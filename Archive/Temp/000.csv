Pericyte loss has been observed in brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and animal models. Our previous data demonstrated that friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli-1), an ETS transcription factor, governs pericyte viability in murine sepsis; however, the role of Fli-1 and its impact on pericyte loss in AD remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that Fli-1 expression was up-regulated in postmortem brains from a cohort of human AD donors and in 5xFAD mice, which corresponded with a decreased pericyte number, elevated inflammatory mediators, and increased Abeta accumulation as compared to cognitively normal individuals and WT mice. Antisense oligonucleotide Fli-1 Gapmer administrated via intrahippocampal injection decelerated pericyte loss, decreased inflammatory response, ameliorated cognitive deficits, improved BBB dysfunction, and reduced Abeta deposition in 5xFAD mice. Fli-1 Gapmer-mediated inhibition of Fli-1 protected against Abeta accumulation-induced human brain pericyte apoptosis in vitro. Overall, these studies indicate that Fli-1 contributes to pericyte loss, inflammatory response, Abeta deposition, vascular dysfunction and cognitive decline, and suggest that inhibition of Fli-1 may represent novel therapeutic strategies for AD.",['Copyright (c) 2022.

METHODS: The expression of hnRNPK was assessed in Ph+ ALL leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo, while imatinib susceptibility was assessed via CCK-8 assay. In cells in which hnRNPK levels had or had not been modulated, LC3/ and mTOR/p-ERK/Beclin1levels were assessed via western blotting, while electron microscopy was used to evaluate autophagic vacuole formation. Interactions between hnRNPK and Beclin1 were assessed through an RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: Imatinib-resistant Ph+ ALL cell lines and patient bone marrow samples exhibited significant hnRNPK overexpression. The knockdown of hnRNPK increased the imatinib sensitivity of these tumor cells and decreased in vivo tumor burden in a xenograft model system as evidenced by a reduction in tumor volume. Levels of LC3/and Beclin1, but not p-ERK and mTOR, were consistent with the regulatory activity of hnRNPK.Electronmicroscopy revealed that imatinib-resistant cells harbored significantly more autophagic vacuoles relative to wild-type cells, while hnRNPK knockdown reduced the number of these vacuoles. In an RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation assay, anti-hnRNPK was able to precipitate the Beclin1 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the hnRNPK/Beclin1 signaling pathway may play a role in shaping imatinib resistance in Ph+ ALL cells.",['Copyright (c) 2022.

Although the relationship between Rituximab and PML is well known, case reports that have been recently published, suggest that ibrutinib; which is used in the treatment of CLL, may increase the risk of PML. CASE REPORT: Here, we report a case of 64 year-old female patient with CLL who was previously treated with rituximab, fludarabine and bendamustin but developed PML after receiving monotherapy with ibrutinib. According to Naranjo's algorithm, the causality relationship with the drug is possible with a score of 3. The patient initially exhibited neurological symptoms. Magnetic resonance of the brain revealed a bilateral asymmetric hyperintensity in the white matter involving the parietal and occipital lobules, and there was no mass effect, edema, hemorrhagic or iscemic lesions. No enhancement of contrast media was observed. The findings were consistent with demyelination and suggestive of PML. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Mirtazapine treatment was initiated. However, neurological sympthoms continuously progressed over the following weeks and the patient, aged 64, died six weeks after diagnosis of PML. DISCUSSION: PML is a rare and often fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is exclusively seen in immunocompromised patients and there is no specific agent to treat PML. The case discussed here, highlights that the use of ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) therapy may result in PML.",,"['Cetintepe, Tugba', 'Gediz, Fusun', 'Akyar, Isin', 'Cetintepe, Lutfi', 'Koc, Ali Murat']","['Cetintepe T', 'Gediz F', 'Akyar I', 'Cetintepe L', 'Koc AM']","['Department of Hematology, 226844Izmir Katip Celebi University, Ataturk Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, 534983Medical Park Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, 162328Acibadem University, Acibadem Labmed C.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the awareness about the importance of high fever in patients with leukemia and lymphoma receiving chemotherapy among healthcare professionals working in non-hospital pharmacies. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study is a survey study. 140 pharmacy employees working in non-hospital pharmacies in Ankara Province were included in the study. Volunteer participants were included in the study. Seven questions were asked to the participants. RESULTS: About 47.1% of the participants stated that they would advise patients to go immediately to the nearest hospital's emergency department when they presented to the pharmacy and said that they had high fever. It was stated by 56.5% of the participating pharmacy employees that high fever did not pose the same risk for a leukemia or lymphoma patient receiving chemotherapy as it did for a leukemia or lymphoma patient not receiving chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: In this study, it was found that awareness about importance of high fever in leukemia and lymphoma patients receiving chemotherapy among healthcare professionals working in pharmacies other than hospital pharmacies was not very high. Providing necessary information to the pharmacy personnels and increasing the awareness about importance of high fever in leukemia and lymphoma patients receiving chemotherapy among the non-hospital pharmacy staff might also contribute to the reduction of negativities associated with infections in such patients.",,"['Mert, Duygu', 'Merdin, Alparslan']","['Mert D', 'Merdin A']","['Universtiy of Health Sciences Ankara Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology Clinic, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Universtiy of Health Sciences Gulhane Education and Research Hospital, Hematology Clinic, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220117,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Non-hospital pharmacy workers', 'awareness', 'fever', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma']",2022/01/18 06:00,2022/01/18 06:00,['2022/01/17 12:12'],"['2022/01/17 12:12 [entrez]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552221074045 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2022 Jan 17:10781552221074045. doi: 10.1177/10781552221074045.,,,10781552221074045,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6810-2199'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mismatched HLA is frequently lost as an individual allele or a whole region in HLA-class I, however, it is downregulated in HLA-class II. We hypothesized that there might be a difference in T cell recognition capacity against epitopes associated with HLA-class I and HLA-class II and consequently such allogeneic immune pressure induced HLA alterations in leukemic cells. To investigate this, we conducted in vitro experiments with T cell receptor-transduced T (TCR-T) cells. The cytotoxic activity of NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T cells exhibited similarly against K562 cells with low HLA-A*02:01 expression. However, we demonstrated that the cytokine production against low HLA-DPB1*05:01 expression line decreased gradually from the HLA expression level approximately 2-log lower than normal expressors. Using sort-purified leukemia cells before and after HSCT, we applied the next-generation sequencing, and revealed that there were several marked downregulations of HLA-class II alleles which demonstrated consistently low expression from pre-transplantation. The marked downregulation of HLA-class II may lead to decreased antigen recognition ability of antigen-specific T cells and may be one of immune evasion mechanism associated with HLA-class II downregulation.",['(c) 2021.

The sequences RPARPAR and GGKRPAR are known to target the neuropilin1 (NRP1) receptor due to the C-terminal Arg domain; however, their effectiveness has never been examined with other commonly over-expressed receptors in tumor cells, particularly of chronic lymphocytic leukemia that include integrin alpha1beta1 and CD22. By conjugating these peptides with GHS, which is known for its inherent anti-cancer properties, the goal is to further enhance tumor cell targeting by developing compounds that can target multiple receptors. The physicochemical properties of the conjugates and individual peptides were analyzed using Turbomole and COSMOthermX20 in order to determine their hydrogen bond accepting and donating capabilities. The web server POCASA was used in order to determine the surface cavities and binding pockets of the three receptors. To explore the binding affinities, we conducted molecular docking studies with the peptides and the conjugates with each of the receptors. After molecular docking, the complexes were analyzed using Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler to determine the types of interactions involved. Molecular dynamics simulation studies were conducted to explore the stability of the receptor-ligand complexes. Our results indicated that in most cases the conjugates showed higher binding and stability with the receptors. Additionally, highly stable complexes of conjugates were obtained with CD22, NRP1 and in most cases with the integrin alpha1beta1 receptor as well. The binding energies were calculated for each of the receptor ligand complexes through trajectory analysis using MMGBSA studies. SwissADME studies revealed that the compounds showed low GI absorption and were not found to be CYP inhibitors and had bioavailability score that would allow them to be considered as potential drug candidates. Overall, our results for the first time show that the designed conjugates can target multiple over-expressed receptors in tumor cells and may be potentially developed as future therapeutics for targeting tumor cells.","['(c) 2021.

Here, we show that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) haploinsufficiency decreases BDNF and increases amyloid-beta (Abeta) precursor in murine brain. Moreover, prior to disease onset, the TERT locus sustains accumulation of repressive epigenetic marks in murine and human AD neurons, implicating TERT repression in amyloid-induced neurodegeneration. To test the impact of sustained TERT expression on AD pathobiology, AD mouse models were engineered to maintain physiological levels of TERT in adult neurons, resulting in reduced Abeta accumulation, improved spine morphology, and preserved cognitive function. Mechanistically, integrated profiling revealed that TERT interacts with beta-catenin and RNA polymerase II at gene promoters and upregulates gene networks governing synaptic signaling and learning processes.

CML could potentially lead to the development of myeloid sarcoma (MS), which is a rare neoplasm composed of immature myeloid cells that could evolve into a tumor mass at any anatomical site other than the bone marrow. MS can develop spontaneously or as a result of another form of myeloid neoplasm. Most instances of CML precede blast phase (BP) within two to three years after the first diagnosis of CML chronic phase (CP) at the age of pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. MS developing in CML patients during the era of TKI treatment is infrequently mentioned in the literature, primarily in single-case studies. As a result, the prognostic influence of MS in CML patients has not been well investigated. In the age of TKI treatment, it is uncertain whether MS and medullary BP have comparable clinical and prognostic relevance. The precise diagnosis of MS is critical for effective treatment, which is frequently delayed due to a high risk of misdiagnosis. This review focuses on the relationship between the development of MS from CML, and it culminates with recommendations for future hematology practice. A literature search was conducted in multiple databases, and the studies were appraised based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, studies to date have shown that the existence of CML and its possible progression to MS in individuals map out the numerous implications this disease has in hematology practice. Though occurrences are uncommon in general, the prognosis for patients is bleak, necessitating the exploration and implementation of diagnostic and therapy advancements. Because there is limited evidence in the literature on its existence in the medullary chronic phase and outcomes in the era of TKI, it must be carefully investigated because it might be the first symptom of progressive illness prior to hematological progression.","['Copyright (c) 2022, Arzoun et al.']","['Arzoun, Hadia', 'Srinivasan, Mirra', 'Thangaraj, Santhosh Raja', 'Thomas, Siji S', 'Mohammed, Lubna']","['Arzoun H', 'Srinivasan M', 'Thangaraj SR', 'Thomas SS', 'Mohammed L']","['Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20220110,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['blastic crisis', 'chronic', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'disease progression', 'hematology', 'myeloid sarcoma']",2022/01/18 06:00,2022/01/18 06:01,['2022/01/17 06:02'],"['2021/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2022/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/17 06:02 [entrez]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.21077 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2022 Jan 10;14(1):e21077. doi: 10.7759/cureus.21077. eCollection 2022 Jan.,14,1,e21077,,,,PMC8752390,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rett syndrome is a severe, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder linked to loss-of-function mutations of the MeCP2 gene for which no cure is yet available. Analysis of the noncoding RNA profile corresponding to the brain-abundant circular RNA (circRNA) and transcribed-ultraconserved region (T-UCR) populations in a mouse model of the disease reveals widespread dysregulation and enrichment in glutamatergic excitatory signaling and microtubule cytoskeleton pathways of the corresponding host genes. Proteomic analysis of hippocampal samples from affected individuals confirms abnormal levels of several cytoskeleton-related proteins together with key alterations in neurotransmission. Importantly, the glutamate receptor GRIA3 gene displays altered biogenesis in affected individuals and in vitro human cells and is influenced by expression of two ultraconserved RNAs. We also describe post-transcriptional regulation of SIRT2 by circRNAs, which modulates acetylation and total protein levels of GluR-1. As a consequence, both regulatory mechanisms converge on the biogenesis of AMPA receptors, with an effect on neuronal differentiation. In both cases, the noncoding RNAs antagonize MeCP2-directed regulation.

In these cases, the loss of information in only retaining annotated exons presents significant drawbacks. Here we present Slinker, a bioinformatics pipeline written in Python and Bpipe that uses a data-driven approach to assemble sample-specific superTranscripts. At its core, Slinker uses Stringtie2 to assemble transcripts with any sequence across any gene. This assembly is merged with reference transcripts, converted to a superTranscript, of which rich visualisations are made through Plotly with associated annotation and coverage information. Slinker was validated on five novel splicing events of rare disease samples from a cohort of primary muscular disorders. In addition, Slinker was shown to be effective in visualising deletion events within transcriptomes of tumour samples in the important leukemia gene, IKZF1. Slinker offers a succinct visualisation of RNA-Seq alignments across typically sparse regions and is freely available on Github.",['Copyright: (c) 2021 Schmidt B et al.'],"['Schmidt, Breon', 'Cmero, Marek', 'Ekert, Paul', 'Davidson, Nadia', 'Oshlack, Alicia']","['Schmidt B', 'Cmero M', 'Ekert P', 'Davidson N', 'Oshlack A']","['Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.', 'School of BioScience, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Centre, Kensington, New South Wales, 2033, Australia."", ""School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Victoria, 2052, Australia."", 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.', 'School of BioScience, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.', 'School of BioScience, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211207,England,F1000Res,F1000Research,101594320,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Novel Splicing Events', 'RNA-Seq', 'Visualisation', 'bioinformatics', 'superTranscripts']",2022/01/18 06:00,2022/01/18 06:00,['2022/01/17 05:58'],"['2021/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/17 05:58 [entrez]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.12688/f1000research.74836.1 [doi]'],epublish,F1000Res. 2021 Dec 7;10:1255. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.74836.1. eCollection 2021.,10,,1255,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0341-3647', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9788-5690']",,PMC8749905,,['No competing interests were disclosed.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis of patients with pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains poor, highlighting the need for improved targeted therapy. The expression data of lncRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNAs and survival information of pediatric AML patients were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Cox regression analysis was used to screen the lncRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNAs that significantly affect the overall survival (OS) of patients as OS-related genes (included lncRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNAs). Enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction were performed for the OS-related mRNAs. We further established a ceRNAs regulatory network. In addition, the potential prognostic role of genes was further evaluated by risk score. We have identified 5275 lncRNAs, 176 miRNAs, and 6221 mRNAs that significantly affect the prognosis of pediatric AML patients. It is worth noting that OS-related mRNAs are mainly involved in ribosome, RNA transport, and spliceosome. We identified the top 10 most connected mRNAs in the PPI network as important mRNAs and constructed a ceRNAs regulatory network (including NCBP2, RPLP0, UBC, RPS2, and RPS9). The risk score and nomogram results suggest that NCBP2 may be a risk factor for pediatric AML, while RPLP0, UBC, RPS2, and RPS9 may be protective factors. Our results construct 5 gene signals as new prognostic indicators for predicting the survival of pediatric AML patients. Our research has demonstrated the ceRNAs regulatory network may become a new target for pediatric AML treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2022 Hao Zhang et al.'],"['Zhang, Hao', 'Cheng, Liqin', 'Liu, Cong']","['Zhang H', 'Cheng L', 'Liu C']","['Beijing Shijitan Hospital Affiliated to Capital University of Medical Sciences, Neonatology, No. 10 Tieyi Road, Yanggang Store, Haidian District, Beijing 100038, China.', 'Beijing Space Center Hospital Paediatrics, 15 Yuquan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100049, China.', 'Beijing New Century Women and Children Hospital Paediatrics, 15 Wangjing North Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100102, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220105,England,J Healthc Eng,Journal of healthcare engineering,101528166,IM,,,2022/01/18 06:00,2022/01/18 06:00,['2022/01/17 05:58'],"['2021/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/17 05:58 [entrez]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2022/2691997 [doi]'],epublish,J Healthc Eng. 2022 Jan 5;2022:2691997. doi: 10.1155/2022/2691997. eCollection 2022.,2022,,2691997,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7948-8568', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7427-9783', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9204-4243']",,PMC8754609,,"['The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the', 'research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to integratively understand the prognostic value of specific copy number variation (CNV) patterns and CNV-modulated gene expression in AML. METHODS: We conducted integrative CNV profiling and gene expression analysis using data from the Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML cohorts. CNV-related genes associated with survival were identified using the TARGET AML cohort and validated using the TCGA AML cohort. Genes whose CNV-modulated expression was associated with survival were also identified using the TARGET AML cohort and validated using the TCGA AML cohort, and patient bone marrow samples were then used to further validate the effects of CNV-modulated gene expression on survival. CNV and mRNA survival analyses were conducted using proportional hazards regression models (Cox regression) and the ""survminer"" and ""survival"" packages of the R Project for Statistical Computing. Genes belonging to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) cancer panel were extracted from KEGG cancer-related pathways. RESULTS: One hundred two CNV-related genes (located at 7q31-34, 16q24) associated with patient survival were identified using the TARGET cohort and validated with the TCGA AML cohort. Among these 102 validated genes, three miRNA genes (MIR29A, MIR183, and MIR335) were included in the KEGG cancer panel. Five genes (SEMA4D, CBFB, CHAF1B, SAE1, and DNMT1) whose expression was modulated by CNVs and significantly associated with clinical outcomes were identified, and the deletion of SEMA4D and CBFB was found to potentially exert protective effects against AML. The results of these five genes were also validated using patient marrow samples. Additionally, the distribution of CNVs affecting these five CNV-modulated genes was independent of the risk group (favorable-, intermediate-, and adverse-risk groups). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study identified 102 CNV-related genes associated with patient survival and identified five genes whose expression was modulated by CNVs and associated with patient survival.

However, the role of TBK1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression levels and the function of TBK1 in AML. METHODS: First, TBK1 expression was detected and analyzed using Western blot and qRT-PCR. Then, GSK8612, a novel TBK1 inhibitor, and TBK1-specific siRNA (si-TBK1) were used to inhibit TBK1 function and expression. The effects of TBK1 inhibition on AML were investigated first through a cell counting kit (CCK-8) assay, followed by trypan blue staining to assess cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression in vitro. Finally, the signaling pathway activities in HL-60 and Kasumi-1 cells and patients' mononuclear cells (MNCs) were explored using western blot. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher TBK1 expression in AML patients with poor prognoses. GSK8612 successfully inhibited TBK1 expression, resulting in the increased sensitivity of AML cells to daunorubicin. Mechanistically, TBK1 inhibition (by GSK8612 and si-TBK1) regulated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) levels in AML cells via the AKT pathway. Moreover, it was observed that the inhibition of protein kinase B (AKT) activity also resulted in the increased sensitivity of AML cell lines to daunorubicin, validating the relationship between TBK1 and the AKT-CDK2 pathway. Similar results were obtained in MNCs from patients with AML. CONCLUSION: TBK1 is a potential prognostic factor for AML, and its inhibition may improve the sensitivity of AML cells to daunorubicin. This regulatory effect is predicted to involve the TBK1-AKT-CDK2 pathway.",['AJTR Copyright (c) 2021.'],"['Chen, Siyu', 'Ni, Ming', 'Hu, Tianzhen', 'Gu, Yangguang', 'Feng, Cheng', 'Pan, Chengyun', 'Zhang, Siyu', 'Wen, Shuangshuang', 'Zhao, Naiqin', 'Wang, Weili', 'Dai, Lihong', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Chen S', 'Ni M', 'Hu T', 'Gu Y', 'Feng C', 'Pan C', 'Zhang S', 'Wen S', 'Zhao N', 'Wang W', 'Dai L', 'Wang J']","['Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre Guiyang 550005, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre Guiyang 550005, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre Guiyang 550005, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre Guiyang 550005, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre Guiyang 550005, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre Guiyang 550005, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre Guiyang 550005, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre Guiyang 550005, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre Guiyang 550005, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre Guiyang 550005, Guizhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211215,United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CDK2', 'GSK8612', 'TBK1', 'apoptosis', 'daunorubicin', 'resistance']",2022/01/18 06:00,2022/01/18 06:01,['2022/01/17 05:57'],"['2021/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/17 05:57 [entrez]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2021 Dec 15;13(12):13640-13653. eCollection 2021.,13,12,13640-13653,,,,PMC8748083,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study determined current real-world use of CPX-351 versus conventional 7+3 (cytarabine+daunorubicin) therapy and evaluated hospital length of stay (LOS) and supportive care utilization in t-AML and AML-MRC. Patients and Methods: This retrospective, observational study utilized the Premier Healthcare Database and included patients who were aged >/=18 years with t-AML or AML-MRC and treated with CPX-351 or 7+3 between August 1, 2017 and February 28, 2019. All patients treated with 7+3 were required to be eligible for CPX-351 based on its FDA-approved indication. Outcome variables were annualized and adjusted for patient, hospital, and clinical confounding factors. The primary outcome was inpatient LOS. Secondary outcomes included use of blood products and use of anti-infectives. Results: The study included 195 qualifying patients treated with CPX-351 and 160 patients treated with 7+3 who were eligible for CPX-351. Approximately one-third of the patients treated with CPX-351 were administered therapy in a hospital-based outpatient setting, and all patients treated with 7+3 received it in the inpatient setting. The regression-adjusted annualized inpatient LOS was shorter with CPX-351 than 7+3 (mean of 183.7 vs 197.1 days, p<0.001). The difference in mean-adjusted LOS was most pronounced for t-AML, with a mean-adjusted LOS of 168.9 versus 192.5 days for CPX-351 versus 7+3, respectively (nominal p<0.001). Supportive care utilization, including the number of administrations of red blood cells, the number of administrations of platelets, and the number of days on anti-infectives, was similar between treatment groups. Conclusion: CPX-351 was associated with a shorter inpatient LOS than 7+3. Supportive care use, including blood products and anti-infectives, was similar for CPX-351 and 7+3. These findings suggest CPX-351 conveys resource advantages over 7+3 in patients with newly diagnosed t-AML and AML-MRC.",['(c) 2022 Price et al.'],"['Price, Kwanza', 'Cao, Zhun', 'Lipkin, Craig', 'Profant, Deb', 'Robinson, Scott']","['Price K', 'Cao Z', 'Lipkin C', 'Profant D', 'Robinson S']","['Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Premier Inc., Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'Premier Inc., Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Premier Inc., Charlotte, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220108,New Zealand,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,101560564,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'anthracycline', 'chemotherapy', 'cytarabine', 'daunorubicin', 'healthcare resource utilization']",2022/01/18 06:00,2022/01/18 06:01,['2022/01/17 05:50'],"['2021/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/17 05:50 [entrez]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CEOR.S342303 [doi]', '342303 [pii]']",epublish,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res. 2022 Jan 8;14:21-34. doi: 10.2147/CEOR.S342303. eCollection 2022.,14,,21-34,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4323-9348', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6661-5284']",,PMC8754465,,"['Kwanza Price was an employee of Jazz Pharmaceuticals at the time of the study.', 'Zhun Cao and Craig Lipkin are employees of Premier Applied Sciences, Premier', 'Inc., which received payment from Jazz Pharmaceuticals to conduct the study.

We found that rs1127354 is associated with neutropenia in general populations and in children (OR: 2.39, 95%CI: 1.97-2.90, and OR: 2.43, 95%CI: 2.12-2.79, respectively), and with all adverse effects tested herein in adult populations (OR: 2.12, 95%CI: 1.22-3.69). We also found that rs7270101 is associated with neutropenia and leucopenia in all-ages populations (OR: 2.93, 95%CI: 2.36-3.63, and OR: 2.82, 95%CI: 1.76-4.50, respectively) and with all adverse effects tested herein in children (OR: 1.74, 95%CI: 1.06-2.87). Stratification according to background disease, in combination with multiple comparisons corrections, verified neutropenia to be associated with both polymorphisms, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. These findings suggest that ITPA polymorphisms could be used as predictive biomarkers for adverse effects of thiopurine drugs to eliminate intolerance in ALL patients and clarify dosing in patients with different ITPA variants.","['(c) 2021.

The EZH2-Y641 gain-of-function mutation is one of the most significant in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Although EZH2 kinase inhibitors, such as EPZ-6438, provide clinical benefit, certain cancer cells are resistant to the enzymatic inhibition of EZH2 because of the inability to functionally target mutant EZH2, or because of cells' dependence on the non-histone methyltransferase activity of EZH2. Consequently, destroying mutant EZH2 protein may be more effective in targeting EZH2 mutant cancers that are dependent on the non-catalytic activity of EZH2. Here, using extensive selectivity profiling, combined with genetic and animal model studies, we identified USP47 as a novel regulator of mutant EZH2. Inhibition of USP47 would be anticipated to block the function of mutated EZH2 through induction of EZH2 degradation by promoting its ubiquitination. Moreover, targeting of USP47 leads to death of mutant EZH2-positive cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, we propose targeting USP47 with a small molecule inhibitor as a novel potential therapy for DLBCL and other hematologic malignancies characterized by mutant EZH2 expression.","['(c) 2021.

A reliance on individual risk assessment introduces the potential for between-practice inconsistencies in non-core vaccine recommendations. A study was initiated to determine non-core vaccination rates of dogs (Leptospira, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine influenza virus) and cats (feline leukemia virus) in patients current for core vaccines in veterinary practices across the United States. Transactional data for 5,531,866 dogs (1,670 practices) and 1,914,373 cats (1,661 practices) were retrieved from practice management systems for the period November 1, 2016 through January 1, 2020, deidentified and normalized. Non-core vaccination status was evaluated in 2,798,875 dogs and 788,772 cats that were core-vaccine current. Nationally, median clinic vaccination rates for dogs were highest for leptospirosis (70.5%) and B. bronchiseptica (68.7%), and much lower for canine influenza (4.8%). In Lyme-endemic states, the median clinic borreliosis vaccination rate was 51.8%. Feline leukemia median clinic vaccination rates were low for adult cats (34.6%) and for kittens and 1-year old cats (36.8%). Individual clinic vaccination rates ranged from 0 to 100% for leptospirosis, B. bronchiseptica and feline leukemia, 0-96% for canine influenza, and 0-94% for borreliosis. Wide variation in non-core vaccination rates between clinics in similar geographies indicates that factors other than disease risk are driving the use of non-core vaccines in pet dogs and cats, highlighting a need for veterinary practices to address gaps in patient protection. Failure to implement effective non-core vaccination strategies leaves susceptible dogs and cats unprotected against vaccine-preventable diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Mogamulizumab, an anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR 4), has been shown to be effective in the treatment of ATL; however, some ATL cases are often resistant, particularly the lymphoma-type ATL. To evaluate drug delivery in vivo and identify the distribution of CCR4-positive cells in the body, we developed a novel mogamulizumab tracer labeled with Indium-111 ((111)In) via diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) for single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), named [(111)In]In-DTPA-mogamulizumab, and evaluated its potential for visualizing CCR4 expression in vivo. METHODS: [(111)In]In-DTPA-mogamulizumab was added to HCT116/CCR4 or HCT116/empty vector (EV) cells, and their radioactivity was measured 1 h after administration. A blocking study was additionally performed by treating HCT116/CCR4 cells with excess mogamulizumab in addition to [(111)In]In-DTPA-mogamulizumab. The biodistribution and SPECT imaging of [(111)In]In-DTPA-mogamulizumab in HCT116/CCR4 and HCT116/EV dual-xenografted BALB/c-nu mice were evaluated for 72 h after intravenous injection. RESULTS: [(111)In]In-DTPA-mogamulizumab was acquired with a radiochemical purity > 95%. The cellular uptake level of [(111)In]In-DTPA-mogamulizumab by HCT116/CCR4 cells was significantly higher than that by HCT116/EV cells (HCT116/CCR4: 0.951 +/- 0.069, HCT116/EV: 0.006 +/- 0.001%dose/mg protein, p < 0.01), and the uptake was significantly suppressed by co-incubation with excess mogamulizumab (0.013 +/- 0.003%dose/mg protein, p < 0.01). In the in vivo study, the radioactivity of the HCT116/CCR4 tumor tissue was significantly higher than that of the HCT116/EV tumor tissue at 72 h after the administration of [(111)In]In-DTPA-mogamulizumab (HCT116/CCR4: 20.5 +/- 5.4, HCT116/EV: 5.7 +/- 1.0%ID/g), and HCT116/CCR4 tumors were clearly and specifically visualized on SPECT imaging. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully developed a novel SPECT imaging tracer targeting CCR4, [(111)In]In-DTPA-mogamulizumab, which showed good specificity and pharmacokinetics, indicating potential in visualizing CCR4 expression in vivo.","['(c) 2021.

Increasing studies suggest that cancer development is accompanied by the deregulation of circular RNAs. We investigated the function of circ_0003159 in GC. The expression levels of circ_0003159, miR-221-3p/miR-222-3p and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) mRNA were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell colony formation ability was assessed by colony formation assay, and cell viability was assessed by cell counting kit-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry assay and caspase3 activity. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by transwell assay. Glycolysis energy metabolism was assessed by 5'-triphosphate production, glucose uptake and lactate production. The protein levels of related marker proteins and LIFR were detected by western blot. The relationship between circ_0003159 and miR-221-3p/miR-222-3p, or LIFR and miR-221-3p/miR-222-3p was obtained from bioinformatics tools and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. A cancer tumorogenicity xenograft experiment in nude mice was conducted to determine the role of circ_0003159 in tumor growth by AGS cells. Our results showed that circ_0003159 expression was decreased in GC tissues and cells. Circ_0003159 overexpression sequestered GC cell viability, migration, invasion and glycolysis and induced cell apoptosis. MiR-221-3p and miR-222-3p were targets of circ_0003159, and the inhibition of miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p also blocked GC cell viability, migration, invasion and glycolysis and promoted cell apoptosis. LIFR was a common target of miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p. Interestingly, LIFR knockdown reversed the effects of circ_0003159 overexpression on GC cell behaviors. Circ_0003159 increased the expression level of LIFR by targeting miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p. The tumorigenicity assay showed that circ_0003159 overexpression inhibited tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, circ_0003159 inhibited GC development in vitro and in vivo by enriching the level of LIFR via direct binding to miR-221-3p/miR-222-3p.","['(c) 2021.

I-BFM ELTEC study with Chilean and Croatian participation.,10.1007/s00520-021-06741-5 [doi],"PURPOSE: Late effects in childhood cancer survivors are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The objective was to establish knowledge about the disease, late effects, self-care practices, application of health knowledge/education, sources of information, and biopsychosocial impact of cancer, and compare the results of Chile and Croatia. METHODS: One-hundred-and-seventy-one, 5-year survivors who were treated for leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma responded to a questionnaire (119 in Chile and 52 in Croatia). The questionnaire was reviewed by BFM-ELTEC. RESULTS: Health knowledge about past diagnosis and general treatment had 96% Chilean and 85% Croatian survivors. Ninety percent of Chilean and 73% of Croatian survivors were unaware of possible late effects, and half did not know which specialist to visit for follow-up. Forty-six percent of Chilean and 35% of Croatian survivors knew about healthy lifestyles, but most did not practice them. The 74% of Chileans and 87% of Croatian survivors recalled having received health education during treatment. About 50% of survivors in both groups were afraid or anguish, but it was also a growth experience for 60% of Chilean and 42% of Croatian survivors. Eighty-seven percent Chilean and 77% Croatian survivors considered themselves physically independent, while 76% and 75% felt psychologically independent, respectively. CONCLUSION: A significant lack of knowledge about the specific treatment, late effects, and future health in both countries was detected. They did not achieve significant learning with the education received. Psychological sequelae were found that are important to prevent.","['(c) 2021.

In addition, recent studies investigated the role of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrKA) enzyme fusions in promoting AML growth and survival. Based on these premises, targeting both kinases using dual inhibitors would constitute a promising therapeutic approach to target resistant AML. Guided by ligand-based design and structure simplification of the FLT3 inhibitor, quizartinib, we developed a benzimidazole-based small molecule, 4ACP, that exhibited nanomolar activity against wild-type FLT3, FLT3-Internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD), and FLT3-D835Y (FLT3-TKD) mutation (IC50 = 43.8, 97.2, and 92.5 nM respectively). Additionally, 4ACP demonstrated potent activity against colon cancer KM12 cell line (IC50 = 358 nM) and subsequent mechanistic deconvolution identified TrKA enzyme as a second plausible target (IC50 = 23.6 nM) for our compound. 4ACP manifested preferential antiproliferative activity against FLT3-ITD positive AML cell lines (MV4-11 IC50 = 38.8 +/- 10.7 nM and MOLM-13 IC50 = 54.9 +/- 4.1 nM), while lacking activity against FLT3-ITD negative AML cell lines. Western blot analysis confirmed 4ACP ability to downregulate ERK1/2 and mTOR signaling downstream of FLT3-ITD in AML cells. Furthermore, 4ACP prompted apoptotic and necrotic cell death and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest as indicated by cell cycle analysis. 4ACP did not show cytotoxic effects on normal BNL and H9c2 cells and demonstrated decreased activity against c-Kit enzyme, hence, indicating lower probability of synthetic lethal toxicity and a relatively safer profile. In light of these data, 4ACP represents a novel FLT3/TrKA dual kinase inhibitor for targeted therapy of AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In current study, the cytotoxicity and possible mechanism of 11-MT on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was explored using network pharmacology and molecular biology techniques. 11-MT significantly inhibited the cell proliferations on different four human T-ALL cells (MOLT-4, Jurkat, CCRF-CEM, and CEM/C1 cells). 11-MT triggered ROS accumulation, calcium concentration and cell apoptosis, and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in human T-ALL cells, especially MOLT-4 cells. Western blot analysis showed that it can induce MOLT-4 cell apoptosis by up-regulating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, 11-MT induces human T-ALL cells apoptosis via up-regulation of ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and down-regulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2022.

Although driver mutations have been identified in these MPNs, subtype-specific markers of the disease have yet to be discovered. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology can potentially improve the clinical management of MPNs by allowing for the simultaneous screening of many disease-associated genes. METHODS: The performance of a custom, in-house designed 22-gene NGS panel was technically validated using reference standards across two independent replicate runs. The panel was subsequently used to screen a total of 10 clinical MPN samples (ET n = 3, PV n = 3, PMF n = 4). The resulting NGS data was then analysed via a bioinformatics pipeline. RESULTS: The custom NGS panel had a detection limit of 1% variant allele frequency (VAF). A total of 20 unique variants with VAFs above 5% (4 of which were putatively novel variants with potential biological significance) and one pathogenic variant with a VAF of between 1 and 5% were identified across all of the clinical MPN samples. All single nucleotide variants with VAFs >/= 15% were confirmed via Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: The high fidelity of the NGS analysis and the identification of known and novel variants in this study cohort support its potential clinical utility in the management of MPNs. However, further optimisation is needed to avoid false negatives in regions with low sequencing coverage, especially for the detection of driver mutations in MPL.",['(c) 2022.

Such a presentation can be easily misdiagnosed and managed as a seroma at significant risk to the patient, as the latter had no precipitating factors and cardiorespiratory compromise. There are nineteen previously described cases of delayed tracheal injury post thyroidectomy of variable severity and variable intervention. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old man presented with non-tender anterior neck surgical emphysema initially diagnosed on bedside ultrasound and plain X-ray, 22 days following total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection. His background was significant for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia requiring chemotherapy and cranio-spinal radiotherapy. He underwent total thyroidectomy, for multiple bilateral thyroid nodules found on cranio-spinal MRI surveillance concerning for follicular neoplasm. There were significant amount of adhesions tethering the thyroid secondary to prior radiotherapy but no tracheal injury intra-operatively. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: At presentation, no source of air leak was identified on Computer Tomography. He failed conservative management. During surgical exploration, a 2 mm tracheal perforation at the right cricothyroid joint was closed with the right sternothyroid muscle due to the proximity of the perforation with the recurrent right laryngeal nerve. Tisseel was applied over the repair. He recovered without further complications. CONCLUSION: Sudden onset neck swelling post thyroidectomy in the context of significant scaring from radiotherapy, should raise the suspicion of surgical emphysema in the neck patients and confirmed with plain x-ray. Such patients should have multidisciplinary tertiary care.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2022. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Typically, treatment of AAP follows a nil per os approach with or without parenteral nutrition (PN). However, with accounts of increased risk of adverse events, such as bacterial translocation and multiorgan failure when PN is used in lieu of enteral nutrition (EN), the recent literature has advocated for a change in practice to the early use of EN for children and adults with acute pancreatitis. Despite these recommendations, a gap remains in the literature regarding whether or not early enteral feedings are currently being used in pediatric oncology patients with acute pancreatitis. In our case series, we account for the successful use of EN to manage AAP in three pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma. Additionally, we describe the development of an early enteral feeding protocol for pediatric oncology patients with pancreatitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case series chronicling the nutritional management of AAP using EN in the pediatric oncology population.

Recent studies revealed that the well-established WNT agonist R-spondin 2 (RSPO2) is also a BMP receptor (BMPR1A) antagonist, with roles in early Xenopus embryogenesis and human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To uncouple the BMP antagonist function from the WNT agonist function and to promote development of AML therapeutics, here we identified a 10-mer peptide (RW) derived from the Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1)-domain of RSPO2, which specifically prevents binding between RSPO2 and BMPR1A without altering WNT signaling. We also show a corresponding RW-dendrimer (RW(d)) exhibiting improved half-life relieves inhibition of BMP receptor signaling by RSPO2 in human AML cells, reducing cell growth and inducing differentiation. Moreover, microinjection of RW(d) in Xenopus embryos ventralizes the dorsoventral embryonic patterning by upregulating BMP signaling without affecting WNT signaling. Our study corroborates the function of RSPO2 as a BMP receptor antagonist and provides a proof-of-concept for pharmacologically uncoupling BMP antagonist from WNT agonist functions of RSPO2 using the inhibitor peptide RW(d) with enhanced target selectivity and limited side effects.",['Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

We aimed to determine whether melflufen plus dexamethasone would provide a progression-free survival benefit compared with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, head-to-head, phase 3 study (OCEAN), adult patients (aged >/=18 years) were recruited from 108 university hospitals, specialist hospitals, and community-based centres in 21 countries across Europe, North America, and Asia. Eligible patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-2; must have had relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, refractory to lenalidomide (within 18 months of randomisation) and to the last line of therapy; and have received two to four previous lines of therapy (including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by age, number of previous lines of therapy, and International Staging System score, to either 28-day cycles of melflufen and dexamethasone (melflufen group) or pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pomalidomide group). All patients received dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle. In the melflufen group, patients received melflufen 40 mg intravenously over 30 min on day 1 of each cycle and in the pomalidomide group, patients received pomalidomide 4 mg orally daily on days 1 to 21 of each cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by an independent review committee in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03151811, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between June 12, 2017, and Sept 3, 2020, 246 patients were randomly assigned to the melflufen group (median age 68 years [IQR 60-72]; 107 [43%] were female) and 249 to the pomalidomide group (median age 68 years [IQR 61-72]; 109 [44%] were female). 474 patients received at least one dose of study drug (melflufen group n=228; pomalidomide group n=246; safety population). Data cutoff was Feb 3, 2021. Median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI 5.0-8.5; 165 [67%] of 246 patients had an event) in the melflufen group and 4.9 months (4.2-5.7; 190 [76%] of 249 patients had an event) in the pomalidomide group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, [95% CI 0.64-0.98]; p=0.032), at a median follow-up of 15.5 months (IQR 9.4-22.8) in the melflufen group and 16.3 months (10.1-23.2) in the pomalidomide group. Median overall survival was 19.8 months (95% CI 15.1-25.6) at a median follow-up of 19.8 months (IQR 12.0-25.0) in the melflufen group and 25.0 months (95% CI 18.1-31.9) in the pomalidomide group at a median follow-up of 18.6 months (IQR 11.8-23.7; HR 1.10 [95% CI 0.85-1.44]; p=0.47). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were thrombocytopenia (143 [63%] of 228 in the melflufen group vs 26 [11%] of 246 in the pomalidomide group), neutropenia (123 [54%] vs 102 [41%]), and anaemia (97 [43%] vs 44 [18%]). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 95 (42%) patients in the melflufen group and 113 (46%) in the pomalidomide group, the most common of which were pneumonia (13 [6%] vs 21 [9%]), COVID-19 pneumonia (11 [5%] vs nine [4%]), and thrombocytopenia (nine [4%] vs three [1%]). 27 [12%] patients in the melflufen group and 32 [13%] in the pomalidomide group had fatal treatment-emergent adverse events. Fatal treatment-emergent adverse events were considered possibly treatment related in two patients in the melflufen group (one with acute myeloid leukaemia, one with pancytopenia and acute cardiac failure) and four patients in the pomalidomide group (two patients with pneumonia, one with myelodysplastic syndromes, one with COVID-19 pneumonia). INTERPRETATION: Melflufen plus dexamethasone showed superior progression-free survival than pomalidomide plus dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Most families reported in the literature show an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern consistent with a single-gene mutation. METHODS: Here we studied a Syrian family with four individuals suffering from AML for CEBPA gene mutations by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The father, his three affected, and one yet unaffected child had the same mutation in the N-terminal region of CEBPA (c.198dupC), resulting in termination at Tyr67Leufs*41. All affected family members had a good primary response to chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. CONCLUSION: Overall, another AML family with CEBPA gene mutation is added to the literature, presenting with yet unreported FAB subtype M5 and absence of CD7 expression in some family members.","['(c) 2022 The Authors.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a promising option for patients with aggressive ATLL, but the posttransplant outcome remains unsatisfactory. Hence, to further improve clinical outcomes, novel therapeutic approaches are needed. The clinical significance of immune checkpoint protein expression has not been well-established in aggressive ATLL. This study aims to identify the association between the expression profile of immune checkpoint proteins on ATLL cells and clinical outcomes. This retrospective study cohort included 65 patients with aggressive ATLL diagnosed between 2001 and 2015 at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was used to immunohistochemically determine the expression of immune checkpoint proteins and assess the impact of expression profile on the probability of overall survival from diagnosis or HSCT. The current analysis shows that cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed death-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressions were adverse prognostic factors in patients with aggressive ATLL. Experiments that assess the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors are warranted to alleviate the adverse impacts associated with negative immune checkpoints.","['(c) 2022.

However, dysfunction of T cells, including exhaustion, is an inevitable obstacle for persistent curative effects. Here, the authors initially found that calcium signaling is hyperactivated via sustained tonic signaling in CAR-T cells. Next, it is revealed that the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) inhibitor BTP-2, but not the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, markedly diminishes CAR-T cell exhaustion and terminal differentiation of CAR-T cells in both tonic signaling and tumor antigen exposure models. Furthermore, BTP-2 pretreated CAR-T cells show improved antitumor potency and prolonged survival in vivo. Mechanistically, transcriptome and metabolite analyses reveal that treatment with BTP-2 significantly downregulate SOCE-calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and glycolysis pathways. Together, the results indicate that modulating the SOCE-calcineurin-NFAT pathway in CAR-T cells renders them resistant to exhaustion, thereby yielding CAR products with enhanced antitumor potency.",['(c) 2022 The Authors.

Chemoimmunotherapy still has a role in the standard frontline therapy for specific population. However, the clinical activity of bendamustine has not been investigated in unfit Chinese patients with CLL. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of bendamustine versus chlorambucil for untreated Chinese patients with Binet stage B/C CLL. METHODS: In this multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled, phase III trial, patients with previously untreated CLL were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive bendamustine or chlorambucil. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, the duration of response, and overall survival. Adverse events were recorded to evaluate safety. RESULTS: Of 158 screened patients, 147 were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive bendamustine (n = 72) or chlorambucil (n = 75). After a median follow-up of 25.6 months (IQR 12.5-27.7), 69.0% (95% CI, 56.9-79.5) of bendamustine-treated patients achieved objective response and 37.0% (95% CI, 26.0-49.1) of chlorambucil with a difference of 32.0% (95%CI: 16.6-47.5), demonstrating the superiority of bendamustine to chlorambucil (p < 0.001). The median progression-free survival was longer for bendamustine (16.5 months; 95% CI, 11.3-24.7) versus chlorambucil (9.6 months; 95% CI, 8.7-11.8; p < 0.001). A longer median duration of response was seen in those receiving bendamustine (19.2 months; 95% CI, 11.8-29.1) than chlorambucil (10.7 months; 95% CI, 5.6-13.6; p = 0.0018). Median overall survival was not reached in either group. Overall survival at 18 months was 88% for bendamustine versus 85% for chlorambucil. Most common adverse events in both groups were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: In untreated Chinese patients with Binet stage B/C CLL, bendamustine induced the better objective response and resulted in longer progression-free survival than chlorambucil. Overall, these results validate the role of bendamustine as an effective and safe first-line therapy in this population.","['(c) 2021.

A study by the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT.",10.1038/s41409-021-01550-0 [doi],"Optimal conditioning for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT) and post-transplant cyclophosphamide has not been established so far. We retrospectively compared outcomes for two myeloablative regimens: fludarabine + total body irradiation (Flu-TBI, n = 117) and thiotepa + iv. busulfan + fludarabine (TBF, n = 119). Patients transplanted either in complete remission (CR) or with active disease were included in the analysis. The characteristics of both groups were comparable except for patients treated with TBF were older. In univariate analysis the incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 2 years was increased for TBF compared to Flu-TBI (31% vs. 19.5%, p = 0.03). There was a tendency towards reduced incidence of relapse after TBF (p = 0.11). Results of multivariate analysis confirmed a reduced risk of NRM using Flu-TBI (HR = 0.49, p = 0.03). In the analysis restricted to patients treated in CR1 or CR2, the use of Flu-TBI was associated with a decreased risk of NRM (HR = 0.34, p = 0.009) but an increased risk of relapse (HR = 2.59, p = 0.01) without significant effect on survival and graft-versus-host disease. We conclude that for haplo-HCT recipients with ALL, Flu-TBI may be preferable for individuals at high risk of NRM while TBF should be considered in cases at high risk of relapse.","['(c) 2021.

However, given the redundancy of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins (BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1), single targeting may not be sufficient. When analyzing the effects of BH3-mimetics selectively targeting BCL-XL and MCL-1 alone or in combination with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, heterogeneous sensitivity to either of these inhibitors was found in ALL cell lines and in patient-derived xenografts. Interestingly, some venetoclax-resistant leukemias were sensitive to the MCL-1-selective antagonist S63845 and/or BCL-XL-selective A-1331852 suggesting functional mutual substitution. Consequently, co-inhibition of BCL-2 and MCL-1 or BCL-XL resulted in synergistic apoptosis induction. Functional analysis by BH3-profiling and analysis of protein complexes revealed that venetoclax-treated ALL cells are dependent on MCL-1 and BCL-XL, indicating that MCL-1 or BCL-XL provide an Achilles heel in BCL-2-inhibited cells. The effect of combining BCL-2 and MCL-1 inhibition by venetoclax and S63845 was evaluated in vivo and strongly enhanced anti-leukemia activity was found in a pre-clinical patient-derived xenograft model. Our study offers in-depth molecular analysis of mutual substitution of BCL-2 family proteins in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and provides targets for combination treatment in vivo and in ongoing clinical studies.",['(c) 2022.

When establishing a pediatric hematology-oncology (PHO) program in low-resource settings, early integration of palliative care services becomes essential. While palliative care is a human right, equitable distribution is lacking. OBJECTIVES: We aim to describe our experience establishing a palliative care program, the services offered, and the distribution of patients served. METHODS: This is a brief description of our PHO palliative care program in Lilongwe, Malawi at a tertiary care center and a three-year retrospective review of activities (2017-2020). Services offered include inpatient, outpatient, home visits, end of life care, and strengthening of referral systems. RESULTS: Over the 3-year period, 315 patients were enrolled. Fifty-seven percent (n=179) were male. The median age was 7 years (5 months - 22 years). Patients served were from 17 of 28 districts within Malawi. Diagnoses of patients included 43% solid tumors (n=135), 22% lymphoma (n=68), 15% leukemia (n=47) and 21% hematologic disease (n=65). Forty percent of patients have died (n=125), with 53% of deaths occurring at home (n=66), 22% in the hospital (n=28), and 25% at unknown locations (n=31). CONCLUSION: Palliative care is a critical component of PHO programs worldwide. Programs must leverage existing networks to ensure optimal care to children and families. We demonstrate the feasibility of integrating palliative care services within a PHO program in a low-resource setting, which could serve as a model for other countries in SSA.",['Copyright (c) 2022.

LC steroidogenesis maintains sexual function, fertility and general health, and is influenced by various paracrine factors. The leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) is expressed in the testis and activated by different ligands, including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), produced by peritubular myoid cells. LIF can modulate LC testosterone production in vitro under certain circumstances, but the role of consolidated signalling through LIFR in adult LC function in vivo has not been established. We used a conditional Lifr allele in combination with adenoviral vectors expressing Cre-recombinase to generate an acute model of LC Lifr-KO in the adult mouse testis, and showed that LC Lifr is not required for short term LC survival or basal steroidogenesis. However, LIFR-signalling negatively regulates steroidogenic enzyme expression and maximal gonadotrophin-stimulated testosterone biosynthesis, expanding our understanding of the intricate regulation of LC steroidogenic function.",['Copyright (c) 2022.

METHODS: HTA evaluations in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) were included from Australia, Canada, England, Norway, and the United States. Key clinical evidence, economic approach, and outcomes (costs, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) were summarized. RESULTS: Fourteen HTA evaluations were identified (5 ALL, 9 DLBCL [4 tisagenlecleucel, 5 axicabtagene]). Analyses were naive comparisons of prospective single-arm studies for the CAR-Ts with retrospective cohort studies for the comparators. Key clinical evidence and economic model approaches were generally consistent by CAR-T and indication, although outcomes varied. Notably, incremental QALYs varied substantially in ALL (3.67-10.6 QALYs gained), whereas variation in DLBCL was less (1.21-1.97 [tisagenlecleucel], 1.97-3.40 [axicabtagene]). Discounting of costs and outcomes varied, with the highest QALYs generated for tisagenlecleucel in ALL (10.95) associated with the lowest discount rate (1.5%) and vice versa (4.97 QALYs; 5% discount rate). The approach to extrapolation of overall survival data varied, even where the same empirical data were used. CONCLUSION: Modeled, long-term treatment benefit in young patients may be associated with greater uncertainty compared with adults because of potential life-long benefits with cell and gene therapies. This reflects the methodological challenges identified by HTA agencies associated with single-arm, short-term studies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes', 'Research, Inc.

P53 is a main tumor suppressor but mutations in this protein per se do not confer a proliferative advantage to the cells and a selection process is needed for the expansion of mutant clones. MDM2 inhibitors may rescue normal p53 from degradation and have been evaluated in a variety of cancers with promising results. However the impact of these drugs on TP53 mutated cells is underexplored. We report herein evidence of a direct effect of MDM2 inhibition on the selection of MPN patients' cells harboring TP53 mutations. To decipher whether these mutations can arise in a specific molecular context we used a DNA single cell approach to determine the clonal architecture of TP53 mutated cells. We observed that TP53 mutations are late events in MPN mainly occurring in the driver clone while clonal evolution frequently consists of sequential branching instead of linear consecutive acquisition of mutations in the same clone. At the single cell level the presence of additional mutations does not influence the selection of TP53 mutant cells by MDM2 inhibitor treatment. Also, we describe an in vitro test allowing to predict the emergence of TP53 mutated clones. Altogether, this is the first demonstration that a drug treatment can directly favor the emergence of TP53-mutated subclones in MPN.",['Copyright (c) 2022 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Maslah, Nabih', 'Verger, Emmanuelle', 'Giraudier, Stephane', 'Chea, Mathias', 'Hoffman, Ronald', 'Mascarenhas, John', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques']","['Maslah N', 'Verger E', 'Giraudier S', 'Chea M', 'Hoffman R', 'Mascarenhas J', 'Cassinat B', 'Kiladjian JJ']","['INSERM U1131, Universite de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'APHP Hopital St Louis, Paris, France.', 'INSERM and APHP and Universite Paris-Diderot, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1131, Universite de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York, United States.', 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States.', 'Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220114,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2022/01/15 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2022/01/14 20:22'],"['2021/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/14 20:22 [entrez]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['483533 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005867 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Adv. 2022 Jan 14. pii: 483533. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005867.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5553-462X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2773-2784', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8400-0483', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6514-3905', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8121-438X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATL is an orphan disease with no curative drug treatment regimens, urgently needing new combination therapy. HTLV-1-infected cells rely on viral proteins, Tax and HBZ (HTLV-1-b-ZIP factor), to activate the transcription of various host genes that are critical for promoting leukemic transformation. Inhibition of bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) protein was previously shown to collapse the transcriptional network directed by BATF3 super-enhancer and thereby induced ATL cell apoptosis. In the current work, by using xenograft, ex vivo, and in vitro models, we demonstrated that I-BET762 (BETi) synergized with copanlisib (PI3Ki) and bardoxolone methyl (NF-kappaBi) to dramatically decrease the growth of ATL cells. Mechanistically, the triple combination exhibited synergistic activity by down-regulating the expression of c-MYC while up-regulating the level of the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ).

The common side effects of doxorubicin include vomiting, hair loss, rashes to serious side-effects such as irreversible cardiotoxicity, and drug-induced leukemia. This led many researchers around the globe to develop methods aimed to achieve higher efficacy and lower toxicity for doxorubicin. The present review article provides a detailed account of the design strategies i.e., chemical modifications and conjugate formation adopted by various research groups to minimize the side effects without compromising with the significant anticancer profile of the drug doxorubicin. Chemical modification of the drug includes alteration at C4' hydroxyl and C3' amine groups present in the sugar part. The pH-sensitive drug delivery system is covered highlighting use of theranostic tantalum oxide to the traditional approach of conjugating with acyl hydrazine and thiourea. Methods adopted to increase the bioavailability of the drugs inside the cancer cells viz., conjugation with humanized monoclonal antibody and other peptides along with their promising results are also discussed. The review further discusses works from recent years comprising of different nanoforms of doxorubicin for the targeted delivery of drugs inside the tumor cells. Few of the articles targeting nucleus or mitochondria as one of the effective cancer treatments are reported. The brain is inaccessible to the drug and it was modified through galactoxyloglucan-modified gold nanocarrier or conjugated with lactoferrin with enhanced permeability through the blood-brain barrier. Prodrug has particularly been used to target tumor tissues without affecting other tissue organs.

TP53 mutated/null tumor cells are more sensitive to ATO treatment compared to tumor cells carrying wild type TP53 gene copies. However, it is unclear whether TP53 inhibitors can increase the sensitivity of TP53 wild type tumor cells to ATO. Here, we show that breast, colon and lung cancer cell lines with mutated/null TP53 are more sensitive to ATO-induced cell growth inhibition than cells with wild type TP53. Moreover, inhibition of TP53 by a TP53 inhibitor, PFTalpha, increased the ATO sensitivity of TP53 wild type tumor cells, coincident with ATO-induced cell growth arrest and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, combined treatment with ATO and PFTalpha synergistically inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenografts in vivo. Through microarray transcriptional analysis, we found that ATO-regulated genes were associated with TP53 and cell cycle signaling pathways. Co-treatment with PFTalpha enhanced ATO induced dynamic transcriptional changes. Overall, our results provide evidences in using TP53 chemical inhibitors to enhance the ATO-mediated therapeutic response against TP53 wild type tumor cells.",['This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: We developed and validated a prognostic index to identify newly diagnosed patients without need of treatment (CLL-WONT) by a training/validation approach using data on 4,708 patients. Composite scores derived from weighted hazards by multivariable analysis defined CLL-WONT risk groups. RESULTS: Age (>65 years: 1 point), Binet stage (B: 2 points), lactate dehydrogenase (>205 U/L: 1 point), absolute lymphocyte count (15-30x10(9) /L: 1 point; >30x10(9) /L; 2 points), beta2-microglobulin (>4 mg/L: 1 point), IGHV mutation status (unmutated: 1 point) and 11q or 17p deletion (1 point) were independently associated with shorter time to first treatment (TTFT). Low risk patients demonstrated 5-year TTFT of 2% by internal validation, but 7-19% by external validation. Including all patients with complete scores, the 5-year TTFT was 10% for the 756 (39%) CLL-WONT low risk patients, and the 704 (37%) patients who were both CLL-WONT and CLL-IPI low risk demonstrated even lower 5-year TTFT (8%). CONCLUSION: We have adopted the CLL-WONT at an institution covering 1,800,000 individuals to allow patients with both low risk CLL-WONT and CLL-IPI to be managed by primary health care providers, thereby prioritizing specialized hematology services for patients in dire need.",['This article is protected by copyright.

Often, their prooncogenic features have been linked to their ability of inhibiting the anti-proliferative action of TGF-ss signalling. Recently, not only pro-oncogenic but also anti-oncogenic functions of Ski/Sno proteins have been revealed. Besides Ski and Sno, which are ubiquitously expressed other members of Ski/Sno proteins exist which show highly specific neuronal expression, the SKI Family Transcriptional Corepressors (Skor). Among others Skor1 and Skor2 are involved in the development of Purkinje neurons and a mutation of Skor1 has been found to be associated with restless legs syndrome. But neither Skor1 nor Skor2 have been reported to be involved in cancer progression. Using overexpression studies in the Drosophila eye imaginal disc, we analysed if the Drosophila Skor homologue Fuss has retained the potential to inhibit differentiation and induce increased proliferation. Fuss expressed in cells posterior to the morphogenetic furrow, impairs photoreceptor axon pathfinding and inhibits differentiation of accessory cells. However, if its expression is induced prior to eye differentiation, Fuss might inhibit the differentiating function of Dpp signalling and might maintain proliferative action of Wg signalling, which is reminiscent of the Ski/Sno protein function in cancer.",,"['Rass, Mathias', 'Gizler, Laura', 'Bayersdorfer, Florian', 'Irlbeck, Christoph', 'Schramm, Matthias', 'Schneuwly, Stephan']","['Rass M', 'Gizler L', 'Bayersdorfer F', 'Irlbeck C', 'Schramm M', 'Schneuwly S']","['Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Zoology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Zoology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Zoology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Zoology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Zoology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Zoology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220114,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2022/01/15 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2022/01/14 17:17'],"['2021/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/14 17:17 [entrez]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0262360 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-05593 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2022 Jan 14;17(1):e0262360. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0262360. eCollection 2022.,17,1,e0262360,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7509-0336', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4710-5275', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0097-5639', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3042-8641']",,PMC8759651,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antibiotic prophylaxis during periods of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia may reduce the incidence of BSIs. PROCEDURE: A levofloxacin prophylaxis guideline was implemented for pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We conducted a retrospective cohort study over 4 years (2 years pre and 2 years post implementation) of the practice guideline to assess the impact on central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and BSI events. Secondary outcomes included incidence of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, bacteremia due to multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO), and bacteremia due to levofloxacin nonsusceptible organisms. STATA was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-three and 72 patients met inclusion criteria for the pre- and postimplementation cohorts, respectively. Demographics were similar between the groups. We observed 60 BSI events in the pre-group versus 49 events in the post-group (p = .1). Bacteremia due to Gram-negative rods (risk ratio [RR] 0.37 [0.21, 0.66], p < .001) and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) CLABSIs (RR 0.62 [0.44, 0.89], p = .01) were significantly reduced in the postimplementation group. The incidences of C. difficile-associated diarrhea and MDRO bacteremia were similar between groups. However, we observed an increase in the incidence of BSI due to Gram-negative rods that were nonsusceptible to levofloxacin (RR 3.38 [0.72, 6.65], p < .001). CONCLUSION: Following implementation of a levofloxacin prophylaxis guideline, we observed a significant decrease in BSIs due to Gram-negative rods and NHSN CLABSIs.

In total, ~75% oral cancer cases are associated with lifestyle factors, including uncontrolled alcohol consumption, betel and tobacco chewing, and the excessive use of tobacco. Notably, betel chewing is highly associated with oral cancer in Southeast Asia. Arsenic is a key environmental toxicant; however, arsenic trioxide has been used as a medicine for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, highlighting its anticancer properties. The present study aimed to investigate the role of arsenic compounds in the treatment of cancer, using FaDu oral squamous carcinoma cells treated with sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) and dimethyl arsenic acid (DMA). The results demonstrated that FaDu cells exhibited membrane blebbing phenomena and high levels of apoptosis following treatment with 10 microM NaAsO2 and 1 mM DMA for 24 h. The results of cell viability assay demonstrated that the rate of FaDu cell survival was markedly reduced as the concentration of arsenic compounds increased from 10 to 100 microM NaAsO2, and 1 to 100 mM DMA. Moreover, flow cytometry was carried out to further examine the effects of arsenic compounds on FaDu cell cycle regulation; the results revealed that treatment with NaAsO2 and DMA led to a significant increase in the percentage of FaDu cells in the subG1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. An Annexin V/PI double staining assay was subsequently performed to verify the levels of FaDu cell apoptosis following treatment with arsenic compounds. Furthermore, the results of the western blot analyses revealed that the expression levels of caspase8, 9 and 3, and poly ADPribose polymerase, as well the levels of phosphorylated JNK and ERK1/2 were increased following treatment with NaAsO2 and DMA in the FaDu cells. On the whole, the results of the present study revealed that treatment with NaAsO2 and DMA promoted the apoptosis of FaDu oral cancer cells, by activating MAPK pathways, as well as the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.",,"['Wu, Su-Zhen', 'Lan, Yu-Yan', 'Chu, Chiao-Yun', 'Wang, Yang-Kao', 'Lee, Yi-Ping', 'Chang, Hong-Yi', 'Huang, Bu-Miin']","['Wu SZ', 'Lan YY', 'Chu CY', 'Wang YK', 'Lee YP', 'Chang HY', 'Huang BM']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Chi Mei Medical Center, Liouying, Tainan 73657, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Nursing, ShuZen Junior College of Medicine and Management, Kaohsiung 82144, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Food Technology, College of Engineering, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan 71005, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220114,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['FaDu cells', 'MAPK pathway', 'apoptosis', 'caspase pathway', 'dimethyl arsenic acid', 'oral cancer', 'sodium arsenite']",2022/01/15 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2022/01/14 08:40'],"['2021/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/14 08:40 [entrez]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/ijo.2022.5308 [doi]', '18 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2022 Feb;60(2). pii: 18. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2022.5308.

SIRT1 is a histone deacetylase involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis. We previously showed the high expression of SIRT1 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with ATL. There have been many reports that SIRT1 inhibitors show tumor suppressive effects. On the other hand, SIRT1 activator SRT1720 induces the cell death of multiple myeloma and breast cancer cells. However, the effect of SRT1720 on ATL is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of SRT1720 on cell death in leukemic cell lines in vitro and freshly isolated ATL cells ex vivo, and in an ATL in vivo mouse model. SRT1720 reduced cell viability in vitro and ex vivo. Additionally, SRT1720 increased the number of apoptotic cells, as shown by annexin V-positive cells, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, cleaved caspase-3, and fragmented DNA. SRT1720 also induced mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization with the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and autophagy. However, SIRT1 knockdown did not attenuate SRT1720-induced cell death in leukemic cell lines. Finally, SRT1720 treatment decreased the growth of human ATL tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Our study shows that while SRT1720 does not target SIRT1, it induces cell death in ATL cells via apoptosis and autophagy, and has anti-tumor activity.",['This article is protected by copyright.

ALDH1A1 is an enzyme critical in cancer stem cells. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ALDH1A1 protects leukemia-initiating cells from a number of antineoplastic agents, which include inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, ALDH1A1 proves vital for the establishment of human AML xenografts in mice. We review here important studies characterizing the role of ALDH1A1 in AML and its potential as a therapeutic target. We also analyze datasets from leading studies, and show that decreased ALDH1A1 RNA expression consistently characterizes the AML patient risk group with a favorable prognosis, while there is a consistent association of high ALDH1A1 RNA expression with high risk and poor overall survival. Our review and analysis reinforces the notion to employ both novel as well as existing inhibitors of the ALDH1A1 protein against AML.","['(c) 2021.

Naringenin is a polyphenolic flavonoid with anti-tumor ability. METHODS: Cell viability and proliferation of two cancer cells and a normal cell line after treatment with these agents were determined with MTT assay. To predict the possible interaction between calmodulin (CaM) and FMSP and naringenin, docking studies were performed. By using fluorescence emission spectra, the effects of FMSP and naringenin on CaM structure and activity were studied. CaM-dependent activation of phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) by FMSP in relation to naringenin and their combination were compared. Effects of these compounds on PDE1 inhibition, cAMP accumulation, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activation were assayed. RESULTS: The combination of FMSP and naringenin had more inhibitory effects on CaM structure than FMSP and naringenin alone. Results of docking analyses also confirmed efficient interaction of the two compounds with a hydrophobic pocket of calmodulin active site. Kinetic analyses of these agents' interaction with CaM showed FMSP and naringenin both competitively inhibited PDE1 activation without changing the Vmax parameter. FMSP and naringenin synergistically increased Km values at a higher level compared to FMSP or naringenin alone. The combination of these two agents also had more cytotoxic effects on cancer cells than FMSP alone. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that mechanism of proliferation inhibition in both cancer cells by these compounds is based on CaM and consequent PDE inhibition followed by intracellular cAMP level elevation and increased PKA activity in a dose-dependent manner.","['(c) 2021.

Despite the emergence of targeted therapies that are well tolerated and prolong survival, the disease remains incurable and relapse is common particularly in individuals with high-risk features. Herein, we review the key literature about the current options for relapsed disease and explore the emerging role of cellular therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials have established the role of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, selective BCL-2 inhibition, and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies as treatment options for CLL/SLL. The role of chimeric antigen receptor T cells has shown promise in individuals with CLL/SLL in early phase clinical trials. Novel therapeutic approaches with targeted therapies have redefined the management of CLL/SLL in both the front-line and relapsed/refractory settings. Optimal management in terms of sequencing or combining therapies, especially in individuals with high-risk features, remains a challenge. The emerging role of cellular therapies has the potential to build upon and further improve the current treatment paradigm.","['(c) 2022.

To enhance trafficking to bone marrow, circulating Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells are expanded in serum-free medium containing TGF-beta1 and IL-2 (gammadelta[T2] cells) or medium containing IL-2 alone (gammadelta[2] cells, as the control). Unexpectedly, the yield and viability of gammadelta[T2] cells are also increased by TGF-beta1, when compared to gammadelta[2] controls. gammadelta[T2] cells are less differentiated and yet display increased cytolytic activity, cytokine release, and antitumor activity in several leukemic and solid tumor models. Efficacy is further enhanced by cancer cell sensitization using aminobisphosphonates or Ara-C. A number of contributory effects of TGF-beta are described, including prostaglandin E2 receptor downmodulation, TGF-beta insensitivity, and upregulated integrin activity. Biological relevance is supported by the identification of a favorable gammadelta[T2] signature in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Given their enhanced therapeutic activity and compatibility with allogeneic use, gammadelta[T2] cells warrant evaluation in cancer immunotherapy.",['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],"['Beatson, Richard E',

Here, we show that primary human ALL samples injected into the femora of immunodeficient mice migrate to the skull and vertebral bone marrow and provoke bone lesions that enable passage into the subarachnoid space. Treatment of leukemia xenografted mice with a biologic antagonist of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) blocks this entry route. In addition to erosion of cranial and vertebral bone, samples from individuals with B-ALL also penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier of recipient mice. Co-administration of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and RANKL antagonists attenuate both identified routes of entry. Our findings suggest that targeted RANKL and CXCR4 pathway inhibitors could attenuate routes of leukemia blast CNS invasion and provide benefit for B-ALL-affected individuals.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Rajakumar, Sujeetha A', 'Grandal, Ildiko', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Hitzler, Johann K', 'Guidos, Cynthia J', 'Danska, Jayne S']","['Rajakumar SA', 'Grandal I', 'Minden MD', 'Hitzler JK', 'Guidos CJ', 'Danska JS']","['Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211221,United States,Cell Rep Med,Cell reports.

Although there have been advancements in treatment, there is still a need to develop a biotherapeutic agent. A new variant of the human alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (HALOA) complex has been synthesized, which showed similarities with SNARE. The native alpha-LA was treated with EDTA to remove Ca(2+) ions confirmed by ICP-OES and Arsenazo III to unfold and attain apo structure. The apo LA was mixed with OA in a specific ratio, leading to HALOA complex formation. The conformational state from native to complex was elucidated by circular dichroism (far; 190-260 nm and near; 260-340 nm UV-CD), which confirmed that the complex consists of a majority of turns and beta-sheet structure. SDS-PAGE result showed the masking effect of OA on apo alpha-LA. In the lane of the complex, there was no band detected. However, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) dye has shown maximum fluorescence intensity with the complex because of the availability of hydrophobic patches, which was further validated by NMR spectroscopy indicating the masking effect of OA on the apo alpha-LA. The SNARE behavior of the complex (500 nm) has been confirmed by TEM. This new structural variant complex shows anti-tumor activity on chronic myeloid leukemia by targeting the IL-8, survivin, and induces apoptosis through DNA fragmentation, but not against normal cells.

The high specificity, sensitivity, simple protocols, and potential to deliver results without the use of expensive equipment has made it an attractive alternative to RT-PCR. However, the high cost per reaction, the centralized manufacturing of required reagents, and their distribution under cold chain shipping limit RT-LAMP's applicability in low-income settings. The preparation of assays using homebrew enzymes and buffers has emerged worldwide as a response to these limitations and potential shortages. Here, we describe the production of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and BstLF DNA polymerase for the local implementation of RT-LAMP reactions at low cost. These reagents compared favorably to commercial kits, and optimum concentrations were defined in order to reduce time to threshold, increase ON/OFF range, and minimize enzyme quantities per reaction. As a validation, we tested the performance of these reagents in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from RNA extracted from clinical nasopharyngeal samples, obtaining high agreement between RT-LAMP and RT-PCR clinical results. The in-house preparation of these reactions results in an order of magnitude reduction in costs; thus, we provide protocols and DNA to enable the replication of these tests at other locations. These results contribute to the global effort of developing open and low-cost diagnostics that enable technological autonomy and distributed capacities in viral surveillance.",['(c) 2021 ABRF.'],"['Matute, Tamara', 'Nunez, Isaac', 'Rivera, Maira', 'Reyes, Javiera', 'Blazquez-Sanchez, Paula', 'Arce, Anibal', 'Brown, Alexander J', 'Gandini, Chiara', 'Molloy, Jennifer', 'Ramirez-Sarmiento, Cesar A', 'Federici, Fernan']","['Matute T', 'Nunez I', 'Rivera M', 'Reyes J', 'Blazquez-Sanchez P', 'Arce A', 'Brown AJ', 'Gandini C', 'Molloy J', 'Ramirez-Sarmiento CA', 'Federici F']","['ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program - Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio), Santiago, Chile.', 'Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering, Schools of Engineering, Medicine and Biological Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program - Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio), Santiago, Chile.', 'Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering, Schools of Engineering, Medicine and Biological Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program - Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio), Santiago, Chile.', 'Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering, Schools of Engineering, Medicine and Biological Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program - Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio), Santiago, Chile.', 'Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering, Schools of Engineering, Medicine and Biological Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program - Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio), Santiago, Chile.', 'Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering, Schools of Engineering, Medicine and Biological Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program - Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio), Santiago, Chile.', 'Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering, Schools of Engineering, Medicine and Biological Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Department of Immunology and Genomic Medicine, National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Immunology & Microbiology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program - Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio), Santiago, Chile.', 'Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering, Schools of Engineering, Medicine and Biological Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program - Millennium Institute for Integrative Biology (iBio), Santiago, Chile.', 'Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering, Schools of Engineering, Medicine and Biological Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'FONDAP Center for Genome Regulation, Departamento de Genetica Molecular y Microbiologia, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago 8331150, Chile.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Biomol Tech,Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,100888641,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['SARS-CoV-2', 'diagnostics open source']",2022/01/15 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2022/01/14 06:00'],"['2022/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7171/jbt.21-3203-006 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomol Tech. 2021 Sep;32(3):114-120. doi: 10.7171/jbt.21-3203-006.,32,3,114-120,,,,PMC8730520,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its low incidence and indistinct symptoms, there is limited information on OP associated with haematological malignancies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to discuss the characteristics and prognosis of OP associated with haematological malignancies. Methods: We observed and analysed pathologically confirmed OP cases associated with haematological malignancies in a hospital record database and excluded cases of OP with known causes, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, transplantation and infection. Results: There were five patients with OP underlying only haematological malignancies, including one case each of the following: myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukaemia, multiple myeloma, aplastic anaemia, and T cell lymphoma. Radiological findings did not show a distinct pattern, and two cases mimicked pulmonary aspergillosis with ground-glass opacity (GGO). The diagnosis of OP was confirmed by minimal invasive biopsy. Although all patients developed severe cases, steroids yielded favourable outcomes. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that haematological malignancies may be a cause of OP and that minimal invasive biopsy may be an effective and safe method to confirm the diagnosis. Although OP associated with haematological malignancies may more frequently develop into severe cases, the OP lesions were steroid-responsive during follow-up.",['(c) 2022 Zeng et al.'],"['Zeng, Huihui', 'Ma, Yiming', 'He, Xue', 'Cai, Shan', 'Chen, Ping', 'Chen, Yan', 'Luo, Hong']","['Zeng H', 'Ma Y', 'He X', 'Cai S', 'Chen P', 'Chen Y', 'Luo H']","[""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Unit of Respiratory Diseases, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Hunan Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Unit of Respiratory Diseases, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Hunan Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Unit of Respiratory Diseases, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Hunan Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Unit of Respiratory Diseases, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Hunan Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Unit of Respiratory Diseases, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Hunan Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Unit of Respiratory Diseases, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Hunan Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Unit of Respiratory Diseases, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Hunan Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220107,New Zealand,Int J Gen Med,International journal of general medicine,101515487,,['NOTNLM'],"['characteristics', 'follow-up', 'haematological malignancies', 'organizing pneumonia']",2022/01/15 06:00,2022/01/15 06:01,['2022/01/14 05:59'],"['2021/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/14 05:59 [entrez]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJGM.S337321 [doi]', '337321 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Gen Med. 2022 Jan 7;15:301-310. doi: 10.2147/IJGM.S337321. eCollection 2022.,15,,301-310,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7713-6913', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9501-651X']",,PMC8752074,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor escape associated with low target antigen expression is emerging as one potential limitation of their efficacy. Here we edit the TRAC locus in human peripheral blood T cells to engage cell-surface targets through their T cell receptor-CD3 complex reconfigured to utilize the same immunoglobulin heavy and light chains as a matched CAR. We demonstrate that these HLA-independent T cell receptors (HIT receptors) consistently afford high antigen sensitivity and mediate tumor recognition beyond what CD28-based CARs, the most sensitive design to date, can provide. We demonstrate that the functional persistence of HIT T cells can be augmented by constitutive coexpression of CD80 and 4-1BBL. Finally, we validate the increased antigen sensitivity afforded by HIT receptors in xenograft mouse models of B cell leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, targeting CD19 and CD70, respectively. Overall, HIT receptors are well suited for targeting cell surface antigens of low abundance.","['(c) 2022.

Here, we examined low-pass whole genome sequencing (LPWGS) of cfDNA for its predictive value in relapsed/ refractory MM (RRMM). We observed that cfDNA positivity, defined as >/=10% tumor fraction by LPWGS, was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) in an exploratory test cohort of 16 patients who were actively treated on diverse regimens. We prospectively determined the predictive value of cfDNA in 86 samples from 45 RRMM patients treated with elotuzumab, pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in a phase II clinical trial (NCT02718833). PFS in patients with tumor-positive and -negative cfDNA after two cycles of treatment was 1.6 and 17.6 months, respectively (HR 7.6, P < 0.0001). Multivariate hazard modelling confirmed cfDNA as independent risk factor (HR 96.6, P = 6.92e-05). While correlating with serum-free light chains and bone marrow, cfDNA additionally discriminated patients with poor PFS among those with the same response by IMWG criteria. In summary, detectability of MM-derived cfDNA, as a measure of substantial tumor burden with therapy, independently predicts poor PFS and may provide refinement for standard-of-care response parameters to identify patients with poor response to treatment earlier than is currently feasible.","['(c) 2021.

Pterostilbene administration significantly induced apoptosis of leukemic cells, but not of non-malignant hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Interestingly, pterostilbene was highly effective in inducing apoptosis of leukemic cells harboring the BCR/ABL fusion gene, including ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant cells with the T315I mutation. In BCR/ABL(+) leukemic cells, pterostilbene decreased the BCR/ABL fusion protein levels and suppressed AKT and NF-kappaB activation. We further demonstrated that pterostilbene along with U0126, an inhibitor of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, synergistically induced apoptosis of BCR/ABL(+) cells. Our results further suggest that pterostilbene-promoted downregulation of BCR/ABL involves caspase activation triggered by proteasome inhibition-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress. Moreover, oral administration of pterostilbene significantly suppressed tumor growth in mice transplanted with BCR/ABL(+) leukemic cells. Taken together, these results suggest that pterostilbene may hold potential for the treatment of BCR/ABL(+) leukemia, in particular for those showing ABL-dependent TKI resistance.",['(c) 2022.

However, little is known about the biological significance and molecular mechanisms of ZC3H15 in GBM. In this study, we revealed that ZC3H15 was overexpressed in GBM and high ZC3H15 expression was associated with poor survival of patients with GBM. We found that ZC3H15 promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis of GBM cells by activating the EGFR signaling pathway. We also revealed that ZC3H15 reduced EGFR ubiquitination, which was responsible for EGFR protein stabilization. In addition, we demonstrated that ZC3H15 inhibited the transcription of CBL, which was an E3 ubiquitin ligase for EGFR proteasomal degradation. And silencing of CBL could partly abrogate the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells induced by ZC3H15 knockdown. Thus, our research revealed the important roles of ZC3H15 in GBM development and provided a brand-new insight for improving the treatment of GBMs.",['(c) 2022.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated the association between night shift work and risk of lymphoma subtypes in 867 incident cases and 774 controls, who participated in a multicentre Italian study between 2011 and 2017. Based on questionnaire information, occupational experts assessed the lifetime probability of night shift work, the total number of night shifts and years of night shift work among study participants. OR and 95% CI for lymphoma and its major subtypes associated with night shift work was calculated with logistic regression, adjusting by age, gender, education, study area, marital status and family history of haemolymphatic cancer. RESULTS: Ever working night shifts was associated with an increase in the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.32), which was highest after a 15-34 years latency. However, there was not a linear increase in risk by probability of exposure, years of night shift work, nor lifetime number of night shifts whether under rotating or permanent work schedules. Risk of lymphoma overall, B cell lymphoma (BCL), its major subtypes other than CLL, and other less prevalent BCL subtypes combined did not show an association. CONCLUSIONS: We found conflicting evidence of an association between night shift work and the risk of CLL. We did not observe an association with other lymphoma subtypes.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. No commercial re-use. See rights and', 'permissions.

Two sites performed SCP for VRE patients and two did not (NCP). We defined a 5% haVRE-risk difference as non-inferiority margin, screened patients for VRE, and characterised isolates by whole genome sequencing and core genome MLST (cgMLST). Potential confounders were assessed by competing risk regression analysis.ResultsWe included 1,397 patients at NCP and 1,531 patients at SCP sites. Not performing SCP was associated with a significantly higher proportion of haVRE; 12.2% (170/1,397) patients at NCP and 7.4% (113/1,531) patients at SCP sites (relative risk (RR) 1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-2.23). The difference (4.8%) was below the non-inferiority margin. Competing risk regression analysis indicated a stronger impact of antimicrobial exposure (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 7.46; 95% CI: 4.59-12.12) and underlying disease (SHR for acute leukaemia 2.34; 95% CI: 1.46-3.75) on haVRE than NCP (SHR 1.60; 95% CI: 1.14-2.25). Based on cgMLST and patient movement data, we observed 131 patient-to-patient VRE transmissions at NCP and 85 at SCP sites (RR 1.76; 95% CI: 1.33-2.34).ConclusionsWe show a positive impact of SCP on haVRE in a high-risk population, although the observed difference was below the pre-specified non-inferiority margin.

The GMALL 07/2003 study used MRD detection by RQ-PCR of clonal immune gene rearrangements with 1x10-4 as discriminating cut-off: levels >/=1x10-4 define molecular failure and MRD-negativity with an assay sensitivity of at least 1x10-4 defines complete molecular response. The clinical relevance of MRD results not fitting in these categories is unclear and termed ""molecular not evaluable"" (MolNE) towards MRD-based treatment decisions. Within the GMALL 07/03 study, 1019 consecutive bone marrow samples after first consolidation were evaluated for MRD. Patients with complete molecular response had significantly better outcome (five-year overall survival, 5y-OS=85+/-2%, n=603; five-year disease-free survival, 5y-DFS=73+/-2%, n=599) compared to patients with molecular failure 5y-OS=40+/-3%, n=238; 5y-DFS=29+/-3%, n=208), with MolNE patients in-between (5y-OS=66+/-4%, 5y-DFS=52+/-4%, n=178). Of MolNE samples re-analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS), patients with undetectable NGS-MRD (n=44; 5y-OS=88+/-5%, 5y-DFS=70+/-7%) had significantly better outcome than those with positive NGS-MRD (n=42; 5y-OS=37+/-8%, 5y-DFS=33+/-8%).

Detection of the Pax-5a gene can provide effective technical means for early screening of B lymphocytic leukemia. In this work, we designed a sensing scheme to detect the Pax-5a gene based on the signal amplification system, which is based on dual-enzyme assisted target gene circulation, and the disordered cleavage of CRISPR/Cas12a protease. The hairpin probe (HP) in this scheme not only contains the binding sites of the target gene and the primer, but also cleverly contains half of the Nt.BbvCI splicing sites. When the target gene is present, through the synergistic effect of KF and Nt.BbvCI, a large number of single strands of a specific sequence can be produced. At the same time, the target gene falls off from the first hairpin and opens the other hairpin to realize the cycle of the target gene. The resulting single-strand can bind to the Cas12a/crRNA binary complex and unlock the anti-cleavage activity of the CRISPR/Cas12a protease. The single strands labeled with the fluorescent group (FAM) and the quenching group (BHQ) around the solution are cleaved, the fluorescence signal of FAM is restored, and a detectable fluorescence signal is generated. The detection limit is as low as 6.77 fM, and the target gene and the mismatch sequence can also be distinguished well. Therefore, the sensing scheme provides a new detection direction for the early diagnosis and screening of B lymphocytic leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Patients with underlying clonal hematopoiesis (CH) may be more inclined to develop hematologic toxicity after PRRT. However, this association remains understudied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated pre- and post-PRRT blood samples of patients with neuroendocrine tumors. After initial screening, 13 cases of interest were selected. Serial blood samples were obtained on 4 of 13 patients. Genomic DNA was analyzed using a 100-gene panel. A variant allele frequency cutoff of 1% was used to call CH. RESULT: Sixty-two percent of patients had CH at baseline. Persistent cytopenias were noted in 64% (7 of 11) of the patients. Serial sample analysis demonstrated that PRRT exposure resulted in clonal expansion of mutant DNA damage response genes (TP53, CHEK2, and PPM1D) and accompanying cytopenias in 75% (3 of 4) of the patients. One patient who had a normal baseline hemogram and developed persistent cytopenias after PRRT exposure showed expansion of mutant PPM1D (variant allele frequency increased to 20% after exposure from < 1% at baseline). In the other two patients, expansion of mutant TP53, CHEK2, and PPM1D clones was also noted along with cytopenia development. CONCLUSION: The shifts in hematopoietic clonal dynamics in our study were accompanied by emergence and persistence of cytopenias. These cytopenias likely represent premalignant state, as PPM1D-, CHEK2-, and TP53-mutant clones by themselves carry a high risk for transformation to therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Future studies should consider CH screening and longitudinal monitoring as a key risk mitigation strategy for patients with neuroendocrine tumors receiving PRRT.",,"['Singh, Abhay', 'Mencia-Trinchant, Nuria', 'Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Altahan, Alaa', 'Swaminathan, Mahesh', 'Gupta, Medhavi', 'Gravina, Matthew', 'Tajammal, Rutaba', 'Faber, Mark G', 'Yan, LunBiao', 'Sinha, Eti', 'Hassane, Duane C', 'Hayes, David Neil', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Iyer, Renuka', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Thota, Swapna']","['Singh A', 'Mencia-Trinchant N', 'Griffiths EA', 'Altahan A', 'Swaminathan M', 'Gupta M', 'Gravina M', 'Tajammal R', 'Faber MG', 'Yan L', 'Sinha E', 'Hassane DC', 'Hayes DN', 'Guzman ML', 'Iyer R', 'Wang ES', 'Thota S']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.', 'State University at Buffalo-Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo, NY.', 'State University at Buffalo-Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.', 'Division of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Division of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Division of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.', 'Division of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JCO Precis Oncol,JCO precision oncology,101705370,IM,,,2022/01/14 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2022/01/13 17:18'],"['2022/01/13 17:18 [entrez]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/PO.21.00309 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Precis Oncol. 2022 Jan;6:e2100309. doi: 10.1200/PO.21.00309.,6,,e2100309,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6657-8647', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1376-8708', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0288-8248', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8835-0392', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5959-397X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4800-1216', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4680-0321', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0719-9572', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6203-7771', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9262-8246', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3643-8621', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8644-0968']",,,,"['Elizabeth A.

It is unclear why some children with ALL develop CNS leukemia and others do not, and there remains debate regarding optimal regimens for prophylaxis, upfront treatment, and the treatment of CNS relapses. These topics are especially important since both cranial radiation therapy (CRT) and intensive intrathecal therapy carry risks of both short- and long-term adverse effects. In this review, we aim to identify areas of ongoing debate on this topic, review the biology of CNS leukemia, and summarize clinical trial data that address some of these questions. RECENT FINDINGS: Both retrospective and meta-analyses have demonstrated that few patients with ALL benefit from CRT as a component of CNS-directed treatment for de novo disease, allowing cooperative groups to greatly limit the number of patients undergoing CRT as part of their initial ALL regimens. More recent efforts are focusing on how best to assay for low levels of CNS disease at the time of diagnosis, as well as the biological drivers that may result in CNS leukemia in certain patients. Progress remains to be made in the identification and treatment of CNS leukemia in pediatric ALL. Advancements have occurred to limit the number of children undergoing CRT, but much has yet to be learned to better understand the biology of and risk factors for CNS leukemia, and novel approaches are required to approach CNS relapse of ALL.","['(c) 2022.

Detailed information on the genetic make-up of immunophenotypically defined subclones is however scarce. We performed error-corrected sequencing for 27 myeloid leukemia driver genes in 86, FACS-sorted immunophenotypically characterized normal and aberrant subfractions in 10 AML patients. We identified three main scenarios. In the first group of patients, the two techniques were equally well characterizing the malignancy. In the second group, most of the isolated populations did not express aberrant immunophenotypes but still harbored several genetic aberrancies, indicating that the information obtained only by immunophenotyping would be incomplete. Vice versa, one patient was identified in which genetic mutations were found only in a small fraction of the immunophenotypically defined malignant populations, indicating that the genetic analysis gave an incomplete picture of the disease. We conclude that currently, characterization of leukemic cells in AML by molecular and immunophenotypic techniques is complementary, and infer that both techniques should be used in parallel in order to obtain the most complete view on the disease.",['(c) 2022.

A total of three thiopurines (also thioguanine (1950) and azathioprine (1957)) were developed over time. These immunosuppressive drugs were also successfully introduced a few decades later to prevent rejection of transplanted organs and to treat several autoimmune diseases. For the discovery of thiopurines and other antimetabolite drugs she was rewarded in 1988, together with George Hitchings and James Black, with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Important steps have been made in recent years to unravel its metabolism, mode of action and pharmacogenetics.

Its use is avoided in adults due to its high risk of liver injury including hepatic steatosis, with obesity and older age considered risk factors of the injury. Our study aims to elucidate the mechanism of PEG-ASNase-induced liver injury. Mice received 1500 U/kg of PEG-ASNase and were sacrificed 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after drug administration. Liver triglycerides were quantified, and plasma bilirubin, ALT, AST, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were measured. The mRNA and protein levels of genes involved in hepatic fatty acid synthesis, beta-oxidation, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, and white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis were determined. Mice developed hepatic steatosis after PEG-ASNase, which associated with increases in bilirubin, ALT, and AST. The hepatic genes Ppara, Lcad/Mcad, Hadhb, Apob100, and Mttp were upregulated, and Srebp-1c and Fas were downregulated after PEG-ASNase. Increased plasma NEFA, WAT loss, and adipose tissue lipolysis were also observed after PEG-ASNase. Furthermore, we found that PEG-ASNase-induced liver injury was exacerbated in obese and aged mice, consistent with clinical studies of ASNase-induced liver injury. Our data suggest that PEG-ASNase-induced liver injury is due to drug-induced lipolysis and lipid redistribution to the liver.","['(c) 2021 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica,', 'Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Methods: We used the eight-color MFC panel with CD45/side scatter log gating strategy to analyze LAIPs in 50 AML patients presenting to Alexandria University Hospitals, Egypt at diagnosis and relapse and refractory cases. Twenty age and sex matched bone marrow samples from patients performing bone marrow aspirate for non-malignant hematological indications were included as controls. Results: LAIPs were observed in 43 (86.0%) cases. Only one aberrant immunophenotype was identified in four cases (9.3%), while two to 12 aberrant immunophenotypes were found in the other 39 (90.7%) cases. Strong LAIPs were obtained by combining CD2, CD4, CD56, with either CD34 or CD117, in contrast to CD19, which has to be combined with CD117. Refractory cases showed the presence of the same LAIPs at both initial diagnosis and persistent disease. One case showed the acquisition of new LAIPs after relapse. Conclusions: The good choice of LAIPs depends on their specificity rather than their frequency. The results of this study can help in increasing the sensitivity of LAIPs strategy in minimal residual disease using MFC in AML patients, which is considered an important post-diagnosis parameter associated with prognosis and clinical outcome.",['The OMJ is Published Bimonthly and Copyrighted 2021 by the OMSB.'],"['Rasheed, Hadeer Mohamed', 'Donia, Hanaa Mahmoud', 'Nadwan, Eman Attia', 'Mourad, Zeinab Ibrahim', 'Farahat, Nahla']","['Rasheed HM', 'Donia HM', 'Nadwan EA', 'Mourad ZI', 'Farahat N']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211130,Oman,Oman Med J,Oman medical journal,101526350,,['NOTNLM'],"['Flow Cytometry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Neoplasm, Residual']",2022/01/14 06:00,2022/01/14 06:01,['2022/01/13 12:29'],"['2021/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/13 12:29 [entrez]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5001/omj.2021.108 [doi]', 'OMJ-36-06-2100009 [pii]']",epublish,Oman Med J. 2021 Nov 30;36(6):e323. doi: 10.5001/omj.2021.108. eCollection 2021 Nov.,36,6,e323,,,,PMC8722324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal expression of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) 4 has been observed in multiple tumors and plays a vital role in cancer development. However, the association between SMC4 expression and clinical characteristics in Chinese childhood patients with ALL is unknown. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between SMC4 expression and clinical features and prognosis in these patients. METHODS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect the expression of SMC4 in Chinese pediatric ALL patients and in patients achieving complete remission (CR). Then, the relationships between SMC4 expression and clinical features, such as gender, age, white blood cell (WBC) count, French-American-British (FAB) classification, immunophenotype, fusion gene, prednisone response, and minimal residual disease (MRD) were determined. Furthermore, survival and prognostic factor analyses were carried out to examine the prognostic value of SMC4 expression. RESULTS: The expression level of SMC4 was significantly higher in bone morrow cells of newly diagnosed pediatric ALL patients than in those of healthy controls (p = 0.006), especially in B-cell precursor ALL (BCP ALL). Moreover, SMC4 expression was correlated with different clinical parameters. Furthermore, a decrease of SMC4 expression was detected in BCP ALL patients achieving CR. The high SMC4 expression group had both worse event-free survival rate and poorer overall survival rate. However, multivariate analysis showed that SMC4 expression was not an independently predictive factor of BCP ALL outcome. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that SMC4 expression in BM was associated with various clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with ALL, although it was not an independent outcome factor.",,"['Peng, Luyun', 'Shi, Rui', 'Dai, Qingkai', 'Yang, Hao', 'Ye, Lei', 'Wang, Yuefang', 'Zhang, Ge', 'Jiang, Yongmei', 'Liu, Xiaojuan']","['Peng L', 'Shi R', 'Dai Q', 'Yang H', 'Ye L', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang G', 'Jiang Y', 'Liu X']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,IM,,,2022/01/14 06:00,2022/01/18 06:00,['2022/01/13 09:01'],"['2022/01/13 09:01 [entrez]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2021.210852 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2022 Jan 1;68(1). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2021.210852.,68,1,,,,,,,,,,,,20220117,,"['Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the founder mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the Turkish population in the Aegean region as well as their genotype-phenotype correlations. METHODS: All the patients were provided with BRCA1/2 testing criteria according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. QIAseq Targeted DNA Panels were used for the BRCA1/2 coding regions. RESULTS: Of the 181 studied patients, 38 (21%) were found to carry pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations, while 20 (11%) patients were found to carry variants of unknown significance. The most common pathogenic mutations were NM_000059.4:c.2765dup in the BRCA2 gene and NM_007300.4:c.981_982del and NM_007294.3:c. 5266dup in the BRCA1 gene. p.Lys3326* was the most frequently detected variant of unknown significance (6/ 181). Regarding genotype-phenotype correlations, the NM_007300.4:c.981_982del mutation in BRCA1 gene was found to be milder in terms of breast cancer. The most frequent cancers other than those related to BRCA genes, observed in the relatives of the patients who had pathogenic variants and variants of unknown significance, were endometrium cancer and leukemia, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NM_007294.3:c.5266dup was found to be a candidate founder mutation in the Turkish population. NM_007300.4:c.981_982del mutation seems to have a milder course in terms of breast cancer.

Although the cause of requests was deficiency suspicions, an important ratio of high levels of Vitamin B12 were reported to physicians by laboratory. Ratios of values of high Vitamin B12 among test request in adults are reported as 14- 20% in present three monocentre studies and one multicentre study. There is no report on children with high vitamin B12 for both ratio in lab requests or clinical follow up. METHODS: We evaluated the records of 40 children (23 male /17 female) with high B12 values ( > 1000 pg/ ml) retrospectively. Children were otherwise healthy children and were seen at outpatient pediatric clinics. Additionally, vitamin B12 values of 13 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients at diagnosis time were retrieved to enlighten possible role of lymphocytes. RESULT: Children did not have any malign or chronic diseases causing the high Vitamin B12 values. Holotranscobalamin levels were normal or slightly above. Two patients did develop leukemia later. Our follow up showed that high vitamin B12 values slightly decreased at 3 months and then remained unchanged later. The high numbers of T and B cells are not the source of vitamin B12 elevation.

However, the potential role of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) remodeling in tumor microenvironment (TME) infiltration remains unclear. METHODS AND MATERIALS: m6A patterns of 469 AML patients (420 of which provided survival data) based on 18 m6A regulators were systematically evaluated. Based on the expression of 18 m6A regulators, unsupervised agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to recognize the various m6A modification types and to classify patients. We linked these patterns to TME infiltration characteristics and identified three distinct populations of m6A modifications. RESULTS: These three TME cell infiltration patterns are characterized by a high degree of concordance with the three tumor immunophenotypes, which include immunoinflammatory, immunorejection, and immune inert patterns. We showed that assessment of m6A modification patterns within individually neoplasms can forecast the stage of neoplasmic inflammation, TME basal activity, subtype, hereditary mutation, and clinical patient prognosis. Limited low m6Ascore, featuring increased mutational load and immune activation, indicates an inflammatory phenotype of TME with a 5-year survival rate at 14.4% compared to the high-m6Ascore group (40.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Data from two different cohorts demonstrated that a higher m6Ascore showed a marked therapeutic superiority as well as clinical advantage. Assessing m6A modification patterns in AML patients could improve our knowledge of the TME infiltrative profile as well as directing effective immunotherapeutic approaches.",['(c) 2022 The Authors.

Unmanipulated haploidentical transplantation (Haplo-HSCT) is commonly used for those AML patients who need a timely transplant and do not have a suitable matched donor, but relapse rates are still high, and improvements are needed. Adoptive immunotherapy using natural killer cells (NK cells) could be a promising tool to improved Haplo-HSCT but, to date, no optimal infusion and manufacturing protocols have been developed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we describe a quick and reproducible protocol for clinical-grade production of haploidentical donor NK cells using double immunomagnetic depletion and enrichment protocol and overnight IL-15 stimulation. RESULTS: Thus, we have obtained 8 viable and functional NK cell products that have been safely infused to five AML patients undergoing unmanipulated Haplo-HSCT.

Prednisolone is a corticosteroid and one of the most important agents in the treatment of ALL. We report here a study of Prednisolone treatment using as a model a leukemia cell line with subsequent investigation of resistance-related gene expression. Gene silencing has been used in order to identify significant targets of resistance to GC-induced apoptosis in ALL cells. We analyzed effects of increasing doses of Prednisolone on ALL cell survival and growth, and we monitored immediate effects on gene expression through gene expression assays. We determined Prednisolone cytotoxicity and cell cycle distribution as well as DNA content. Upon treatment with escalating Prednisolone concentration, we observed a gradual decline in cell survival. MCL1 and GRIM19 were investigated as possible genes for the intrinsic capacity of this cell line to respond to corticosteroid and a snapshot of early changes was examined. Early MCL1 and GRIM19 expression correlated significantly to late GC-induced apoptosis. Prednisolone competitively induces MCL1 expression. Consistently with previous studies on primary leukemia blasts, cells are sensitive to proteasome inhibitor MG132; no interference of Prednisolone with MG132 effects on this cell line was noted. The inherent plasticity of clinically evolving cancer justifies approaches to characterize and prevent undesirable activation of early oncogenic pathways. Study of the pattern of intracellular signal pathway activation by anticancer drugs can lead to development of efficient treatment strategies by reducing detrimental secondary effects.","['(c) 2021.

Current understanding of the leukemogenic potential and therapeutic targetability of activating TYK2 alterations in the ALL setting is unclear, thus further investigations are warranted. Consequently, we developed in vitro, and for the first time, in vivo models of B-cell ALL from a patient harboring the MYB-TYK2 fusion gene. These models revealed JAK/STAT signaling activation and the oncogenic potential of the MYB-TYK2 fusion gene in isolation. High throughput screening identified the HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat and the HSP90 inhibitor, tanespimycin plus the JAK inhibitor, cerdulatinib as the most effective agents against cells expressing the MYB-TYK2 alteration. Evaluation of vorinostat and cerdulatinib in pre-clinical models of MYB-TYK2-rearranged ALL demonstrated that both drugs exhibited anti-leukemic effects and reduced the disease burden in treated mice.

In addition, our data provide evidence for use of vorinostat and cerdulatinib in the treatment regimens of patients with this rare yet aggressive type of high-risk ALL that warrants further investigation in the clinical setting.","['(c) 2022.

Core subunits of the SWI/SNF complexes have been shown to have oncogenic roles in acute myeloid leukemia. However, the roles of the unique targeting subunits, including that of Arid2 and Arid1b, in AML leukemogenesis are not well understood. Here, we used conditional knockout mouse models to elucidate their role in MLL-AF9 leukemogenesis. We uncovered that Arid2 has dual roles; enhancing leukemogenesis when deleted during leukemia initiation and yet is required during leukemia maintenance. Whereas, deleting Arid1b in either phase promotes leukemogenesis. Our integrated analyses of transcriptomics and genomic binding data showed that, globally, Arid2 and Arid1b regulate largely distinct sets of genes at different disease stages, respectively, and in comparison, to each other. Amongst the most highly dysregulated transcription factors upon their loss, Arid2 and Arid1b converged on the regulation of Etv4/Etv5, albeit in an opposing manner while also regulating distinct TFs including Gata2,Tcf4, Six4, Irf4 and Hmgn3. Our data demonstrate the differential roles of SWI/SNF subunits in AML leukemogenesis and emphasize that cellular context and disease stage are key in determining their functions during this process.","['(c) 2022.

Therefore, eradicating quiescent CML LSCs is a major goal in CML therapy. Here, using a G0 marker (G0M), we narrow down CML LSCs as G0M- and CD27- double positive cells among the conventional CML LSCs. Whole transcriptome analysis reveals NF-kappaB activation via inflammatory signals in imatinib-insensitive quiescent CML LSCs. Blocking NF-kappaB signals by inhibitors of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1/4 (IRAK1/4 inhibitors) together with imatinib eliminates mouse and human CML LSCs. Intriguingly, IRAK1/4 inhibitors attenuate PD-L1 expression on CML LSCs, and blocking PD-L1 together with imatinib also effectively eliminates CML LSCs in the presence of T cell immunity. Thus, IRAK1/4 inhibitors can eliminate CML LSCs through inhibiting NF-kappaB activity and reducing PD-L1 expression. Collectively, the combination of TKIs and IRAK1/4 inhibitors is an attractive strategy to achieve a radical cure of CML.",['(c) 2022.

It reportedly causes pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and the dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial cells. However, no report has yet discussed the relationship between dasatinib-induced PAH and drug dose. We therefore investigated the incidence of dasatinib-induced PAH and the relationship between dasatinib-PAH and drug dose in consecutive patients with CML and Ph+ ALL who took dasatinib. Methods The clinical data of 128 patients with CML (94 patients) and Ph+ ALL (34 patients) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients All patients (>17 years old) who received dasatinib from January 2009 to March 2020 at Jichi Medical University (Tochigi, Japan) were included. Patients who transferred within one month of starting dasatinib administration were excluded. Results Four (4.3%) and three (8.8%) patients developed pulmonary hypertension (PH), which was considered present when the transtricuspid pressure gradient was >/=40 mmHg, in the CML and ALL groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the PH onset and the administration period, cumulative dose, or daily dose of dasatinib. PH occurred in seven patients (5.5%), and the period from the start of dasatinib administration to the PH onset ranged from 7 to 39 (median: 28) months. No patients died from PH in either group. Conclusion Dasatinib-induced PAH does not occur time- or dose-dependently. When administering dasatinib, cardiovascular diagnostic modalities should be routinely checked, and PAH occurrence should be promptly detected.",,"['Kubota, Kana', 'Imai, Yasushi', 'Oh, Iekuni', 'Ueno, Shuichi', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Kario, Kazuomi']","['Kubota K', 'Imai Y', 'Oh I', 'Ueno S', 'Kanda Y', 'Kario K']","['Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacology, Jichi Medical University, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Japan.', 'Ueno Clinic, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220113,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2022/01/14 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2022/01/13 05:57'],"['2022/01/13 05:57 [entrez]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.8392-21 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Intern Med. 2022 Jan 13. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.8392-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite consolidation therapies with arsenic trioxide, daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside (AraC), and gemtuzumab ozogamicin as well as maintenance therapy with tamibarotene, the patient experienced a relapse 6 months after the start of maintenance therapy. She was then given re-induction therapy with idarubicin+AraC and high-dose AraC, but remission was not achieved. Since the coordination of the unrelated donor had been completed at this time, she then underwent bone marrow transplantation with pre-conditioning of 4 Gy total body irradiation, fludarabine, and busulfan.

In other hematologic malignancies, therapeutic advances resulted in significant improvement over time in survival of patients relapsing after transplant. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared outcomes at European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) participating centers of 899 adult patients with Ph(+) ALL who relapsed between 2000 and 2019 after allo-HCT performed in first complete remission. Median follow-up for alive patients was 56 months. RESULTS: Overall, 116 patients relapsed between 2000 and 2004, 225 between 2005 and 2009, 294 between 2010 and 2014, and 264 between 2015 and 2019. Patient and transplant characteristics were similar over the four time periods except for a progressive increase in unrelated donors, peripheral blood stem cells, reduced intensity conditioning, and in vivo T-cell depletion and a progressive decrease in total body irradiation. The 2-year overall survival (OS) after relapse increased from 27.8% for patients relapsing between 2000 and 2004 to 54.8% for 2015 and 2019 (P = 0.001). A second allo-HCT within 2 years after relapse was performed in 13.9% of patients resulting in a 2-year OS of 35.9%. In multivariate analysis, OS from relapse was positively affected by a longer time from transplant to relapse and the year of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a major progressive improvement in OS from posttransplant relapse for patients with Ph(+) ALL over the years, likely multifactorial including transplant-related factors, posttransplant salvage, and improvement in supportive care. These large-scale real-world data can serve as a benchmark for future studies in this setting.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Niittyvuopio, Riitta', 'Balsat, Marie', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Grassi, Anna', 'Reinhardt, Hans Christian', 'Lenhoff, Stig', 'Jindra, Pavel', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Abou Dalle, Iman', 'Stadler, Michael', 'Lioure, Bruno', 'Ceballos, Patrice', 'Brissot, Eolia', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Bazarbachi A', 'Labopin M', 'Aljurf M', 'Niittyvuopio R', 'Balsat M', 'Blaise D', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Grassi A', 'Reinhardt HC', 'Lenhoff S', 'Jindra P', 'Passweg J', 'Abou Dalle I', 'Stadler M', 'Lioure B', 'Ceballos P', 'Brissot E', 'Giebel S', 'Nagler A', 'Schmid C', 'Mohty M']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon. bazarbac@aub.edu.lb.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, APHP, UMR-S938, Paris, France."", 'King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre Oncology (Section of Adult Haematolgy/BMT), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Haematology, Lyon Sud Hospital, Rhone, France.', 'Programme de Transplantation and Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'CHU de Lille, univ Lille, INSERM U1286, Infinite, Lille, France.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Bergamo, Italy.', 'University Hospital, Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Skanes University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Charles University Hospital, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Hannover Medical School, Department of Haematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover, Germany.', 'Nouvel Hopital Civil, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Haematology, CHU Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, APHP, UMR-S938, Paris, France."", 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Oncohematology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute, Oncology Center, Gliwice Branch, Wybrzeze Armii Kr, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Universitatsklinikum Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, APHP, UMR-S938, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220112,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,,2022/01/14 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2022/01/13 05:56'],"['2021/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/13 05:56 [entrez]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-21-2675 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-2675 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Clin Cancer Res. 2022 Jan 12. pii: 1078-0432.CCR-21-2675. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-2675.,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5706-9349', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8415-7069']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report the development of a recombinant Ig fragment, designated IgCw-gammaepsilonkappa, as an alternative reagent to human IgE. IgCw-gammaepsilonkappa ( approximately 130 kDa) comprises two hybrid constant H chain regions (Cgamma1-Cepsilon2-4, each approximately 53 kDa) and two constant kappa L chains (Ckappa, each approximately 12 kDa) and lacks a V domain. The presence of Cgamma1 instead of Cepsilon1 within the H chain increased the production yield and facilitated assembly of the H and L chains. IgCw-gammaepsilonkappa was produced in cultured human embryonic kidney 293F cells, with a yield of approximately 27 mg/l. IgCw-gammaepsilonkappa bound to human FcepsilonRIalphaRs expressed on the surface of rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells. A beta-hexosaminidase release assay revealed that the biological activity of IgCw-gammaepsilonkappa was comparable with that of IgE. The IgE concentration measured using IgCw-gammaepsilonkappa as a standard was similar to that measured using IgE as a standard. These results suggest that the IgCw-gammaepsilonkappa molecule retains the basic characteristics of IgE, but does not cross-react with Ags, making it an alternative to the IgE isotype references used in a variety of immunological assays.","['Copyright (c) 2022 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Kim, Minjae', 'Lee, Jeonghyun', 'Choi, Juho', 'Seo, Youngsil', 'Park, Gyeseo', 'Jeon, Jinah', 'Jeon, Yerin', 'Lee, Mi-Gi', 'Kwon, Myung-Hee']","['Kim M', 'Lee J', 'Choi J', 'Seo Y', 'Park G', 'Jeon J', 'Jeon Y', 'Lee MG', 'Kwon MH']","['Department of Microbiology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Graduate School, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea; and.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Graduate School, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea; and.', 'Department of Microbiology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Graduate School, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea; and.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Graduate School, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea; and.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Graduate School, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea; and.', 'Bio-Center, Gyeonggido Business and Science Accelerator, Suwon, South Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea; kwonmh@ajou.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Graduate School, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea; and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220112,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,,2022/01/14 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2022/01/13 05:56'],"['2021/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/13 05:56 [entrez]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.2100576 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.2100576 [doi]']",aheadofprint,J Immunol. 2022 Jan 12. pii: jimmunol.2100576. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2100576.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although inhibitors targeting signal proteins involved in B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling constitute an important part of the current therapeutic protocols for CLL patients, the exact role of BCR signaling, as compared to genetic aberration, in the development and progression of CLL is controversial. To investigate whether BCR expression per se is pivotal for the development and maintenance of CLL B cells, we used the TCL1 mouse model. By ablating the BCR in CLL cells from TCL1 transgenic mice, we show that CLL cells cannot survive without BCR signaling and are lost within eight weeks in diseased mice. Furthermore, we tested whether mutations augmenting B cell signaling influence the course of CLL development and its severity. The Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is an integral part of the BCR signaling machinery and its activity is indispensable for B cell survival. It is negatively regulated by the lipid phosphatase PTEN, whose loss mimics PI3K pathway activation. Herein, we show that PTEN has a key regulatory function in the development of CLL, as deletion of the Pten gene resulted in greatly accelerated onset of the disease. By contrast, deletion of the gene TP53, which encodes the tumor suppressor p53 and is highly mutated in CLL, did not accelerate disease development, confirming that development of CLL was specifically triggered by augmented PI3K activity through loss of PTEN and suggesting that CLL driver consequences most likely affect BCR signaling. Moreover, we could show that in human CLL patient samples, 64% and 81% of CLL patients with a mutated and unmutated IgH VH, respectively, show downregulated PTEN protein expression in CLL B cells if compared to healthy donor B cells. Importantly, we found that B cells derived from CLL patients had higher expression levels of the miRNA-21 and miRNA-29, which suppresses PTEN translation, compared to healthy donors. The high levels of miRNA-29 might be induced by increased PAX5 expression of the B-CLL cells. We hypothesize that downregulation of PTEN by increased expression levels of miR-21, PAX5 and miR-29 could be a novel mechanism of CLL tumorigenesis that is not established yet. Together, our study demonstrates the pivotal role for BCR signaling in CLL development and deepens our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the genesis of CLL and for the development of new treatment strategies.",,"['Schmid, Vera Kristin', 'Khadour, Ahmad', 'Ahmed, Nabil', 'Brandl, Carolin', 'Nitschke, Lars', 'Rajewsky, Klaus', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Hobeika, Elias']","['Schmid VK', 'Khadour A', 'Ahmed N', 'Brandl C', 'Nitschke L', 'Rajewsky K', 'Jumaa H', 'Hobeika E']","['Institute of Immunology, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Uniklinik RWTH Aachen.', 'Division of Genetics, Department of Biology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Genetics, Department of Biology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany. elias.hobeika@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220113,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,,2022/01/14 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2022/01/13 02:55'],"['2021/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2022/01/13 02:55 [entrez]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2021.279924 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2022 Jan 13. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2021.279924.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutations (P760L and G761V) are located within the regulatory pseudokinase domain and lead to constitutive activation of TYK2. We demonstrate the transformation capacity of TYK2P760L in hematopoietic cell systems including primary bone marrow cells. In vivo engraftment of TYK2P760L-expressing cell lines led to development of leukemia. A kinase inhibitor screen uncovered that oncogenic TYK2 acts synergistically with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and CDK4/6 pathways. Accordingly, the TYK2-specific inhibitor deucravacitinib (BMS986165) reduces cell viability of TYK2P760Ltransformed cell models and ex vivo cultured TYK2P760L-mutated patient-derived xenograft cells most efficiently when combined with mTOR or CDK4/6 inhibitors.

Protein expression and activation levels were measured in 500 bulk leukemic patient samples and 30 control CD34+ samples, using the reverse phase protein arrays with 296 strictly validated antibodies. The multi-step ""MetaGalaxy"" analysis methodology was applied and identified nine protein expression signatures (PrSIG), based on strong recurrent protein expression patterns. PrSIGs were associated with cytogenetics and mutational state, and with both favorable or unfavorable prognosis. Analysis based on treatment (i.e., ADE vs. ADE plus bortezomib (ADEB)) identified three PrSIGs that did better with ADEB vs. ADE. When PrSIGs were studied in the context of genetic subgroups, PrSIGs were independently prognostic after multivariate analysis, suggesting a potential value for proteomics in combination with current classification systems.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Large Belgian Malinois (BGM) and German Shepherd Dog (GSD) breeds (n=27), aged from 1 to 12 years, were used for this study. Peripheral bloods were obtained by venepuncture, then plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated immediately. Six myokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-15, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8), and GDF11 were measured from plasma and CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocytes ratio were measured from PBMC. These parameters were then tested with age prediction models to find the best fit model. RESULTS: We found that the T-lymphocyte ratio (CD4+/CD8+) was significantly correlated with age (r=0.46, p=0.016). Among the six myokines, only GDF8 showed a significant correlation with age (r=0.52, p=0.005). Interestingly, these two markers showed better correlations in male dogs than females, and BGM breed than GSD. Using these two age biomarkers, we could obtain the best fit in a quadratic linear mixed model (r=0.77, p=3x10(-6)). CONCLUSIONS: Age prediction is a challenging task because of complication with biological age.

In spite of the most recent discoveries about the molecular landscape of this disease, the treatment of elderly and unfit young patients continues to be a great challenge. The hypomethylating agents (HMA) still represent an effective therapeutic option for these categories, especially for the low-risk subgroups. We report the case of a young patient with NPM1mut-AML who underwent a first cycle of intensive induction treatment, achieving a complete remission, but suffered from a serious life-threatening neurologic toxicity. Due to the ineligibility to further lines of intensive chemotherapy, we decided to consolidate the response with azacitidine, administered according to the regular schedule. The minimal residual disease (MRD), monitored through the NPM1 mutation at diagnosis, progressively decreased and became undetectable after 36 cycles of hypomethylating therapy. After 1 year from discontinuation of azacitidine, MRD remains undetectable. Therefore, HMA might still represent a feasible and effective option for patients with low-risk AML, especially when the standard chemotherapy is not indicated, or as maintenance therapy in nontransplantable patients.","['(c) 2022 S.

However, there have been no studies comparing HRD HSCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT with antithymocyte globulin, using similar busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning regimen in pediatric acute leukemia. Here, we compared the outcomes in children and adolescents with high-risk acute leukemia after HRD HSCT with PTCy (n=35) and MUD HSCT (n=45) after targeted busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning using intensive pharmacokinetic monitoring. The median follow-up times of the HRD and MUD groups were 3.7 and 4.6 years, respectively. No engraftment failure was observed in both groups. The cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV (34.3% versus 48.9%, p=0.142), grades III-IV (2.9% vs. 8.9%, p=0.272), moderate to severe chronic GVHD (11.4% vs. 18.3%, p=0.417), relapse (25.6% vs. 28.0%, p=0.832), and non-relapse mortality (0% vs. 2.2%, p=0.420) were not significantly different between the two groups. The 3-year severe chronic GVHD-free/relapse-free (GRFS), leukemia-free (LFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in the HRD and MUD groups were 62.9% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 45.8%, 80.0%) versus 49.8% (95% CI, 34.9%, 64.7%; p=0.318), 74.4% (95% CI, 58.7%, 90.1%) versus 67.5% (95% CI, 53.4%, 81.6%; p=0.585), and 88.6% (95% CI, 78.0%, 99.2%) versus 83.7% (95% CI, 72.5%, 94.9%; p=0.968), respectively. In a subgroup analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (HRD, n=17; MUD, n=26), the 3-year GRFS, LFS, and OS rates of the HRD and MUD groups were 49.4% (95% CI, 24.3%, 74.5%) versus 39.5% (95% CI, 19.7%, 59.3%; p=0.601), 61.8% (95% CI, 37.5%, 86.1%) versus 63.6% (95% CI, 44.4%, 82.8%; p=0.872), and 82.4% (95% CI, 64.4%, 100%) versus 84.2% (95% CI, 70.1%, 98.3%; p=0.445), respectively. In acute myeloid leukemia patients (HRD, n=16; MUD, n=16), the 3-year GRFS, LFS, and OS rates of the HRD and MUD groups were 80.8% (95% CI, 61.2%, 100%) versus 61.9% (95% CI, 37.8%, 86.0%; p=0.326), 87.1% (95% CI, 70.2%, 100%) versus 73.9% (95% CI, 51.8%, 96.0%; p=0.478), and 93.8% (95% CI, 81.8%, 100%) versus 85.6% (95% CI, 67.0%, 100%; p=0.628), respectively. Although the difference was not statistically significant and the number of patients was small, the promising outcomes of HRD HSCT in AML patients were encouraging.

Here, we use domain-focused CRISPR screening and identify the nuclear phosphatase SCP4 as a dependency in AML, yet this enzyme is dispensable in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Using CRISPR exon scanning and gene complementation assays, we show that the catalytic function of SCP4 is essential in AML. Through mass spectrometry analysis of affinity-purified complexes, we identify the kinase paralogs STK35 and PDIK1L as binding partners and substrates of the SCP4 phosphatase domain. We show that STK35 and PDIK1L function catalytically and redundantly in the same pathway as SCP4 to maintain AML proliferation and to support amino acid biosynthesis and transport. We provide evidence that SCP4 regulates STK35/PDIK1L through two distinct mechanisms: catalytic removal of inhibitory phosphorylation and by promoting kinase stability.

To address this question, we specifically delete Mek1 in hematopoietic cells in the Mek2 null background. Characterization of an allelic series of Mek mutants reveals the presence of distinct degrees of spontaneous B cell activation, which are inversely proportional to the levels of MEK proteins and ERK activation. While Mek1 and Mek2 null mutants have a normal lifespan, 1Mek1 and 1Mek2 mutants retaining only one functional Mek1 or Mek2 allele in hematopoietic cell lineages die from glomerulonephritis and lymphoproliferative disorders, respectively. This establishes that the fine-tuning of the ERK/MAPK pathway is critical to regulate B and T cell activation and function and that each MEK isoform plays distinct roles during lymphocyte activation and disease development.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for CML inhibit BCR-ABL1 by competitively targeting its adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site, which significantly improves patient outcomes. However, resistance to and intolerance of TKIs remains a clinical challenge. Asciminib is a promising investigational agent in development that allosterically targets BCR-ABL1 in a non-ATP-competitive manner. It binds to the ABL1 myristoyl-binding pocket and is effective against most ABL1 kinase domain mutations that confer resistance to ATP-competitive TKIs, including the T315I mutation.

How oncogenic NOTCH1 signaling launches a leukemia-prone chromatin landscape during T-ALL initiation is unknown. Here we demonstrate an essential role for the high-mobility-group transcription factor Tcf1 in orchestrating chromatin accessibility and topology allowing aberrant Notch1 signaling to convey its oncogenic function. Although essential, Tcf1 is not sufficient to initiate leukemia. The formation of a leukemia-prone epigenetic landscape at the distal Notch1-regulated Myc enhancer, which is fundamental to this disease, is Tcf1-dependent and occurs within the earliest progenitor stage even before cells adopt a T lymphocyte or leukemic fate. Moreover, we discovered a unique evolutionarily conserved Tcf1-regulated enhancer element in the distal Myc-enhancer, which is important for the transition of pre-leukemic cells to full-blown disease.",['Copyright (c) 2022 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Antoszewski, Mateusz', 'Fournier, Nadine', 'Ruiz Buendia, Gustavo A', 'Lourenco, Joao', 'Liu, Yuanlong', 'Sugrue, Tara', 'Dubey, Christelle', 'Nkosi, Marianne', 'Pritchard, Colin E J', 'Huijbers, Ivo J', 'Segat, Gabriela C', 'Alonso-Moreno, Sandra', 'Serracanta, Elisabeth', 'Belver, Laura', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A', 'Ciriello, Giovanni', 'Weng, Andrew P', 'Koch, Ute', 'Radtke, Freddy']","['Antoszewski M', 'Fournier N', 'Ruiz Buendia GA', 'Lourenco J', 'Liu Y', 'Sugrue T', 'Dubey C', 'Nkosi M', 'Pritchard CEJ', 'Huijbers IJ', 'Segat GC', 'Alonso-Moreno S', 'Serracanta E', 'Belver L', 'Ferrando AA', 'Ciriello G', 'Weng AP', 'Koch U', 'Radtke F']","['Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Cancer Center Leman, Switzerland.', 'Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI-AvL), Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Netherlands.', '7Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Spain.', '8Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Columbia University, New York, New York, United States.', 'Swiss Cancer Center Leman (SCCL), Switzerland.', 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'EPFL SV ISREC, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ecole Polytechnique Fedlrale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220112,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2022/01/13 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2022/01/12 17:31'],"['2021/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/12 17:31 [entrez]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['483447 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021012077 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2022 Jan 12. pii: 483447. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021012077.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7651-0547', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4935-1480', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2483-024X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2522-8370', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7848-9377', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9161-079X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6670-085X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0167-1215', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7493-7072', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7914-7061']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed enhanced whole-genome sequencing to characterize clonal evolution, and deep-coverage single-cell RNA sequencing on the same samples, which yielded 142,642 high-quality cells for analysis. Identifying expressed mutations in individual cells enabled us to discriminate between normal and AML cells, to identify coordinated changes in the genome and transcriptome, and to identify subclone-specific cell states. We quantified the coevolution of genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity during AML progression, and found that transcriptional changes were significantly correlated with genetic changes. However, transcriptional adaptation sometimes occurred independently, suggesting that clonal evolution does not represent all relevant biological changes. In three cases, we identified cells at diagnosis that likely seeded the relapse. Finally, these data revealed a conserved relapse-enriched leukemic cell state bearing markers of stemness, quiescence, and adhesion. SIGNIFICANCE: These data enabled us to identify a relapse-enriched leukemic cell state with distinct transcriptional properties. Detailed case-by-case analyses elucidated the complex ways in which the AML genome, transcriptome, and immune microenvironment interact to evade chemotherapy.

Here we performed targeted DNA sequencing as well as transcriptional and proteomic profiling of paired leukemia-infiltrating cells in the bone marrow (BM) and CNS of xenografts. Genes governing mRNA translation were upregulated in CNS leukemia, and subclonal genetic profiling confirmed this in both BM-concordant and BM-discordant CNS mutational populations. CNS leukemia cells were exquisitely sensitive to the translation inhibitor omacetaxine mepesuccinate, which reduced xenograft leptomeningeal disease burden. Proteomics demonstrated greater abundance of secreted proteins in CNS-infiltrating cells, including complement component 3 (C3), and drug targeting of C3 influenced CNS disease in xenografts. CNS-infiltrating cells also exhibited selection for stemness traits and metabolic reprogramming. Overall, our study identifies targeting of mRNA translation as a potential therapeutic approach for B-ALL leptomeningeal disease. SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer metastases are often driven by distinct subclones with unique biological properties. Here we show that in B-ALL CNS disease, the leptomeningeal environment selects for cells with unique functional dependencies. Pharmacologic inhibition of mRNA translation signaling treats CNS disease and offers a new therapeutic approach for this condition.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) MRD detection >0 in bone marrow (BM) was highly associated with relapse. B-cell recovery [signifying loss of functional chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells] within the first year of treatment was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) for relapse of 4.5 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.03-9.97; P < 0.001]. Multivariate analysis at day 28 showed independent associations of BMNGS-MRD >0 (HR = 4.87; 95% CI, 2.18-10.8; P < 0.001) and B-cell recovery (HR = 3.33; 95% CI, 1.44-7.69; P = 0.005) with relapse. By 3 months, the BMNGS-MRD HR increased to 12 (95% CI, 2.87-50; P < 0.001), whereas B-cell recovery was not independently predictive (HR = 1.27; 95% CI, 0.33-4.79; P = 0.7). Relapses occurring with persistence of B-cell aplasia were largely CD19(-) (23/25: 88%). Detectable BMNGS-MRD reliably predicts risk with sufficient time to consider approaches to relapse prevention such as hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or second CAR-T cell infusion. SIGNIFICANCE: Detectable disease by BMNGS-MRD with or without B-cell aplasia is highly predictive of relapse after tisagenlecleucel therapy for ALL. Clonotypic rearrangements used to follow NGS-MRD did not change after loss of CD19 or lineage switch. High-risk patients identified by these biomarkers may benefit from HCT or investigational cell therapies.See related commentary by Ghorashian and Bartram, p. 2.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1.",['(c)2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Pulsipher, Michael A', 'Han, Xia', 'Maude, Shannon L', 'Laetsch, Theodore W', 'Qayed, Muna', 'Rives, Susana', 'Boyer, Michael W', 'Hiramatsu, Hidefumi', 'Yanik, Gregory A', 'Driscoll, Tim', 'Myers, G Doug', 'Bader, Peter', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Buechner, Jochen', 'Stefanski, Heather E', 'Kalfoglou, Creton', 'Nguyen, Kevin', 'Waldron, Edward R', 'Thudium Mueller, Karen', 'Maier, Harald J', 'Kari, Gabor', 'Grupp, Stephan A']","['Pulsipher MA', 'Han X', 'Maude SL', 'Laetsch TW', 'Qayed M', 'Rives S', 'Boyer MW', 'Hiramatsu H', 'Yanik GA', 'Driscoll T', 'Myers GD', 'Bader P', 'Baruchel A', 'Buechner J', 'Stefanski HE', 'Kalfoglou C', 'Nguyen K', 'Waldron ER', 'Thudium Mueller K', 'Maier HJ', 'Kari G', 'Grupp SA']","[""Section of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Children's Hospital Los Angeles Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California. michael.pulsipher@hci.utah.edu."", 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, New Jersey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, Center for Childhood Cancer Research and Cancer Immunotherapy Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, Center for Childhood Cancer Research and Cancer Immunotherapy Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Pediatric Hematology, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu de Barcelona, Fundacio Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto City, Japan.', ""Michigan Medicine Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, C.S.

In the treatment of chronic GVHD, skin directed therapy, systemic corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors (such as cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus), rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) and ruxolitinib are used. CASE REPORT: We present an 18 year old male with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute B lymphoblastic leukemia, treated with allogeneic HCT from a full matched sibling donor. The patient had grade 2 chronic cutaneous GVHD resistant to corticosteroids, CsA, MMF, and ECP treatment. Three months after initiation of ruxolitinib therapy, the patient developed skin ulcers on his lower extremities. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: The biopsy revealed that the changes were caused by the drug reactions. We suspected ruxolitinib as the likely cause of these ulcerative lesions after evaluating the adverse drug reaction probability scale. The adverse drug score was 4, therefore, ruxolitinib treatment was discontinued. Ulcerative lesions fully recovered after 4 weeks of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Ruxolitinib is used in the treatment of chronic GVHD that has been resistant to steroids and other salvage therapies. In our case, ruxolitinib was used as a salvage therapy in a patient who had refractory chronic skin GVHD. Ruxolitinib-related skin lesions with ulcers of lower extremities and whole body erythematous skin lesions were reported previously in patients with myelofibrosis. The pathophysiology of ruxolitinib related skin ulcers is unknown. Skin changes of patients using ruxolitinib should be closely monitored, and newly developing lesions should be suspected of being drug-related and biopsied.",,"['Aslan Candir, Burcu', 'Yigenoglu, Tugce Nur', 'Kizil Cakar, Merih', 'Dal, Mehmet Sinan', 'Altuntas, Fevzi']","['Aslan Candir B', 'Yigenoglu TN', 'Kizil Cakar M', 'Dal MS', 'Altuntas F']","['146995Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', '146995Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', '146995Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', '146995Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', '146995Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220112,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Skin ulcers', 'chronic cutaneous GVHD', 'ruxolitinib']",2022/01/13 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2022/01/12 12:21'],"['2022/01/12 12:21 [entrez]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211073881 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2022 Jan 12:10781552211073881. doi: 10.1177/10781552211073881.,,,10781552211073881,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3386-8984', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4204-7515', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5994-2735']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incorporation of DOTAP as the lipid component of the PLA nanoparticles enhanced the release of the immuno-nanoparticles from the endosomes into the cytosol compared to nanoparticles made from PLA alone. Systemic delivery of these anti-CD7 immuno-nanoparticles into humanized CD7 transgenic mice resulted in localization in the spleen, enhanced uptake into CD7-expressing splenocytes, and release of low amounts of reporter mRNA for translation.

Negative imprints were prepared from layers of 15 mum polymeric microbeads closely matching the size of cultured human leukemic cells (HL60). We replicated these imprints on a large scale with UV curable polyurethane resin using nanoimprinting lithography. The imprints were functionalized with branched polyethylene imine (bPEI) and passivated by Poloxamer 407 to promote a weak attraction toward cells. When a matching cell fits into an imprint cavity, its contact area with the imprint is maximized, which amplifies the attraction and the binding selectivity. We tested these imprints specificity for depleting myeloblasts from a mixture with healthy human PBMCs in a cell recognition chromatography setup hosting the imprint. The mixture of fixed HL60/PBMCs ratio was circulated over the imprint and at each step the selectivity toward HL60 was assessed by flow cytometry. The role of the imprint length, flow rate, channel depth, and the bPEI coating concentration were examined. The results show that HL60 cells, closely matching the imprint cavities, get trapped on the imprint, while the smaller PBMCs are carried away by the drag force of the flow. Lower flow rates, longer imprints, and interim channel depth favor HL60 specific retention. The bPEI concentration higher than 1 wt % on the imprint made it less selective toward the HL60 because of indiscriminate attraction with all cells. Particle imprint based cell recognition chromatography was able to achieve selective myeloblast depletion from initial 11.7% HL60 (88.3% PBMC) to less than 1.3% HL60 for 3 h of circulation. The cell recognition chromatography with size-matched microbead imprints can be employed as an efficient cell separation technique and potentially lead to alternative therapies for myeloblasts removal from peripheral blood of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['Chester, Rosie', 'Das, Anupam A K', 'Medlock, Jevan', 'Nees, Dieter', 'Allsup, David J', 'Madden, Leigh A', 'Paunov, Vesselin N']","['Chester R', 'Das AAK', 'Medlock J', 'Nees D', 'Allsup DJ', 'Madden LA', 'Paunov VN']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull, HU67RX, U.K.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull, HU67RX, U.K.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull, HU67RX, U.K.', 'Joanneum Research FmbH, Leonhardstrasse 59, 8010 Graz, Austria.', 'Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull, HU67RX, U.K.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull, HU67RX, U.K.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull, HU67RX, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200117,United States,ACS Appl Bio Mater,ACS applied bio materials,101729147,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['HL60', 'PBMC', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell recognition', 'chromatography', 'microbeads', 'particle imprints']",2020/02/17 00:00,2020/02/17 00:01,['2022/01/12 12:17'],"['2022/01/12 12:17 [entrez]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/17 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/acsabm.9b00770 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Appl Bio Mater. 2020 Feb 17;3(2):789-800. doi: 10.1021/acsabm.9b00770.

BACKGROUND: PR platelets are increasing in use as standard blood products. However, few randomised trials have evaluated their impact on bleeding control or prevention. Furthermore, PR platelets recirculate less than untreated platelets. METHODS: A subgroup study of the randomised clinical trial EFFIPAP compared three arms of platelet preparations (PR: P-PRP/PAS, additive solution: P-PAS and plasma P-P arms respectively). The subgroup of acute leukaemia patients, in their chemotherapy induction phase, included 392 patients (133 P-PRP/PAS arm, 132 P-PAS arm and 130 P-P arm). Blood requirements were analysed across over periods of 7 days. RESULTS: The number of platelet transfusions per week was significantly higher in the P-PRP/PAS group 2.3 [1.6-3.3] compared to the control groups 1.9 [1.3-2.8] and 2.0 [1.3-3.0] for P-P and P-PAS groups respectively (p < 0.0001). However, the total number of platelets transfused per week was not different. The number of red blood cell concentrates (RBC) transfusion per week did not differ either. CONCLUSION: In a homogeneous group of patients, platelet pathogen reduction resulted in an increased number of platelet units transfused per week while having no impact on the total number of platelets transfused or the number of RBC transfusion; resulting to an average requirement of 2 RBC and 2-3 platelets transfusions per week of marrow aplasia.",['(c) 2022 British Blood Transfusion Society.'],"['Garban, Frederic', 'Vilotitch, Antoine', 'Tiberghien, Pierre', 'Bosson, Jean Luc']","['Garban F', 'Vilotitch A', 'Tiberghien P', 'Bosson JL']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Grenoble Alpes (Grenoble Alps University Hospital), Grenoble, France."", 'CNRS, UMR 5525 Translationnal innovation in Medicine and Complexity, Universite Grenoble Alpes, La Tronche, France.', ""Cellule d'ingenierie des donnees, Centre d'Investigation Clinique 1406 - Innovation Technologique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Grenoble Alpes (Grenoble Alps University Hospital), Grenoble, France."", 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, La Plaine Saint-Denis, Saint-Denis, France.', 'INSERM UMR 1098 RIGHT, Universite de Franche-Comte, Etablissement Francais du Sang, Besancon, France.', 'CNRS, UMR 5525 Translationnal innovation in Medicine and Complexity, Universite Grenoble Alpes, La Tronche, France.', ""Cellule d'ingenierie des donnees, Centre d'Investigation Clinique 1406 - Innovation Technologique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Grenoble Alpes (Grenoble Alps University Hospital), Grenoble, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220112,England,Transfus Med,"Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)",9301182,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['pathogen reduction', 'platelets transfusion', 'randomised clinical trial', 'transfusion practice']",2022/01/13 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2022/01/12 08:52'],"['2021/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/12 08:52 [entrez]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tme.12848 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Transfus Med. 2022 Jan 12. doi: 10.1111/tme.12848.,,,,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3981-0839'],,,,,['EFFIPAP Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) and magnetite folate core shell (MFCS) on leukemic and hepatocarcinoma cell cultures as well as their effect on the animal model of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). Through current study nanoparticles were synthesized, characterized by various techniques, and their properties were studied to confirm their nanostructure. Invivo study, nanoparticles were evaluated to inspect their cytotoxic activity against SNU-182 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), K562 (human leukemia), and THLE2 (human normal epithelial liver) cells via MTT test. Apoptotic signaling proteins Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 expression were inspected through RT-PCR method. A cytotoxic effect of MNPs and MFCS was detected in previous cell cultures. Moreover, the apoptosis was identified through significant up-regulation of caspase-3, with Bcl-2 down-regulation. Invitro study, AML was induced in rats by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea followed by oral treatment with MNPS and MFCS. Biochemical indices such as aspartate and alanine amino transferases, and lactate dehydrogenase activities, uric acid, complete blood count, and Beta -2-microglubulin were assessed in serum. Immunophenotyping for CD34 and CD38 detection was performed. Liver, kidney, and bone marrow were microscopically examined. Bcl-2 promoter methylation, and mRNA levels were examined. Although, both MNPs and MFCS depict amelioration in biochemical parameters, MFCS alleviated them toward normal control. Anticancer activity of MNPs and MFCS was approved especially for AML.

CASE REPORT: This case report presents two cases of male geriatric patients, both referred from primary care in rural areas and received at an urban clinic in a tertiary care hospital on separate instances. The first patient complained of low-grade fever (on/off), generalized body aches, rapid weight loss and shortness of breath for the last 2 months. The second patient arrived pale looking with symptoms of generalized body aches, dizziness and anorexia. Both patients were diagnosed to have aCML according to the World Health organization criteria. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Both the patients were from a low economic bracket and were treated with Hydroxyurea a relatively economic medicine successfully. The follow-up lasted for 12 months in both cases. No progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or relapse was observed. DISCUSSION: This case report shows the promising results of Hydroxyurea in treating aCML and can be a cost effective alternate to other expensive treatments (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) and expensive medicines in lower and middle-income countries especially for resource-limited patients. These two cases show promising evidence for further studies to evaluate and conduct pharmaco-economic evaluations as well as clinical trials to compare hydroxyurea with other available alternative treatments for an affordable therapeutic option towards prevention of relapse and disease free survival after aCML.",,"['Hassan, Zair', 'Iqbal, Ayesha', 'Zahoor, Saiqa', 'Ali, Iftikhar', 'Iqbal, Muhammad Mamoon', 'Bibi, Rashida']","['Hassan Z', 'Iqbal A', 'Zahoor S', 'Ali I', 'Iqbal MM', 'Bibi R']","['Department of Cardiology, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'Division of Pharmacy Practice and Policy, School of Pharmacy, University of Nottingham, University park Campus, Nottingham, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'Paraplegic Center, Hayatabad, Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'Internal Medicine trainee, University Hospitals of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Lecturer in Clinical Pharmacy, 469633Abbottabad University of Science and Technology, Abbottabad, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220112,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['aCML', 'cost effective', 'hydroxyurea', 'leukaemia']",2022/01/13 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2022/01/12 08:43'],"['2022/01/12 08:43 [entrez]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211073518 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2022 Jan 12:10781552211073518. doi: 10.1177/10781552211073518.,,,10781552211073518,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9789-0270', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7282-471X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron has improved the rates of CINV but, unfortunately, up to 30% of patients do not obtain satisfactory control. This study examined whether genetic variations in a relevant drug-metabolizing enzyme (CYP2D6), transporter (ABCB1), or receptor (5-HT3) were associated with ondansetron failure. METHODS: DNA was extracted from blood and used to genotype: ABCB1 (3435C > T (rs1045642) and G2677A/T (rs2032582)), 5-HT3RB (rs3758987 T > C and rs45460698 (delAAG/dupAAG)), and CYP2D6 variants. Ondansetron failure was determined by review of the medical records and by patient-reported outcomes (PROs). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine patients were approached; 103 consented. Participants were less than 1 to 33 years (mean 6.85). A total of 39.8% was female, 58.3% was White (22.3% Black, 19.4% other), and 24.3% was Hispanic. A majority had leukemia or lymphoma, and 41 (39.8%) met the definition of ondansetron failure. Of variants tested, rs45460698 independently showed a significant difference in risk of ondansetron failure between a mutant (any deletion) and normal allele (p = 0.0281, OR 2.67). Age and BMI were both predictive of ondansetron failure (age > 12 (OR 1.12, p = 0.0012) and higher BMI (OR 1.13, p = 0.0119)). In multivariate analysis, age > 12 was highly predictive of ondansetron failure (OR 7.108, p = 0.0008). rs45460698 was predictive when combined with an increased nausea phenotype variant of rs1045642 (OR 3.45, p = 0.0426). CONCLUSION: Select phenotypes of 5-HT3RB and ABCB1, age, and potentially BMI can help predict increased risk for CINV in a diverse pediatric oncology population.","['(c) 2022.

Attacking the LSC niche in CML may thus be an effective approach to overcome drug resistance. We have recently shown that osteoblasts are a major site of niche-mediated LSC resistance against second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in CML. In the present study, we screened for drugs that are capable of suppressing the growth and viability of osteoblasts and/or other niche cells and can thereby overcome TKI resistance of CML LSC. Proliferation was analyzed by determining (3)H-thymidine uptake in niche-related cells, and apoptosis was measured by Annexin-V/DAPI-staining and flow cytometry. We found that the dual PI3 kinase (PI3K) and mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 and the selective pan-PI3K inhibitor copanlisib suppress proliferation of primary osteoblasts (BEZ235 IC50: 0.05 muM; copanlisib IC50: 0.05 muM), the osteoblast cell line CAL-72 (BEZ235 IC50: 0.5 muM; copanlisib IC50: 1 muM), primary umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells (BEZ235 IC50: 0.5 muM; copanlisib IC50: 0.5 muM), and the vascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 (BEZ235 IC50: 1 muM; copanlisib IC50: 1 muM), whereas no comparable effects were seen with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, we show that BEZ235 and copanlisib cooperate with nilotinib and ponatinib in suppressing proliferation and survival of osteoblasts and endothelial cells. Finally, BEZ235 and copanlisib were found to overcome osteoblast-mediated resistance against nilotinib and ponatinib in K562 cells, KU812 cells and primary CD34(+)/CD38(-) CML LSC. Together, targeting osteoblastic niche cells through PI3K inhibition may be a new effective approach to overcome niche-induced TKI resistance in CML. Whether this approach can be translated into clinical application and can counteract drug resistance of LSC in patients with CML remains to be determined in clinical trials.",['AJCR Copyright (c) 2021.'],"['Filik, Yuksel', 'Bauer, Karin', 'Hadzijusufovic, Emir', 'Haider, Patrick', 'Greiner, Georg', 'Witzeneder, Nadine', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Hohensinner, Philipp J', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Wojta, Johann', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Valent, Peter']","['Filik Y', 'Bauer K', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Haider P', 'Greiner G', 'Witzeneder N', 'Hoermann G', 'Hohensinner PJ', 'Gleixner KV', 'Wojta J', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department/Clinic for Companion Animals and Horses, Clinic for Small Animals, Clinical Unit of Internal Medicine, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Ihr Labor, Medical Diagnostic Laboratories Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cardiovascular Research, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211215,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1 inhibitors', 'CML', 'PI3 kinase', 'drug resistance', 'leukemic stem cells', 'mTOR', 'precision medicine', 'stem cell niche']",2022/01/13 06:00,2022/01/13 06:01,['2022/01/12 06:32'],"['2021/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/12 06:32 [entrez]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2021 Dec 15;11(12):6042-6059. eCollection 2021.,11,12,6042-6059,,,,PMC8727792,,"['The authors declare that they have no study-specific conflict of interest (COI)', 'to disclose.

In the present study, the organic extracts and fractions of various parts of Ornithogalum bungei were investigated for in vitro cytotoxic properties on three human cancer cell lines, hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), prostate cancer (PC3), and leukemia (K562) cells. Methods: The present experimental study was conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, Iran) during 2017-2019. Separately extracted plant materials, including bulbs, stems, and flowers of O. bungei were assessed by the tetrazolium dye-based colorimetric assay (MTT). The selected extracts were submitted to fractionation using vacuum liquid chromatography and after MTT assay, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 (value for each fraction was determined. The data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The cytotoxicity of the bulb's methanol extract and the dichloromethane extract of aerial parts increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In the HepG2 cell line, the best IC50 values of fractions from DCM extracts of aerial parts were determined to be 19.8+/-10.2 microg/mL after 24 hours of exposure and 19.39+/-6.4 microg/mL following 48 hours of exposure. In the PC3 cell line, after 48 hours of exposure, the IC50 values of fractions were unaccountable, while the percentage of inhibition for A6 to A11 in 24 hours of exposure was more than 40 microg/mL.

There is considerable preclinical evidence for potential synergy between PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade and the hypomethylating agents already commonly used for this disease. METHODS: We report here the results of 17 H-0026 (PD-AML, NCT02996474), an investigator sponsored, single-institution, single-arm open-label 10-subject pilot study to test the feasibility of the first-in-human combination of pembrolizumab and decitabine in adult patients with refractory or relapsed AML (R-AML). RESULTS: In this cohort of previously treated patients, this novel combination of anti-PD-1 and hypomethylating therapy was feasible and associated with a best response of stable disease or better in 6 of 10 patients. Considerable immunological changes were identified using T cell receptor beta sequencing as well as single-cell immunophenotypic and RNA expression analyses on sorted CD3+ T cells in patients who developed immune-related adverse events (irAEs) during treatment. Clonal T cell expansions occurred at irAE onset; single-cell sequencing demonstrated that these expanded clones were predominately CD8+ effector memory T cells with high cell surface PD-1 expression and transcriptional profiles indicative of activation and cytotoxicity. In contrast, no such distinctive immune changes were detectable in those experiencing a measurable antileukemic response during treatment. CONCLUSION: Addition of pembrolizumab to 10-day decitabine therapy was clinically feasible in patients with R-AML, with immunological changes from PD-1 blockade observed in patients experiencing irAEs.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

As a consequence, the immune system of the mother may become sensitized to paternal histocompatibility antigens. It has been hypothesized that mother's ""exposure"" to paternal HLA haplotype antigens during pregnancy may affect transplantation outcomes when the mother acts as donor for the child. In T-cell depleted HLA haploidentical hematopoietic transplants, maternal donors have been shown to improve transplantation outcomes (Stern et al. Blood, 2008;112: 2990-2995). OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: The present retrospective multicenter study was conducted on behalf of Cellular Therapy and Immunobiology Working Party of the EBMT. It involved 409 patients (102 pediatric and 307 adult) with acute leukemia who were given HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic transplants. The goal of the study was to evaluate the role of maternal donors in a large cohort of haploidentical transplants. RESULTS: Transplants from maternal donors were associated with lower relapse incidence in T-cell depleted (HR: 2.13 (1.16-3.92), p= 0.018) as well as in a limited series of unmanipulated, in vivo T-cell depleted transplants (HR: 4.15 (0.94-18.35), P=0.06) and also better graft-vs-host disease/relapse-free survival in T-cell depleted transplants (HR: 1.67 (1.02-2.73), p=0.04). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the mother should be the preferred donor in order to provide better graft-vs-host disease/relapse-free survival in T-cell depleted HLA-haploidentical transplants for acute leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2022.

Comprehensive evaluation of the epidemiological characteristics of CLL is warranted, especially in the current context of global population aging. The main objective of this study is evaluating the disease burden of CLL at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2019. As secondary objectives, we studied the influence of demographic factors and performed risk factor analysis. We hope this study could provide evidence for the evaluation of the effectiveness of previous prevention strategies and the formulation of future global health policies. RESULTS: Based on data of CLL between 1990 to 2019 from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019, we depicted the age, gender, and regional structure of the CLL burden population and described the impact of social development on the disease burden of CLL. The distribution and changing trends of attributable risk factors were also investigated. The global burden of CLL has increased dramatically. A high incidence has been achieved in males and elder people. Countries and territories with high social-demographic index (SDI) tended to have higher global burden than low-SDI region. Of risk factors, high body mass index and smoking were the major contributors for CLL-related mortality and disability adjusted life-years (DALYs). CONCLUSION: In summary, the global CLL burden continues to rise over the past 30 years. The relocation of medical resource should be considered on a global scale.",['(c) 2022.

RESULTS: A Resnet101-9 ensemble model was developed for classifying ALL in microscopic images. The proposed Resnet101-9 ensemble model combined the use of the nine trained Resnet-101 models with a majority voting strategy. Each trained Resnet-101 model integrated the well-known pre-trained Resnet-101 model and its algorithm hyperparameters by using transfer learning method to classify ALL in microscopic images. The best combination of algorithm hyperparameters for the pre-trained Resnet-101 model was determined by Taguchi experimental method. The microscopic images used for training of the pre-trained Resnet-101 model and for performance tests of the trained Resnet-101 model were obtained from the C-NMC dataset. In experimental tests of performance, the Resnet101-9 ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 85.11% and an F1-score of 88.94 in classifying ALL in microscopic images. The accuracy of the Resnet101-9 ensemble model was superior to that of the nine trained Resnet-101 individual models. All other performance measures (i.e., precision, recall, and specificity) for the Resnet101-9 ensemble model exceeded those for the nine trained Resnet-101 individual models.

Ninety-six caregivers of youth (diagnosed with leukemia/lymphoma or a solid tumor) reported on their own anxiety/depression symptoms, family functioning, demographic and medical factors, and on their child's generic and cancer-specific QOL shortly after diagnosis (T1) and 6 months later (T2). Caregiver anxiety/depression symptoms were associated with poorer cancer-specific and generic child QOL within and across time points. Family conflict was associated with youth cancer-related QOL at T1. Attendance to caregiver anxiety/depression symptoms and family functioning, beginning early in the cancer trajectory, is an important aspect of family-centered care. Routine psychosocial screening and triage may help identify and intervene to support both caregiver and child psychosocial well-being.",,"['Desjardins, Leandra', 'Solomon, Aden', 'Shama, Wendy', 'Mills, Denise', 'Chung, Joanna', 'Hancock, Kelly', 'Barrera, Maru']","['Desjardins L', 'Solomon A', 'Shama W', 'Mills D', 'Chung J', 'Hancock K', 'Barrera M']","['Charles-Bruneau Cancer Care Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', ""Department of Social Work, Division of Hematology/Oncology, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."", ""Department of Nursing, Division of Hematology/Oncology, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."", ""Department of Psychology, Division of Hematology/Oncology, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."", 'Department of Psychology, Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220112,United States,J Psychosoc Oncol,Journal of psychosocial oncology,8309337,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Pediatric', 'anxiety/depression', 'cancer', 'family', 'quality of life', 'quantitative']",2022/01/13 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2022/01/12 05:36'],"['2022/01/12 05:36 [entrez]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/07347332.2021.2015646 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Psychosoc Oncol. 2022 Jan 12:1-18. doi: 10.1080/07347332.2021.2015646.,,,1-18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seeking to understand the clinical features of this dual hematological neoplasm and exploration of novel therapeutic approaches is warranted. METHODS: The cases of 7 patients diagnosed with both MGUS/MM coexisting with MDS-EB were reported. Moreover, this study reviewed and summarized 34 published cases of MDS including 7 cases of MDS-EB, describing the coexistence with plasma cell disease, and analyzed the clinical characteristics and survival of these cases. RESULTS: In total, 14 cases (7 reported here and 7 previously published) of MGUS/MM coexisting with MDS-EB were analyzed. Of these 14 patients, the median age was 65.5 years. Almost all (85.7%) participants had severe anemia or pancytopenia, and nearly half (42.9%) of the cases developed into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Half of the participants showed osteolytic lesions. The median bone marrow plasma cell count was 23.0%, and the median myeloid blast count was 7.5%. Immunological analysis using flow cytometry confirmed the coexistence of 2 different clones, malignant myeloid clone (CD34+, CD117+, HLA-DR+, CD33+, and CD13+) and plasma clone (CD38+, CD138+, and CD56+). Patients with MGUS/MM and MDS-EB experience very poor therapeutic responses. A great number of patients (64%) were reported to have no response or rapid relapse. The median overall survival (OS) was only 8 months for patients with MGUS/MM and MDS-EB, which was significantly shorter than that of those with MGUS/MM and MDS-other type (median OS of 52 months) (P=0.0009). CONCLUSIONS: Herein, a type of malignant myeloid clone concurrent with plasma clone was reported, without previous exposure to chemotherapy, and poor prognosis of these patients was observed. However, standard treatment methods are still absent, which therefore heightens our awareness of this type of disease and the urgent need for further investigation to prolong survival.",,"['Yan, Wei', 'Qu, Xiao-Yan', 'Li, Hui', 'Li, Ying-Chun', 'Li, Yang', 'Yao, Kun', 'Yang, Wei', 'Wang, Hui-Han']","['Yan W', 'Qu XY', 'Li H', 'Li YC', 'Li Y', 'Yao K', 'Yang W', 'Wang HH']","['Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Ann Palliat Med,Annals of palliative medicine,101585484,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Myelodysplastic syndrome with excess of blasts (MDS-EB)', 'coexistence', 'monoclonal gammopathy of underdetermined significance (MGUS)', 'multiple myeloma (MM)', 'prognosis']",2022/01/13 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2022/01/12 01:01'],"['2021/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/12 01:01 [entrez]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.21037/apm-21-3210 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Palliat Med. 2021 Dec;10(12):12431-12440. doi: 10.21037/apm-21-3210.,10,12,12431-12440,,,,,,,,,,,20220113,,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Multiple Myeloma', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Plasma Cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of hematotoxicity caused by this drug is quite high in Asians even using a standard low dosage regimen. The present study was aimed to elucidate the impact of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), a nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 15 (NUDT15), inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) and ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 4 (ABCC4) polymorphisms on hematotoxicity in pediatric patients who received a standard low starting dose of 6-MP. One hundred and sixty-nine pediatric patients were enrolled and their genotypes were determined. Patients who carried NUDT15( *)3 and NUDT15( *)2 genotypes were at a 10-15 fold higher risk of severe neutropenia than those of the wild-type during the early months of the maintenance phase. Risk of neutropenia was not significantly increased in patients with other NUDT15 variants as well as in patients with TPMT, ITPA or ABCC4 variants. These results suggest that NUDT15 polymorphisms particularly, NUDT15( *)3 and NUDT15( *)2, play major roles in 6-MP-induced severe hematotoxicity even when using a standard low dosage of 6-MP and genotyping of these variants is necessary in order to obtain precise tolerance doses and avoid severe hematotoxicity in pediatric patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Japanese Society for the Study of Xenobiotics.

We leveraged paired whole exome and transcriptome sequencing in the largest LGL leukemia cohort to date, which included 105 patients (93 TCRab T-LGL and 12 TCRgammadelta T-LGL). 76 mutations were observed in three or more patients in the cohort, and out of those, STAT3, KMT2D, PIK3R1, TTN, EYS, and SULF1 mutations were shared between both subtypes. We identified ARHGAP25, ABCC9, PCDHA11, SULF1, SLC6A15, DDX59, DNMT3A, FAS, KDM6A, KMT2D, PIK3R1, STAT3, STAT5B, TET2, and TNFAIP3 as recurrently mutated putative drivers using an unbiased driver analysis approach leveraging our whole exome cohort. Hotspot mutations in STAT3, PIK3R1, and FAS were detected, whereas truncating mutations in epigenetic modifying enzymes such as KMT2D and TET2 were observed. Moreover, STAT3 mutations co-occurred with mutations in chromatin and epigenetic modifying genes, especially KMT2D and SETD1B (p < 0.01, p < 0.05 respectively). STAT3 was mutated in 50.5% of the patients. Most common Y640F STAT3 mutation was associated with lower ANC values, and N647I mutation was associated with lower hemoglobin values. Somatic activating mutations (Q160P, D170Y, L287F) in the STAT3 coiled-coil domain were characterized. STAT3 mutant patients exhibited increased mutational burden and enrichment of a mutational signature associated with increased spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Finally, gene expression analysis revealed enrichment of interferon gamma signaling and decreased PI3K-Akt signaling for STAT3 mutant patients.

TCLs have inferior prognosis which is attributed to poor understanding of their pathogenesis. Based on phenotypic similarities between normal and neoplastic lymphocytes it has been assumed that TCLs develop in the periphery, directly from various subtypes of normal T-cells. To address the debated question of the cell of origin in TCLs we analyzed to identify the highly variable complementarity determining regions (CDR3) regions of T-cell receptor (TCR) to trace the clonal history of the T-cells. We have collected previously published whole genome -exome, and -transcriptome sequencing data from 574 TCL patients. TCR clonotypes were identified by de novo assembly of CDR3 regions of TCR gamma, beta and alpha. We have found that the vast majority of TCLs are clonotypically oligoclonal, although the pattern oligoclonality varied. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma was most diverse comprising multiple clonotypes of TCRgamma, beta and alpha whereas adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia and peripheral T-cell lymphomas often showed monoclonality for TCRgamma and beta but had diverse TCRalpha clonotypes. These patterns of rearrangements indicated that TCLs are initiated at the level of the lymphoid precursor. In keeping with this hypothesis, TCR rearrangements in TCLs resembled the pattern seen in the human thymus showing biased usage of V and J segments of high combinatorial probability resulting in recurrent, ""public"" CDR3 sequences shared across unrelated patients and different clinical TCL entities.

Although chimeric fusion proteins involving transcription factors (TF) are hallmarks of many types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), therapeutically targeting the fusion proteins is a challenge. In this work, we characterize the core regulatory circuitry (CRC; interconnected autoregulatory loops of TFs) of B-ALL involving MEF2D-fusions and identify MEF2D-fusion and SREBF1 TFs as crucial CRC components. By gene silencing and pharmacologic perturbation, we reveal that the CRC integrates the pre-B-cell receptor (BCR) and lipid metabolism to maintain itself and govern malignant phenotypes. Small-molecule inhibitors of pre-BCR signaling and lipid biosynthesis disrupt the CRC and silence the MEF2D fusion in cell culture and show therapeutic efficacy in xenografted mice. Therefore, pharmacologic disruption of CRC presents a potential therapeutic strategy to target fusion protein-driven leukemia. SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer type-specific gene expression is governed by transcription factors involved in a highly interconnected autoregulatory loop called CRC. Here, we characterized fusion protein-driven CRC and identified its pharmacologic vulnerabilities, opening therapeutic avenues to indirectly target fusion-driven leukemia by disrupting its CRC.See related commentary by Sadras and Muschen, p. 18.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 5.",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Tsuzuki, Shinobu', 'Yasuda, Takahiko', 'Kojima, Shinya', 'Kawazu, Masahito', 'Akahane, Koshi', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Imaizumi, Masue', 'Morishita, Takanobu', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Ueno, Toshihide', 'Karnan, Sivasundaram', 'Ota, Akinobu', 'Hyodo, Toshinori', 'Konishi, Hiroyuki', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Nagai, Hirokazu', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Tomita, Akihiro', 'Suzuki, Kyogo', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Takahashi, Yoshiyuki', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Hosokawa, Yoshitaka', 'Mano, Hiroyuki', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko']","['Tsuzuki S', 'Yasuda T', 'Kojima S', 'Kawazu M', 'Akahane K', 'Inukai T', 'Imaizumi M', 'Morishita T', 'Miyamura K', 'Ueno T', 'Karnan S', 'Ota A', 'Hyodo T', 'Konishi H', 'Sanada M', 'Nagai H', 'Horibe K', 'Tomita A', 'Suzuki K', 'Muramatsu H', 'Takahashi Y', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Matsumura I', 'Kiyoi H', 'Hosokawa Y', 'Mano H', 'Hayakawa F']","['Department of Biochemistry, Aichi Medical University, School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan. tsuzukis@aichi-med-u.ac.jp.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Signaling, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Signaling, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', ""Miyagi Children's Hospital, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan."", 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Signaling, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Aichi Medical University, School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Aichi Medical University, School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Aichi Medical University, School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Aichi Medical University, School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Sayama, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Aichi Medical University, School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Signaling, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathophysiological Laboratory Sciences, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20200610,United States,Blood Cancer Discov,Blood cancer discovery,101764786,IM,,,2020/07/01 00:00,2020/07/01 00:01,['2022/01/11 17:34'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 17:34 [entrez]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 00:01 [medline]']","['2643-3230.BCD-19-0080 [pii]', '10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-19-0080 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cancer Discov. 2020 Jul;1(1):82-95. doi: 10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-19-0080.

Unlike polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), the role of PRC1 in oncogenesis and therapy resistance is not well defined. Here, we demonstrate that highly recurrent mutations of the PRC1 subunits BCOR and BCORL1 in leukemia disrupt assembly of a non-canonical PRC1.1 complex, thereby selectively unlinking the RING-PCGF enzymatic core from the chromatin targeting auxiliary subcomplex. As a result, BCOR-mutated PRC1.1 is localized to chromatin but lacks repressive activity, leading to epigenetic reprogramming and transcriptional activation at target loci. We define a set of functional targets that drive aberrant oncogenic signaling programs in PRC1.1 mutated cells and primary patient samples. Activation of these PRC1.1 targets in BCOR-mutated cells confers acquired resistance to treatment while sensitizing to targeted kinase inhibition. Our study thus reveals a novel epigenetic mechanism that explains PRC1.1 tumor suppressive activity and identifies a therapeutic strategy in PRC1.1 mutated cancer.","['Copyright (c)2021, American Association for Cancer Research.']","['Schaefer, Eva J', 'Wang, Helen C', 'Karp, Hannah Q', 'Meyer, Clifford A', 'Cejas, Paloma', 'Gearhart, Micah D', 'Adelman, Emmalee R', 'Fares, Iman', 'Apffel, Annie', 'Lim, Klothilda', 'Xie, Yingtian', 'Gibson, Christopher J', 'Schenone, Monica', 'Murdock, H Moses', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Gondek, Lukasz P', 'Carroll, Martin P', 'Vedula, Rahul S', 'Winer, Eric S', 'Garcia, Jacqueline S', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Luskin, Marlise R', 'Carr, Steven A', 'Long, Henry W', 'Bardwell, Vivian J', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Lindsley, R Coleman']","['Schaefer EJ', 'Wang HC', 'Karp HQ', 'Meyer CA', 'Cejas P', 'Gearhart MD', 'Adelman ER', 'Fares I', 'Apffel A', 'Lim K', 'Xie Y', 'Gibson CJ', 'Schenone M', 'Murdock HM', 'Wang ES', 'Gondek LP', 'Carroll MP', 'Vedula RS', 'Winer ES', 'Garcia JS', 'Stone RM', 'Luskin MR', 'Carr SA', 'Long HW', 'Bardwell VJ', 'Figueroa ME', 'Lindsley RC']","['Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, University of Minnesota.', 'Human Genetics, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Proteomics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Medical School.', 'WRDM-Chemical Biology, Pfizer (United States).', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'Proteomics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.', 'Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.', 'University of Minnesota.', 'Human Genetics, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute coleman_lindsley@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211217,United States,Blood Cancer Discov,Blood cancer discovery,101764786,IM,,,2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2022/01/11 17:34'],"['2021/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/11 17:34 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['2643-3230.BCD-21-0115 [pii]', '10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-21-0115 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Cancer Discov. 2021 Dec 17. pii: 2643-3230.BCD-21-0115. doi: 10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-21-0115.,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8887-1799', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9873-1930', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3429-0803', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0754-2374', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2209-3944', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6456-8768', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4098-8968', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2118-6302', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5781-4529', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7203-4299', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6849-6629']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that mRNA encoding CD22 undergoes aberrant splicing in B-ALL. We describe the plasma membrane-bound CD22 Deltaex5-6 splice isoform, which is resistant to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting the third immunoglobulin-like domain of CD22. We also describe splice variants skipping the AUG-containing exon 2 and failing to produce any identifiable protein, thereby defining an event that is rate limiting for epitope presentation. Indeed, forcing exon 2 skipping with morpholino oligonucleotides reduced CD22 protein expression and conferred resistance to the CD22-directed antibody-drug conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin in vitro. Furthermore, among inotuzumab-treated pediatric patients with B-ALL, we identified one nonresponder in whose leukemic blasts Deltaex2 isoforms comprised the majority of CD22 transcripts. In a second patient, a sharp reduction in CD22 protein levels during relapse was driven entirely by increased CD22 exon 2 skipping. Thus, dysregulated CD22 splicing is a major mechanism of epitope downregulation and ensuing resistance to immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanism(s) underlying downregulation of surface CD22 following CD22-directed immunotherapy remains underexplored. Our biochemical and correlative studies demonstrate that in B-ALL, CD22 expression levels are controlled by inclusion/skipping of CD22 exon 2. Thus, aberrant splicing of CD22 is an important driver/biomarker of de novo and acquired resistance to CD22-directed immunotherapies.See related commentary by Bourcier and Abdel-Wahab.",['(c)2021 The

Mechanistically, mild hyperthermia stimulates aggregation of PML/RARalpha in complex with nuclear receptor corepressors leading to ubiquitin-mediated degradation via the SIAH2 E3 ligase. Hyperthermia and arsenic therapy destabilize PML/RARalpha via distinct mechanisms and are synergistic in primary patient samples and in vivo, including three refractory APL cases. Collectively, our results suggest that by taking advantage of a biophysical vulnerability of PML/RARalpha, thermal therapy may improve prognosis in drug-resistant or otherwise refractory APL. These findings serve as a paradigm for therapeutic targeting of fusion oncoprotein-associated cancers by hyperthermia. SIGNIFICANCE: Hyperthermia destabilizes oncofusion proteins including PML/RARalpha and acts synergistically with standard arsenic therapy in relapsed and refractory APL. The results open up the possibility that heat shock sensitivity may be an easily targetable vulnerability of oncofusion-driven cancers.See related commentary by Wu et al., p. 300.",['(c)2021 American

Despite an overall survival of 80% in the pediatric setting, 20% of patients with T-ALL ultimately die from relapsed or refractory disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapies. Molecular genetic analyses and sequencing studies have led to the identification of recurrent T-ALL genetic drivers. This review summarizes the main genetic drivers and targetable lesions of T-ALL and gives a comprehensive overview of the novel treatments for patients with T-ALL that are currently under clinical investigation or that are emerging from preclinical research. SIGNIFICANCE: T-ALL is driven by oncogenic transcription factors that act along with secondary acquired mutations. These lesions, together with active signaling pathways, may be targeted by therapeutic agents.

The US Food and Drug Administration allows generic drug manufacturers to market versions with skinny labels that exclude patent-protected indications. This study assessed whether use of generic versions of imatinib varied between indications included and excluded from the skinny labels. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we identified adult patients covered by commercial insurance or Medicare Advantage plans who initiated imatinib from February 2016 (first generic availability) to September 2020. Generic versions were introduced with skinny labels that included indications covering treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) but excluded treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) because of remaining patent protections. Logistic regression was used to determine whether use of generic versus brand-name imatinib differed between patients with a diagnosis of CML or GIST, adjusting for demographics, insurance type, prior use of brand-name drugs, and calendar month. RESULTS: Among 2,000 initiators, 934 (47%) had CML and 686 (34%) had GIST. Within 3 years after generics entered the market, more than 90% of initiators in both groups used generic imatinib. Initiation of generic imatinib was slightly lower among patients with GIST than among patients with CML (85% v 88%; adjusted odds ratio 0.56; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.80; P </= .001). CONCLUSION: Generic versions of imatinib were dispensed frequently for indications both included (CML) and excluded (GIST) from the skinny labeling, although patients with GIST were slightly less likely to receive a generic version. The skinny labeling pathway allowed generics to enter the market before patent protection for treating patients with GIST expired, facilitating lower drug prices.",,"['Walsh, Bryan S', 'Kesselheim, Aaron S', 'Sarpatwari, Ameet', 'Rome, Benjamin N']","['Walsh BS', 'Kesselheim AS', 'Sarpatwari A', 'Rome BN']","[""Program On Regulation, Therapeutics, And Law (PORTAL), Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Program On Regulation, Therapeutics, And Law (PORTAL), Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Program On Regulation, Therapeutics, And Law (PORTAL), Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Program On Regulation, Therapeutics, And Law (PORTAL), Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220111,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,,2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2022/01/11 17:31'],"['2022/01/11 17:31 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JCO.21.02139 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Clin Oncol. 2022 Jan 11:JCO2102139. doi: 10.1200/JCO.21.02139.,,,JCO2102139,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1947-3663', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8867-2666', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5043-6206', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5776-3293']",,,,"['Ameet SarpatwariResearch Funding: Anthem Public Policy Institute (Inst)Travel,', 'Accommodations, Expenses: Kaiser Permanente Benjamin N.

35015466,,Publisher,,,2022 Jan,Non-Odontogenic Tumors Of The Jaws,,"Non-odontogenic tumor of the jaw is a term that encompasses a vast range of pathologies that cannot be fully dealt with below. Instead, the focus will be on pathology that is more commonly encountered in clinical practice, although many are still exceedingly rare. Six tumors will be covered in detail: osteosarcoma, fibrous dysplasia, central giant cell granuloma, osteoma, osteochondroma, and osteoblastoma. Below is a more thorough classification of non-odontogenic tumors of the jaw, divided by tissue of origin, highlighting the breadth of the topic. Neoplasms of Bone : Benign: Osteoma. Osteoblastoma. Osteoid osteoma. Ossifying fibroma Chondroma. Chondroblastoma. Chondromyxoid fibroma. Malignant: Osteosarcoma. Ewing's sarcoma. Chondrosarcoma. Metastases. Fibroconnective or Fibro-osseous : Benign: Fibrous dysplasia. Cherubism. Non-ossifying fibroma. Desmoplastic fibroma. Malignant: Fibrosarcoma. Histocyte Derived : Benign: Central giant cell granulomas. Malignant: Malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Fat Derived : Benign: Lipoma. Malignant: Liposarcoma. Muscle Derived : Benign: Leiomyoma. Malignant: Leiomyosarcoma. Vascular Derived : Benign: Central hemangioma. Lymphangioma. Hemangiopericytoma. Malignant: Angiosarcoma. Nerve Derived Benign: Solitary neurofibroma. Neurilemoma. Hematological : Primary lymphoma. Leukemia. Plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma. Osteosarcoma Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor of the bone, accounting for over half of all primary bone tumors. Osteosarcoma of the jaw accounts for 6% of all osteosarcoma's and after squamous cell carcinomas are the second most common malignancy of the jaws.[1] They can be defined as either primary or secondary tumors, with the latter originating from diseased bone, e.g., Paget disease, or transformation of benign tumors.[2] They are graded and classified based on histological features.[3] Fibrous Dysplasia Fibrous dysplasia is a fibro-osseous disease that causes abnormal bone maturation and remodeling. It does not cause a discrete lesion but leads to abnormal bony swellings and has therefore been included as an important form of non-odontogenic tumor.[4][5] Fibrous dysplasia is a rare genetic condition caused by a sporadic, somatic mutation in the GNAS 1 gene.[6][7] It commonly affects the jaws, most often occurring in the maxilla, and leads to significant deformity, asymmetry, and, if present around the orbit, blindness. It can occur in monostotic (80 to 85%) and polyostotic forms (single vs. multiple bones, respectively). McCune-Albright syndrome is a form of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. There are associated cutaneous changes in the form of cafe-au-lait spots and widespread endocrinopathies. Jaffe-Lichtenstein syndrome is another polyostotic form of fibrous dysplasia with cafe-au-lait spots but the absence of endocrinopathies.[8] Another term commonly encountered is craniofacial fibrous dysplasia. This refers to a polyostotic form of fibrous dysplasia in the facial skeleton, where multiple bones are affected in continuity. Central Giant Cell Granuloma Central giant cell granuloma is the most common non-odontogenic tumor that affects the jaws, accounting for 7% of benign jaw tumors.[9][10] They are most commonly found in the anterior portion of the mandible but can affect the maxilla. They are benign but can be locally destructive.[11] They are of osteoclastic origin and present, therefore, as expansile lytic lesions. They are usually unifocal, in the presence of multifocal or bilateral lesions underlying diagnoses of hyperparathyroidism or cherubism should be investigated. Osteoma An osteoma is a benign, slow-growing proliferation of compact or cancellous bone.[12][13] They most often occur in the craniofacial skeleton, primarily in the paranasal sinuses. In the jaws, they are more frequently seen in the mandible and rarely reported in the maxilla.[14] They can be divided into three types: central, peripheral, and extraskeletal. Central osteomas derive from the endosteum, peripheral from the periosteum, and extraskeletal from the soft tissues, specifically muscles.[15] Gardener syndrome must be investigated as an underlying diagnosis in either the presence of multiple osteomas or osteoma in children. This is an autosomal dominant condition that leads to osteomas, fibromatosis, and polyposis of the large intestines. These adenomatous polyps ultimately undergo malignant transformation and lead to adenocarcinomas of the large intestines in all patients. Osteochondroma Osteochondroma is a benign hamartoma in the form of cartilage capped, bony outgrowth. They are primarily found in the axial skeleton in areas of endochondral ossification. Consequently, they are rare in the facial skeleton, as this primarily undergoes membranous ossification. When they do occur, they appear in the mandibular condyle, occasionally also occurring in the coronoid process.[16] Their growth pattern can classify them as either exophytic or globular. Exophytic lesions tend to develop in stalk-like attachments, primarily from the condylar head. Globular lesions deform the whole of the condylar head in a lobular manner with a vertical growth plane.[17] Osteoblastoma Osteoblastoma is a rare benign neoplasm; it is primarily found in the vertebral column but can occur in the jaws, most commonly the mandible. There is significant debate surrounding their natural course of progression and histology; consequently, diagnosis can be challenging.[18] They can be divided into benign and aggressive subtypes. Aggressive tumors are locally destructive, have high recurrence rates, and can be difficult to distinguish from low-grade osteosarcoma.[19][20] Surrounding literature will often use terms such as 'osteoid osteoma,' 'juvenile active ossifying fibroma,' and 'aggressive osteoblastoma' to describe this pathology. Osteoid osteoma is histologically indistinguishable from osteoblastoma but will exhibit pain as a more prominent feature. Some believe it represents a different pathology entirely, and others feel it is an early phase of the developing osteoblastoma. Juvenile active ossifying fibroma and aggressive osteoblastoma both describe the same subtype of osteoblastoma. This aggressive subtype, described above, is more often seen in young adults.","['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']","['Shaw, Sarah E.', 'Chan, Chi-Hwa']","['Shaw SE', 'Chan CH']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,2022/01/12 06:01,2022/01/12 06:01,,,['NBK576441 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20220112,['20211222'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2022/01/12 06:01'],,,,,,,

In a large cohort-study we assessed the morbidity in 1 328 Swedish CML chronic phase patients diagnosed 2002-2017 and treated with TKIs, as compared to that in carefully matched control individuals. Several Swedish patient registers with near complete nationwide coverage were utilized for data acquisition. Median follow-up was 6 (IQR, 3-10) years with total follow-up of 8510 person-years for the full cohort. Among 670 analyzed disease categories the patient cohort showed a significantly increased risk in 142 while, strikingly, no category was more common in controls. Increased incidence rate ratios/IRR (95% CI) for more severe events among patients included acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 2.0 (1.5-2.6), heart failure 2.6 (2.2-3.2), pneumonia 2.8 (2.3-3.5) and unspecified sepsis 3.5 (2.6-4.7). When comparing patients on 2nd generation TKIs vs. imatinib in a within-cohort analysis, nilotinib generated elevated IRRs for AMI (2.9; 1.5-5.6) and chronic ischemic heart disease (2.2; 1.2-3.9), dasatinib for pleural effusion (11.6; 7.6-17.7) and infectious complications, e.g. acute upper respiratory infections (3.0; 1.4-6.0). Our extensive real-world data reveal significant risk increases of severe morbidity in TKI-treated CML patients, as compared to matched controls, particularly for 2nd generation TKIs. Whether this increased morbidity may also translate into increased mortality, thus preventing CML patients to achieve a normalized overall survival, needs to be further explored.

Although others have documented the impact on new cancer diagnoses, trends in new starts for oncology drugs are less clear. We examined changes in new users of oral oncology medications in the US following COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in 2020 compared to prior years. METHODS: We examined prescription data for members enrolled with a national pharmacy benefits manager in the US from January 1-October 31 of 2018, 2019, and/or 2020. This is a retrospective, observational study comparing new users per 100,000 members per month for all oral oncology drugs, and separately for breast, lung, and prostate cancer, leukemia, and melanoma oral drugs. We performed a difference-in-differences analysis for change in new users from pre-period (prior to pandemic-induced disruption, January-March), to post-period (following pandemic-induced disruption, April-October), between 2020 and 2019, and 2020 and 2018. RESULTS: New oral oncology drug users per 100,000 members per month declined by an additional 11.3% in the 2020 post-period compared to 2019 (p = 0.048). New oral breast cancer drug starts declined by an additional 14.0% in the 2020 post-period compared to 2019 (p = 0.040). Similar but non-significant trends were found between 2020 and 2018. No significant differences were found between post-period monthly new starts of leukemia, melanoma, lung or prostate cancer disease-specific oral medications.

In recent years, the important roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CC have emerged, but studies on the relationship between lncRNAs and HPVpositive (HPV+) CC remain scarce. The present study aimed to investigate whether lncRNA deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (DLEU1) is associated with HPV infection and explore the clinical significance of DLEU1 in HPV+ patients with CC. DLEU1 expression was detected by reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR. The ability of DLEU1 to screen patients with CC from controls and differentiate individuals with different HPV infection status was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. The association of DLEU1 with the survival prognosis of patients with CC was assessed by KaplanMeier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis. The RNA Interactome Database was used to predict molecules interacting with DLEU1. The results indicated that DLEU1 expression was significantly upregulated in CC tissues and cell lines, particularly in those that were HPV+. In addition, DLEU1 had a high diagnostic value in discriminating patients with CC and differentiating between HPV+ and HPV patients with CC, and had a certain ability to screen HPV+ controls. DLEU1 was correlated with HPV infection in CC patients. Furthermore, DLEU1 was indicated to be associated with survival prognosis in both total patients with CC and HPV+ patients with CC, and independently predict the prognosis of patients with CC. Most of the molecules interacting with DLEU1 were microRNAs. In conclusion, abnormal DLEU1 expression is associated with HPV infection and may serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HPV+ patients with CC.",,"['Dong, Aiping', 'Xu, Bin', 'Wang, Zhanzhao', 'Miao, Xia']","['Dong A', 'Xu B', 'Wang Z', 'Miao X']","[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, Shandong 261041, P.R.

Moreover, there is an increasing need for understanding the AR-independent progression of tumor cells such as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Menin, which is encoded by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), serves as a direct link between AR and the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex in PCa development by activating AR target genes through histone H3 lysine 4 methylation. Although menin is a critical component of AR signaling, its tumorigenic role in AR-independent PCa cells remains unknown. Here, we compared the role of menin in AR-positive and AR-negative PCa cells via RNAi-mediated or pharmacological inhibition of menin. We demonstrated that menin was involved in tumor cell growth and metastasis in PCa cells with low or deficient levels of AR. The inhibition of menin significantly diminished the growth of PCa cells and induced apoptosis, regardless of the presence of AR. Additionally, transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of many metastasis-associated genes was perturbed by menin inhibition in AR-negative DU145 cells. Furthermore, wound-healing assay results showed that menin promoted cell migration in AR-independent cellular contexts. Overall, these findings suggest a critical function of menin in tumorigenesis and provide a rationale for drug development against menin toward targeting high-risk metastatic PCa, especially those independent of AR.",,"['Kim, Taewan', 'Jeong, Kwanyoung', 'Kim, Eunji', 'Yoon, Kwanghyun', 'Choi, Jinmi', 'Park, Jae Hyeon', 'Kim, Jae-Hwan', 'Kim, Hyung Sik', 'Youn, Hong-Duk', 'Cho, Eun-Jung']","['Kim T', 'Jeong K', 'Kim E', 'Yoon K', 'Choi J', 'Park JH', 'Kim JH', 'Kim HS', 'Youn HD', 'Cho EJ']","['School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.', 'These authors contributed equally to this work.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.', 'These authors contributed equally to this work.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.', 'NineBiopharm, Co., Ltd., Cheongju 28161, Korea.', 'National Creative Research Center for Epigenome Reprogramming Network, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.', 'National Creative Research Center for Epigenome Reprogramming Network, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220103,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['androgen receptor', 'menin', 'menin inhibitor', 'metastasis', 'prostate cancer']",2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2022/01/11 08:44'],"['2021/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 08:44 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['molcells.2021.0206 [pii]', '10.14348/molcells.2021.0206 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Mol Cells. 2022 Jan 3. pii: molcells.2021.0206. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2021.0206.,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2770-2849', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8415-7480', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6120-6390', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3746-5237', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4909-9473', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8463-6086', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1347-9909', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7657-3970', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9741-8566', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6610-5329']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitoquinone (MitoQ), a mitochondrial targeted antioxidant, is a potential compound for therapeutic development of RIRI. This study observed the effect of MitoQ on RIRI, and further explored its possible molecular mechanism. Temporary increase in intraocular pressure was used to establish rat model of RIRI to observe the effect of MitoQ treatment on retinal function, pathological injury, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect expressions of cleaved caspase 3, B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 associated X (Bax), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX1), NOX4, cleaved-Notch 1, hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), and sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1) in retina were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. MitoQ treatment significantly improved retinal function and pathological injury, inhibited the over-production of reactive oxygen species, increased the expression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1), suppressed the releases of inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited retinal cells apoptosis. MitoQ also down-regulated the expressions of cleaved caspase 3, Bax, NOX 1, NOX 4, cleaved-Notch 1, and Hes 1, increased the expression of SIRT 1 protein and its activity. These effects were significantly reversed by SIRT1 inhibitor EX527. Our data suggests that MitoQ, as a potentially effective drug for improving RIRI, may act through the SIRT1/Notch1/NADPH signal axis.","['(c) 2022 Wiley Periodicals, LLC.']","['Tang, Dongyong', 'Liu, Xin', 'Chen, Jun']","['Tang D', 'Liu X', 'Chen J']","['Department of Ophthalmology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine Surgery, Clinical College, Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220111,United States,Drug Dev Res,Drug development research,8204468,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Mitoquinone', 'ROS', 'SIRT 1', 'inflammation', 'mitochondria injury', 'notch 1', 'retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury']",2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2022/01/11 07:04'],"['2021/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2022/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 07:04 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ddr.21911 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Drug Dev Res. 2022 Jan 11. doi: 10.1002/ddr.21911.,,,,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6726-1227'],"['Z2180912/Health and Family Planning Commission Technology Plan of Guangxi Zhuang', 'Autonomous Region']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the impact of VAF on outcomes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has not been extensively explored. METHODS: Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed in 350 newly diagnosed MDS cases. The associations of mutational VAF of each gene with overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were examined by multivariate Cox regression after univariate analysis. RESULTS: Shorter OS was independently associated with DNMT3A VAF (HR 1.020 per 1% VAF increase; 95% CI 1.005-1.035; p = 0.011) and TP53 VAF (HR 1.014 per 1% VAF increase; 95% CI 1.006-1.022; p = 0.001). LFS analyses revealed that TET2 VAF (HR 1.013 per 1% VAF increase; 95% CI 1.005-1.022; p = 0.003) and TP53 VAF (HR 1.012 per 1% VAF increase; 95% CI 1.004-1.021; p = 0.005) were independently associated with faster leukemic transformation. Furthermore, we established nomograms to predict OS and LFS, respectively, by integrating independent mutational predictors into the revised International Prognostic Scoring System. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights that VAF of certain genes should be incorporated into routine clinical prognostication of survival and leukemic transformation of MDS.","['(c) 2022.

Agents that selectively and specifically target each of the S1P receptors have been sought as both biological tools and potential therapeutics. JTE-013, a small molecule antagonist of S1P receptors 2 and 4 (S1P2 and S1P4) has been widely used in defining the roles of these receptors in various biological processes. Indeed, our previous studies showed that JTE-013 had anti-acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) activity, supporting a role for S1P2 in the biology and therapeutic targeting of AML. Here we examined this further and describe lipidomic analysis of AML cells that revealed JTE-013 caused alterations in sphingolipid metabolism, increasing cellular ceramides, dihydroceramides, sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine. Further examination of the mechanisms behind these observations showed that JTE-013, at concentrations frequently used in the literature to target S1P2/4, inhibits several sphingolipid metabolic enzymes, including dihydroceramide desaturase 1 and both sphingosine kinases. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that JTE-013 can have broad off-target effects on sphingolipid metabolism and highlight that caution must be employed in interpreting the use of this reagent in defining the roles of S1P2/4.",['(c) 2022.

The process of granulocytic differentiation activated by ATRA in APL blasts is recapitulated in the NB4 cell-line, which is characterized by expression of the pathogenic PML-RARalpha fusion protein. In the present study, we used the NB4 model to define the effects exerted by ATRA on lipid homeostasis. Using a high-throughput lipidomic approach, we demonstrate that exposure of the APL-derived NB4 cell-line to ATRA causes an early reduction in the amounts of cardiolipins, a major lipid component of the mitochondrial membranes. The decrease in the levels of cardiolipins results in a concomitant inhibition of mitochondrial activity. These ATRA-dependent effects are causally involved in the granulocytic maturation process. In fact, the ATRA-induced decrease of cardiolipins and the concomitant dysfunction of mitochondria precede the differentiation of retinoid-sensitive NB4 cells and the two phenomena are not observed in the retinoid-resistant NB4.306 counterparts. In addition, ethanolamine induced rescue of the mitochondrial dysfunction activated by cardiolipin deficiency inhibits ATRA-dependent granulocytic differentiation and induction of the associated autophagic process. The RNA-seq studies performed in parental NB4 cells and a NB4-derived cell population, characterized by silencing of the autophagy mediator, ATG5, provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the differentiating action of ATRA. The results indicate that ATRA causes a significant down-regulation of CRLS1 (Cardiolipin-synthase-1) and LPCAT1 (Lysophosphatidylcholine-Acyltransferase-1) mRNAs which code for two enzymes catalyzing the last steps of cardiolipin synthesis. ATRA-dependent down-regulation of CRLS1 and LPCAT1 mRNAs is functionally relevant, as it is accompanied by a significant decrease in the amounts of the corresponding proteins. Furthermore, the decrease in CRLS1 and LPCAT1 levels requires activation of the autophagic process, as down-regulation of the two proteins is blocked in ATG5-silenced NB4-shATG5 cells.",['(c) 2021.

We reported previously that inactivation of FOXO1 confers growth arrest and apoptosis in B-ALL, partially mediated by subsequent depletion of CCND3. Given that previously the canonical MYC target CCND2 has been considered to play the major role in B-ALL proliferation, further investigation of the role of FOXO1 in CCND3 transcription and the role of CCND3 in B-ALL is warranted. In this study, we demonstrated that CCND3 is essential for the proliferation and survival of B-ALL, independent of the mutational background. Respectively, its expression at mRNA level exceeds that of CCND1 and CCND2. Furthermore, we identified FOXO1 as a CCND3-activating transcription factor in B-ALL. By comparing the effects of CCND3 depletion and CDK4/6 inhibition by palbociclib on B-ALL cells harboring different driver mutations, we found that the anti-apoptotic effect of CCND3 is independent of the kinase activity of the CCND3-CDK4/6 complex. Moreover, we found that CCND3 contributes to CDK8 transcription, which in part might explain the anti-apoptotic effect of CCND3. Finally, we found that increased CCND3 expression is associated with the development of resistance to palbociclib. We conclude that CCND3 plays an essential role in the maintenance of B-ALL, regardless of the underlying driver mutation. Moreover, downregulation of CCND3 expression might be superior to inhibition of CDK4/6 kinase activity in terms of B-ALL treatment.",['(c) 2022.

Adoptive cell therapy using CAR-T cells is a potentially interesting approach in this. RECENT FINDINGS: Several potentially interesting AML targets are being investigated with CAR-T therapy with over 60 clinical trials listed on clinicaltrials.gov. The first clinical data are only just emerging with mixed results, once more proving that further research is needed. SUMMARY: Adoptive cell therapy using chimeric antigen receptor T cells is being investigated in AML through many clinical trials. So far, no AML-specific antigen has been identified, requiring additional strategies to mitigate on-target off-tumor toxicity and to increase efficacy. Focus point is to acquire control over the CAR T cells once administered. Strategies to do so include biodegradable CARs, inducible CARs, suicide-switch containing CARs and two-component modular CARs. Limited and mixed results are available, confirming the risk of lasting toxicity for nonswitchable CARs. Initial results of modular CARs suggest toxicity can be mitigated whilst maintaining CAR activity by the use of modular CAR concepts that allows for 'ON' and 'OFF' switching.","['Copyright (c) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

RECENT FINDINGS: In QUAZAR AML-001 study, the oral azacitidine analogue CC-486 demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit when given as postremission therapy (PRT) for patients in CR1 that were ineligible to proceed to allo-HCT. Used as maintenance post allo-HCT, CC-486 has also shown safety with encouraging disease-free survival (DFS). Although a recent randomized trial of parenteral azacitidine vs. placebo post allo-HCT failed to show relapse reduction, a subsequent meta-analysis of maintenance studies posttransplant has shown good utility with this approach. Such conflicting results emphasize the need for robust study designs to identify subsets of patients that derive maximal benefits using latest tools to risk stratify relapse risk. SUMMARY: PRT with hypomethylating agents is feasible and in select population, there is a survival advantage with CC-486. Better understanding of distinct epigenetic and immunomodulatory properties of azacitidine, holds significant promise to synergize pharmacologic and cellular drivers of disease control as PRT in future AML trials.","['Copyright (c) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

It is a human carcinogen and can induce lymphohematopoietic cancers, particularly leukemia, in occupationally-exposed workers. BD is an air pollutant with the major environmental sources being automobile exhaust and tobacco smoke. It is one of the major constituents and is considered the most carcinogenic compound in cigarette smoke. The BD concentrations in urban areas usually vary between 0.01 and 3.3 mug/m(3) but can be significantly higher in some microenvironments. For BD exposure of the general population, microenvironments, particularly indoor microenvironments, are the primary determinant and environmental tobacco smoke is the main contributor. BD has high cancer risk and has been ranked the second or the third in the environmental pollutants monitored in most urban areas, with the cancer risks exceeding 10(-5). Mutagenicity/carcinogenicity of BD is mediated by its genotoxic metabolites but the specific metabolite(s) responsible for the effects in humans have not been determined. BD can be bioactivated to yield three mutagenic epoxide metabolites by cytochrome P450 enzymes, or potentially be biotransformed into a mutagenic chlorohydrin by myeloperoxidase, a peroxidase almost specifically present in neutrophils and monocytes. Several urinary BD biomarkers have been developed, among which N-acetyl-S-(4-hydroxy-2-buten-1-yl)-L-cysteine is the most sensitive and is suitable for biomonitoring BD exposure in the general population. Exposure to BD has been associated with leukemia, cardiovascular disease, and possibly reproductive effects, and may be associated with several cancers, autism, and asthma in children. Collectively, BD is a ubiquitous pollutant that has been associated with a range of adverse health effects and diseases with children being a subpopulation with potentially greater susceptibility. Its adverse effects on human health may have been underestimated and more studies are needed.",['(c) 2022.

Immunosuppressive properties have been attributed to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that regulate the phenotype and function of different immune cells. However, such properties were poorly considered until now for adult stem cells with myogenic potential and advanced as possible therapeutic candidates for MDs. In the present study, we investigated the immunoregulatory potential of human MuStem (hMuStem) cells, for which we previously demonstrated that they can survive in injured muscle and robustly counteract adverse tissue remodeling. METHODS: The impact of hMuStem cells or their secretome on the proliferative and phenotypic properties of T-cells was explored by co-culture experiments with either peripheral blood mononucleated cells or CD3-sorted T-cells. A comparative study was produced with the bone marrow (BM)-MSCs. The expression profile of immune cell-related markers on hMuStem cells was determined by flow cytometry while their secretory profile was examined by ELISA assays. Finally, the paracrine and cell contact-dependent effects of hMuStem cells on the T-cell-mediated cytotoxic response were analyzed through IFN-gamma expression and lysis activity. RESULTS: Here, we show that hMuStem cells have an immunosuppressive phenotype and can inhibit the proliferation and the cytotoxic response of T-cells as well as promote the generation of regulatory T-cells through direct contact and via soluble factors. These effects are associated, in part, with the production of mediators including heme-oxygenase-1, leukemia inhibitory factor and intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1, all of which are produced at significantly higher levels by hMuStem cells than BM-MSCs. While the production of prostaglandin E2 is involved in the suppression of T-cell proliferation by both hMuStem cells and BM-MSCs, the participation of inducible nitric oxide synthase activity appears to be specific to hMuStem cell-mediated one. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings demonstrate that hMuStem cells are potent immunoregulatory cells. Combined with their myogenic potential, the attribution of these properties reinforces the positioning of hMuStem cells as candidate therapeutic agents for the treatment of MDs.",['(c) 2021.

Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a cytokine involved in wound healing and implantation. The aim of this study was to determine the change in endometrial LIF mRNA expression before and after mechanical injury during hysteroscopy. METHODS: Forty patients with a history of two or more unsuccessful implantations who decided to undergo hysteroscopy in the proliferative phase were divided into two equal groups: one with endometrial injury (scratching group) and the other with noninjury (control group). Endometrial sampling was conducted before injury on the patients in the scratching group, and then injury was performed with monopolar needle forceps. Only diagnostic hysteroscopy was performed on the patients in the control group. Endometrial tissues were collected using a Pipelle catheter between Days 20 and 23 of the mid-luteal phase of the next cycles in both the scratching and control groups. Endometrial LIF mRNA expression was evaluated with the use of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions. RESULTS: Relative changes in mRNA expression levels of the LIF gene in endometrial samples taken before and after injury were calculated using the 2-DeltaDeltaCt method, and the fold changes obtained were compared between and within the groups. Compared with preinjury values, an 11.1-fold increase was found in postinjury LIF mRNA expression in patients with monopolar forceps injury (p < 0.001). There was a 3.9-fold significant increase in postinjury LIF mRNA levels compared with those in the control group (p < 0.02).

AML features massive proliferation of abnormal blasts and leukemia cells in the bone marrow and the inhibition of normal hematopoiesis at onset. Exosomes containing proteins or nucleic acids are secreted by cells; they participate in intercellular communication and serve as key modulators of hematopoiesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on the regulation of AML and the underlying mechanisms mediated by microRNA (miRNA). METHODS: Dysregulated miR-7-5p in AML patients was identified using qRT-PCR and its clinical significance was explored. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the target gene OSBPL11 that could be regulated by miR-7-5p. The findings were validated using a dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blotting. The functional genes of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway were identified, and the functional significance of miR-7-5p in AML cells was determined using a functional recovery assay. AML cells were co-cultured with exosomes originating from BMSCs overexpressing miR-7-5p to determine cell-cell regulation by Exo-miR-7-5p, as well as in vitro and in vivo functional validation via gain- and loss-of-function methods. RESULTS: Expression of miR-7-5p was decreased in AML patients and cells. Overexpression of miR-7-5p curbed cellular proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Overexpression of OSBPL11 reversed the tumorigenic properties of miR-7-5p in AML cells in vitro. Exo-miR-7-5p derived from BMSCs induced formation of AML cells prone to apoptosis and a low survival rate, with OSBPL11 expression inhibited through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Exo-miR-7-5p derived from BMSCs exhibited tumor homing effects in vitro and in vivo, and inhibited AML development. CONCLUSIONS: Exo-miR-7-5p derived from BMSCs negatively regulates OSBPL11 by suppressing the phosphorylation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting AML proliferation and promoting apoptosis. The data will inform the development of AML therapies based on BMSC-derived exosomes.",['(c) 2022.

Progress has been made in the last two decades in the pre-transplant induction therapies, supportive care, selection of donors and conditioning regimens that allowed to extend the HSCT to a larger number of patients, including those aged over 65 years and/or lacking an HLA-identical donor. Furthermore, improvements in the prophylaxis of the graft-versus-host disease and of infection have dramatically reduced transplant-related mortality. The relapse of AML remains the major reason for transplant failure affecting almost 40-50% of the patients. From 10 to 15 years ago to date, treatment options for AML relapsing after HSCT were limited to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and donor leukocyte infusions (DLI). Nowadays, novel agents and targeted therapies have enriched the therapeutic landscape. Moreover, very recently, the therapeutic landscape has been enriched by manipulated cellular products (CAR-T, CAR-CIK, CAR-NK). In light of these new perspectives, careful monitoring of minimal-residual disease (MRD) and prompt application of pre-emptive strategies in the post-transplant setting have become imperative.

Impaired activation and aggregation processes were identified in previous studies on platelet behaviour associated with this disease. This study's aim was to examine platelet function in correlation with other haemorrhage risk factors (fever, sepsis, recent bleeding, uraemia, leucocytosis, haematocrit value, treatment). DESIGN AND METHODS: The analysis of platelet surface proteins (Glycoprotein Ib-IX (CD42b, CD42a), Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (CD41, CD61), p-selectin (CD62P), granulophysin (CD63)) was conducted by flowcytometry from samples of whole blood in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in different stages of diagnosis and therapy (n = 22) in comparison with healthy human controls (n = 10). RESULTS AND INTERPRETATIONS: Our results show a significant decrease in fluorescence level associated with platelet activation markers (CD63 (14.11% vs. 40.78 % p < 0.05); CD62P (15.26% vs. 28.23% p < 0.05)); adhesion markers (CD42b (69.08% vs. 84.41% p < 0.05)) and aggregation markers (CD61 (83.79% vs. 98.62% p < 0.001)) in patients compared to controls. The levels of CD41 (80.62% vs. 86.31%, p = 0.290) and CD42a (77.98% vs. 94.15%, p = 0.99) demonstrate no significant differences in the two groups. CONCLUSION: The AML patients present changes in adhesion receptors and activation markers, suggesting a functional defect or denatured intracellular signalling in platelets.

We herein describe and characterize the PDX generation in NSG mice. In vivo tumor cell proliferation, engraftment and location were monitored by flow cytometry and bioluminescence imaging. Leukemic cells were retransplanted for up to four passages, and comparative analyses of engraftment pattern, cellular morphology and genomic hotspot mutations were conducted. Ninety-four percent of all samples were successfully engrafted, and the xenograft velocity was dependent on the molecular subtype, outcome of the patient and transplantation passage. While BCR::ABL1 blasts were located in the spleen, KMT2A-positive cases had higher frequencies in the bone marrow. Molecular changes appeared in most model systems, with low allele frequency variants lost during primary engraftment. After the initial xenografting, however, the PDX models demonstrated high molecular stability. This protocol for reliable ALL engraftment demonstrates variability in the location and molecular signatures during serial transplantation.

However, Pax-5 deregulation is associated with various cancer lesions, notably hematopoietic cancers. Mechanistically, studies have characterized genetic alterations within the Pax-5 locus that result in either dominant oncogenic function or haploinsufficiency-inducing mutations leading to oncogenesis. Apart from these mutations, some examples of aberrant Pax-5 expression cannot be associated with genetic alterations. In the present study, we set out to elucidate potential alterations in post-transcriptional regulation of Pax-5 expression and establish that Pax-5 transcript editing represents an important means to aberrant expression. Upon the profiling of Pax-5 mRNA in leukemic cells, we found that the 3'end of the Pax-5 transcript is submitted to alternative polyadenylation (APA) and alternative splicing events. Using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'RACE) from polysomal fractions, we found that Pax-5 3' untranslated region (UTR) shortening correlates with increased ribosomal occupancy for translation. These observations were also validated using reporter gene assays with truncated 3'UTR regions cloned downstream of a luciferase gene. We also showed that Pax-5 3'UTR editing has direct repercussions on regulatory elements such as miRNAs, which in turn impact Pax-5 protein expression.

Here, we investigated the as yet unknown roles of calcium signaling and autophagy regulatory proteins during TRAIL-induced cell death in leukemia cells. Taking advantage of the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) project, we first found that leukemia patients present a unique TRAIL receptor gene expression pattern that may reflect their resistance to TRAIL. The exposure of NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells to TRAIL induces intracellular Ca(2+) influx through a calcium release-activated channel (CRAC)-dependent mechanism, leading to an anti-apoptotic response. Mechanistically, we showed that upon TRAIL treatment, two autophagy proteins, ATG7 and p62/SQSTM1, are recruited to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and are essential for TRAIL-induced Ca(2+) influx and cell death. Importantly, the treatment of NB4 cells with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) led to the upregulation of p62/SQSTM1 and caspase-8 and, when added prior to TRAIL stimulation, significantly enhanced DISC formation and the apoptosis induced by TRAIL. In addition to uncovering new pleiotropic roles for autophagy proteins in controlling the calcium response and apoptosis triggered by TRAIL, our results point to novel therapeutic strategies for sensitizing leukemia cells to TRAIL.",,"['Airiau, Kelly', 'Vacher, Pierre', 'Micheau, Olivier', 'Prouzet-Mauleon, Valerie', 'Kroemer, Guido', 'Moosavi, Mohammad Amin', 'Djavaheri-Mergny, Mojgan']","['Airiau K', 'Vacher P', 'Micheau O', 'Prouzet-Mauleon V', 'Kroemer G', 'Moosavi MA', 'Djavaheri-Mergny M']","['Institut Bergonie, INSERM U1218, University of Bordeaux, 33000 Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut Bergonie, INSERM U1218, University of Bordeaux, 33000 Bordeaux, France.', 'Lipides, Nutrition Cancer, INSERM, UMR1231, 21079 Dijon, France.', 'UFR Science de Sante, Universite de Bourgogne, Franche-Comte, 21079 Dijon, France.', 'Institut Bergonie, INSERM U1218, University of Bordeaux, 33000 Bordeaux, France.', 'Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM UMRS 1138, Sorbonne Universite, Universite de Paris, Equipe 11 Labellisee par la Ligue Contre le Cancer, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Metabolomics and Cell Biology Platforms, Institut Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Pole de Biologie, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran P.O.

N-Aryl-7-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoquinoline-1(2H)carboxamides (5a-j) were accessed in two steps under ultrasonicated irradiation, as per the reported method. The anticancer activity was tested at 10 microM against a total of 5 dozen cancer cell lines obtained from nine distinct panels, as per the National Cancer Institute (NCI US) protocol. The compounds 5a (TK-10 (renal cancer); %GI = 82.90) and 5j (CCRF-CEM (Leukemia); %GI = 58.61) showed the most promising anticancer activity. Compound 5a also demonstrated promising DPPH free radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 14.16 +/- 0.42 microM. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and carbonic anhydrase (CA), two prospective cancer inhibitor targets, were used in the molecular docking studies. Molecular docking studies of ligand 5a (docking score = -8.839) against the active site of EGFR revealed two H-bond interactions with the residues Asp855 and Thr854, whereas ligand 5a (docking = -5.337) interacted with three H-bond with the residues Gln92, Gln67, and Thr200 against the active site CA.

The study aimed to assess and compare the oral hygiene and periodontium status based on the indices in leukemic patients before and after one cycle of chemotherapy and whether the therapy had an impact on the change of these parameters. Dental indices used in clinical diagnostics were calculated: API (approximal plaque index), SBI (sulcus bleeding index), and CPI (community periodontal index). The research project was conducted at the Clinic of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation of the Independent Public Clinical Hospital No. 1 in Lublin. The target population consisted of 102 adults with leukemia who were over 18 years of age. The time since diagnosis of the disease ranged from 1 to 10 years. The data were evaluated in the Statistica 12 software with the respective tests. In the majority of patients, both before and after chemotherapy, improper oral hygiene and severe generalized periodontitis were confirmed. The cycle of chemotherapy that was used did not correlate with the change of patients' oral hygiene and periodontium state.

The results showed the application of N (in the form of Urea or NPK) increased root biomass yield, cryptolepine content, and cryptolepine yield compared to unfertilized plants. The 9-month-old plants recorded the maximum cryptolepine content (2.26 mg/100 mg dry root) and cryptolepine yield (304.08 mg/plant), indicating the perfect time to harvest the herb. Plant age at harvest had a more significant influence (50.6-55.7%) on cryptolepine production than fertilizer application (29.2-33.3%).

Reduced expression of GFI1 or presence of the GFI1-36N (serine replaced with asparagine) variant leads to epigenetic changes in human and murine AML blasts and accelerated the development of leukaemia in a murine model of human MDS and AML. We and other groups previously showed that the GFI1-36N allele or reduced expression of GFI1 in human AML blasts is associated with an inferior prognosis. Using GFI1-36S, -36N -KD, NUP98-HOXD13-tg mice and curcumin (a natural histone acetyltransferase inhibitor (HATi)), we now demonstrate that expansion of GFI1-36N or -KD, NUP98-HODXD13 leukaemic cells can be delayed. Curcumin treatment significantly reduced AML progression in GFI1-36N or -KD mice and prolonged AML-free survival. Of note, curcumin treatment had no effect in GFI1-36S, NUP98-HODXD13 expressing mice. On a molecular level, curcumin treatment negatively affected open chromatin structure in the GFI1-36N or -KD haematopoietic cells but not GFI1-36S cells.

Increasing evidence signifies that microRNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in the progression of tuberculosis (TB). RNA sequencing was used to sequence miRNAs in human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) infected by the virulent MTB-1458 strain and the avirulent vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Sets of differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) between MTB-1458/BCG-infected groups and uninfected groups were identified, among which 18 were differentially expressed only in the MTB-1458-infected THP-1 group. Then, 13 transcription factors (TFs) and 81 target genes of these 18 DE-miRNAs were matched. Gene Ontology classification as well as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis showed that the candidate targets were predominantly involved in apoptotic-associated and interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathways. A TF-miRNA-mRNA interaction network was constructed to analyze the relationships among these 18 DE-miRNAs and their targets and TFs, as well as display the hub miRNAs, TFs, and target genes. Considering the degrees from network analysis and the reported functions, this study focused on the BHLHE40-miR-378d-BHLHE40 regulation axis and confirmed that BHLHE40 was a target of miR-378d.

Compounds were tested in vitro against human HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8 enzymes and compared to reference class I HDACi (Entinostat (MS-275), Mocetinostat, CI994 and RGFP-966). The most promising compounds were found to be highly selective against HDAC1, 2 and 3 over the remaining HDAC subtypes from other classes. Molecular docking studies and MD simulations were performed to rationalize the in vitro data and to deduce a complete structure activity relationship (SAR) analysis of this novel series of class-I HDACi. The most potent compounds, including 19f, which blocks HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, as well as the selective HDAC1/HDAC2 inhibitors 21a and 29b, were selected for further cellular testing against human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and erythroleukemic cancer (HEL) cells, taking into consideration their low toxicity against human embryonic HEK293 cells.

Cell viability assays, transcriptome and immunoblot analysis revealed increased survival of hypoxic cardiomyocytes by mLIF, mOSM and hlOSM stimulation, associated with increased activation of STAT3. Kinetic expression profiling of infarcted hearts further specified a transient increase of OSM and LIF during the early inflammatory phase of cardiac remodeling. A post-infarction delivery of hlOSM but not mOSM or mLIF within this time period combined with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-based strain analysis uncovered a global cardioprotective effect on infarcted hearts. Our data conclusively suggest that a simultaneous and rapid activation of OSMR and LIFR after MI offers a therapeutic opportunity to preserve functional and structural integrity of the infarcted heart.",,"['Lorchner, Holger', 'Adrian-Segarra, Juan M', 'Waechter, Christian', 'Wagner, Roxanne', 'Goes, Maria Elisa', 'Brachmann, Nathalie', 'Sreenivasan, Krishnamoorthy', 'Wietelmann, Astrid', 'Gunther, Stefan', 'Doll, Nicolas', 'Braun, Thomas', 'Poling, Jochen']","['Lorchner H', 'Adrian-Segarra JM', 'Waechter C', 'Wagner R', 'Goes ME', 'Brachmann N', 'Sreenivasan K', 'Wietelmann A', 'Gunther S', 'Doll N', 'Braun T', 'Poling J']","['Department of Cardiac Development and Remodeling, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Rhein-Main, Frankfurt am Main, 60323 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiac Development and Remodeling, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiac Development and Remodeling, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Marburg, Baldingerstrasse, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiac Development and Remodeling, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiac Development and Remodeling, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiac Development and Remodeling, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiac Development and Remodeling, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'MRI and micro-CT Service Group, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiac Development and Remodeling, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiac Surgery, Schuchtermann-Clinic, Ulmenallee 5-11, 49214 Bad Rothenfelde, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiac Development and Remodeling, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Rhein-Main, Frankfurt am Main, 60323 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiac Development and Remodeling, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Rhein-Main, Frankfurt am Main, 60323 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiac Surgery, Schuchtermann-Clinic, Ulmenallee 5-11, 49214 Bad Rothenfelde, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211229,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['cardiac remodeling', 'cardioprotection', 'cytokine signaling', 'myocardial infarction']",2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2022/01/11 01:04'],"['2021/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 01:04 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms23010353 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms23010353 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Dec 29;23(1). pii: ijms23010353. doi: 10.3390/ijms23010353.,23,1,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3712-0554', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1558-0696', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1626-1961', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6165-4804']","['268555672 - B02 (SFB1213)/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '268555672 - A02 (SFB1213)/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '403584255 - TP A05 (TRR 267)/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft']",PMC8745562,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without successful treatment, CML progressively develops from the chronic phase through the accelerated phase to the blast crisis, and ultimately to death. Nowadays, the availability of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies has led to long-term disease control for the vast majority of patients. Nevertheless, there are still patients that do not respond well enough to TKI therapies and available targeted therapies are also less efficient for patients in accelerated phase or blast crises. Thus, a more detailed characterization of molecular alterations that distinguish the different CML phases is still very important. We performed an in-depth bioinformatics analysis of publicly available gene expression profiles of the three CML phases. Pairwise comparisons revealed many differentially expressed genes that formed a characteristic gene expression signature, which clearly distinguished the three CML phases. Signaling pathway expression patterns were very similar between the three phases but differed strongly in the number of affected genes, which increased with the phase. Still, significant alterations of MAPK, VEGF, PI3K-Akt, adherens junction and cytokine receptor interaction signaling distinguished specific phases. Our study also suggests that one can consider the phase-wise CML development as a three rather than a two-step process. This is in accordance with the phase-specific expression behavior of 24 potential major regulators that we predicted by a network-based approach. Several of these genes are known to be involved in the accumulation of additional mutations, alterations of immune responses, deregulation of signaling pathways or may have an impact on treatment response and survival. Importantly, some of these genes have already been reported in relation to CML (e.g., AURKB, AZU1, HLA-B, HLA-DMB, PF4) and others have been found to play important roles in different leukemias (e.g., CDCA3, RPL18A, PRG3, TLX3). In addition, increased expression of BCL2 in the accelerated and blast phase indicates that venetoclax could be a potential treatment option. Moreover, a characteristic signaling pathway signature with increased expression of cytokine and ECM receptor interaction pathway genes distinguished imatinib-resistant patients from each individual CML phase. Overall, our comparative analysis contributes to an in-depth molecular characterization of similarities and differences of the CML phases and provides hints for the identification of patients that may not profit from an imatinib therapy, which could support the development of additional treatment strategies.",,"['Schwarz, Annemarie', 'Roeder, Ingo', 'Seifert, Michael']","['Schwarz A', 'Roeder I', 'Seifert M']","['Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), D-01307 Dresden, Germany: German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), D-01328 Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), D-01307 Dresden, Germany: German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), D-01328 Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220105,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['accelerated phase', 'blast crisis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'chronic phase', 'comparative transcriptome analysis', 'computational cancer genomics']",2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:01,['2022/01/11 01:02'],"['2021/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 01:02 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers14010256 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers14010256 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2022 Jan 5;14(1). pii: cancers14010256. doi: 10.3390/cancers14010256.,14,1,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2844-053X'],,PMC8750437,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed computational analyses consisting of genome-wide methylation and transcriptomic profiles and developed a prognostics model for the TYAs with MB. We identified that TYAs predominantly comprised of Group 4 (40%) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-activated (33%) tumours, with Wingless-type (WNT, 17%) and Group 3 (10%) being less common. TYAs with SHH tumours displayed significantly more gene expression alterations, whereas no gene was detected in the Group 4 tumours. Across MB subgroups, we identified unique and shared sets of TYA-specific differentially methylated probes and DNA-binding motifs. Finally, a 22-gene signature stratified TYA patients into high- and low-risk groups, and the prognostic significance of these risk groups persisted in multivariable regression models (P = 0.001).

One of the side effects of RT includes damage of normal tissue in close proximity to the treated tumor. This problem can be solved by applying cancer specific radiosensitizers. N-Alkylaminoferrocene-based (NAAF) prodrugs produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells, but not in normal cells. Therefore, they can potentially act as cancer specific radiosensitizers. However, early NAAF prodrugs did not exhibit this property. Since functional mitochondria are important for RT resistance, we assumed that NAAF prodrugs affecting mitochondria in parallel with increasing intracellular ROS can potentially exhibit synergy with RT. We applied sequential Cu(+)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloadditions (CuAAC) to obtain a series of NAAF derivatives with the goal of improving anticancer efficacies over already existing compounds. One of the obtained prodrugs (2c) exhibited high anticancer activity with IC50 values in the range of 5-7.1 microM in human ovarian carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, pancreatic carcinoma and T-cell leukemia cells retained moderate water solubility and showed cancer specificity. 2c strongly affects mitochondria of cancer cells, leading to the amplification of mitochondrial and total ROS production and thus causing cell death via necrosis and apoptosis. We observed that 2c acts as a radiosensitizer in human head and neck squamous carcinoma cells. This is the first demonstration of a synergy between the radiotherapy and NAAF-based ROS amplifiers.",,"['Xu, Hong-Gui', 'Reshetnikov, Viktor', 'Wondrak, Marit', 'Eckhardt, Lisa', 'Kunz-Schughart, Leoni A', 'Janko, Christina', 'Tietze, Rainer', 'Alexiou, Christoph', 'Borchardt, Hannes', 'Aigner, Achim', 'Gong, Wenjie', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Sellner, Leopold', 'Daum, Steffen', 'Ozkan, Hulya Gizem', 'Mokhir, Andriy']","['Xu HG', 'Reshetnikov V', 'Wondrak M', 'Eckhardt L', 'Kunz-Schughart LA', 'Janko C', 'Tietze R', 'Alexiou C', 'Borchardt H', 'Aigner A', 'Gong W', 'Schmitt M', 'Sellner L', 'Daum S', 'Ozkan HG', 'Mokhir A']","['Organic Chemistry Chair II, Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Str. 10, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Organic Chemistry Chair II, Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Str. 10, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.', 'OncoRay-National Center for Radiation Research in Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden and Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'OncoRay-National Center for Radiation Research in Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden and Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'OncoRay-National Center for Radiation Research in Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden and Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Partner Site Dresden, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Section of Experimental Oncology and Nanomedicine (SEON), Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Section of Experimental Oncology and Nanomedicine (SEON), Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Section of Experimental Oncology and Nanomedicine (SEON), Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Rudolf-Boehm-Institute for Pharmacology and Toxicology, Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Leipzig University, 04107 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Rudolf-Boehm-Institute for Pharmacology and Toxicology, Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Leipzig University, 04107 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Organic Chemistry Chair II, Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Str. 10, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Merck, Im Laternenacker 5, 8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland.', 'Organic Chemistry Chair II, Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Str. 10, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Organic Chemistry Chair II, Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Str. 10, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211231,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['N-alkylaminoferrocene', 'cancer', 'mitochondrion', 'prodrug', 'radiotherapy', 'reactive oxygen species']",2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:01,['2022/01/11 01:02'],"['2021/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 01:02 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers14010208 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers14010208 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 31;14(1). pii: cancers14010208. doi: 10.3390/cancers14010208.,14,1,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3912-6594', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5705-6329', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2778-6256', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1579-1509', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7893-401X']","['MO 1418 / 7-2/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'Horizon 2020 research and an innovation program FET Open under grant agreement No', '861878 (project ""NeutroCure"")./European Union', 'Emerging Field Initiative, project ""Chemistry in Live', 'Cells""/Friedrich-Alexander-University (FAU) of Erlangen-Nurnberg']",PMC8750417,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From its classification, further studies were performed to evaluate its carcinogenicity. The aim of the systematic review is to update the evidence on occupational exposure to formaldehyde and cancer onset. METHODS: The review, in accordance with the PRISMA statement, includes articles in English reporting original results of studies conducted on workers exposed to formaldehyde, considering all types of cancer, published from 1 January 2000 to 30 July 2021 and selected from the Pubmed and Scopus databases. The studies' quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: A total of 21 articles were included, conducted in different European, American, and Asian countries. The most investigated occupational areas are those characterized by a deliberate use of formaldehyde. Some studies evaluated all types of cancer, whereas others focused on specific sites such as thyroid and respiratory, lymphohematopoietic, or central nervous systems. The results showed weak associations with lung cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the need for further original studies carried out on representative samples of workers exposed to measured levels of FA.

A significant proportion of these survivors can experience long-term emotional and psychosocial problems. However, the exact risk factors remain inconclusive. We investigated potential risk factors for decreased daily life quality and life challenges in long-term childhood ALL survivors enrolled between 1971 and 1998 in EORTC studies. METHODS: self-report questionnaires were collected from 186 survivors (109 females; mean age at diagnosis 5.62 years, range 0.2-14.7; median time since diagnosis of 20.5 years (12.9-41.6)), including the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) and Impact of Cancer-Childhood Survivors (IOC-CS). Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the impact of gender, age at diagnosis, relapse/second neoplasm, National Cancer Institute (NCI) risk group and cranial radiotherapy on 2 subscales of the SF-12 (physical and mental health) and five subscales of the IOC-CS (life challenges, body and health, personal growth, thinking and memory problems and socializing). RESULTS: mental component scores of SF-12 were not significantly associated with any risk factor. Physical component scores were lower in relapsed, irradiated and NCI high-risk patients. Regarding IOC-CS negative impact subscales, life challenges was more negatively impacted by cancer in female, younger (i.e., <6 years) and relapsed patients. Regarding the positive impact scales, personal growth was more positively impacted in relapsed patients, whereas body and health, and socializing, were less positively impacted in these patients, compared to non-relapsed patients. Socializing was more positively impacted in older patients (>6 years). CONCLUSIONS: this study demonstrates that long-term outcomes can be both adverse and positive, depending on the patient's demographic and clinical characteristics. Younger, female, and relapsed patients might encounter more life challenges years after their disease, while physical challenges could occur more often in relapsed and high-risk patients. Finally, the positive effect on socializing in the older patients sheds new light on the importance of peer interactions for this subgroup. Specific individual challenges thus need specialized support for specific subgroups.",,"['Sleurs, Charlotte', 'Musoro, Jammbe', 'Rowsell, Ali', 'Kicinski, Michal', 'Suciu, Stefan', 'Chantziara, Sofia', 'Coens, Corneel', 'Pe, Madeline', 'Missotten, Pierre', 'Vandecruys, Els', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Dresse, Marie-Francoise', 'Pluchart, Claire', 'Ferster, Alina', 'Freycon, Claire', 'van der Werff Ten Bosch, Jutte', 'Rohrlich, Pierre-Simon', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Darlington, Anne-Sophie', 'Piette, Caroline']","['Sleurs C', 'Musoro J', 'Rowsell A', 'Kicinski M', 'Suciu S', 'Chantziara S', 'Coens C', 'Pe M', 'Missotten P', 'Vandecruys E', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Dresse MF', 'Pluchart C', 'Ferster A', 'Freycon C', 'van der Werff Ten Bosch J', 'Rohrlich PS', 'Benoit Y', 'Darlington AS', 'Piette C']","['Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), 1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), 1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), 1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), 1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), 1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Unite de Psychologie de la Senescence, Universite de Liege, 4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ghent University Hospital, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Division of Haematology-Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital Liege, University of Liege, 4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Haematology and Oncology, CHU Reims, 51100 Reims, France.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, HUDERF (ULB), 1020 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, CHU Grenoble, 38700 Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Pediatrics, UZ Brussel, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Oncology, CHU Nice, 06200 Nice, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ghent University Hospital, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'Division of Haematology-Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital Liege, University of Liege, 4000 Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211229,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'long-term survivorship', 'quality of life']",2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:01,['2022/01/11 01:02'],"['2021/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 01:02 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers14010152 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers14010152 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 29;14(1). pii: cancers14010152. doi: 10.3390/cancers14010152.,14,1,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4480-8330', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5644-424X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9777-1519', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9920-8359']","['QOL grant 013/2016/Fonds Cancer', 'NA/Vzw Kinderkankerfonds', 'NA/Kom op tegen Kanker']",PMC8750449,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the eight patients who remain alive, four are continuing on venetoclax combination therapy, and four proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Three patients who initially achieved CR, later relapsed, and are deceased. Nine patients are deceased, and one patient was lost to follow-up. Overall survival is 9.14 months (range 1.1-33.1), and progression-free survival is 7.34 months (range 0.2-33.1).

We studied neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in CML and evaluated the effect of TKIs on NET formation. Neutrophils isolated from treatment-naive patients with CML showed a significant increase in NET formation compared to matched controls at baseline and after stimulation with ionomycin (IO) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Expression of citrullinated histone H3 (H3cit), peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly higher in CML samples compared to controls. Pre-treatment of neutrophils with TKIs was associated with a differential effect on NET formation, and ponatinib significantly augmented NET-associated elastase and ROS levels as compared to controls and other TKIs. BCR-ABL1 retroviral transduced HoxB8-immortalized mouse hematopoietic progenitors, which differentiate into neutrophils in-vitro, demonstrated increased H3cit & myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression consistent with excess NET formation. This was inhibited by Cl-amidine, a PAD4 inhibitor, but not by the NADPH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). Ponatinib pre-exposure significantly increased H3cit expression in HoxB8-BCR-ABL1 cells after stimulation with IO. In summary, CML is associated with increased NET formation, which is augmented by ponatinib, suggesting a possible role for NETs in promoting vascular toxicity in CML.",,"['Telerman, Alona', 'Granot, Galit', 'Leibovitch, Chiya', 'Yarchovsky-Dolberg, Osnat', 'Shacham-Abulafia, Adi', 'Partouche, Shirly', 'Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Ellis, Martin H', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Wolach, Ofir']","['Telerman A', 'Granot G', 'Leibovitch C', 'Yarchovsky-Dolberg O', 'Shacham-Abulafia A', 'Partouche S', 'Yeshurun M', 'Ellis MH', 'Raanani P', 'Wolach O']","['Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petah-Tikva 4941492, Israel.', 'Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petah-Tikva 4941492, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv 39040, Israel.', 'Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Institute of Hematology, Beilinson Hospital, Petah-Tikva 4941492, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv 39040, Israel.', 'Meir Medical Center, Hematology Institute and Blood Bank, Kfar Saba 4428164, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv 39040, Israel.', 'Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Institute of Hematology, Beilinson Hospital, Petah-Tikva 4941492, Israel.', 'Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petah-Tikva 4941492, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv 39040, Israel.', 'Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Institute of Hematology, Beilinson Hospital, Petah-Tikva 4941492, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv 39040, Israel.', 'Meir Medical Center, Hematology Institute and Blood Bank, Kfar Saba 4428164, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv 39040, Israel.', 'Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Institute of Hematology, Beilinson Hospital, Petah-Tikva 4941492, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv 39040, Israel.', 'Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Institute of Hematology, Beilinson Hospital, Petah-Tikva 4941492, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211227,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'neutrophil extracellular traps', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:01,['2022/01/11 01:01'],"['2021/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 01:01 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers14010119 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers14010119 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 27;14(1). pii: cancers14010119. doi: 10.3390/cancers14010119.,14,1,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9973-639X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8662-0707']","['Cancer Research Biology Center,/Tel Aviv University']",PMC8750902,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present review aims to summarize the main milestones achieved in pediatric exercise oncology. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic review of relevant studies written in English in the electronic database PubMed (from inception to 14 August 2021). This review traces the field of pediatric exercise oncology throughout recent history based on three fundamental pillars: (i) exercise during childhood cancer treatment; (ii) exercise during/after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; and (iii) exercise after childhood cancer treatment. Accumulating evidence--although still preliminary in many cases--supports the safety and potential benefits of regular exercise (with no major contraindications in general) in the childhood cancer continuum, even during the most aggressive phases of treatment.

The isothiocyanate sulforaphane (SFN) is a well-known natural anticancer compound with remarkable pro-apoptotic activity. Its ability to promote non-apoptotic cell-death mechanisms remains poorly investigated. This work aimed to explore the capacity of SFN to induce non-apoptotic cell death modalities. SFN was tested on different acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. The mechanism of cell death was investigated using a multi-parametric approach including fluorescence microscopy, western blotting, and flow cytometry. SFN triggered different cell-death modalities in a dose-dependent manner. At 25 muM, SFN induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and at 50 muM ferroptosis was induced through depletion of glutathione (GSH), decreased GSH peroxidase 4 protein expression, and lipid peroxidation. In contrast, necroptosis was not involved in SFN-induced cell death, as demonstrated by the non-significant increase in phosphorylation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 and phosphorylation of the necroptotic effector mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase. Taken together, our results suggest that the antileukemic activity of SFN can be mediated via both ferroptotic and apoptotic cell death modalities.",,"['Greco, Giulia', 'Schnekenburger, Michael', 'Catanzaro, Elena', 'Turrini, Eleonora', 'Ferrini, Fabio', 'Sestili, Piero', 'Diederich, Marc', 'Fimognari, Carmela']","['Greco G', 'Schnekenburger M', 'Catanzaro E', 'Turrini E', 'Ferrini F', 'Sestili P', 'Diederich M', 'Fimognari C']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze per la Qualita della Vita, Alma Mater Studiorum-Universita di Bologna, Corso d'Augusto 237, 47921 Rimini, Italy."", 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9 Rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', ""Dipartimento di Scienze per la Qualita della Vita, Alma Mater Studiorum-Universita di Bologna, Corso d'Augusto 237, 47921 Rimini, Italy."", ""Dipartimento di Scienze per la Qualita della Vita, Alma Mater Studiorum-Universita di Bologna, Corso d'Augusto 237, 47921 Rimini, Italy."", 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomolecolari, Universita degli Studi di Urbino Carlo Bo, 61029 Urbino, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomolecolari, Universita degli Studi di Urbino Carlo Bo, 61029 Urbino, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Korea.', ""Dipartimento di Scienze per la Qualita della Vita, Alma Mater Studiorum-Universita di Bologna, Corso d'Augusto 237, 47921 Rimini, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211224,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['anticancer activity', 'apoptosis', 'ferroptosis', 'natural products', 'necroptosis', 'non-canonical cell death', 'sulforaphane']",2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:01,['2022/01/11 01:01'],"['2021/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 01:01 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers14010076 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers14010076 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 24;14(1). pii: cancers14010076. doi: 10.3390/cancers14010076.,14,1,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8174-9977', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0550-9538', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7699-3414', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4743-1126', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3810-1259', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9412-1660', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0115-4725', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2461-8214']","['370C-20160062/Brain Korea (BK21) FOUR and the Creative-Pioneering Researchers', 'Program', '019R1A2C-1009231/National Research Foundation (NRF)']",PMC8750507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic regulations can be altered in oncogenesis, favoring tumor progression. The development of epidrugs has allowed targeting successfully these altered epigenetic patterns in lymphoma and leukemia patients. It has been recently shown that epigenetic alterations can also play a key role in tumor immune escape. Epidrugs, like HDAC inhibitors, can prime the anti-tumor immune response, therefore constituting interesting partners to develop combination strategies with immunotherapy agents.

EVs secreted by leukemic blasts in patients with leukemia have been shown to influence the fate of recipient cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. Methods to quantify and to characterize them phenotypically are therefore urgently needed to study their functional role in leukemia development and to evaluate their potential as targets for therapy. We have used cryo-electron microscopy to study morphology and size of leukemic EVs, and nanoparticle tracking analysis and fluorescence triggering flow cytometry to quantify EVs in platelet-free plasma from a small cohort of leukemia patients and healthy blood donors. Additional studies with a capture bead-based assay allowed us to establish phenotypic signatures of leukemic EVs from 17 AML and 3 B-ALL patients by evaluating the expression of 37 surface antigens. In addition to tetraspanins and lineage-specific markers we found several adhesion molecules (CD29, and CD146) to be highly expressed by EVs from B-ALL and several leukemic stem cell antigens (CD44, CD105, CD133, and SSEA-4) to be expressed by EVs from AML patients.

Here, we present the initial characterization of 2-amino-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-4H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-3-carbonitrile (Bcr-TMP), a nanomolar-active MYB-inhibitory compound identified in a screen for novel MYB inhibitors. Bcr-TMP affects MYB function in a dual manner by inducing its degradation and suppressing its transactivation potential by disrupting its cooperation with co-activator p300. Bcr-TMP also interferes with the p300-dependent stimulation of C/EBPbeta, a transcription factor co-operating with MYB in myeloid cells, indicating that Bcr-TMP is a p300-inhibitor. Bcr-TMP reduces the viability of AML cell lines at nanomolar concentrations and induces cell-death and expression of myeloid differentiation markers. It also down-regulates the expression of MYB target genes and exerts stronger anti-proliferative effects on MYB-addicted primary murine AML cells and patient-derived ACC cells than on their non-oncogenic counterparts. Surprisingly, we observed that Bcr-TMP also has microtubule-disrupting activity, pointing to a possible link between MYB-activity and microtubule stability.

This condition can be classified based on modal chromosome number as low-hypodiploidy (30-39 chromosomes) and near-haploidy (24-29 chromosomes), with unique cytogenetic and mutational landscapes. Hypodiploid B-ALL with <40 chromosomes has an extremely poor outcome, with 5-year overall survival rates below 50% and 20% in childhood and adult B-ALL, respectively. Accordingly, this genetic feature represents an adverse prognostic factor in B-ALL and is associated with early relapse and therapy refractoriness. Notably, half of all patients with hypodiploid B-ALL with <40 chromosomes cases ultimately exhibit chromosome doubling of the hypodiploid clone, resulting in clones with 50-78 chromosomes. Doubled clones are often the major clones at diagnosis, leading to ""masked hypodiploidy"", which is clinically challenging as patients can be erroneously classified as hyperdiploid B-ALL. Here, we summarize the main cytogenetic and molecular features of hypodiploid B-ALL subtypes, and provide a brief overview of the diagnostic methods, standard-of-care treatments and overall clinical outcome. Finally, we discuss molecular mechanisms that may underlie the origin and leukemogenic impact of hypodiploidy and may open new therapeutic avenues to improve survival rates in these patients.",,"['Molina, Oscar', 'Bataller, Alex', 'Thampi, Namitha', 'Ribera, Jordi', 'Granada, Isabel', 'Velasco, Pablo', 'Fuster, Jose Luis', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Molina O', 'Bataller A', 'Thampi N', 'Ribera J', 'Granada I', 'Velasco P', 'Fuster JL', 'Menendez P']","['Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Group, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Autonomous University of Barcelona, 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Group, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Autonomous University of Barcelona, 08916 Badalona, Spain.', ""Cytogenetics Laboratory, Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia (ICO), Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, 08916 Badalona, Spain."", ""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Department, Hospital Vall d'Hebron, 08035 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria (IMIB), 30120 Murcia, Spain.', 'Spanish Network for Advanced Therapies RICORS-TERAV, ISCIII, 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Campus Clinic, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Spanish Network for Advanced Therapies RICORS-TERAV, ISCIII, 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBER-ONC), ISCIII, 28029 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), 08010 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211222,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'clinical biomarkers', 'hypodiploidy', 'near-haploidy', 'patient stratification']",2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:01,['2022/01/11 01:01'],"['2021/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 01:01 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers14010032 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers14010032 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 22;14(1). pii: cancers14010032. doi: 10.3390/cancers14010032.,14,1,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7585-4519', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6085-2745', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7331-9483', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4881-9440']",,PMC8750410,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are well-established CLL prognostic biomarkers that have transformed treatment and improved the understanding of CLL biology. Here, we have studied the clinical significance of two crucial B cell regulators, BACH2 (BTB and CNC homology 1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor 2) and BCL6 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6), in a cohort of 102 CLL patients and determined the protein interaction networks that they participate in using MEC-1 CLL cells. We observed that CLL patients expressing low levels of BCL6 and BACH2 RNA had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than high BCL6- and BACH2-expressing cases. Notably, their low expression specifically decreased the OS of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region-mutated (IGHV-M) CLL patients, as well as those with 11q and 13q deletions. Similar to the RNA data, a low BACH2 protein expression was associated with a significantly shorter OS than a high expression. There was no direct interaction observed between BACH2 and BCL6 in MEC-1 CLL cells, but they shared protein networks that included fifty different proteins. Interestingly, a prognostic index (PI) model that we generated, using integrative risk score values of BACH2 RNA expression, age, and 17p deletion status, predicted patient outcomes in our cohort. Taken together, these data have shown for the first time a possible prognostic role for BACH2 in CLL and have revealed protein interaction networks shared by BCL6 and BACH2, indicating a significant role for BACH2 and BCL6 in key cellular processes, including ubiquitination mediated B-cell receptor functions, nucleic acid metabolism, protein degradation, and homeostasis in CLL biology.",,"['Ciardullo, Carmela', 'Szoltysek, Katarzyna', 'Zhou, Peixun', 'Pietrowska, Monika', 'Marczak, Lukasz', 'Willmore, Elaine', 'Enshaei, Amir', 'Walaszczyk, Anna', 'Ho, Jia Yee', 'Rand, Vikki', 'Marshall, Scott', 'Hall, Andrew G', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Soundararajan, Meera', 'Eswaran, Jeyanthy']","['Ciardullo C', 'Szoltysek K', 'Zhou P', 'Pietrowska M', 'Marczak L', 'Willmore E', 'Enshaei A', 'Walaszczyk A', 'Ho JY', 'Rand V', 'Marshall S', 'Hall AG', 'Harrison CJ', 'Soundararajan M', 'Eswaran J']","['Department of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 8ST, UK.', 'Translational & Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Translational & Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute, Oncology Center, Gliwice Branch, 02-034 Warszawa, Poland.', 'School of Health & Life Sciences, Teesside University, Middlesbrough TS1 3JN, UK.', 'National Horizons Centre, Teesside University, Darlington DL1 1HG, UK.', 'Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute, Oncology Center, Gliwice Branch, 02-034 Warszawa, Poland.', 'Department of Natural Products Biochemistry, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, 61-704 Poznan, Poland.', 'Translational & Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Translational & Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia, EduCity Iskandar, Johor 79200, Malaysia.', 'School of Health & Life Sciences, Teesside University, Middlesbrough TS1 3JN, UK.', 'National Horizons Centre, Teesside University, Darlington DL1 1HG, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Trust, Sunderland SR4 7TP, UK.', 'Translational & Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Translational & Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Department of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 8ST, UK.', 'Translational & Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK.', 'Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia, EduCity Iskandar, Johor 79200, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211221,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['BACH2', 'BCL6', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)', 'coimmunoprecipitation and proteomics', 'prognosticator', 'tumour suppressor']",2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:01,['2022/01/11 01:01'],"['2021/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 01:01 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers14010023 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers14010023 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 21;14(1). pii: cancers14010023. doi: 10.3390/cancers14010023.,14,1,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4379-5221', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2498-5986', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9317-7822', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2859-4491', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4687-0151']",,PMC8750551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While in most patient samples the presence of NLC in co-cultures guarantees high viability of leukemic cells in vitro, in some cases this protective effect is absent. These macrophages are characterized by an ""M1-like phenotype"". We show here that their reprogramming towards an M2-like phenotype (tumor-supportive) with IL-10 leads to an increase in leukemic cell survival. Inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, are also able to depolarize M2-type protective NLC (decreasing CLL cell viability), an effect which is countered by IL-10 or blocking antibodies. Interestingly, both IL-10 and TNF are implied in the pathophysiology of CLL and their elevated level is associated with bad prognosis. We propose that the molecular balance between these two cytokines in CLL niches plays an important role in the maintenance of the protective phenotype of NLCs, and therefore in the survival of CLL cells.",,"['Domagala, Marcin', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Ligat, Laetitia', 'Lopez, Frederic', 'Fournie, Jean-Jacques', 'Laurent, Camille', 'Poupot, Mary']","['Domagala M', 'Ysebaert L', 'Ligat L', 'Lopez F', 'Fournie JJ', 'Laurent C', 'Poupot M']","['Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Inserm UMR1037, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, 31400 Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Inserm UMR1037, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, 31400 Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'IUCT-O, 31000 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Inserm UMR1037, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, 31400 Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Inserm UMR1037, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, 31400 Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Inserm UMR1037, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, 31400 Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Inserm UMR1037, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, 31400 Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'IUCT-O, 31000 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Inserm UMR1037, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Toulouse III Paul-Sabatier, 31400 Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 CNRS, 31037 Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211221,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'IL-10', 'Nurse-like cells', 'TNF', 'polarization', 'survival']",2022/01/12 06:00,2022/01/12 06:01,['2022/01/11 01:01'],"['2021/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/11 01:01 [entrez]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers14010016 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers14010016 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 21;14(1). pii: cancers14010016. doi: 10.3390/cancers14010016.,14,1,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3821-2901', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4102-7261', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2688-1091']",,PMC8750769,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on unsupervised clustering with 567 most variably methylated CpG sites, patients were categorized into four clusters associated with genetic alterations. Clusters 1 and 3 were characterized by the presence of known favorable prognostic factors, such as RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion and KMT2A rearrangement with low MECOM expression, and biallelic CEBPA mutations (all 8 patients), respectively. Clusters 2 and 4 comprised patients exhibiting molecular features associated with adverse outcomes, namely FLT3-ITD, KMT2A-PTD, and high PRDM16 expression. Depending on the methylation values of the 1243 CpG sites that were significantly different between FLT3-ITD positive and negative AML, patients were categorized into three clusters: A, B, and C. The STAT5-binding motif was most frequently found close to the 1,243 CpG sites. All eight patients with FLT3-ITD in Cluster A harbored high PRDM16 expression and experienced adverse events, whereas only one of seven patients with FLT3-ITD in the other clusters experienced adverse events. PRDM16 expression levels were also related to DNA methylation patterns, which were drastically changed at the cutoff value of PRDM16/ABL1 = 0.10. The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing of AMLs supported enhanced chromatin accessibilities around genomic regions, such as HOXB cluster genes, SCHIP1, and PRDM16, which were associated with DNA methylation changes in AMLs with FLT3-ITD and high PRDM16 expression. Our results suggest that DNA methylation levels at specific CpG sites are useful to support genetic alterations and gene expression patterns of patients with pediatric AML.",['Copyright (c) 2022 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Yamato, Genki', 'Kawai, Tomoko', 'Shiba, Norio', 'Ikeda, Junji', 'Hara, Yusuke', 'Ohki, Kentaro', 'Tsujimoto, Shin-Ichi', 'Kaburagi, Taeko', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Sotomatsu, Manabu', 'Arakawa, Hirokazu', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Hata, Kenichiro', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Yamato G', 'Kawai T', 'Shiba N', 'Ikeda J', 'Hara Y', 'Ohki K', 'Tsujimoto SI', 'Kaburagi T', 'Yoshida K', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Miyano S', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Tomizawa D', 'Shimada A', 'Sotomatsu M', 'Arakawa H', 'Adachi S', 'Taga T', 'Horibe K', 'Ogawa S', 'Hata K', 'Hayashi Y']","['Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine,, Japan.', 'National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Yokohama City University, Japan.', 'Yokohama City University Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.', 'National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Gunma Childrens Medical Center, Gunma, Japan.', 'Kyoto Univeristy, Kyoto, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'The University of Tokyo, Japan.', 'National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Okayama University, Japan.', 'GCMC, Shibukawa, Japan.', 'Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan.', 'Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Gunma Children's Medical Center, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220110,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2022/01/10 20:37'],"['2021/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/10 20:37 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['483410 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005381 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Adv. 2022 Jan 10. pii: 483410. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005381.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8137-0334', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1520-7007', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6251-6059', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7778-5374', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7809-7637']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe the successful clinical course and multiple key interventions administered to an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient, who tested SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-PCR on day -1 of matched unrelated donor (SARS-CoV-2 IgG negative) T-cell-replete HCT. This experience allowed for implementing a virologic and immunomonitoring panel to characterize the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the recipient's nascent humoral and cellular immune response. The finding of robust, functional, and persistent levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells, starting early after transplant was unexpected, and in combination with the clinical strategy may have contributed to the favorable outcome. Additionally, it is plausible that pre-existing cross-reactive endemic coronavirus immunity in the allogeneic graft reduced recipient susceptibility to COVID-19 disease. This case supports the critical role that T-cell responses may play in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in the context of transplant immunosuppression, in which reconstitution of humoral response is commonly delayed.

Here we report on an expanded bicenter cohort of 33 patients, <25 years of age, with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML treated with up to 2 cycles of the TVTC reinduction regimen from 2007 to 2018. The overall response rate (ORR), defined as complete remission (CR) or CR with partial recovery of platelet count (CRp), was 71.4% (95%CI: 41.9 to 91.6%) for those patients in first relapse (n=14) and 47.4% ( 95%CI: 24.4 to 71.1%) for patients in 2nd or greater relapse or refractory disease.

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent a consultation with the PM AYA program from 2014 to 2020. The association between the health domain concerns reported and age at consultation, cancer diagnoses, and time since diagnosis was analyzed using chi-square test of independence in SPSS. Results: In our cohort of 1128 AYA, the median age at assessment was 28.2 years. The most common diagnoses were lymphoma (n = 251, 22.2%), leukemia (n = 207, 18.4%), and breast cancer (n = 162, 14.4%). The most common concerns reported were related to fertility (n = 882, 78.2%) and work/school (n = 472, 41.8%). Fertility concerns were most common in 25-34 age group (443/540, 82.0%) and work-/school-related concerns were highest in 18-24 age group (191/355, 53.8%). Diagnoses significantly affect majority of concerns reported. Fertility concerns were most common in AYA consulted near diagnosis, while body image-, exercise-, and diet-related concerns were more frequently reported, while on active treatments. Conclusions: Supporting fertility concerns remains the cornerstone of any successful AYA program. Work-/school-related concerns deserve more elucidation and attention. We identified important patterns in the health-related concerns of AYA, especially as they relate to age, diagnoses, and time since diagnosis. This insight will guide us for improving patient-centered care delivery to AYA.",,"['Pitch, Natalie', 'Stefaniuk, Stephanie', 'MacMillan, Meghan', 'Catsburg, Jennifer', 'Gupta, Abha A', 'Vora, Tushar']","['Pitch N', 'Stefaniuk S', 'MacMillan M', 'Catsburg J', 'Gupta AA', 'Vora T']","['Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Adolescent and Young Adult Program, Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Adolescent and Young Adult Program, Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Adolescent and Young Adult Program, Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Alberta Health Services, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Adolescent and Young Adult Program, Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Adolescent and Young Adult Program, Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Adolescent and Young Adult Program, Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220107,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['AYA concerns', 'adolescent and young adult', 'program analysis', 'survivorship']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2022/01/10 20:14'],"['2022/01/10 20:14 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jayao.2021.0156 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2022 Jan 7. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2021.0156.,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5469-056X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Newly diagnosed AML aged over 60 years who received intensive chemotherapy consisting of cytarabine and idarubicin (n=105) were enrolled prospectively. Pretreatment GA included evaluations for social and nutritional support, cognition, depression, distress, and physical function. The median age was 64 years (range, 60-75), and 93% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score <2. Between 32.4% and 69.5% of patients met the criteria for impairment for each domain of GA. Physical impairment by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and cognitive dysfunction by the Mini-Mental State Examination in the Korean version of the CERAD Assessment Packet (MMSE-KC) were significantly associated with non-fatal toxicities, including grade III-IV infections (SPPB, P=0.024; MMSE-KC, P=0.044), acute renal failure (SPPB, P=0.013), and/or prolonged hospitalization ((3)40 days) during induction chemotherapy (MMSE-KC, P=0.005). Reduced physical function by SPPB and depressive symptoms by the Korean version of the short form of geriatric depression scales (SGDS-K) were significantly associated with inferior survival (SPPB, P=0.027; SGDS-K, P=0.048). Gait speed or sit-and-stand speed was the single powerful tool to predict survival outcomes. Notably, the addition of SPPB and SGDS-K, gait speed and SGDS-K, or sit-and-stand speed and SGDS-K significantly improved the power of existing survival prediction models. In conclusion, GA improved risk stratification for treatment decisions and may inform interventions to improve outcomes for older adults with AML.

Naive T cells (TN) cause severe GVHD in murine models. We evaluated chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and other outcomes in three phase II clinical trials of TN-depletion of peripheral blood stem-cell (PBSC) grafts. METHODS: One hundred thirty-eight patients with acute leukemia received TN-depleted PBSC from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors following conditioning with high- or intermediate-dose total-body irradiation and chemotherapy. GVHD prophylaxis was with tacrolimus, with or without methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. Subjects received CD34-selected PBSC and a defined dose of memory T cells depleted of TN. Median follow-up was 4 years. The primary outcome of the analysis of cumulative data from the three trials was cGVHD. RESULTS: cGVHD was very infrequent and mild (3-year cumulative incidence total, 7% [95% CI, 2 to 11]; moderate, 1% [95% CI, 0 to 2]; severe, 0%). Grade III and IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) occurred in 4% (95% CI, 1 to 8) and 0%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade II aGVHD, which was mostly stage 1 upper gastrointestinal GVHD, was 71% (95% CI, 64 to 79). Recipients of matched related donor and matched unrelated donor grafts had similar rates of grade III aGVHD (5% [95% CI, 0 to 9] and 4% [95% CI, 0 to 9]) and cGVHD (7% [95% CI, 2 to 13] and 6% [95% CI, 0 to 12]). Overall survival, cGVHD-free, relapse-free survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality were, respectively, 77% (95% CI, 71 to 85), 68% (95% CI, 61 to 76), 23% (95% CI, 16 to 30), and 8% (95% CI, 3 to 13) at 3 years. CONCLUSION: Depletion of TN from PBSC allografts results in very low incidences of severe acute and any cGVHD, without apparent excess risks of relapse or nonrelapse mortality, distinguishing this novel graft engineering strategy from other hematopoietic cell transplantation approaches.",,"['Bleakley, Marie', 'Sehgal, Alison', 'Seropian, Stuart', 'Biernacki, Melinda A', 'Krakow, Elizabeth F', 'Dahlberg, Ann', 'Persinger, Heather', 'Hilzinger, Barbara', 'Martin, Paul J', 'Carpenter, Paul A', 'Flowers, Mary E', 'Voutsinas, Jenna', 'Gooley, Theodore A', 'Loeb, Keith', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Heimfeld, Shelly', 'Riddell, Stanley R', 'Shlomchik, Warren D']","['Bleakley M', 'Sehgal A', 'Seropian S', 'Biernacki MA', 'Krakow EF', 'Dahlberg A', 'Persinger H', 'Hilzinger B', 'Martin PJ', 'Carpenter PA', 'Flowers ME', 'Voutsinas J', 'Gooley TA', 'Loeb K', 'Wood BL', 'Heimfeld S', 'Riddell SR', 'Shlomchik WD']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington School of Public Health, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'The Starzl Transplantation Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220110,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,,2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2022/01/10 17:15'],"['2022/01/10 17:15 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JCO.21.01755 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Clin Oncol. 2022 Jan 10:JCO2101755. doi: 10.1200/JCO.21.01755.,,,JCO2101755,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7018-8702', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4398-8616', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9051-1215', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5021-0714', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1631-0911', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3305-0261', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7414-3969', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4688-9920']",,,,"['Marie BleakleyStock and Other Ownership Interests: HighPass BioConsulting or', 'Advisory Role: HighPass Bio, Orca BioResearch Funding: HighPass BioPatents,', 'Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: TCRs specific for minor', 'histocompatibility antigen HA-1 and uses thereof US20190211076A1 and', 'international.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-arm phase II trial enrolled patients age 1-21 years with R/R CD22-positive B-ALL. In cycle 1, InO dosing was 0.8 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 and 0.5 mg/m(2) on days 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle with response evaluation at day 28. Using a two-stage design, the trial was continuously monitored for dose-limiting toxicities and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). CD22 expression was retrospectively evaluated by central flow cytometry. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were evaluable for response and toxicity; 19 had complete response (CR) and nine CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) after cycle 1 (CR/CRi rate: 58.3%; two-sided 90% CI, 46.5 to 69.3). Twenty-seven of 28 patients with CR or CRi had minimal residual disease measured by flow cytometry; 18 (66.7%) had minimal residual disease < 0.01%. Seven of 28 patients (25%) with CR or CRi had delayed count recovery past day 42 in cycle 1. Three (6.3%) patients had grade 3 ALT elevation and one patient had grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia in cycle 1. Of 21 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation after InO, 6 (28.6%) developed grade 3 SOS. Partial CD22 expression and lower CD22 site density were associated with lower likelihood of response to InO. CONCLUSION: InO is effective and well tolerated in heavily pretreated children and adolescents with R/R CD22-positive B-ALL. SOS after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and prolonged cytopenias were notable. CD22 modulation was identified as a mechanism of resistance.

Subsequently, cell subpopulations with similar characteristics were detected in various kinds of solid cancers and were denoted as cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells are presently presumed to be crucially involved in malignant progression of solid cancer: chemoresitance, radioresistance, immune evasion, and metastasis. On the contrary, less attention has been paid to cancer non-stem cell population, which comprise most cancer cells in cancer tissues, due to the lack of suitable markers to discriminate cancer non-stem cells from cancer stem cells. Chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells generate a larger number of morphologically distinct non-stem cells. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that poor prognosis is associated with the increases in these non-stem cells including basophils and megakaryocytes. We will discuss the potential roles of cancer non-stem cells in fostering tumor microenvironment, by illustrating the roles of chronic myeloid leukemia non-stem cells including basophils and megakaryocytes in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia, a typical malignant disorder arising from leukemic stem cells.",['(c) 2021.

CLL is treated with ibrutinib. During the course of ibrutinib therapy, bleeding and cardiac arrhythmias may occur. Non-hemorrhagic adverse events are extremely infrequent in individuals using ibrutinib. CASE REPORT: A 64 year-old man was diagnosed with CLL in June 2016. He was treated with 6 courses of FCR, he stayed in remission for 3 years and then relapsed. He achieved partial remission after two months of therapy with ibrutinib. The patient was admitted to the hospital with fever and shortness of breath. Pericardial tamponade and effusion was diagnosed during his evaluation. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Non-hemorrhagic exudative effusion was drained by pericardiocentesis and a pericardial catheter was inserted to drain pericardial effusion. In all pleural and pericardial effusion samples, pathological and flow cytometric examination revealed no atypical malignant cells for malignancy, including CLL. Infections, both bacterial and viral, were also undetectable in the samples, as were rheumatological markers of collagen vascular disease. Ibrutinib therapy was discontinued. The pericardial effusion and tamponade were linked to ibrutinib treatment after evaluating the adverse drug reaction probability scale with a total score of 6. Colchicine was administered to reduce the pericardial effusion. The catheter was removed; pericardial effusion did not reoccur during follow up visits. DISCUSSION: Serious adverse events of ibrutinib are seen when treating CLL patients. This group of individuals should be closely monitored for potentially serious complications such as pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade.",,"['Aslan Candir, Burcu', 'Yigenoglu, Tugce Nur', 'Kizil Cakar, Merih', 'Dal, Mehmet Sinan', 'Altuntas, Fevzi']","['Aslan Candir B', 'Yigenoglu TN', 'Kizil Cakar M', 'Dal MS', 'Altuntas F']","['Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220110,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Pericardial tamponade', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2022/01/10 12:19'],"['2022/01/10 12:19 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211073885 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2022 Jan 10:10781552211073885. doi: 10.1177/10781552211073885.,,,10781552211073885,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3386-8984', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4204-7515', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5994-2735']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accurate myocarditis incidence rate is difficult to determine because of the clinical limitations of an endomyocardial biopsy. The primary pathogenesis of eosinophilic myocarditis is the release of related substances by eosinophils, leading to cell membrane damage and cell destruction. However, evidence suggests that specific genes play a role in myocarditis development.As CMR imaging availability increases, the diagnosis rate of eosinophilic myocarditis will increase. The diagnosis of myocarditis mainly depends on an endocardial biopsy. Glucocorticoids can relieve patients' symptoms, but the early use of steroids may prevent intermediate disease stage development (i.e., thrombonecrosis and fibrosis with wall thrombosis). Anticoagulant therapy may also affect disease development. In addition to routine follow-up, a regular myocardial biopsy should be considered for discharged patients, if possible.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Zhong, Zezhong', 'Yang, Zicong', 'Peng, Yiming', 'Wang, Lei', 'Yuan, Xuming']","['Zhong Z', 'Yang Z', 'Peng Y', 'Wang L', 'Yuan X']","[""Department of Cardiology, Liuyang People's Hospital, Nanhua University, Hunan Province, 410300, China."", ""People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 530021, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, Liuyang People's Hospital, Nanhua University, Hunan Province, 410300, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, Liuyang People's Hospital, Nanhua University, Hunan Province, 410300, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, Liuyang People's Hospital, Nanhua University, Hunan Province, 410300, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210902,Netherlands,J Transl Autoimmun,Journal of translational autoimmunity,101759413,,['NOTNLM'],"['ANCA, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody', 'CEL, chronic eosinophilic leukemia.', 'CMR, cardiac magnetic resonance', 'Cardiac magnetic resonance', 'EAM, experimental autoimmune myocarditis', 'ECG, electrocardiogram', 'ECP, eosinophilic cationic protein', 'EGE, early gadolinium enhancement, LGE, late gadolinium enhancement', 'EGPA, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis', 'EMB, endomyocardial biopsy', 'Endomyocardial biopsy', 'Eosinophilic myocarditis', 'FIP1L1-PDGFRA, FIP1-like1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha', 'Glucocorticoids', 'HES, hypereosinophilic syndrome', 'IFNgamma, interferon gamma']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:34'],"['2021/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:34 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jtauto.2021.100118 [doi]', 'S2589-9090(21)00038-1 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Autoimmun. 2021 Sep 2;4:100118. doi: 10.1016/j.jtauto.2021.100118. eCollection 2021.,4,,100118,,,,PMC8716607,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Material and Methods. Eighty-six hepatic carcinoma (HCC) tissue specimens and 86 corresponding adjacent tissue specimens were collected, and the mRNA expression of miR-10b-5p and Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) in the specimens was determined using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Western blot was employed to quantify EphA2, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and Caspase-3 in the cells, and CCK8, Transwell assay, and flow cytometry were applied to evaluate the proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of cells, respectively. Moreover, the dual luciferase reporter assay was utilized for correlation analysis between miR-10b-5p and EphA2. Results: miR-10b-5p was lowly expressed in HCC, while EphA2 was highly expressed. Cell experiments revealed that miR-10b-5p overexpression or EphA2 knockdown could reduce cell proliferation, accelerate apoptosis, strongly upregulate Bax and Caspase-3, and downregulate Bcl-2. In contrast, miR-10b-5p knockdown or EphA2 overexpression gave rise to reverse biological phenotypes. Furthermore, dual luciferase reporter assay verified that miR-10b-5p was a target of EphA2, and the rescue experiment implied that transfection of pCMV-EphA2 or Si-EphA2 could reverse EphA2 expression and cell biological functions caused by miR-10b-5p overexpression or knockdown. Conclusions: miR-10b-5p reduced HCC cell proliferation but accelerate apoptosis by regulating EphA2, suggesting it has the potential to be a clinical target for HCC.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Xu Niu et al.'],"['Niu, Xu', 'Sun, Haitao', 'Qiu, Feng', 'Liu, Jing', 'Yang, Tianchi', 'Han, Wei']","['Niu X', 'Sun H', 'Qiu F', 'Liu J', 'Yang T', 'Han W']","['General Surgery, Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 101100, China.', 'General Surgery, Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 101100, China.', 'General Surgery, Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 101100, China.', 'General Surgery, Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 101100, China.', 'General Surgery, Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 101100, China.', 'General Surgery, Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 101100, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211229,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,,,2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2022/01/10 09:27'],"['2021/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:27 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/1382061 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2021 Dec 29;2021:1382061. doi: 10.1155/2021/1382061. eCollection 2021.,2021,,1382061,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9143-903X'],,PMC8731268,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,20220114,"['0 (EPHA2 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN10 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA2)']","['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Erythropoietin/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptor, EphA2/*genetics', 'Transfection/methods', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LCS and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) can occur in the same diseased tissues, such as lymph nodes or skin. CASE SUMMARY: A 48-year-old female Han Chinese patient was admitted for generalized lymph node enlargement for 6 years and abdominal distension for 1 wk. She was diagnosed with small B-cell lymphoma (stage IV)/CLL (Benet stage B) and received chemotherapy. She started oral ibrutinib in February 2019. She was hospitalized on June 11, 2019, and a 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm dark-red nodule with ulceration scalp lesion was found. Biopsy revealed LCS but without CLL/SLL. She was diagnosed with CLL/SLL (Binet stage C, Rai stage IV) accompanied by secondary histiocytic sarcomas and skin LCS and received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone, and etoposide but developed severe cytopenia. She ultimately refused treatments and discharged spontaneously. She died on September 12, 2019. The literature review showed that in patients with CLL/SLL, skin lesions of LCS are accompanied by CLL/SLL. This patient was different from the previously reported cases of skin LCS in patients with CLL/SLL.

ANKL can be accompanied with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Here, we report a case of ANKL with rare skin lesions as an earlier manifestation, accompanied with HLH, and review the literature in terms of etiology, clinical manifestation, diagnosis and treatment. CASE SUMMARY: A 30-year-old woman from Northwest China presented with the clinical characteristics of jaundice, fever, erythema, splenomegaly, progressive hemocytopenia, liver failure, quantities of abnormal cells in bone marrow, and associated HLH. The immunophenotypes of abnormal cells were positive for CD2, cCD3, CD7, CD56, CD38 and negative for sCD3, CD8 and CD117. The diagnosis of ANKL complicated with HLH was confirmed. Following the initial diagnosis and supplementary treatment, the patient received chemotherapy with VDLP regimen (vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asparaginase and prednisone). However, the patient had severe adverse reactions and complication such as severe hematochezia, neutropenia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and died a few days later.

Methods: Bone marrow cells were assessed by karyotype analysis to reveal chromosomal abnormalities. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to detect MLL gene rearrangement using an MLL-specific break-apart probe. LDI-PCR and RT-PCR were performed, and the PCR products were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The sequence data of the PCR products were analyzed using bioinformatics tools. Meanwhile, clinical data were collected to evaluate the prognosis of the patient. Results: Chromosomal karyotype analysis showed that the karyotype of the patient was 46, XX, t(11;22)(q23;q11)[10]/46, XX[1]. Subsequently, FISH data confirmed MLL gene rearrangement in the patient. LDI-PCR precisely showed that SEPT5 was the MLL translocation partner gene. RT-PCR and sequencing analysis disclosed the presence of MLL-SEPT5 fusion transcript and confirmed the fusion between MLL exon 8 and SEPT5 exon 3. Moreover, the patient had a recurrence shortly after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Conclusion: Although the MLL-SEPT5 fusion transcript was occasionally described in acute myeloid leukemia, it was first identified in MDS. Patients with MLL-SEPT5 fusion gene exhibited a poor prognosis even with an aggressive treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zou, Chen, Wu, Zhang, Ouyang and Mu.']","['Zou, Duobing', 'Chen, Ying', 'Wu, Ningning', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Ouyang, Guifang', 'Mu, Qitian']","['Zou D', 'Chen Y', 'Wu N', 'Zhang Y', 'Ouyang G', 'Mu Q']","['Laboratory of Stem Cell Transplantation, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Transplantation, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Transplantation, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Transplantation, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Transplantation, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211222,Switzerland,Front Med (Lausanne),Frontiers in medicine,101648047,,['NOTNLM'],"['MLL rearrangement', 'SEPT5', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'septin', 't(11;22)(q23;q11)']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:26'],"['2021/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:26 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmed.2021.783229 [doi]'],epublish,Front Med (Lausanne). 2021 Dec 22;8:783229. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2021.783229. eCollection 2021.,8,,783229,,,,PMC8729882,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the collection efficiency of plateletpheresis (CEPP) and factors influencing its efficacy in patients with thrombocytosis. Materials and Methods: From September 2010 to December 2016, 81 patients from two institutions in China with myeloproliferative neoplasms and thrombocytosis accompanied by severe symptoms were treated with plateletpheresis by Fresenius COM. TEC machine. Results: After apheresis, the median CEPP was 20.71% (IQR: 9.99-36.69%) and median PLT reduction rate was 25.87% (IQR: 21.78-36.23%). Further analysis showed that no significant difference was observed between PLT count with 800-1,000 x 10(9)/L and > 1,000 x 10(9)/L. The PLT counts significantly decreased (P < 0.001) after plateletpheresis, the red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin (HGB), and hematocrit (HCT) levels showed no significant differences before- or after- plateletpheresis. Multivariate analysis showed that female sex (P = 0.009) and HGB (P = 0.010) before apheresis were associated with CEPP. Female (P = 0.022), HCT (P = 0.001) and blood volume (P = 0.015) were associated with the PLT reduction rate. Furthermore, symptoms were relieved after apheresis in patients whose PLT count was 800-1,000 x 10(9)/L accompanied with symptoms. Conclusions: It is reasonable to perform plateletpheresis when the PLT count is over 800 x 10(9)/L and patients are complicated by clinical symptoms such as dizziness, headache, somnolence, and stupor. Plateletpheresis is effective in removing PLTs especially in females with high HGB.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Jiang, Jin, Shang, Yuan, Liu, Li, Wang, Ding, Tong, Guo, Gong', 'and Zhou.']","['Jiang, Hongqiang', 'Jin, Yanxia', 'Shang, Yufeng', 'Yuan, Guolin', 'Liu, Dandan', 'Li, Jianfang', 'Wang, Cong', 'Ding, Lu', 'Tong, Xiqin', 'Guo, Shishang', 'Gong, Fayun', 'Zhou, Fuling']","['Jiang H', 'Jin Y', 'Shang Y', 'Yuan G', 'Liu D', 'Li J', 'Wang C', 'Ding L', 'Tong X', 'Guo S', 'Gong F', 'Zhou F']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Hubei Normal University, Huangshi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Physics and Technology and Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro- and Nano-structure of Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Mechanical Engineering, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211224,Switzerland,Front Med (Lausanne),Frontiers in medicine,101648047,,['NOTNLM'],"['collection efficiency', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'platelet', 'therapeutic apheresis', 'thrombocytosis']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:26'],"['2021/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:26 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmed.2021.762419 [doi]'],epublish,Front Med (Lausanne). 2021 Dec 24;8:762419. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2021.762419. eCollection 2021.,8,,762419,,,,PMC8738088,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDSCs have been proven to play a positive role in protecting acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Here, we aimed to describe the mechanism behind how mTOR signaling regulates MDSCs' generation and explore its prophylactic and therapeutic potential in aGVHD. Reducing mTOR expression retains myeloid cells with immature characteristics and promotes polymorphonuclear MDSC (PMN-MDSC) immunosuppressive function through STAT3-C/EBPbeta pathway. Prophylactic transfusion of mTOR(KO) PMN-MDSCs could alleviate aGVHD while maintaining the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, which could downregulate the Th1/Th2 ratio, decrease serum proinflammatory cytokines, and increase the proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in aGVHD models at the early stage after transplantation. Moreover, transfusion therapy could promote the reconstruction and function of donor-derived PMN-MDSCs. Not only the percentage and the absolute number of donor-derived PMN-MDSCs significantly increased but also the immunosuppressive ability was much more robust compared to other groups. Altogether, these findings indicated that mTOR is an intrinsic regulator for PMN-MDSCs' differentiation and immunosuppressive function. Together, mTOR(KO) PMN-MDSC transfusion can play a protective role in alleviating cytokine storm at the initial stage and promoting the quantitative and functional recoveries of donor-derived PMN-MDSCs in aGVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Li, Yu, Xu, Fu, Wei, Wang, Luo, Shi, Qian, Huang and Lin.']","['Li, Xiaoqing', 'Li, Yixue', 'Yu, Qinru', 'Xu, Lin', 'Fu, Shan', 'Wei, Cong', 'Wang,

But in spite of several efforts in a variety of scientific fields, the causes of the disease and the interplay of possible risk factors are still poorly understood. To push forward the research on the causes of CL, the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection has been organizing recurring international workshops since 2008 every two to three years. In November 2019 the 6th International Workshop on the Causes of CL was held in Freising and brought together experts from diverse disciplines. The workshop was divided into two main parts focusing on genetic and environmental risk factors, respectively. Two additional special sessions addressed the influence of natural background radiation on the risk of CL and the progress in the development of mouse models used for experimental studies on acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of leukemia worldwide. The workshop presentations highlighted the role of infections as environmental risk factor for CL, specifically for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Major support comes from two mouse models, the Pax5(+/-) and Sca1-ETV6-RUNX1 mouse model, one of the major achievements made in the last years. Mice of both predisposed models only develop leukemia when exposed to common infections. These results emphasize the impact of gene-environment-interactions on the development of CL and warrant further investigation of such interactions - especially because genetic predisposition is detected with increasing frequency in CL. This article summarizes the workshop presentations and discusses the results in the context of the international literature.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Schmidt, Hornhardt, Erdmann, Sanchez-Garcia, Fischer, Schuz', 'and Ziegelberger.']","['Schmidt, Janine-Alison', 'Hornhardt, Sabine', 'Erdmann, Friederike', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Isidro', 'Fischer, Ute', 'Schuz, Joachim', 'Ziegelberger, Gunde']","['Schmidt JA', 'Hornhardt S', 'Erdmann F', 'Sanchez-Garcia I', 'Fischer U', 'Schuz J', 'Ziegelberger G']","['Department of Effects and Risks of Ionizing and Non-ionizing Radiation, Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS), Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Effects and Risks of Ionizing and Non-ionizing Radiation, Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS), Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Division of Childhood Cancer Epidemiology, Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Environment and Lifestyle Epidemiology Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization (IARC/WHO), Lyon, France.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Environment and Lifestyle Epidemiology Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization (IARC/WHO), Lyon, France.', 'Department of Effects and Risks of Ionizing and Non-ionizing Radiation, Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS), Neuherberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211224,Switzerland,Front Public Health,Frontiers in public health,101616579,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'childhood leukemia', 'environmental exposure', 'genetic susceptibility', 'magnetic fields', 'radiation', 'risk factors']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2022/01/10 09:25'],"['2021/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:25 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpubh.2021.805757 [doi]'],epublish,Front Public Health. 2021 Dec 24;9:805757. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2021.805757. eCollection 2021.,9,,805757,,,,PMC8739478,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional donor hierarchy favours a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor (MSD) over an HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD), followed by alternative donors such as haploidentical donors or unrelated cord blood. However, haploidentical HSCT (hHSCT) may be entailed with significant advantages: besides a potentially increased graft-vs.-leukaemia effect, the immediate availability of a relative as well as the possibility of a second donation for additional cellular therapies may impact on outcome. The key question in hHSCT is how, and how deeply, to deplete donor T-cells. More T cells in the graft confer faster immune reconstitution with consecutively lower infection rates, however, greater numbers of T-cells might be associated with higher rates of graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD). Two different methods for reduction of alloreactivity have been established: in vivo T-cell suppression and ex vivo T-cell depletion (TCD). Ex vivo TCD of the graft uses either positive selection or negative depletion of graft cells before infusion. In contrast, T-cell-repleted grafts consisting of non-manipulated bone marrow or peripheral blood grafts require intense in vivo GvHD prophylaxis. There are two major T-cell replete protocols: one is based on post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), while the other is based on anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG; Beijing protocol). Published data do not show an unequivocal benefit for one of these three platforms in terms of overall survival, non-relapse mortality or disease recurrence. In this review, we discuss the pros and cons of these three different approaches to hHSCT with an emphasis on the significance of the existing data for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Kleinschmidt, Lv, Yanir, Palma, Lang and Eyrich.']","['Kleinschmidt, Katharina', 'Lv, Meng', 'Yanir, Asaf', 'Palma, Julia', 'Lang, Peter', 'Eyrich, Matthias']","['Kleinschmidt K', 'Lv M', 'Yanir A', 'Palma J', 'Lang P', 'Eyrich M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Division of Haematology and Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach-Tikva, Israel."", 'The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Hospital Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany."", ""Department of Paediatric Haematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Center, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211224,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,['NOTNLM'],"['Beijing', 'T-cell depletion', 'acute leukaemia', 'haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'paediatric [MeSH]', 'post-transplant cyclophosphamide', 'stem cell transplantation (HSCT)']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:25'],"['2021/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:25 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.794541 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Dec 24;9:794541. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.794541. eCollection 2021.,9,,794541,,,,PMC8740090,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

However, a portion of children will harbor high-risk features at the time of diagnosis, have a poor response to upfront therapy, or suffer relapse necessitating more intensive therapy, which may include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Recent advances in risk stratification, improved detection and incorporation of minimal residual disease (MRD), and intensification of upfront treatment have changed the indications for HSCT over time. For children in first complete remission, HSCT is generally reserved for those with the highest risk of relapse. These include patients with unfavorable features/cytogenetics who also have a poor response to induction and consolidation chemotherapy, usually reflected by residual blasts after prednisone or by detectable MRD at pre-defined time points. In the relapsed setting, children with first relapse of B-cell ALL are further stratified for HSCT depending on the time and site of relapse, while all patients with T-cell ALL are generally consolidated with HSCT. Alternatives to HSCT have also emerged over the last decade including immunotherapy and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. These novel agents may spare toxicity while attempting to achieve MRD-negative remission in the most refractory cases and serve as a bridge to HSCT. In some situations, these emerging therapies can indeed be curative for some children with relapsed or resistant disease, thus, obviating the need for HSCT. In this review, we seek to summarize the role of HSCT in the current era of immunotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Truong, Jinca, Mann, Arghirescu, Buechner, Merli and Whitlock.']","['Truong, Tony H', 'Jinca, Cristian', 'Mann, Georg', 'Arghirescu, Smaranda', 'Buechner, Jochen', 'Merli, Pietro', 'Whitlock, James A']","['Truong TH', 'Jinca C', 'Mann G', 'Arghirescu S', 'Buechner J', 'Merli P', 'Whitlock JA']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplant/Cellular Therapy, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Cell and Gene Therapy, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children/University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211223,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'acute lympoblastic leukemia', 'children', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)', 'immunotherapy', 'indications and outcome', 'pediatrics', 'relapse']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:25'],"['2021/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:25 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.782785 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Dec 23;9:782785. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.782785. eCollection 2021.,9,,782785,,,,PMC8733383,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

Neurological complications, both acute and long term, are common following HSCT and contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. The aetiology of neurotoxicity includes infections and a wide variety of non-infectious causes such as drug toxicities, metabolic abnormalities, irradiation, vascular and immunologic events and the leukaemia itself. The majority of the literature on this subject is focussed on adults. The impact of the combination of neurotoxic drugs given before and during HSCT, radiotherapy and neurological complications on the developing and vulnerable paediatric and adolescent brain remains unclear. Moreover, the age-related sensitivity of the nervous system to toxic insults is still being investigated. In this article, we review current evidence regarding neurotoxicity following HSCT for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in childhood. We focus on acute and long-term impacts. Understanding the aetiology and long-term sequelae of neurological complications in children is particularly important in the current era of immunotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells and bi-specific T-cell engager antibodies), which have well-known and common neurological side effects and may represent a future treatment modality for at least a fraction of HSCT-recipients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Gabriel, Hoeben, Uhlving, Zajac-Spychala, Lawitschka, Bresters', 'and Ifversen.']","['Gabriel, Melissa', 'Hoeben, Bianca A W', 'Uhlving, Hilde Hylland', 'Zajac-Spychala, Olga', 'Lawitschka, Anita', 'Bresters, Dorine', 'Ifversen, Marianne']","['Gabriel M', 'Hoeben BAW', 'Uhlving HH', 'Zajac-Spychala O', 'Lawitschka A', 'Bresters D', 'Ifversen M']","[""Cancer Centre for Children, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', ""Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Unit, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211223,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'haematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'neurological complications', 'neurotoxicity', 'paediatric']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:25'],"['2021/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:25 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.774853 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Dec 23;9:774853. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.774853. eCollection 2021.,9,,774853,,,,PMC8734594,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

However, adolescents with leukemia and their parents also experience positive changes, which is referred to as posttraumatic growth. We examined posttraumatic growth, core beliefs, impact of event, and event-related rumination in adolescents within 5 years of a diagnosis of childhood leukemia and their parents. Methods: The participants were 68 adolescents with childhood leukemia (aged 13~18 years) and their parents, who were recruited from C university hospital in Korea from May to September 2016. The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, Core Belief Inventory, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Event-related Rumination Inventory were completed by the adolescents and their parents. The mean scores and correlations between variables were investigated for both set of participants. Results: Parents showed significantly higher levels of posttraumatic growth, disruption of core beliefs, impact of event, and invasive rumination than adolescents. Disruption of core beliefs and deliberate rumination were positively correlated with posttraumatic growth in both groups. Conclusion: Nursing intervention programs that involve modifying core beliefs and inducing a positive thought can help adolescents with leukemia and their parents grow after traumatic events.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Korean Academy of Child Health Nursing.

The prognosis of ALL is excellent in paediatric population, however the outcome of relapse/refractory disease is dismal. Adult ALL has less favourable prognosis and relapse/refractory disease is not uncommonly encountered. Bortezomib is the first generation proteasome inhibitor licensed to treat plasma cell myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma with favourable side effect profile. Efficacy of bortezomib had been proven in other solid tumors. Clinical studies showed promising response for proteasome inhibitors in treating relapse/refractory ALL. Thus, proteasome inhibitors are attractive alternative agents for research in treating ALL. In the review article, we will introduce different proteasome inhibitors and their difference in pharmacological properties. Moreover, the mechanism of action of proteasome inhibitors on ALL will be highlighted. Finally, results of various clinical studies on proteasome inhibitors in both paediatric and adult ALL will be discussed.

The main toxicities of CAR-T include cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, cytopenia, and severe infection. It is still very difficult for CAR-T to kill tumor cells to the maximum extent and avoid damaging normal organs. Here, we report a case of DLBCL with persistent grade 4 thrombocytopenia and severe platelet transfusion dependence treated with CD19 CAR-T cells. We used sirolimus to inhibit the sustained activation of CAR-T cells and restore normal bone marrow hematopoiesis and peripheral blood cells. Moreover, sirolimus treatment did not affect the short-term efficacy of CAR-T cells, and DLBCL was in complete remission at the end of follow-up. In conclusion, sirolimus can represent a new strategy for the management of CAR-T cell therapy-related toxicity, including but not limited to hematotoxicity. However, further controlled clinical studies are required to confirm these findings.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Xing, Wang, Liu, Gao, Shao, Yue, Liu, Wang, Shao and Fu.']","['Xing, Limin', 'Wang, Yihao', 'Liu, Hui', 'Gao, Shan', 'Shao, Qing', 'Yue, Lanzhu', 'Liu, Zhaoyun', 'Wang, Huaquan', 'Shao, Zonghong', 'Fu, Rong']","['Xing L', 'Wang Y', 'Liu H', 'Gao S', 'Shao Q', 'Yue L', 'Liu Z', 'Wang H', 'Shao Z', 'Fu R']","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20211223,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD19', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cell', 'cytopenia', 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'sirolimus']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:23'],"['2021/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:23 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.798352 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 23;11:798352. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.798352. eCollection 2021.,11,,798352,,,,PMC8733571,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: To report the expression patterns of ASPH in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods: Cell surface expression of ASPH was measured via 8-color multiparameter flow cytometry in 41 AML patient samples (31 bone marrow, 10 blood) using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-ASPH antibody, SNS-622. A mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of 10 was used as a cutoff for ASPH surface expression positivity. Data regarding patient and disease characteristics were collected. Results: ASPH surface expression was found on AML blasts in 16 samples (39%). Higher ASPH expression was seen in myeloblasts of African American patients (p=0.02), but no correlation was found between ASPH expression and other patient or disease characteristics. No association was found between ASPH status and CR rate (p=0.53), EFS (p=0.87), or OS (p=0.17). Conclusions: ASPH is expressed on blasts in approximately 40% of AML cases, and may serve as a new therapeutically targetable leukemia-associated antigen.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Holtzman, Lebowitz, Koka, Baer, Malhotra, Shahlaee, Ghanbari,', 'Bentzen and Emadi.']","['Holtzman, Noa G', 'Lebowitz, Michael S', 'Koka, Rima', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Malhotra, Kanam', 'Shahlaee, Amir', 'Ghanbari, Hossein A', 'Bentzen, Soren M', 'Emadi, Ashkan']","['Holtzman NG', 'Lebowitz MS', 'Koka R', 'Baer MR', 'Malhotra K', 'Shahlaee A', 'Ghanbari HA', 'Bentzen SM', 'Emadi A']","['Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Immune Deficiency Cellular Therapy Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Sensei Biotherapeutics Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Sensei Biotherapeutics Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, United States.', 'Sensei Biotherapeutics Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, United States.', 'Sensei Biotherapeutics Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, United States.', 'Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211222,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['ASPH', 'leukemia', 'leukemia-associated antigen', 'myeloblasts', 'myeloid']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:23'],"['2021/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:23 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.783744 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 22;11:783744. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.783744. eCollection 2021.,11,,783744,,,,PMC8727599,,"['Authors ML, KM and AS were employed by company Sensei Biotherapeutics.

The introduction of targeted therapies, blocking ""driver"" mutations (e.g., BRAF V600E), enabled long-term remission in patients with LCH. The effect of BRAF inhibition on the course and the prognosis of co-existing clonal hematopoiesis is poorly understood. We report on a 61-year-old patient with systemic BRAF V600E positive LCH and concomitant BRAF wild-type (wt) clonal cytopenia of unknown significance (CCUS) with unfavorable somatic mutations including loss of function (LOF) of NF1. While manifestations of LCH improved after blocking BRAF by dabrafenib treatment, the BRAF wt CCUS progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient eventually underwent successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We performed an in-depth analyzes of the clonal relationship of CCUS and the tissue affected by LCH by using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The findings suggest activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in the CCUS clone due to the presence of the RAS deregulating NF1 mutations and wt BRAF, which is reportedly associated with paradoxical activation of CRAF and hence MEK. Patients with LCH should be carefully screened for potential additional clonal hematological diseases. NGS can help predict outcome of the latter in case of BRAF inhibition. Blocking the MAP kinase pathway further downstream (e.g., by using MEK inhibitors) or allogeneic HSCT may be options for patients at risk.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Hostettler, Casanas Quintana, Tamm, Savic Prince, Sommer,', 'Chen, Nordmann, Lundberg, Stehle and Daikeler.']","['Hostettler, Katrin E', 'Casanas Quintana, Elisa', 'Tamm, Michael', 'Savic Prince, Spasenija', 'Sommer, Gregor', 'Chen, Wei-Chih', 'Nordmann, Thierry Michael', 'Lundberg, Pontus', 'Stehle, Gregor Thomas', 'Daikeler, Thomas']","['Hostettler KE', 'Casanas Quintana E', 'Tamm M', 'Savic Prince S', 'Sommer G', 'Chen WC', 'Nordmann TM', 'Lundberg P', 'Stehle GT', 'Daikeler T']","['Clinics of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Emergency Department, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Clinics of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Pathology, Institute of Medical Genetics and Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Clinic of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chest Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', ""Department of Dermatology, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20211224,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML-acute myeloid leukemia', 'BRAF inhibition', 'Langerhans cell histiocytosis', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'case report', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:23'],"['2021/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:23 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.779523 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 24;11:779523. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.779523. eCollection 2021.,11,,779523,,,,PMC8739218,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Post-chemotherapy marrow examination gives vital clues regarding treatment response and marrow regeneration. Aim We aimed to study the histomorphological changes in post-chemotherapy bone marrow in acute leukemias, monitor residual disease by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on trephine biopsy, and correlate survival status. Method This study was a prospective clinical study. A total of 155 post-induction cases (acute myeloid leukemia [AML] - 68 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] - 87), from January 2014 to December 2015, were included with a follow-up of 4-28 months. A detailed histomorphology was studied in all cases. IHC was applied in 88 cases of post-induction marrow, which showed morphologic suspicion of an increase in blasts. Observations Post-induction marrow was hypercellular in 55.9% of AML and normocellular in 56.3% of ALL. Regenerative hematopoiesis was noted in 37.4% of AML and 88.5% of cases of ALL. Marrow serous atrophy and stromal edema were associated with delayed recovery of counts and their recovery duration ranged from one to five months. Twenty-seven bone marrow aspirates were unsatisfactory, and their trephine biopsies were showed remission in 20 cases and stromal changes in nine cases. In addition, trephine biopsy picked up residual leukemic blasts in four cases in which aspirate showed remission status. Post-induction marrow IHC with scattered positivity for blasts showed sustained remission in 96% cases, and in those with clustered positivity, 28.6% showed residual disease, and 7.2% showed relapse at the end of the study period. The median survival duration was 13, 3, and 12 months for cases with sustained remission, residual disease, and relapse, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in median survival of patients in the three groups (sustained remission, residual disease, and relapse) (p=0.000). Conclusion We conclude that histomorphology augmented by IHC on trephine biopsy gives valuable information regarding post-chemotherapy changes and residual disease status. Bone marrow trephine biopsy is an important tool to assess the remission status of patients with acute leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Ayyanar et al.']","['Ayyanar, Pavithra', 'Kar, Rakhee', 'Dubashi, Biswajit', 'Basu, Debdatta']","['Ayyanar P', 'Kar R', 'Dubashi B', 'Basu D']","['Pathology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Bhubaneswar, IND.', 'Pathology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, IND.', 'Medical Oncology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, IND.', 'Pathology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, IND.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211205,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'bone marrow regeneration', 'dyspoiesis', 'histomorphology of bone marrow', 'post-induction chemotherapy', 'remission', 'residual disease', 'serous atrophy', 'stromal changes', 'trephine biopsy']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:20'],"['2021/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:20 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.20175 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Dec 5;13(12):e20175. doi: 10.7759/cureus.20175. eCollection 2021 Dec.,13,12,e20175,,,,PMC8725173,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of a 37-year-old woman presented to the Department of Hematology with a two-month history of growth inside the oral cavity in the upper jaw and weakness. The physical examination revealed a voluminous mass involving the left side of the maxillary gingiva. The maxillofacial computerized tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of a solid tissue mass at the left upper maxilla. A biopsy sample obtained from the lesion showed a plasma cell infiltration. The laboratory findings revealed anemia, renal impairment with high levels of creatinine and calcium. Serum protein electrophoresis found a monoclonal peak at IgG lambda, a high level of lambda free light. The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by a peripheral-blood smear revealed 25% of plasma cells and bone marrow aspiration with 50% of plasma cell infiltration. Primary plasma-cell leukemia (pPCL) was confirmed. The patient received VTD chemotherapy (bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone) followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), which resulted in complete remission. At the six-month follow-up, the patient relapsed with extramedullary multiple lesions under ineffective rescue therapy. Response to frontline treatments may be significant initially but short-lived with a dismal median overall survival below one year.

The role of bridging radiotherapy prior to CAR T infusion is an area of increasing interest with a sizable body of literature regarding its use in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but reports of its use in leukemia are limited. Furthermore, available literature on bridging radiotherapy is limited to the treatment of bulky, often symptomatic disease, as opposed to its role in treating high-risk regions and sanctuary sites. Here, we present an adult male with multiply relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) who presented with bone marrow relapse and extramedullary relapse in the right testicle. He was successfully treated with right orchiectomy followed by adjuvant bridging radiotherapy to the left testicle and scrotum, followed by CAR T infusion. Under this treatment paradigm, he tolerated the CAR T infusion with minimal toxicity and was without evidence of disease 100 days post-infusion, with normal testosterone levels. This is the first reported case of bridging radiation being used in the adjuvant setting in a patient with hematologic malignancy. This case adds to the growing body of literature that bridging radiation is well-tolerated and can potentially decrease the risk of relapse in high-risk areas following CAR T infusion.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Ladbury et al.']","['Ladbury, Colton', 'Salhotra, Amandeep', 'Dandapani, Savita']","['Ladbury C', 'Salhotra A', 'Dandapani S']","['Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, USA.', 'Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, USA.', 'Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20211203,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['b-all', 'bringing radiation', 'car t', 'leukemia', 'scrotal irradiation']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:20'],"['2021/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:20 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.20134 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Dec 3;13(12):e20134. doi: 10.7759/cureus.20134. eCollection 2021 Dec.,13,12,e20134,,,,PMC8723713,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laboratory workup showed acute monoblastic leukemia and radiological investigation showed cerebral hemorrhagic foci secondary to leukostasis. He received leukoreduction apheresis and he was started on induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine. On the ninth day of induction chemotherapy, it was noted that he developed worsening neurological findings. Investigations showed significant elevation in ammonia level and associated cerebral edema.

There is growing evidence that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells may evade NK cell-mediated cell lysis by expressing low or no ligands for NKG2D (NKG2D-Ls). We hypothesized that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), one of the most studied lineage-specific transcription factors in hematopoiesis, might influence the expression of NKG2D-Ls. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the endogenous expression of wild-type C/EBPalpha (C/EBPalpha-p42) in human AML cell lines and demonstrated that its expression level was highly relevant to the sensitivity of AML cells to NK cell cytotoxicity. Induction of C/EBPalpha-p42 in the low endogenous CEBPA-expressing AML cell line increased the sensitivity to NK-induced lysis. Moreover, decreased expression of C/EBPalpha-p42 by RNA interference in AML cells abrogated NK-mediated cytotoxicity. We further showed that the increase in NK susceptibility caused by C/EBPalpha-p42 occurred through up-regulation of the NKG2D-Ls ULBP2/5/6 in AML cells. More importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with high-throughput sequencing captured C/EBPalpha motif signatures at the enhancer regions of the ULBP 2/5/6 genes. Whilst, the AML-associated C/EBPalpha C-terminal mutant and N-terminal truncated mutant (C/EBPalpha-p30) diminished ULBP2/5/6 transcription. Finally, we identified that histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibition can restore the expression of ULBPs via induction of CEBPA expression in AML cells, which may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for CEBPA-mutated AML.

The fusion event is expected to convert inhibitory signals to activating signals and promote proliferation and potentially transformation of T cells. To test the function of the CTLA4-CD28 fusion gene in vivo, we generated a murine model that expresses the gene in a T cell-specific manner. The transgenic mice have shorter life spans and display inflammatory responses including lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. T cells in turn show higher levels of activation and infiltrate various organs including the lung and skin. T cells, in particular CD4+ helper T cells, were also readily transplantable to immunocompromised mice. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that the gene expression pattern in CD4 + T cells closely resembles that of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and that of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) tissues. Consistently, we detected supernumerary FOXP3+ cells and PD-1+ cells in transgenic and transplanted mice. This is the first report demonstrating the transforming activity of the CTLA4-CD28 fusion gene in vivo, and this murine model should be useful in dissecting the molecular events downstream to this mutation.","['(c) 2022 The Author(s).

RESULTS: Fifty-six courses of PP were identified in 47 patients with a median age of 7.5 years (IQR, 4-10), 51.6% (n = 24) of whom were female. The main underlying medical conditions were aplastic anemia (n = 19, 33.9%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 18, 32.1%), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 14, 25.0%), and 34.1% had undergone HSCT. The median dose of posaconazole was 13.62 mg/kg/day (IQR, 12.0-16.8), and the median duration of PP was 24 days (IQR, 16-82). Gastrointestinal symptoms included abdominal pain (17.9%), nausea (16.1%), diarrhea (7.1%), and vomiting (3.6%). Elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were observed in 9/35 patients (25.7%) and 10/51 (19.6%) patients, respectively. Five cases of breakthrough fungal infection were identified (8.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients younger than 13 years who received PP showed an increase in transaminase values, and the development of breakthrough fungal infections.","['Copyright.

However, relapses are possible, and all classes of drugs are refractory to patients. Next-generation sequencing has improved our understanding of the multiple myeloma genome related to drug resistance and has discovered many genomic variants. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate new variants associated with drug resistance in MM patients who relapsed and refractory to bortezomib regimen and daratumumab treatment using next-generation sequencing for whole-exome sequencing. Peripheral blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes from six patients; four were in relapsed and refractory to bortezomib regimens and daratumumab; two patients responded to bortezomib regimens. Whole-exome sequencing was performed by the MGI-DNBSEQ-G400 instrument. We identified 21 variants in multiple myeloma patients. Seventeen variants were found in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in 11 genes (GNAQ, PMS1, CREB1, NSUNS2, PIK3CG, ROS1, PMS2, FIT4, KDM5A, STK11 and ZFHX3). And four variants were identified in two patients with response to bortezomib regimens in 4 genes (RAF1, CREB1, ZFHX3 and INSR). We have observed several genetic variants in many genes that may have been associated with the poor prognosis and poor response to treatment in these patients.

The purpose of this study was to provide information on current patterns of healthcare utilization in CLL. Patients and Methods: We used data from Danish nation-wide registers to study healthcare utilization the year before and the year after CLL diagnosis and in relation to first-line treatment. Patients diagnosed with CLL between 1997 and 2018 were included and stratified on number of comorbidities, presence of specific comorbidities, and fitness status, respectively. Healthcare utilization was studied in terms of hospital admissions, in-hospital bed days, out-patient visits, emergency room visits, and prescription drugs. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, and calendar year. Results: The study comprised 9170 patients with CLL with a median age of 71 years, of whom 35% had >/=1 comorbidity. Healthcare utilization increased markedly upon CLL diagnosis both in patients with and without comorbidities. During the year after CLL diagnosis, 39% were hospitalized, 16% visited an emergency room, 88% visited an out-patient clinic, and 93% received prescription drugs. Both individual comorbidities and the total number of comorbidities were associated with increased healthcare utilization of all types, except for contacts to hematological departments. Conclusion: Our results suggest that CLL diagnosis may unveil incipient diseases and aggravate comorbidities and thereby have considerably wider health implications than those directly related to CLL. These findings may be used by clinicians and decisions makers to guide planning of multidisciplinary care for cancer patients.",['(c) 2021 Rotbain et al.'],"['Rotbain, Emelie C', 'Rostgaard, Klaus', 'Andersen, Michael A', 'Da Cunha-Bang, Caspar', 'Niemann, Carsten U', 'Frederiksen, Henrik', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik']","['Rotbain EC', 'Rostgaard K', 'Andersen MA', 'Da Cunha-Bang C', 'Niemann CU', 'Frederiksen H', 'Hjalgrim H']","['Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Hematology Research Group, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Hematology Research Group, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Academy of Geriatric Cancer Research (AGECARE), Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Hematology Research Group, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211230,New Zealand,Clin Epidemiol,Clinical epidemiology,101531700,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'epidemiology', 'hematology', 'real-world data']",2022/01/11 06:00,2022/01/11 06:01,['2022/01/10 09:04'],"['2021/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/10 09:04 [entrez]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CLEP.S337495 [doi]', '337495 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epidemiol. 2021 Dec 30;13:1155-1165. doi: 10.2147/CLEP.S337495. eCollection 2021.,13,,1155-1165,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4199-772X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6220-9414', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9880-5242', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8905-0220']",,PMC8722577,,"['ECR received consultancy fees or travel grants from AbbVie, Janssen, and', 'AstraZeneca.

The first BTK inhibitor approved for clinical use is ibrutinib, which showed excellent efficacy and good tolerability. More recently, the interest is growing for novel more selective BTK inhibitors that may reduce the off-target effects of the drug, thus minimizing side effects and subsequent treatment interruptions or discontinuations. Acalabrutinib is an orally administered irreversible BTK inhibitor, characterized by the lack of inhibition towards other kinases. In this review, we present the most recent data from clinical trials on the clinical efficacy of acalabrutinib and acalabrutinib-based combinations for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory and treatment-naive CLL. We delineate the safety profile of the drug, describe side effects of interest and discuss the clinical management of patients receiving acalabrutinib.

OBJECTIVE: Glucose metabolism may be altered in CML cells because glucose is a key metabolite used by tumor cells. We investigated whether D-mannose treatment induced metabolic changes in CML cells and reduced CML growth in the presence of ABL TKIs. METHODS: We investigated whether D-mannose treatment induced metabolic changes in CML cells and reduced CML growth in the presence of ABL TKIs. RESULTS: Treatment with D-mannose for 72 h inhibited the growth of K562 cells. Combined treatment using ABL TKIs and D-mannose induced a significantly higher level of cytotoxicity in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukemia cells than in control cells. In the mouse model, severe toxicity was observed as evidenced by body weight loss in the ponatinib and D-mannose combination treatment groups.

Our previous studies showed that 4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl retinate (ATPR), a new derivative of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), could induce AML cell differentiation and cycle arrest. The current study aimed to determine the potential pharmacological mechanisms of ATPR therapies against AML. Our findings showed that E2A was overexpressed in AML specimens and cell lines, and mediate AML development by inactivating the P53 pathway. The findings indicated that E2A expression and activity decreased with ATPR treatment. Furthermore, we determined that E2A inhibition could enhance the effect of ATPR-induced AML cell differentiation and cycle arrest, whereas E2A overexpression could reverse this effect, suggesting that the E2A gene plays a crucial role in AML. We identified P53 and c-Myc were downstream pathways and targets for silencing E2A cells using RNA sequencing, which are involved in the progression of AML. Taken together, these results confirmed that ATPR inhibited the expression of E2A/c-Myc, which led to the activation of the P53 pathway, and induced cell differentiation and cycle arrest in AML.","['(c) 2022 The Authors.

Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for MDD in the AYA patients with cancer versus age-, sex- and working status-matched cancer-free controls. A subgroups analysis of the AYA patients with cancer was performed to explore MDD risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 3,559 AYA patients with cancer and 35,590 matched controls were included in the analysis. AYA patients with cancer had a 3-fold higher risk for MDD compared with cancer-free controls (HR, 3.12; 95% CI, 2.64-3.70). Among cancer categories with >100 patients, patients with multiple cancer categories, including those with metastatic cancer (HR, 6.73, 95% CI, 3.65-12.40) and leukemia (HR, 6.30; 95% CI, 3.75-10.58), had the greatest MDD risk versus matched controls. Patients who received inpatient chemotherapy as initial treatment had a higher risk for MDD than patients without chemotherapy (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30-0.62). CONCLUSIONS: AYA patients in Japan with cancer are at high risk for MDD. Particularly, those with multiple cancer categories, leukemia, and those who receive aggressive anticancer treatments should be monitored closely for symptoms of MDD.

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies indicate that the methylation state of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is different between cancer patients and healthy individuals. Therefore, we speculate that abnormal expression of miRNA may be associated with cfDNA methylation. METHODS: A green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled B-ALL transplantation animal model was established to explore the relationship between the miRNA expression and cfDNA methylation of the related gene. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of miRNAs. Further, cfDNA methylation levels of the related genes were evaluated through bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP). RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-196b, miR-203, miR-34a-5p, miR-335-3p, miR-34b-5p, miR-615, miR-375-3p and miR-193b-5p in the serum of the model mice were significantly lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The methylation level of miR-196b promoter in cfDNA of the model group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was noted in miR-203 promoter. The methylation levels of miR-196b and miR-203 coding region in cfDNA of the model group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that CpG island hypermethylation in the miRNA coding region of cfDNA is related to the low expression of miR-196b and miR-203.","['(c) 2021.

Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) proteins are good substrates for SUMOylation, and PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) may function as a platform for the PML SUMOylation. PML proteins are rapidly modified both with SUMO2/3 and SUMO1 after exposure to arsenite (As(3+)) and SUMOylated PML are further ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes. However, effects of As(3+) on SUMO dynamics on PML-NBs are not well investigated. In the present study, we report that (1) the number and size of PML-NBs were regulated by SUMO E1-activating enzyme, (2) SUMO2/3 co-localized with PML irrespective of As(3+) exposure and was restricted to PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) via covalent binding in response to As(3+), and (3) As(3+)-induced biochemical changes in PML were not modulated by ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in THP-1 cells. Undifferentiated and differentiated THP-1 cells responded to As(3+) similarly and PML proteins were changed from the detergent soluble to the insoluble form and further SUMOylated with SUMO2/3 and SUMO1. ML792, a SUMO E1 inhibitor, decreased the number of PML-NBs and reciprocally increased the size irrespective of exposure to As(3+), which itself slightly decrease both the number and size of PML-NBs. TAK243, a ubiquitin E1 inhibitor, did not change the PML-NBs, while SUMOylated proteins accumulated in the TAK243-exposed cells. Proteasome inhibitors did not change the As(3+)-induced SUMOylation levels of PML. Co-localization and further restriction of SUMO2/3 to PML-NBs were confirmed by PML-transfected CHO-K1 cells. Collectively, SUMOylation regulates PML-NBs and As(3+) restricts SUMO dynamics on PML by changing its solubility.","['(c) 2021.

RO7297089 is a novel bispecific BCMA/CD16A-directed innate cell engager (ICE((R))) designed to induce BCMA+ MM cell lysis through high affinity binding of CD16A and retargeting of NK cell cytotoxicity and macrophage phagocytosis. Unlike conventional antibodies approved in MM, RO7297089 selectively targets CD16A with no binding of other Fcgamma receptors, including CD16B on neutrophils, and irrespective of 158V/F polymorphism, and its activity is less affected by competing IgG suggesting activity in the presence of M-protein. Structural analysis revealed this is due to selective interaction with a single residue (Y140) uniquely present in CD16A opposite the Fc binding site. RO7297089 induced tumor cell killing more potently than conventional antibodies (wild-type and Fc-enhanced) and induced lysis of BCMA+ cells at very low effector-to-target ratios. Preclinical toxicology data suggested a favorable safety profile as in vitro cytokine release was minimal and no RO7297089-related mortalities or adverse events were observed in cynomolgus monkeys. These data suggest good tolerability and the potential of RO7297089 to be a novel effective treatment of MM patients.","['(c) 2021.

However, treatment practices in pediatric hematology/oncology (PHO) patients vary widely as evidence-based guidelines for clinical management of these complications in this population are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess management practices of asparaginase-related coagulopathy by pediatric hematologist/oncologist attending physicians. DESIGN/METHOD: Email survey sent to 2327 PHO physicians primarily practicing in the United States. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-five (12.2%) attending physicians completed the survey. Only 4.6% (n=13/285) routinely prescribe prophylactic anticoagulation during induction chemotherapy for leukemia. Slightly more than half (n=145/250, 50.9%) of all providers perform baseline coagulation studies. Most providers that were surveyed (n=185/285, 64.9%) only replete coagulant factors if the patient experiences bleeding or bruising. One hundred thirty (n=130/285, 45.6%) physicians replace low fibrinogen. The median fibrinogen replacement was 100 mg/dL (range: 40 to 200 mg/dL) with the median target of at least 100 mg/dL (range: 50 to 200 mg/dL). A minority of physicians (n=39/250, 13.7%) replace low antithrombin. The median antithrombin cutoff activity level was 60% (range: 40% to 100%) with a median target of 75% (range: 40% to 125%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant variation in PHO physician practices for monitoring and management of asparaginase-associated hemostatic derangements. Evidence-based guidelines have the potential to standardize practices.","['Copyright (c) 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In addition, histologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular characteristics were reviewed. This showed that all patients had a previous history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in 2 cases diagnosed >10 years before the testicular lesions. In 1 case, there was bilateral involvement, while in 2, involvement was unilateral. The neoplastic cells showed evidence of cytogenetic/molecular clonal evolution in all cases, 1 of which also had significant immunophenotypic changes. A mutational profile including NPM1 p.Trp288Cysfs*12, IDH1 p.Arg132His NRAS p.Gly12Asp was seen in 2 of the 3 cases. Concurrent bone marrow involvement by a myeloid neoplasm was diagnosed in 2 patients, in 1, there was AML in the second 8% blasts. These patients progressed rapidly after MS and had a dismal outcome.

However, convincing therapeutic response rates can be accompanied by cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and severe neurotoxicity termed immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). METHODS: Single center, prospective observational study of fifteen consecutive r/r DLBCL patients treated with Tisagenlecleucel within 1 year at Hannover Medical School. Extensive neurological work-up prior to CAR T cell infusion included clinical examination, cognitive testing (Montreal-Cognitive-Assessment), brain MRI, electroencephalogram, electroneurography, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. After CAR T cell infusion, patients were neurologically examined for 10 consecutive days. Afterwards, all patients were assessed at least once a week. RESULTS: ICANS occurred in 4/15 patients (27%) within 6 days (4-6 days) after CAR T cell infusion. Patients with ICANS grade 2 (n = 3) exhibited similar neurological symptoms including apraxia, expressive aphasia, disorientation, and hallucinations, while brain MRI was inconspicuous in either case. Treatment with dexamethasone rapidly resolved the clinical symptoms in all three patients. Regarding baseline parameters prior to CAR T cell treatment, patients with and without ICANS did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, ICANS occurred in only every fourth patient and rather low grade neurotoxicity was found during daily examination. Our results demonstrate that a structured neurological baseline examination and close monitoring are helpful to detect CAR T cell related neurotoxicity already at an early stage and to potentially prevent higher grade neurotoxicity.",['(c) 2022.

METHOD: We studied antibody responses in 500 patients following dual COVID-19 vaccination to assess the magnitude, correlates of response, stability and functional activity of the spike-specific antibody response with two different vaccine platforms. RESULTS: Spike-specific seroconversion post-vaccine was seen in 67% of patients compared to 100% of age-matched controls. Amongst responders, titres were 3.7 times lower than the control group. Antibody responses showed a 33% fall over the next 4 months. The use of an mRNA (n = 204) or adenovirus-based (n = 296) vaccine platform did not impact on antibody response. Male gender, BTKi therapy, prophylactic antibiotics use and low serum IgA/IgM were predictive of failure to respond. Antibody responses after CD20-targeted immunotherapy recovered 12 months post treatment. Post-vaccine sera from CLL patients with Spike-specific antibody response showed markedly reduced neutralisation of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant compared to healthy controls. Patients with previous natural SARS-CoV-2 infection showed equivalent antibody levels and function as healthy donors after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate impaired antibody responses following dual COVID-19 vaccination in patients with CLL and further define patient risk groups. Furthermore, humoural protection against the globally dominant delta variant is markedly impaired in CLL patients and indicates the need for further optimisation of immune protection in this patient cohort.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The SSCs of male NMRI mice were isolated by enzymatic digestion and cultured for two weeks. Then, the identity of SSCs was validated by anti-Plzf and anti-GFR-alpha1 antibodies via immunocytochemistry (ICC). The proliferation capacity of SSCs was evaluated by their culture on a layer of the decellularized testicular matrix (DTM) prepared from mouse testis, as well as two-dimensional (2D) with different mediums. After two weeks of the initiation of proliferation culture on 3D and 2D medium, the pre-meiotic at the mRNA and protein levels were evaluated via qRT-PCR and flow cytometry methods, respectively. The results showed that the proliferation rate of SSCs in 3D culture with 50 mM glutamic acid and 20 mM D-serine was significantly different from other groups after 14 days treatment. mRNA expression levels of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf) in 3D cultures supplemented by 20 mM D-serine and 50 mM glutamic acid were considerably higher than the 3D control group (p < 0.001). The flow cytometry analysis revealed that the amount of Plzf in the 2D-culture groups of SSCs with 20 mM MK-801 was considerably lower compared to the 2D-culture control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that decellularized testicular matrix supplemented with D-serine and glutamic acid could be considered a promising vehicle to support cells and provide an appropriate niche for the proliferation of SSCs.","['(c) 2021.

Despite current therapies, failure to conventional treatments and relapse are frequent in children with T-ALL. It is known that the chemokine CXCL12 modulates leukemia survival and dissemination; however, our understanding of molecular mechanisms used by T-ALL cells to infiltrate and respond to leukemia cells-microenvironment interactions is still vague. In the present study, we showed that CXCL12 promoted H3K9 methylation in cell lines and primary T-ALL cells within minutes. We thus identified that CXCL12-mediated H3K9 methylation affected the global chromatin configuration and the nuclear mechanics of T-ALL cells. Importantly, we characterized changes in the genomic profile of T-ALL cells associated with rapid CXCL12 stimulation. We showed that blocking CXCR4 and protein kinase C (PKC) impaired the H3K9 methylation induced by CXCL12 in T-ALL cells. Finally, blocking H3K9 methyltransferases reduced the efficiency of T-ALL cells to deform their nuclei, migrate across confined spaces, and home to spleen and bone marrow in vivo models.

Incidence of CNS involvement is less than 5% in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and 6-29% in Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia at Diagnosis. For Successful treatment of childhood leukemia it is mandatory, to give sufficient therapy directed to the CNS to treat sub clinical or overt CNS Leukemia. Without Central Nervous System- Directed therapy, relapses originating from the CNS in up to 75% cases. For this purpose it is crucial to find out the CNS involvement in acute leukemia at diagnosis. This study was conducted to find proportion and pattern of central nervous system involvement (central nervous system manifestation and/or cerebrospinal fluid findings) in acute leukemia at diagnosis in Bangladesh. A cross sectional study was conducted from May 2012 to November 2012 in the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. Total 50 samples were included those having age <15 years newly diagnosed with acute leukemia by purposive sampling. Common age group 1-5 years (48%), 32 patients (64%) were male and 18 patients (36%) were female. Out of 32 male patients 4 patients presented with CNS manifestation and among 18 female patients 2 patients presented with CNS manifestation. There is no association between sex and CNS presentation (P value 0.89). 25 (50%) patients had total leukocyte count >11,000-1,00,000. Twelve (24%) patients had total leukocyte count <4,000. Eight (16%) patients had total leukocyte count 4,000-11,000, and rest 05(10%) patients had leukocyte count >1,00,000. Proportion of CNS manifestation was found 6/50 patients. Eight (8) patients were suffering from AML and 42 patients were suffering form ALL. Among 8 AML patients 1 (11.1%) patient had CNS manifestation and Among 42 ALL patients 5(11.1%) patients had CNS manifestation. Out of 6 patients with CNS manifestation, 2 (04%) patients presented with clinical manifestation, and 5(10%) had positive CSF findings. Pattern of CSF finding of 50 leukemic children CNS-1 90%, CNS-2 02%, CNS-3 08%, and no patients had traumatic lumber puncture with concomitant presence of blasts cells. There is significant association was found between hyper leukocytosis and CNS manifestation (p=0.138) but there is no statistically significant association between positive CSF findings and neurological findings (p=0.082). At conclusion, CNS manifestation is not uncommon (6/50 patients) was found in acute leukemia at diagnosis. So, every patient of acute leukemia should be examined carefully for CNS involvement along with CSF cytospin.",,"['Yeasmin, S', 'Rashid, M H', 'Debnath, M R', 'Rashid, M M']","['Yeasmin S', 'Rashid MH', 'Debnath MR', 'Rashid MM']","['Dr Sabina Yesmin, Assistant Registrar, Department of Neurosurgery, Mymensingh Medical College and Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh; E-mail: liton35th@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Bangladesh,Mymensingh Med J,Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,9601799,IM,,,2022/01/10 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2022/01/09 21:08'],"['2022/01/09 21:08 [entrez]', '2022/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mymensingh Med J. 2022 Jan;31(1):55-60.,31,1,55-60,,,,,,,,,,,20220111,,"['Adolescent', 'Bangladesh/epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an abnormal increase in size and/or altered consistency of lymph nodes. The condition generally is not a disease itself but a symptom of one of many possible underlying problems. So it is very much essential to achieve a correct diagnosis of patients presenting with lymphadenopathy. This cross sectional study carried out at the Department of Medicine, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH), Mymensingh over a period of 6 months from January 2014 to June 2014. This study was carried out to evaluate the clinical presentations and to see the ultimate diagnosis by appropriate investigations of lymphadenopathy patients. It is a male predominance study. Metastatic carcinoma (Met. Ca) belonged to relatively higher age group, tuberculosis (TB) and acute leukaemias belonged to younger age group and lymphoma belonged to middle age group. Among 50 cases metastatic carcinoma comprises total 14(28%), lymphoma 13(26%), tuberculosis (TB) 12(24%), acute leukaemia 7(14%), non-specific (Non Sp.) 4(8%) cases. Among lymphoma non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was 10 (20%) then Hodgkin's disease (HD) was 3(6%) and among acute leukaemia acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was 5(10%) and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) was 2(4%) cases. Most of the patients belong to younger age groups, 32% cases were from 18-30 years. Most of the patients had generalized lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of lymph node was done in 60% cases. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was done in 24% cases. Bone marrow study (BMD) was done in 14% cases include all cases of leukemia. Among 50 patients correct clinical diagnosis were found 100% cases of ALL and non-specific infection, 80% cases of metastatic carcinoma, 66.66% cases of AML and NHL, 62.5% cases of TB, 50% cases of HD. AML and ALL were diagnosed by bone marrow study. Over all 70% of clinical diagnosis were found correct in this study. In conclusion malignancy, lymphoma and tuberculosis were the most common cause of lymphadenopathy patients. Most of the cases were diagnosed by taking appropriate history and examination but FNAC, biopsy and bone marrow study were need for final diagnosis.",,"['Hosen, M A', 'Sutradhar, S R', 'Khanam, J', 'Sarkar, U', 'Fakruzzaman, M', 'Faysal, M M']","['Hosen MA', 'Sutradhar SR', 'Khanam J', 'Sarkar U', 'Fakruzzaman M', 'Faysal MM']","['Dr Muhammad Ashraf Hosen, Junior Consultant (Medicine), Upazila Health Complex, Madhupur, Tangail, Bangladesh; E-mail: dr.hosen.mmc@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Bangladesh,Mymensingh Med J,Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,9601799,IM,,,2022/01/10 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2022/01/09 21:08'],"['2022/01/09 21:08 [entrez]', '2022/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mymensingh Med J. 2022 Jan;31(1):24-30.,31,1,24-30,,,,,,,,,,,20220111,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', '*Lymph Nodes', '*Lymphadenopathy/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, exploration of a suitable novel treatment scheme is urgently needed.However, combining venetoclax with NK cell-based immunotherapy has not been studied. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of NK cell combined with venetoclax was assessed in vitro using flow cytometry. Venetoclax-induced natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligand (NKG2DL) expression was detected by flow cytometry and western blotting. Mechanisms underlying venetoclax-induced NKG2DL expression were found by GSE127200 analysis and investigated using real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and western blotting. RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis showed that combining venetoclax with NK cells produced synergistic anti-leukaemia effects similar to those of venetoclax + azacitidine. Venetoclax could render AML cell lines and primary AML cells sensitive to NK cell killing by promoting NK cell degranulation, NK-AML cell recognition and NK cell secretion of interferon (IFN)-gamma and granzyme B. The synergistic effect resulted from venetoclax-induced NKG2DL upregulation in AML cells and could be undermined by blocking NKG2D on NK cells. This finding suggests that venetoclax enhances NK cell killing activity by activating the NKG2D/NKG2DL ligand-receptor pathway. Furthermore, the nuclear factor-kappa-B (NFKB) signalling pathway was involved in venetoclax-induced NKG2DL upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data confirm that venetoclax combined with NK cells induces synergistic AML cell cytolysis and preliminarily revealed that venetoclax could selectively induce NKG2DLs on AML cells via NFKB signalling pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Bleeding, particularly severe bleeding is the leading cause of early death (ED). Meanwhile, thrombosis, the other major coagulopathic complication, is being increasingly recognized. However, predictors of thrombohemorrhagic disorders are still not well investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively studied 83 patients with high-risk APL and categorized them into severe bleeding, thrombosis and no evident events groups. RESULTS: Severe bleeding was observed in 15 patients, nearly half of whom died of hemorrhage, while thrombosis was observed in 12 patients. Risk factor analysis showed that high WBC (>58.76 x 10(9)/L) (p = 0.001) and prolonged PT (>17.7 s) (p = 0.015) could be independent predictors for severe bleeding, while high WBC/D-dimer>5.12 (p = 0.002) and low D-dimer/FIB<5.14 (p = 0.03) could be independent predictors for thrombosis in high-risk APL patients. Moreover, there are significant differences in WBC/D-dimer and D-dimer/FIB between DIC and Non-DIC groups (p < 0.001). Notably, we found that the WBC/D-dimer was dramatically higher in the thrombotic group than in the other two groups at the time of admission or during the first week of induction therapy. CONCLUSIONS: High WBC and prolonged PT could predict severe bleeding in high-risk APL patients, while high WBC/D-dimer and low D-dimer/FIB could be independent predictors for thrombosis. For high-risk APL, WBC/D-dimer and D-dimer/FIB are also beneficial in the diagnosis of DIC. WBC/D-dimer might help early identification of thrombosis at the time of admission or during the first week of induction therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The phlorotannins 2-[2-(3,5-dihydroxyphenoxy)-3,5-dihydroxyphenoxy]-1,3,5-benzenetriol (1), 2,2'-[[2-(3,5-dihydroxyphenoxy)-5-hydroxy-1,3-phenylene]bis(oxy)]bis(1,3,5-benzen etriol) (2), and 2-[2-[4-[2-(3,5-dihydroxyphenoxy)-3,5-dihydroxyphenoxy]-3,5-dihydroxyphenoxy]-3,5 -dihydroxyphenoxy]-1,3,5-benzenetriol (3) were isolated from S. carpophyllum. Here, we evaluated the anti-allergic activities of these compounds and comprehensively explored their effects on intracellular protein levels. Immunoglobulin E-sensitized rat basophilic leukemia cells pretreated with any of these three compounds exhibited reduced beta-hexosaminidase, prostaglandin D2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion compared with dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA)-stimulated cells. Reduction of beta-hexosaminidase release was dose-dependent but the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were similar (36-51 muM). Proteomics analysis revealed that the three compounds up-regulated 25 proteins and down-regulated 33 proteins compared with DNP-HSA stimulation alone, and slightly suppressed proteasome 5 expression linked to the regulation of IkappaB. These results demonstrate that these phlorotannins are potentially useful for preventing immediate hypersensitivity. S. carpophyllum may be a functional food.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few studies reflect recent occupational settings and women seafarers are usually too scarce for meaningful analyses. We conducted a study on cancer incidence between 1985 and 2011 in a Swedish cohort consisting of male and female seafarers. METHODS: All seafarers in the Swedish Seafarers' Register with at least one sea service between 1985 and 2011 and a cumulated sea service time of >/= 30 days (N = 75,745; 64% men, 36% women; 1,245,691 person-years) were linked to the Swedish Cancer Register and followed-up until 31 December 2011. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated with the general population as reference. RESULTS: There were 4159 cancer cases in total, with 3221 among men and 938 among women. Male seafarers had an increased risk of total cancer (SIR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.09), lung cancer (SIR 1.51; 95% CI 1.35-1.67) and urinary bladder cancer (SIR 1.17; 95% CI 1.02-1.33). Several lifestyle-associated cancer forms were more common in men. Previous work on tankers was associated with leukaemia (SIR 1.41; 95% CI 1.00-1.86). The risk of cancer decreased with a start as a male seafarer after 1985, with a significant trend for total cancer (P < 0.001), lung cancer (P = 0.001) and, for tanker seafarers, leukaemia (P = 0.045). Women seafarers had an increased risk of lung cancer (SIR 1.54; 95% CI 1.23-1.87) but the risk of total cancer was not increased (SIR 0.83; 95% CI 0.78-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of merchant Swedish seafarers 1985-2011, the risk of total cancer was increased in men but not in women compared to the general population. Lung cancer was increased in both genders. The risk of cancer seems to decrease over the last decades, but better exposure assessments to occupational carcinogens and longer observation times are needed.",['(c) 2021.

PROCEDURE: Consecutive patients with T-ALL/LLy from 1999 to 2019 at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia were analyzed for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission and various high-risk features as well as clinical trial enrollment and outcome. RESULTS: We identified 153 patients newly diagnosed with T-ALL/LLy, 53 (35%) required PICU-level care within 24 hours and 73 (48%) within 7 days. Non-PICU patients had a significantly higher clinical trial enrollment rate (79.4%) versus PICU patients (56.1%, P = 0.016). Patients who enrolled on a clinical trial had similar relapse risk to those who did not enroll (relapse rate 20% vs 29%, P = 0.523). Nineteen patients were precluded from trial participation. Risk of relapse was increased for patients admitted to the PICU within 24 hours (26% vs 13%, P = 0.048). Forty-four patients with T-ALL presented with hyperleukocytosis, of which 30% relapsed versus 14% without (P = 0.082). Patients who underwent apheresis for hyperleukocytosis were statistically more likely to relapse (47% vs 15%, P = 0.007). Patients with elevated uric acid (20% vs 16%, P = 0.278), mediastinal mass (20% vs 14%, P = 0.501), or required emergent steroids (20% vs 16%, P = 0.626) had a similar relapse risk. A single second relapse patient survived. CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of T-ALL/LLy patients required PICU-level care at diagnosis, making enrollment on clinical trials challenging, but trial enrollment predicted better outcome.

However, studies have shown that patients with the e13a2 transcript were less likely to achieve major molecular response compared to those with e14a2 transcripts. Most quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for detection of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene do not differentiate between the two transcripts and we therefore hypothesised that technical bias linked to the qPCR assay could partially explain the discrepancy in outcomes. We designed an e14a2-specific assay and identified no difference in results compared to an e13a2 standard assay. We then demonstrated that the commercial e14a2 standards were causing a significant overestimation of the e13a2 transcripts. Finally, we reviewed patient management after the qPCR values were corrected, using our new evaluation.

Our study is aimed to extract the trend of benzene-induced leukemia (BIL) and qualitatively and quantitatively estimate research on it. Publications on BIL were identified from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Microsoft Excel 2019 (Redmond, WA) and The CiteSpace 5.6.R5 software (Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA) were used to analyze the publication outcomes, countries, institutions, authors, keywords, and research frontiers. The overall 1152 publications were collected from 1990 to 2019 until November 6, 2020. Environ Health Persp had the highest number of articles published. The USA were the top country in terms of BIL. The Smith MT, Yin SN, Lan Q, and Hayes RB are both listed in the top 10 of co-cited authors, high contribution authors, and the authors of co-cited references. High IF articles account for a considerable proportion, among all the publications. Chinese institutions engaged in BIL and contributed a large part of articles. Exposure population, exposure dose, and exposure risk are the research hotspots in this field. The risk of benzene exposure on childhood leukemia is at issue, and the studies on attributable risk of benzene-induced leukemia are few. More early, sensitive, and specific epigenetic biomarkers of benzolism may be the leading research fields of benzene-induced leukemia in the next few years.","['(c) 2021.

Three types of biological screenings were performed: (i) in vitro antiproliferative screening against a panel of solid tumor and leukemia cell lines, (ii) antiviral screening against several RNA viruses, and (iii) anti-quorum sensing screening using gram-negative Chromobacterium violaceum as the reporter strain. Antiproliferative screening revealed a high activity of several compounds. Anthranilamides 12 and 13 with chloroquine core and halogenated anthranilic acid were the most active agents toward diverse cancer cell lines such as glioblastoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, lung carcinoma, acute lymphoblastic, acute myeloid, chronic myeloid leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but also against noncancerous cell lines. Boc-protected analogs 2 and 3 showed moderate activities against the tested cancer cells without toxic effects against noncancerous cells. A nonhalogenated quinoline derivative 10 with N-benzylanthranilic acid residue was equally active as 12 and 13 and selective toward tumor cells. Chloroquine and quinoline anthranilamides 10-13 exerted pronounced antiviral effect against human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, whereas 12 and 13 against coronavirus OC43 (EC50 values in low micromolar range; selectivity indices from 4.6 to > 10.4). Anthranilamides 14 and 16 with PQ core inhibited HIV-1 with EC50 values of 9.3 and 14.1 microM, respectively. Compound 13 displayed significant anti-quorum/biofilm effect against the quorum sensing reporter strain (IC50 of 3.7 muM) with no apparent bactericidal effect.","['(c) 2021.

The full extent of this far-reaching interplay remains undefined. Here, we show that MYC transcriptionally activates IDH2 and increases alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) levels. This regulatory step induces the activity of alphaKG-dependent DNA hydroxylases and RNA demethylases, thus reducing global DNA and RNA methylation. MYC, in a IDH2-dependent manner, also promotes the nuclear accumulation of TET1-TET2-TET3, FTO and ALKBH5. Notably, this subcellular movement correlated with the ability of MYC, in an IDH2-dependent manner, and, unexpectedly, of alphaKG to directly induce O-GlcNAcylation. Concordantly, modulation of the activity of OGT and OGA, enzymes that control the cycling of this non-canonical mono-glycosylation, largely recapitulated the effects of the MYC-IDH2-alphaKG axis on the subcellular movement of DNA and RNA demethylases. Together, we uncovered a hitherto unsuspected crosstalk between MYC, alphaKG and O-GlcNAcylation which could influence the epigenome and epitranscriptome homeostasis.","['(c) 2021.

The pathobiological effects of these mutations vary considerably, impeding the identification of common expression profiles. We performed an expression meta-analysis between IDH-mutant (IDH(mut)) and IDH-wild-type (IDH(wt)) conditions in six human and mouse isogenic disease models. The datasets included colon cancer cells, glioma cells, heart tissue, hepatoblasts, and neural stem cells. Among differentially expressed genes (DEGs), serine protease 23 (PRSS23) was upregulated in four datasets, i.e., in human colon carcinoma cells, mouse heart tissue, mouse neural stem cells, and human glioma cells. Carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2 (P3H2) were upregulated in three datasets, and SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2-OT) was downregulated in three datasets. The most significantly overrepresented protein class was termed intercellular signal molecules. An additional DEG set contained genes that were both up- and downregulated in different datasets and included oxidases and extracellular matrix structural proteins as the most significantly overrepresented protein classes. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the expression effects of IDH mutations shared between different isogenic disease models.

Although treatment methods have improved and resulted in significant improvement of survival and reduction in late effects and late mortality risk, the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of survivors might be affected. To introduce new interventions in clinical practice with the potential to support positive HRQOL outcomes, more knowledge is needed on how HRQOL in this group is constructed and stimulated. The purpose of this study is to investigate how HRQOL is affected in adults treated for paediatric ALL, in a long-term perspective and possible factors influencing this relationship. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This cohort of young adult ALL survivors allows for investigations of factors influencing HRQOL outcomes on a national level. Eligible participants are obtained from the Swedish Childhood Cancer quality registry. Data collection includes both a follow-up of data collected in 2012 (n=224) and recruitment of new eligible participants to the cohort (n=601). The cohort will cover survivors of paediatric ALL, diagnosed between 1985 and 2007, at an age between 0 and 15 years. Data will be collected using validated, multidimensional, self-administered instruments, designed to measure HRQOL (SF-36), social support, sense of coherence and resilience. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be carried out in accordance with the ethics permit obtained from the Swedish ethics review authority (Dnr 2019-05181). Dissemination of study results will take place through research articles and reports to the national patient organisation and the national network for consultancy nurses for this target group and to the working group for the Swedish national long-term care programme for childhood cancer.

Although the majority of children diagnosed with ALL are now cured and outcomes are improving for younger adults, older adults diagnosed with ALL usually succumb to their disease. Traditional chemotherapy regimens are poorly tolerated and ineffective in most older adults. Recently, novel chemotherapy agents such as inotuzumab ozogamicin and venetoclax have been successfully combined with dose reduced chemotherapy (mini-hyper-CVD) with promising results. Further study is needed to define the optimal combination and sequencing of novel agents and chemotherapy for different patient populations. This review discusses the challenge of treating older adults with traditional chemotherapy, experience to date with novel agents in combination with mini-hyper-CVD, as well as future directions and unanswered questions.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Although potent drugs are emerging, CML and AML may still relapse after the drug treatment is stopped. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and lncRNAs play certain roles in the occurrence and development of tumors, but m6A-modified LncRNAs in ML remain to be further investigated. METHODS: In this study, we extracted and analyzed the TCGA gene expression profile of 151 ML patients and the clinical data. On this basis, we then evaluated the immune infiltration capacity of ML and LASSO-penalized Cox analysis was applied to construct the prognostic model based on m6A related lncRNAs to verify the prognostic risk in clinical features of ML. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to detect the expression level of LncRNA in in ML cell lines K562, MOLM13 and acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. RESULTS: We found 70 m6A-related lncRNAs that were related to prognosis, and speculated that the content of stromal cells and immune cells would correlate with the survival of patients with ML. Next, Prognostic risk model of m6A-related lncRNAs was validated to have excellent consistency in clinical features of ML. Finally, we verified the expression levels of CRNDE, CHROMR and NARF-IT1 in ML cell lines K562, MOLM13 and acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1, which were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The research provides clues for the prognosis prediction of ML patients by using the m6A-related lncRNAs model we have created, and clarifies the accuracy and authenticity of it.",['(c) 2021.

Systemic inflammatory biomarkers have been confirmed as prognostic markers in several types of malignancy. Our objective was to explore the predictive value of pretreatment inflammatory biomarkers and establish a novel, clinically applicable prognostic index for adult patients with sporadic BL. METHODS: We surveyed retrospectively 336 adult patients with newly diagnosed sporadic BL at 8 Chinese medical centers and divided into training cohort (n = 229) and validation cohort (n = 107). The pretreatment inflammatory biomarkers were calculated for optimal cut-off value. The association between serum biomarkers and overall survival (OS) was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional models. The risk stratification was defined based on normal LDH level, Ann Arbor stage of I and completely resected abdominal lesion or single extra-abdominal mass < 10 cm. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that platelets< 254 x 10(9)/L, albumin< 40 g/L, lactate dehydrogenase>/=334 U/L independently predicted unfavorable OS. We used these data as the basis for the prognostic index, in which patients were stratified into Group 1 (no or one risk factor), Group 2 (two risk factors), or Group 3 (three risk factors), which were associated with 5-year OS rates of 88.1, 72.4, and 45%, respectively. In the subgroup analysis for high-risk patients, our prognostic model results showed that high-risk patients with no more than one adverse factor presented a 5-year survival rate of 85.9%, but patients with three adverse factors had a 5-year survival rate of 43.0%. Harrell's concordance index (C-index) of the risk group score was 0.768. Therefore, the new prognostic model could be used to develop risk-adapted treatment approaches for adult sporadic BL.",['(c) 2022.

To address how peri-HCT MRD dynamics could refine risk assessment across different conditioning intensities, we analyzed 810 adults transplanted in remission after myeloablative conditioning (MAC; n=515) or non-MAC (n=295) who underwent multiparameter flow cytometry-based MRD testing before and 20-40 days after allografting. Patients without pre- and post-HCT MRD (MRDneg/MRDneg) had the lowest risks of relapse and highest relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Relative to those patients, outcomes for MRDpos/MRDpos and MRDneg/MRDpos patients were poor regardless of conditioning intensity. Outcomes for MRDpos/MRDneg patients were intermediate. Among 161 patients with MRD before HCT, MRD was cleared more commonly with a MAC (85/104 [81.7%]) than non-MAC (33/57 [57.9%]) regimen (P=0.002). Although non-MAC regimens were less likely to clear MRD, if they did the impact on outcome was greater. Thus, there was a significant interaction between conditioning intensity and ""MRD conversion"" for relapse (P=0.020), RFS (P=0.002), and OS (P=0.001). Similar findings were obtained in the subset of 590 patients receiving HLA-matched allografts. C-statistic values were higher (indicating higher predictive accuracy) for peri-HCT MRD dynamics compared to the isolated use of pre-HCT MRD status and post-HCT MRD status for prediction of relapse, RFS, and OS. Across conditioning intensities, peri-HCT MRD dynamics improve risk assessment over isolated pre- or post-HCT MRD assessments.",['Copyright (c) 2022 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Paras, Gabrielle', 'Morsink, Linde M', 'Othus, Megan', 'Milano, Filippo', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Zarling, Lucas C', 'Palmieri, Raffaele', 'Schoch, Gary', 'Davis, Chris', 'Bleakley, Marie', 'Flowers, Mary Ed', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Storb, Rainer F', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Paras G', 'Morsink LM', 'Othus M', 'Milano F', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Zarling LC', 'Palmieri R', 'Schoch G', 'Davis C', 'Bleakley M', 'Flowers ME', 'Deeg HJ', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Storb RF', 'Walter RB']","['University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reaserch Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'University of Washington, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220107,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2022/01/08 06:00,2022/01/08 06:00,['2022/01/07 17:24'],"['2021/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/07 17:24 [entrez]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['483372 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021014804 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2022 Jan 7. pii: 483372. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021014804.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5408-5298', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3573-2159', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9767-9739', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3557-2351', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2855-8121', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7018-8702', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9343-4099', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9268-3341']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Post-remission maintenance therapy that prolongs MRD negativity or converts MRD positive (MRD+) patients to MRD negative (MRD-) status may delay or prevent relapse and improve overall survival (OS). In the phase 3 QUAZAR AML-001 trial, oral azacitidine (Oral-AZA; formerly CC-486), a hypomethylating agent, significantly prolonged OS and relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with placebo in patients aged >/=55 years with AML in first remission after intensive chemotherapy who were not candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this trial, MRD (>/=0.1% leukemic cells in bone marrow) was assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry in serial samples collected at baseline and on day 1 of every 3 cycles. As expected, baseline MRD status was significantly associated with both OS and RFS. Multivariate analyses showed Oral-AZA significantly improved OS and RFS vs. placebo independent of baseline MRD status. Oral-AZA treatment also extended the duration of MRD negativity by 6 months vs. placebo, and resulted in a higher rate of conversion from MRD+ at baseline to MRD- during treatment: 37% vs. 19%, respectively. In the Oral-AZA arm, 24% of MRD responders achieved MRD negativity >6 months after treatment initiation. While presence or absence of MRD was a strong prognostic indicator of OS and RFS, there were added survival benefits with Oral-AZA maintenance therapy compared with placebo, independent of patients' MRD status at baseline.

METHODS: 1,449,144 adults age 18-64 years newly diagnosed with 19 common cancers between 2010 and 2013 were identified from the National Cancer Database. States' Medicaid income eligibility limits were categorized as </= 50%, 51%-137%, and >/= 138% of federal poverty level (FPL). Survival time was measured from diagnosis date through December 31, 2017, for up to an 8-year follow-up. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with age as time scale were used to assess associations of eligibility limits and stage-specific survival, adjusting for the effects of sex, metropolitan statistical area, comorbidities, year of diagnosis, facility type and volume, and state. RESULTS: Among patients with newly diagnosed cancer age 18-64 years, patients living in states with lower Medicaid income eligibility limits had worse survival for most cancers in both early and late stages, compared with those living in states with Medicaid income eligibility limits >/= 138% FPL. A dose-response relationship was observed for most cancers with lower income limits associated with worse survival (13 of 17 cancers evaluated for early-stage cancers, and 11 of 17 cancers evaluated for late-stage cancers, and leukemia and brain tumors with P-trend < .05). CONCLUSION: Lower Medicaid income eligibility limits were associated with worse long-term survival within stage; increasing Medicaid income eligibility may improve survival after cancer diagnosis.",,"['Zhao, Jingxuan', 'Han, Xuesong', 'Nogueira, Leticia', 'Hyun, Noorie', 'Jemal, Ahmedin', 'Yabroff, K Robin']","['Zhao J', 'Han X', 'Nogueira L', 'Hyun N', 'Jemal A', 'Yabroff KR']","['Surveillance and Health Equity Science, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Surveillance and Health Equity Science, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Surveillance and Health Equity Science, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle, WA.', 'Surveillance and Health Equity Science, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Surveillance and Health Equity Science, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220107,United States,JCO Oncol Pract,JCO oncology practice,101758685,IM,,,2022/01/08 06:00,2022/01/08 06:00,['2022/01/07 17:12'],"['2022/01/07 17:12 [entrez]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/OP.21.00631 [doi]'],aheadofprint,JCO Oncol Pract. 2022 Jan 7:OP2100631. doi: 10.1200/OP.21.00631.,,,OP2100631,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2733-2000', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7159-7949', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6990-3660', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8923-1184', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0000-4111', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0644-5572']",,,,"['Jingxuan ZhaoResearch Funding: AstraZeneca Xuesong HanResearch Funding:', 'AstraZeneca K.

To be able to extract the specific spectral differences in a heterogeneous cell system with great spectroscopic similarities derived from many common biomolecular components, the maximum information entropy probability (MIEP) was proposed and exemplified by identifying normal lymphocytes from leukemia cells. The essential spectroscopic features were observed to locate at three Raman peaks whose spectral signatures were commensurate. The applicability of the extracted features was acknowledged by that the predicted identification accuracy of up to 93% was still achieved when only two peaks were loaded into decision tree model, which may provide the possibility of a clinically rapid hematological malignancy detection.

However, its further physiological and biochemical research is limited by CHA yield in liquid stated fermentation, which is a problem urgently awaiting solutions by effective biological strategies. In this work, Ca(2+) and Al(3+) were found which possessed a strong promoting effect on CHA production after multiple metal ions screening. Then, the addition condition of Ca(2+) and Al(3+) was respectively optimized on CHA production and DCW. The intermediate metabolites were increased obviously with co-addition of Ca(2+) and Al(3+) . The activities of key enzymes of DAHPs, AroAs and TrpCs in CHA biosynthesis pathway were improved by 3.58-, 3.60- and 3.34-folds respectively. Meanwhile, the transcription levels of laeA, dahp, cs, and trpC were up-regulated by 3.22-, 12.65-, 5.58- and 6.99-fold respectively by co-addition of Ca(2+) and Al(3+) . Additionally, the fermentation strategy was successfully scaled up to 5 L bioreactor, in which CHA production could attain 75.6 mg/L at 336 h. This work demonstrated that Ca(2+) and Al(3+) co-addition was an effective strategy for increasing CHA production, and the information obtained might be useful to fermentation of filamentous fungi with addition of metal ions.

Leukemias are the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality in children and the sixth most in adults. Relapsed leukemia represents a major component of the population that may benefit from genomic sequencing. However, ethical and analytic challenges arise when considering sequencing of biologic samples obtained from patients with relapsed leukemia following allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.

Leukemic cell's auxotrophy for L-asparagine is exploited as a therapeutic strategy to mediate cell death through metabolic blockade of L-asparagine using L-asparaginase. Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi serve as the major enzyme deriving sources accepted in clinical practise and the enzyme has bestowed improvements in patient outcomes over the last 40 years. However, an array of side effects generated by the native enzymes due to glutamine co-catalysis and short serum stays augmenting frequent dosages, intended a therapeutic switch towards the development of biobetter alternatives for the enzyme including the formulations resulting in sustained local depletion of L-asparagine. In addition, the treatment with L-asparaginase in few cancer types has proven to elicit drug-induced cytoprotective autophagy mechanisms and therefore warrants concern. Although the off-target glutamine hydrolysis has been viewed in contributing the drug-induced secondary responses in cells deficient with asparagine synthetase machinery, the beneficial role of glutaminase-asparaginase in proliferative regulation of asparagine prototrophic cells has been looked forward. The current review provides an overview on the enzyme's clinical applications in leukemia and possible therapeutic implications in other solid tumours, recent advancements in drug formulations, and discusses the aspects of two-sided roles of glutaminase-asparaginases and drug-induced cytoprotective autophagy mechanisms.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Sindhu R', 'Manonmani, H K']","['Sindhu R', 'Manonmani HK']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, JSS-AHER, Mysuru-570015, Karnataka, India.', 'Food Protectants and Infestation Control Department, CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru-570020, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220106,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['L-asparaginase', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'autophagy', 'biobetters', 'glutaminase-asparaginase', 'solid tumours']",2022/01/08 06:00,2022/01/08 06:00,['2022/01/07 08:45'],"['2021/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/07 08:45 [entrez]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-120006 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520622666220106103336 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2022 Jan 6. pii: ACAMC-EPUB-120006. doi: 10.2174/1871520622666220106103336.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, however, FCM does in many cases not permit proper counting of fluorophore-tagged markers on individual particles, due to a lack of tools for translating FCM output intensities into accurate numbers of fluorophores. This lack hinders derivation of detailed biologic information and comparison of data between experiments with FCM. To address this technological void, the authors here use DNA nanotechnology to design and construct barrel-shaped DNA-origami nanobeads for fluorescence/antigen quantification in FCM. Each bead contains a specific number of calibrator fluorophores and a fluorescent trigger domain with an alternative fluorophore for proper detection in FCM. Using electron microscopy, single-particle fluorescence microscopy, and FCM, the design of each particle is verified. To validate that the DNA bead-based FCM calibration enabled the authors to determine the number of antigens on a biological particle, the uniform and well-characterized murine leukemia virus (MLV) is studied. 48 +/- 11 envelope surface protein (Env) trimers per MLV is obtained, which is consistent with reported numbers that relied on low-throughput imaging.

Elevated expression of PIM-1 has been associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancer. There are no studies that have analyzed the response to radiotherapy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) according to the expression of PIM-1. The aim of our study was to analyze the relationship between the transcriptional expression of PIM-1 and local response to radiotherapy in HNSCC patients. METHODS: We determined the transcriptional expression of PIM-1 in 135 HNSCC patients treated with radiotherapy, including patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (n = 65) and bioradiotherapy (n = 15). RESULTS: During the follow-up, 48 patients (35.6%) had a local recurrence of the tumor. Patients with local recurrence had a higher level of PIM-1 expression than those who achieved local control of the disease (P = 0.017). Five-year local recurrence-free survival for patients with a high expression of PIM-1 (n = 43) was 44.6% (95% CI 29.2-60.0%), and for patients with low expression (n = 92) it was 71.9% (95% CI 62.5-81.3%) (P = 0.007). According to the results of multivariate analysis, patients with a high PIM-1 expression had a 2.2-fold increased risk of local recurrence (95% CI 1.22-4.10, P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Patients with elevated transcriptional expression levels of PIM-1 had a significantly higher risk of local recurrence after radiotherapy.",['(c) 2022.

However, data on the implication of autoantibodies in paediatric HSCT recipients are scarce. In this single-centre study of paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) surviving longer than 3 months, our objectives were to evaluate autoantibody expression and investigate the correlation with cGvHD and immune reconstitution using serially monitored parameters. Methods: We investigated circulating autoantibodies together with cellular and humoral parameters [including major T- and B-cell subsets, natural killer (NK) cells, and immunoglobulin levels] in 440 samples from 74 patients (median age 10.9 years, range 2.7-22.2 years) serially during long-term follow-up of median 8 years (range 0.4-19.3 years). Evaluations comprised of patient and transplant characteristics, precisely reviewed details of National Institute of Health (NIH)-defined cGvHD, and outcome data such as relapse, overall survival (OS) and mortality. Analysis of these clinical parameters was performed to identify possible associations. Results: Autoantibodies were detected in 65% (48/74) of patients. Anti-nuclear antibodies were the most common, occurring in 75% (36/48) of patients with autoantibodies. When comparing demographic data and transplant characteristics, there were no significant differences between patients with and without autoantibody expression; 5-year OS was excellent, at 96.4 and 95.8%, respectively. Neither the expression of autoantibodies nor the occurrence of cGvHD correlated with significantly worse OS or relapse rate. Furthermore, there was no significant association between autoantibody profiles and the incidence, overall severity or organ involvement of cGvHD. Patients with autoantibodies showed significantly better immune reconstitution, with overall higher numbers of T cells, B cells, and serum immunoglobulins. In autoantibody-positive patients with cGvHD, autoantibody production positively correlated with the expansion of CD56+ NK cells (236.1 vs. 165.6 x 10(3) cells/mL, respectively; p = 0.023) and with signs of B-cell perturbation, such as higher CD21(low) B cells (23.8 vs. 11.8 x 10(3) cells/mL, respectively; p = 0.044) and a higher ratio of CD21(low) B cells/CD27(+) memory B cells (1.7 vs. 0.4, respectively; p = 0.006) in comparison to autoantibody-positive patients without cGvHD. Furthermore, when assessing the correlation between autoantibody positivity and the activity of cGvHD at time of analysis, indicators of aberrant B-cell homeostasis were substantiated by a lower proportion of CD27(+) memory B cells (9.1 vs. 14.9%, respectively; p = 0.028), a higher ratio of class-switched CD27(+)IgD(-)/CD27(+) memory B cells (3.5 vs. 5.1%, respectively; p = 0.013), significantly elevated numbers of CD21(low) B cells (36.8 vs. 11.8 x 10(3) cells/mL, respectively; p = 0.013) and a higher ratio of CD21(low)B cells/CD27(+) memory B cells (2.4 vs. 0.4, respectively; p = 0.034) in the active vs. the no cGvHD group. We then assessed the potential role of autoantibody expression in the context of elevated CD19(+)CD21(low) B cells (cutoff >7%), a well-known marker of cGvHD. Surprisingly we found a significant higher proportion of those cases where elevated CD21(low) B cells correlated with active cGvHD in samples from the autoantibody-negative group vs. the antibody-positive group (82 vs. 47%, respectively; p = 0.0053). When comparing immune parameters of the large proportion of survivors (89%) with the small proportion of non-survivors (11%), data revealed normalisation within the B-cell compartment of survivors: there were increased numbers of CD27(+) memory B cells (54.9 vs. 30.6 x 10(3) cells/mL, respectively; p = 0.05), class-switched CD27(+)IgD(-) B cells (21.2 vs. 5.0 x 10(3) cells/mL, respectively; p < 0.0001), and immunoglobulin G4 (40.9 vs. 19.4 mg/dL, respectively; p < 0.0001). Overall mortality was significantly associated with an elevated proportion of CD21(low) B cells (13.4 vs. 8.8%, respectively; p = 0.039) and CD56(+) NK cells (238.8 vs. 314.1 x 10(3) cells/mL, respectively; p = 0.019). In multivariate analysis, better OS was significantly associated with lower numbers of CD56(+) NK cells [hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, p = 0.041] and higher numbers of CD27(+) memory B cells [(HR) 1.62, p = 0.014]. Conclusion: Our data shows that autoantibody profiles are not suitable biomarkers for diagnosing cGvHD in children or for predicting cGvHD severity, disease course and outcome. We identified a number of indicators of aberrant immune homeostasis associated with active cGvHD in paediatric ALL patients after HSCT. These findings confirm published results and suggest that candidate B cell subpopulations may serve as a surrogate measure for characterisation of cGvHD in paediatric HSCT for malignant diseases, and warrants confirmation in larger, multicentre studies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Lawitschka, Ronceray, Bauer, Rittenschober, Zubarovskaya,', 'Geyeregger, Pickl and Kuzmina.']","['Lawitschka, Anita', 'Ronceray, Leila', 'Bauer, Dorothea', 'Rittenschober, Michael', 'Zubarovskaya, Natalia', 'Geyeregger, Rene', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Kuzmina, Zoya']","['Lawitschka A', 'Ronceray L', 'Bauer D', 'Rittenschober M', 'Zubarovskaya N', 'Geyeregger R', 'Pickl WF', 'Kuzmina Z']","[""Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", ""Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'Institute of Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Pulmonology Department Ottakring Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211221,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,['NOTNLM'],"['B cells', 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'autoantibody', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'immune reconstitution', 'paediatric']",2022/01/08 06:00,2022/01/08 06:01,['2022/01/07 06:28'],"['2021/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/07 06:28 [entrez]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.788360 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Dec 21;9:788360. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.788360. eCollection 2021.,9,,788360,,,,PMC8724433,,"[""AL has served on advisory boards and received speaker's fees for participation in"", 'scientific meetings of the companies Therakos and Novartis.

However, the lack of specific biomarkers for IM resistance remains a serious clinical challenge. Recently, growing evidence has suggested that exosome-harbored proteins were involved in tumor drug resistance and could be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and drug sensitivity prediction of cancer. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the proteomic profile of plasma exosomes derived from CML patients to identify ideal biomarkers for IM resistance. Methods: We extracted exosomes from pooled plasma samples of 9 imatinib-resistant CML patients and 9 imatinib-sensitive CML patients by ultracentrifugation. Then, we identified the expression levels of exosomal proteins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based label free quantification. Bioinformatics analyses were used to analyze the proteomic data. Finally, the western blot (WB) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analyses were applied to validate the candidate proteins. Results: A total of 2812 proteins were identified in plasma exosomes from imatinib-resistant and imatinib-sensitive CML patients, including 279 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with restricted criteria (fold change>/=1.5 or </=0.667, p<0.05). Compared with imatinib-sensitive CML patients, 151 proteins were up-regulated and 128 proteins were down-regulated. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the main function of the upregulated proteins was regulation of protein synthesis, while the downregulated proteins were mainly involved in lipid metabolism. The top 20 hub genes were obtained using STRING and Cytoscape, most of which were components of ribosomes. Moreover, we found that RPL13 and RPL14 exhibited exceptional upregulation in imatinib-resistant CML patients, which were further confirmed by PRM and WB. Conclusion: Proteomic analysis of plasma exosomes provides new ideas and important information for the study of IM resistance in CML. Especially the exosomal proteins (RPL13 and RPL14), which may have great potential as biomarkers of IM resistance.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Zhao, Chen, Yao, Zhong, Chen, Xu, Jiang, Yang, Min, Lin,', 'Zhang, Liu, Wang and Huang.']","['Li, Mei-Yong', 'Zhao, Cui', 'Chen, Lian', 'Yao, Fang-Yi', 'Zhong, Fang-Min', 'Chen, Ying', 'Xu, Shuai', 'Jiang, Jun-Yao', 'Yang, Yu-Lin', 'Min, Qing-Hua', 'Lin, Jin', 'Zhang, Hai-Bin', 'Liu, Jing', 'Wang, Xiao-Zhong', 'Huang, Bo']","['Li MY', 'Zhao C', 'Chen L', 'Yao FY', 'Zhong FM', 'Chen Y', 'Xu S', 'Jiang JY', 'Yang YL', 'Min QH', 'Lin J', 'Zhang HB', 'Liu J', 'Wang XZ', 'Huang B']","['Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Huanggang Central Hospital Affiliated to Changjiang University, Huanggang, China.', 'Department of Ultrasound, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211221,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'exosomes', 'imatinib', 'proteomics', 'ribosomal protein L13', 'ribosomal protein L14']",2022/01/08 06:00,2022/01/08 06:01,['2022/01/07 06:28'],"['2021/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/07 06:28 [entrez]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.779567 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 21;11:779567. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.779567. eCollection 2021.,11,,779567,,,,PMC8724304,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alongside, robust genetic manipulations facilitated the generation of preclinical mouse models to validate mutations associated with poor prognosis and refractory B cell malignancies. Taken together, these studies identified new prognostic markers that could achieve characteristics of precision biomarkers for molecular diagnosis. On the contrary, the idea of augmented B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling as a transforming cue has somewhat receded despite the efficacy of Btk and Syk inhibitors. Recent studies from several research groups pointed out that acquired mutations in BCR components serve as faithful biomarkers, which become important for precision diagnostics and therapy, due to their relevant role in augmented BCR signaling and CLL pathogenesis. For example, we showed that expression of a single point mutated immunoglobulin light chain (LC) recombined through the variable gene segment IGLV3-21, named IGLV3-21(R110), marks severe CLL cases. In this perspective, we summarize the molecular mechanisms fine-tuning B cell transformation, focusing on immunoglobulin point mutations and recurrent mutations in tumor suppressors. We present a stochastic model for gain-of-autonomous BCR signaling and subsequent neoplastic transformation. Of note, additional mutational analyses on immunoglobulin heavy chain (HC) derived from non-subset #2 CLL IGLV3-21(R110) cases endorses our perspective. Altogether, we propose a model of malignant transformation in which the augmented BCR signaling creates a conducive platform for the appearance of transforming mutations.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Nicolo, Linder, Jumaa and Maity.']","['Nicolo, Antonella', 'Linder, Alexandra Theresa', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Maity, Palash Chandra']","['Nicolo A', 'Linder AT', 'Jumaa H', 'Maity PC']","['Institute of Immunology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211221,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR signaling', 'CLL', 'biomarkers', 'immunoglobulin genes', 'transformation']",2022/01/08 06:00,2022/01/08 06:01,['2022/01/07 06:28'],"['2021/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/07 06:28 [entrez]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.771669 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 21;11:771669. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.771669. eCollection 2021.,11,,771669,,,,PMC8724047,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed findings indicative of pituitary adenoma with apoplexy. He was noted to have thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow evaluation revealed precursor B-lineage CALLA-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Accordingly, he was started on dexamethasone and vincristine but succumbed to Acinetobacter baumanii-related hospital-acquired pneumonia two weeks after initiation of chemotherapy. We performed a literature search and found five cases of pituitary apoplexy secondary to haematological malignancy-related thrombocytopenia. The usual age of presentation was in the 6(th) to 7(th) decade, and there was slight male preponderance. The underlying pituitary adenoma was either nonfunctioning or a prolactinoma, and in majority, the apoplexy event occurred after the diagnosis of haematological malignancy.

Changes in the expression of immune checkpoints, including B7 homolog (H)1 and B7-H2, have been reported to contribute to AML progression. Binding of T cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain (TIGIT) among other immune checkpoints on natural killer (NK) and T cells to CD155/CD112 in tumors is supposed to be inhibitory; however, the mechanism by which changes in CD155 and CD112 expression affect tumor immunity remains unclear. When the increased expression of CD155 and CD112 activates Raf-MEK-ERK pathway and Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is one of the targets of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibition. The present study investigated the alterations in CD155 and CD112 expression under FLT3 inhibition (quizartinib and gilteritinib) and studied its effect on NK and T cell cytotoxicity. CD155 and CD112 expression was analyzed using flow cytometry and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR in AML cell lines with or without FLT3 mutation using FLT3 inhibitors. CD155 and CD112 expression was specifically downregulated by FLT3 inhibition in FLT3-mutated cell lines. Direct cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against these cells by NK cells were enhanced. However, the cytotoxicity of gammadelta T cells with low TIGIT expression compared with NK cells was not enhanced in direct cytotoxicity assay using luciferase luminescence. The analysis of clinical trials from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that high CD155 and CD112 expression is associated with poor overall survival.

This is a unique formula that is frequently used to treat malignant hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in modern clinical practice. An approach of network pharmacology and experimental validation were applied to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms of QHP in AML treatment. First, public databases for target genes known to be associated with AML are searched and compared to the target genes of the active compounds in QHP. Second, AML-associated genes and QHP target genes are compared to identify overlapping enriched genes, and these were used to predict selected target genes that may be implicated in the effects of QHP on AML. Additionally, we conducted functional enrichment analyses, such as gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The significantly enriched pathway associated with potential target proteins was the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, suggesting that these potential target proteins and pathways may mediate the beneficial biological effects of QHP on AML. All these following genes were found to occur in the compounds-target-pathway networks: AKT1, MAPK1, MAPK3, PIK3CG, CASP3, CASP9, TNF, TGFB1, MAPK8, and TP53. Then, based on the molecular docking studies, it was suggested that the active compound isovitexin can fit into the binding pockets of the top candidate QHP-AML target proteins (PIK3CG). Subsequently, based on the prediction by network pharmacology analysis, both in vitro AML cells and western blot experiments were performed to validate the curative role of QHP. QHP exerted its antitumor activity on AML in vitro, as it inhibits cells proliferation, reduced the expression of Bcl-2 protein, and downregulated the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, these results revealed that QHP could treat AML via a ""multicomponent, multitarget, multipathway"" regulatory network. Furthermore, our study also demonstrated that the combination of network pharmacology with the experimental study is effective in discovering and identifying QHP in the treatment of AML and its underlying pharmacological mechanisms.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Ying-jian Zeng et al.'],"['Zeng, Ying-Jian', 'Wu, Min', 'Zhang, Huan', 'Wu, Xin-Ping', 'Zhou, Lu', 'Wan, Na', 'Wu, Zhen-Hui']","['Zeng YJ', 'Wu M', 'Zhang H', 'Wu XP', 'Zhou L', 'Wan N', 'Wu ZH']","['Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211228,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,2022/01/08 06:00,2022/01/08 06:01,['2022/01/07 06:23'],"['2021/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/07 06:23 [entrez]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/6195174 [doi]'],epublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2021 Dec 28;2021:6195174. doi: 10.1155/2021/6195174. eCollection 2021.,2021,,6195174,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0742-7368', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2866-2642']",,PMC8727110,,['All authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an important member of the STAT family, STAT3 participates as a major regulator of cellular development and differentiation-associated genes. Prolonged and persistent STAT3 activation has been reported to be associated with tumor cell survival, proliferation, and invasion. Therefore, the JAK-STAT pathway can be a potential target for drug development to treat human cancers, e.g., hematological malignancies. Although STAT3 upregulation has been reported in hematopoietic cancers, protein-level STAT3 mutations have also been reported in invasive leukemias/lymphomas. The principal role of STAT3 in tumor cell growth clarifies the importance of approaches that downregulate this molecule. Epigenetic modifications are a major regulatory mechanism controlling the activity and function of STAT3. So far, several compounds have been developed to target epigenetic regulatory enzymes in blood malignancies. Here, we discuss the current knowledge about STAT3 abnormalities and carcinogenic functions in hematopoietic cancers, novel STAT3 inhibitors, the role of epigenetic mechanisms in STAT3 regulation, and targeted therapies, by focusing on STAT3-related epigenetic modifications.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zeinalzadeh, Valerievich Yumashev, Rahman, Marofi, Shomali,', 'Kafil, Solali, Sajjadi-Dokht, Vakili-Samiani, Jarahian and Hagh.']","['Zeinalzadeh, Elham', 'Valerievich Yumashev, Alexey', 'Rahman, Heshu Sulaiman', 'Marofi, Faroogh', 'Shomali, Navid', 'Kafil, Hossein Samadi', 'Solali, Saeed', 'Sajjadi-Dokht, Mehdi', 'Vakili-Samiani, Sajjad', 'Jarahian, Mostafa', 'Hagh, Majid Farshdousti']","['Zeinalzadeh E', 'Valerievich Yumashev A', 'Rahman HS', 'Marofi F', 'Shomali N', 'Kafil HS', 'Solali S', 'Sajjadi-Dokht M', 'Vakili-Samiani S', 'Jarahian M', 'Hagh MF']","['Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Prosthetic Dentistry, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Moscow, Russia.', 'College of Medicine, University of Sulaimani, Sulaimaniyah, Iraq.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Komar University of Science and Technology, Sulaimaniyah, Iraq.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Toxicology and Chemotherapy Unit (G401), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Toxicology and Chemotherapy Unit (G401), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211221,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,['NOTNLM'],"['Janus kinase', 'STAT3', 'epigenetics', 'leukemia', 'methylation']",2022/01/08 06:00,2022/01/08 06:01,['2022/01/07 06:23'],"['2021/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/07 06:23 [entrez]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2021.703883 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Dec 21;12:703883. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.703883. eCollection 2021.,12,,703883,,,,PMC8725977,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we attempted to incorporate infection location into the analysis to construct a rapid comorbidity scoring system independent of laboratory tests. Methods: Data were extracted from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care III database. A total of 3904 critically ill patients with immunocompromise admitted to ICU were enrolled and assigned into training or validation sets according to the date of ICU admission. The predictive nomogram was constructed in the training set based on logistic regression analysis and then undergone validation in the validation set in comparison with SOFA, CCI and ECI. Results: Factors eligible for the nomogram included patient's age, gender, ethnicity, underlying disease of immunocompromise like metastatic cancer and leukemia, possible infection on admission including pulmonary infection, urinary tract infection and blood infection, and one comorbidity, coagulopathy. The nomogram we developed exhibited better discrimination than SOFA, CCI and ECI with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.739 (95% CI 0.707-0.771) and 0.746 (95% CI 0.713-0.779) in the training and validation sets, respectively. Combining the nomogram and SOFA could bring a new prediction model with a superior predictive effect in both sets (training set AUC = 0.803 95% CI 0.777-0.828, validation set AUC = 0.818 95% CI 0.783-0.854). The calibration curve exhibited coherence between the nomogram and ideal observation for two cohorts (p>0.05). Decision curve analysis revealed the clinical usefulness of the nomogram in both sets. Conclusion: We established a nomogram that could provide an accurate assessment of 30 days ICU mortality in critically ill patients with immunocompromise, which can be employed to evaluate the short-term prognosis of those patients and bring more clinical benefits without dependence on laboratory tests.",['(c) 2021 Guo and Guo.'],"['Guo, Xuequn', 'Guo, Donghao']","['Guo X', 'Guo D']","[""Department of Respiratory Medicine, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, Fujian, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211224,New Zealand,Int J Gen Med,International journal of general medicine,101515487,,['NOTNLM'],"['30 days ICU mortality', 'immunocompromised patients', 'intensive care unit', 'large observational database', 'nomogram']",2022/01/08 06:00,2022/01/08 06:01,['2022/01/07 06:20'],"['2021/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/07 06:20 [entrez]', '2022/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJGM.S345632 [doi]', '345632 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Gen Med. 2021 Dec 24;14:10281-10292. doi: 10.2147/IJGM.S345632. eCollection 2021.,14,,10281-10292,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7677-7815', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8300-8176']",,PMC8713880,,['There is no conflict of interest related to this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleotide excision repair is carried out by DNA helicase encoded by xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) genes and aberrations in the XPD gene predisposes to increased risk of cancer. The present study aimed to investigate GSTT1, GSTM1 and XPD polymorphisms in newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients and to examine the association of these polymorphisms with the risk of developing CML. Patients and Methods: This case-control study was carried out from June 2019 to August 2021 involving 150 newly diagnosed patients with CML and an equal number of randomly selected age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. A multiplex-PCR assay was used to genotype GSTT1 null and GSTM1 null polymorphisms. XPD gene polymorphism was detected by PCR-RFLP using predesigned gene-specific primers. Results: GSTT1 and GSTM1 null polymorphisms were detected in 42.7% and 61.3% of cases, respectively, compared to 18% and 35.3% for controls. The combination of both GST null polymorphisms revealed a significant association with CML. Frequencies of XPD Lys751Gln genotypes in cases were 62.7% heterozygous Lys/Gln, 24% homozygous Lys/Lys and 13.3% homozygous Gln/Gln, while in the controls were 74.7%, 20%, and 5.3%, respectively. Significant differences were also noted regarding the combination of GSTT1/GSTM1 null with XPD Lys/Lys, and GSTM1 null with XPD Lys/Lys. Conclusion: In conclusion, GSTT1 null, GSTM1 null and XPD polymorphisms showed positive association with the risk of development of CML.

WT1 overexpression is common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, WT1 mutations occur in only about 10% of cases, with increasing incidence in the setting of relapse. In this study, we investigated the clinical and molecular characteristics of WT1 mutations in NPM1-mutated AML, to enhance our understanding of the biology and potential therapeutic implications of WT1 mutations. Our study cohort included 67 patients with NPM1 mutated AML and a median follow-up of 13.7 months. WT1 mutations were identified in 7% (n = 5) of patients at the time of initial diagnosis. WT1 mutant clones were presumed to be present as co-dominant clones in 3/5 and in subclonal populations in 2/5 cases based on variant allelic frequency (VAF) when compared with NPM1 mutation VAF. All WT1 mutations became undetectable at time of MRD-negative (NPM1-wild type) remission. None of these patients experienced relapse at the time of last follow-up (median, 15 months; range, 4.5-20.2 months). A total of 15/67 (22%) patients relapsed; among these patient, four (27%) relapsed with WT1 mutant AML. Three of four patients had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). None of these patients had detectable WT1 mutations at the time of initial diagnosis. WT1 mutations were presumed clonal in two cases and subclonal in the other two cases, based on VAF. Our results indicate that WT1 mutations contribute to relapse in NPM1 mutated AML, especially in the setting of HSCT. These findings suggest that emerging WT1 mutations may serve as a conduit for relapse in NPM1-mutated AML, and that sequential molecular profiling to evaluate potential emergent WT1 mutations during surveillance and particularly at relapse likely has prognostic value in patients with NPM1 mutated AML.","['(c) 2021.

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System database. We included all children (6 months - 17 years) from 2011 to 2020 with an ED diagnosis of BP. We excluded children with previous neurologic chronic condition or malignancy diagnosed during or prior to the index visit. Our primary outcome was diagnosis of malignancy within 60 days following the index ED visit. We compared clinical characteristics between children with and without new-onset malignancy. RESULTS: Of 12,272 encounters for BP, 41 had a new oncologic diagnosis within 60 days (0.33%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.25-0.45%). Median time to oncologic diagnosis was 22 days. Primary CNS malignancy (59%) and leukemia (17.1%) were the most common diagnoses. Younger children had a higher incidence of new oncologic diagnosis compared with older children. Incidences were 0.68% (95% CI 0.36-1.3%), 0.70% (95% CI 0.38-1.3%), 0.26% (95% CI 0.15-0.47%), and 0.21% (95% CI 0.12-0.37%) for children aged <2 years, 2-5 years, 6-11 years, and 12-17 years respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found a small but potentially clinically significant rate of new-onset oncologic diagnosis within 60 days after BP diagnosis in the ED, especially in children younger than 5 years. Further studies of the diagnostic utility of laboratory testing or neuroimaging and the risk of empiric steroids in children with BP are needed.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, there remains an area of unmet need for patients who progress on novel therapies. The development of cellular therapies in CLL has been hindered by CLL induced immunosuppression. Fortunately, recent progress in various methods in immunomodulation may help overcome this limitation in CLL. These advances have spurred ongoing interest in the development of cellular therapies for CLL, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, bi-specific antibodies, and use of natural killer cells. These novel treatment modalities may hold promise for patients with refractory, and potentially transformed disease. Here, we discuss the development of CAR-T cell therapy in CLL and the impact of combining CAR-T and small molecule inhibitors on treatment outcomes, the evolving role of bi-specific antibodies and natural killer cells, and comment on the use of cellular therapies for Richter's syndrome.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

However, AOE rates vary depending on the definitions and reporting approach used. METHODS: To better understand clinically relevant AOEs with ponatinib, an independent cardiovascular adjudication committee reviewed 5-year AOE data from the PACE trial according to a charter-defined process and standardized event definitions. RESULTS: A total of 449 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) received ponatinib (median age 59 y; 47% female; 93% >/= 2 prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); median follow-up, 37.3 months). The adjudicated AOE rate (17%) was lower than the non-adjudicated rate (i.e., rate before adjudication; 25%). The only adjudicated AOE in > 2% of patients was peripheral arterial occlusive disease (4%). Exposure-adjusted incidence of newly occurring adjudicated AOEs decreased over time. Patients with multiple baseline cardiovascular risk factors had higher adjudicated AOE rates than those without risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: This independent adjudication study identified lower AOE rates than previously reported, suggesting earlier overestimation that may inaccurately reflect AOE risk with ponatinib.

However, the regulatory mechanisms by which TAMs influence the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain unclear. Here, we report that hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) acts as a novel oncoprotein in TNBC. We found that HLF was regulated by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) that is secreted by TAMs. Then, HLF transactivated gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1) to promote the ferroptosis resistance, thus driving TNBC cell proliferation, metastasis and cisplatin resistance. Reciprocally, IL-6 produced by TNBC cells activated the JAK2/STAT3 axis to induce TGF-beta1 secretion by TAMs, thus constituted a feed-forward circuit. The accuracy of TNBC patient prognosis could be improved by employing a combination of HLF and GGT1 values. Thus, our findings document that the interactive dialogue between TNBC cells and TAMs promotes sustained activation of HLF in tumor cells through the IL-6-TGF-beta1 axis. Subsequently, HLF promotes the ferroptosis resistance in TNBC cells via GGT1 and ultimately facilitates the malignant tumor progression. Our study provides a potential target for the treatment of TNBC.",['(c) 2022.

The efficacy of targeted approaches with blinatumomab and Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO), outweigh that of conventional chemotherapeutic regimens, and the reduced toxicity profile has also translated into higher transplant realization rates. Factors influencing the sequential use of these two antibodies include the preference for InO in those with high disease burden, while blinatumomab is a superior agent for attaining MRD responses in low disease burden groups.

On day 4 of admission, initial blood cultures grew Moraxella nonliquefaciens, and targeted antibiotic therapy was initiated and continued for a total of 21 days. The patient was discharged after 6 days of in-patient therapy and made a full recovery. M. nonliquefaciens has been reported to be associated with multiple types of infection, but no cases of M. nonliquefaciens-associated ecthyma gangrenosum were identified in the literature review for this report.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been shown to promote follicular growth, through the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, triggered the elevation of GC apoptosis within follicles, and then prevented follicular growth. However, combined treatment with LIF relieved the follicular regression caused by rapamycin, mainly resulting in alleviating the decline of GCs viability and cell autophagic apoptosis, and eventually, promoting follicle development. Further investigation revealed that LIF inhibited the GC autophagic apoptosis by activating PI3K/AKT and Stat3 pathways, reflecting an increase of BCL-2 expression but a decrease in BECN1. Additionally, blocking PI3K/AKT and Stat3 pathways resulted in the reduction of LIF protection against follicular atresia. These findings illustrated that LIF activated the PI3K/AKT and Stat3 signaling pathways to inhibit GC autophagic cell death, and further relieve chicken follicular atresia.",['Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

On rare occasion, patients with IBD develop myeloid neoplasms; however, the frequency and clinicopathological features of IBD-associated lymphoid and myeloid proliferative disorder (LMPD) in Japanese patients is still unclear. In this study, we reviewed 2474 Japanese patients with IBD, and found that LMPD occurred in 12 (0.5%) patients with UC (n=7) or CD (n=5). Together with an additional 3 cases, we analyzed a total of 15 cases of LMPD for clinicopathological and histological features. Based on the status of using immunosuppressants such as biologics and immunomodulators, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and histopathology, the 15 cases were classified into the Group I (high-grade LPD; n=7), Group II (low-grade LPD; n=5), and Group III (myeloid neoplasms; n=3). Most patients in Group I were undergoing strong immunosuppressive therapy, and the LPD lesions corresponded to high-grade B-cell or T/NK-cell lymphoma often with EBV infection. Discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs alone did not resolve these LPDs; Group I patients required chemotherapy, and eventually 4 of them (57%) died of the tumor. Most cases in Group II were low-grade B-cell lymphoma without EBV infection and had an indolent clinical course with excellent prognosis. All patients in Group III developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) during the course of CD. Two (67%) of these patients died of AML.

Following cancer cell death, a growing body of evidence suggests an important role for remaining apoptotic debris in regulating the immunologic response to, and growth of, solid tumors. Here we investigated the role of macrophage LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) within the BM microenvironment of AML. Depletion of BM macrophages increased AML growth in-vivo. We showed that LAP is the predominate method of BM macrophage phagocytosis of dead and dying cells in the AML microenvironment. Targeted inhibition of LAP led to accumulation of apoptotic cells (AC) and apoptotic bodies (AB) resulting in accelerated leukemia growth. Mechanistically, LAP of AMLderived-AB by BM macrophages, resulted in STING pathway activation. We identified that AML derived mitochondrial damage associated molecular patterns were processed by BM macrophages via LAP. Moreover, depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in AML derived-AB showed that it is this mtDNA which was responsible for the induction of STING signalling in BM macrophages. Phenotypically we found that STING activation suppressed AML growth through a mechanism related to increased phagocytosis.

CAR T cells are a type of cellular immunotherapy that artificially enhances T cells to boost eradication of malignancy through activation of the native immune system. The CAR construct is a synthetically created functional cell receptor grafted onto previously harvested patient T cells, which bind to preselected tumor-associated antigens and thereby activate host immune signaling cascades to attack tumor cells. Advantages include a single treatment episode of 2-3 weeks and durable disease elimination, with remission rates of over 80%. Responses to therapy are more rapid than with conventional chemotherapy or immunotherapy, with intervening short-interval edema. CAR T-cell administration is associated with therapy-related toxic effects in a large percentage of patients, notably cytokine release syndrome, immune effect cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and infections related to immunosuppression. Knowledge of the expected evolution of therapy response and potential adverse events in CAR T-cell therapy and correlation with the timeline of treatment are important to optimize patient care. Some toxic effects are radiologically evident, and familiarity with their imaging spectrum is key to avoiding misinterpretation. Other clinical toxic effects may be occult at imaging and are diagnosed on the basis of clinical assessment. Future directions for CAR T-cell therapy include new indications and expanded tumor targets, along with novel ways to capture T-cell activation with imaging.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ara-C-pathway genes were analyzed with outcome in patients from the multicenter-AML02 trial (N = 166). Multi-SNP predictor modeling was used to develop 10-SNP Ara-C_SNP score (ACS10) using top SNPs predictive of minimal residual disease and event-free survival (EFS) from the AML02-cohort and four SNPs previously associated with ara-C triphosphate levels in the AML97 trial. ACS10 was evaluated for association with outcomes in each clinical trial arms: the standard low-dose ara-C (LDAC, n = 91) and augmented high-dose ara-C (HDAC, n = 75) arms of AML02 and the standard Ara-C, daunorubicin and etoposide (ADE) (n = 465) and the augmented ADE + gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO; n = 466) arms of AAML0531 trial. RESULTS: In the standard LDAC-arm of AML02 cohort, the low-ACS10 score group (</= 0) had significantly worse EFS (ACS10 low v high hazard ratio [HR] = 2.81; 95% CI, 1.45 to 5.43; P = .002) and overall survival (OS; HR = 2.98; 95% CI, 1.32 to 6.75; P = .009) compared with the high-ACS10 group (score > 0). These results were validated in the standard-ADE arm of AAML0531, with poor outcome in the low-ASC10 group compared with the high-ACS10 group (EFS: HR = 1.35, 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.75, P = .026; OS: HR = 1.64, 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.22, P = .002). Within the augmented arms (AML02-HDAC and AAML0531-ADE + GO), EFS and OS did not differ between low- and high-ACS10 score groups. In both cohorts, patients with low-ACS10 consistently showed a 10-percentage point improvement in 5-year EFS with augmented therapy (AML02-HDAC or AAML0531-ADE + GO arms) than with standard therapy (AML02-LDAC or AAML0531-ADE arms). CONCLUSION: Patients with low-ACS10 score experienced significantly poor outcome when treated on standard regimen. Augmentation with either high-dose ara-C or GO addition improved outcome in low-ACS10 group.

METHODS: In this retrospective study between July 2009 and April 2019, 3,87,359 consecutive structured radiology reports for computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis from 91,665 patients spanning 30 types of cancer were included. A randomized sample of 2,022 reports from patients with colorectal cancer, hepatobiliary cancer (HB), leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and non-HL patients was manually annotated as positive or negative for splenomegaly. NLP model training/testing was performed on 1,617/405 reports, and a new validation set of 400 reports from all cancer subtypes was used to test NLP model accuracy, precision, and recall. Overall survival was compared between the patient groups (with and without splenomegaly) using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: The final cohort included 3,87,359 reports from 91,665 patients (mean age 60.8 years; 51.2% women). In the testing set, the model achieved accuracy of 92.1%, precision of 92.2%, and recall of 92.1% for splenomegaly. In the validation set, accuracy, precision, and recall were 93.8%, 92.9%, and 86.7%, respectively. In the entire cohort, splenomegaly was most frequent in patients with leukemia (32.5%), HB (17.4%), non-HL (9.1%), colorectal cancer (8.5%), and HL (5.6%). A splenomegaly label was associated with an increased risk of mortality in the entire cohort (hazard ratio 2.10; 95% CI, 1.98 to 2.22; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Automated splenomegaly labeling by NLP of radiology report demonstrates good accuracy, precision, and recall.

The impact of standard molecular evaluation and risk category of the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 classification model on early mortality has not been rigorously evaluated thus far. We reviewed the medical records of 320 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed AML treated with intensive induction chemotherapy in our center from 2007 to 2021. The median age was 56 years; 33 patients (10%) died during induction. Patient age, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, platelet level, creatinine, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase serum levels, and FLT3-ITD and CEBPA mutational status did not significantly impact early mortality. NPM1(mut) patients had a lower likelihood of early death compared to NPM1(wt) (5% versus 13%; p = 0.023) whereas patients with high-risk cytogenetic studies experienced higher rates of induction mortality compared with intermediate and favorable risk patients (20% versus 8 and 7%, respectively; p = 0.049). Adverse risk ELN 2017 was significantly more likely to die during induction compared with intermediate and favorable risk patients (20% versus 10 and 4%, respectively; p = 0.001). Patients treated in 2007-2011 experienced a significantly higher rate of induction death compared with patients in 2012-2021 (17% versus 8%; p = 0.039). Multivariate analysis confirmed adverse ELN 2017 [odds ratio (OR), 6.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.74-25.3; p = 0.006) and treatment timeframe (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14-0.85; p = 0.019) as pivotal predictors of early mortality. ELN 2017 is a robust prognosticator of early mortality in intensively treated AML patients.","['(c) 2021.

We encountered a 58-year-old man with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) that relapsed after haploidentical HCT from his daughter. Peripheral blood samples collected at HCT and at relapse were analyzed, and CD14(+)/CD16(-) monocytes that typically accumulate in CMML were isolated by flow cytometry. Whole-exome sequencing of the monocytes revealed 8 common mutations in CMML at HCT. In addition, a PHF6 nonsense mutation not detected at HCT was detected at relapse. RNA sequencing could not detect changes in expression of HLA or immune-checkpoint molecules, which are important mechanisms of immune evasion. However, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that a TNF-alpha signaling pathway was downregulated at relapse. Ubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine residue 120 (H2BK120ub) at relapse was significantly decreased at the protein level, indicating that PHF6 loss might downregulate a TNF-alpha signaling pathway by reduction of H2BK120ub. This case illustrates that PHF6 loss contributes to a competitive advantage for the clone under stress conditions and leads to relapse after HCT.",['(c) 2022.

We intended to investigate the critical roles and mechanism underlying homo sapiens circular RNA 0003602 (hsa_circ_0003602) in AML progression, especially in tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Real-time PCR was applied to identify the differential expression of hsa_circ_0003602 and miR-502-5p in AML bone marrow tissues and cell lines. In addition, western blot analysis was employed to determine the levels insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) protein. The biological behaviors were assessed by CCK-8 cell viability assay, flow cytometry assay for apoptosis detection, and Transwell migration and invasion assay. The relationships between target miRNA and downstream mRNA were investigated by bioinformatics, luciferase reporter assay, and biotin-labeled RNA pull-down assay. Hsa_circ_0003602 was upregulated and predicted poor survival in AML. Knockdown of hsa_circ_0003602 in AML cell lines induced the inhibition of proliferation, migration, and invasion and caused apoptosis. Hsa_circ_0003602 sequestered miR-502-5p by functioning as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), thereby regulating IGF1R expression. Hsa_circ_0003602 acted as a tumor promoter in AML via miR-502-5p/IGF1R axis. Our study provides evidence that hsa_circ_0003602, miR-502-5p, and IGF1R might form a regulatory axis to affect the carcinogenicity of AML cells and provide potential targets for the treatment of AML.","['(c) 2021.

METHODS: Searched databases included EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (EBSCO Information Services), and Web of Science (Thomson Reuters). Eligible studies included: (1) original research; (2) published in English; (3) a diagnosis of cancer between 0 and 21 years; (4) survivors at least 5 years from diagnosis and/or 2 years from therapy completion; and (5) quantitative assessment of social adjustment. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 3698 articles of which 43 were included in the final review. Risk of bias was assessed using domains adapted from the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Quality of evidence was evaluated following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. There was some evidence that school-aged and adolescent/young adult survivors experienced worse social adjustment compared to controls. There was some evidence suggesting cranial radiation therapy (CRT) is associated with social adjustment difficulties among young adult survivors. Inconsistent evidence was found for relapse, age at diagnosis and study, sex, and late effects in relation to social adjustment. CONCLUSION: Survivors of pediatric ALL were at higher risk of social adjustment difficulties compared to controls. However, evidence for treatment and non-treatment risk and resilience factors require stronger evidence. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Information on modifiable factors that modulate social adjustment may influence targets of intervention and follow-up guidelines.","['(c) 2021.

Therefore, we aim to explore the alterations of nutritional status after CAR-T cell therapy in patients with hematological malignancies. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of patients with acute leukemia (AL), lymphoma, and multiple myeloma (MM), who underwent CAR-T therapy at our hospital from 2018 to 2020. The serum albumin, triglyceride, and cholesterol before and 7, 14, and 21 days after CAR-T cell infusion were compared and analyzed. RESULT: A total of 117 patients were enrolled, consisting of 39 AL, 23 lymphoma, and 55 MM patients. The baseline albumin, triglyceride, and cholesterol were 37.43 +/- 5.08 mg/L, 1.63 +/- 0.74 mmol/L, and 3.62 +/- 1.03 mmol/L, respectively. The lowest albumin level was found at 7 days after CAR-T cell infusion compared with baseline (P < 0.001), while the levels of triglyceride increased at 14 and 21 days (P < 0.001, P = 0.036). The levels of cholesterol at 7, 14, and 21 days after CAR-T cell infusion were lower than baseline (all P < 0.05). Spearman's correlation coefficient showed cytokine release syndrome grade was negatively correlated with the levels of albumin at 7 days and cholesterol at 21 days after CAR-T cell infusion (r = - 0.353, P < 0.001; r = - 0.395, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The alterations of different nutrition-related biochemical parameters varied after CAR-T cell therapy. The levels of albumin and total cholesterol after CAR-T cell infusion were negatively correlated with the grade of cytokine release syndrome. Specific screening and intervention for malnutrition in patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy need to be explored in further studies.","['(c) 2022.

Musashi-1 (MSI1), long considered as an intestinal and neural stem cell marker, has been more recently found to be over expressed in many cancers. It has served as an important drug target for treating acute myeloid leukemia and solid tumors such as ovarian, colorectal and bladder cancer. One of the reported binding targets of MSI1 is Numb, a negative regulator of the Notch signaling. However, the dynamic mechanism of Numb RNA binding to MSI1 remains unknown, largely hindering effective drug design targeting this critical interaction. Here, we have performed extensive all-atom microsecond-timescale simulations using a robust Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) method, which successfully captured multiple times of spontaneous and highly accurate binding of the Numb RNA from bulk solvent to the MSI1 protein target site. GaMD simulations revealed that Numb RNA binding to MSI1 involved largely induced fit in both the RNA and protein. The simulations also identified important low-energy intermediate conformational states during RNA binding, in which Numb interacted mainly with the beta2-beta3 loop and C terminus of MSI1. The mechanistic understanding of RNA binding obtained from our GaMD simulations is expected to facilitate rational structure-based drug design targeting MSI1 and other RBPs.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Wang, Jinan', 'Lan, Lan', 'Wu, Xiaoqing', 'Xu, Liang', 'Miao, Yinglong']","['Wang J', 'Lan L', 'Wu X', 'Xu L', 'Miao Y']","['Center for Computational Biology, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 66047, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 66047, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 66047, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 66047, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 66047, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.', 'Center for Computational Biology, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 66047, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 66047, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211214,Netherlands,Curr Res Struct Biol,Current research in structural biology,101767537,,['NOTNLM'],"['Binding pathway and mechanism', 'Free energy landscape', 'Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics', 'Musashi RNA-binding proteins', 'Protein-RNA binding']",2022/01/07 06:00,2022/01/07 06:01,['2022/01/06 06:05'],"['2021/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/06 06:05 [entrez]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.crstbi.2021.12.002 [doi]', 'S2665-928X(21)00030-1 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Res Struct Biol. 2021 Dec 14;4:10-20. doi: 10.1016/j.crstbi.2021.12.002. eCollection 2022.,4,,10-20,,,,PMC8695263,,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite playing a role in cellular signaling, it is found overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia and also an independent prognostic marker in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. However, the biological effect of ZC3H15 in malignant melanoma (MM) remains unexplored. The expression of ZC3H15 in patients was analyzed using the R2: Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform database. Immunohistochemical analysis, western blot, and qRT-PCR were used to detect ZC3H15 expression in melanoma tissues and cell lines. MTT, BrdU, flow cytometry assay, transwell, and western blot were performed to explore the proliferation, cell cycle, invasion, and migration of melanoma cells. We undertaken colony formation assay in vitro and tumor xenograft in vivo to detect the tumorigenicity of melanoma cells. In the present study, ZC3H15 was demonstrated highly expressed in melanoma tissues and cells. Elevated ZC3H15 impairs the survival of melanoma patients. Meanwhile, attenuation of ZC3H15 in melanoma cells inhibited cell proliferation and induced cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Consistently, the expression of cell cycle-related proteins cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), CDK6, and cyclin D1 (CCND1) was decreased while p21 was upregulated. Furthermore, we found the migration and invasion abilities were inhibited in ZC3H15-knockdown melanoma cells. In addition, downregulation of ZC3H15 resulted in inhibition of colony formation abilities in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. ZC3H15 promotes proliferation, migration/invasion, and tumorigenicity of melanoma cells. As a promising biomarker and therapeutic target in MM, ZC3H15 is worthy of further exploration.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Qian Li et al.'],"['Li, Qian', 'Hou, Jianbing', 'Guo, Chengda', 'Zhang, Yanli', 'Liu, Lichao', 'Hu, Huanrong', 'Shi, Shaomin', 'Ji, Yacong', 'Guo, Leiyang', 'Shi, Yaqiong', 'Liu, Yaling', 'Cui, Hongjuan']","['Li Q', 'Hou J', 'Guo C', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu L', 'Hu H', 'Shi S', 'Ji Y', 'Guo L', 'Shi Y', 'Liu Y', 'Cui H']","['Department of Dermatology, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, No. 139, Ziqiang Road, Shijiazhuang, 050051 Hebei, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, No. 2, Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, No. 2, Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'Cancer Center, Medical Research Institute, Southwest University, No. 2, Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050051 Hebei, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, No. 139, Ziqiang Road, Shijiazhuang, 050051 Hebei, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, No. 139, Ziqiang Road, Shijiazhuang, 050051 Hebei, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, No. 139, Ziqiang Road, Shijiazhuang, 050051 Hebei, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, No. 139, Ziqiang Road, Shijiazhuang, 050051 Hebei, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Shijiazhuang, 050051 Hebei, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, No. 139, Ziqiang Road, Shijiazhuang, 050051 Hebei, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, No. 139, Ziqiang Road, Shijiazhuang, 050051 Hebei, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, No. 139, Ziqiang Road, Shijiazhuang, 050051 Hebei, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University, No. 139, Ziqiang Road, Shijiazhuang, 050051 Hebei, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology, Southwest University, No. 2, Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400715, China.', 'Cancer Center, Medical Research Institute, Southwest University, No. 2, Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400715, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211227,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,,,2022/01/07 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2022/01/06 06:00'],"['2021/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/8305299 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2021 Dec 27;2021:8305299. doi: 10.1155/2021/8305299. eCollection 2021.,2021,,8305299,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4321-399X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1178-1570']",,PMC8723872,,"['The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",,,,,20220114,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ZC3H15 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']","['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'G1 Phase/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Prognosis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Human NSCLC H1975 cells were treated with Andro (0-20 microM) for 4-72 h. B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-antagonist/killer (Bak)-small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Bak-siRNA) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1)-siRNA were transfected into H1975 cells to inhibit the endogenic Bak and FBP1 expression, respectively, and their expressions were detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB). Cellular proliferation ability was determined through various assessments, including 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), colony formation, and cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. Cell apoptosis ability was measured using flow cytometry. Pro-apoptotic-related proteins (cleaved caspase 9, cleaved caspase 8, and cleaved caspase 3) and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway proteins [Bcl2-associated X (Bax), Bak, Bcl-2, and cytochrome C (cyto C)] were assessed by WB. Aerobic glycolysis-associated genes [pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)] and gluconeogenesis genes [phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PEPCK1), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), and phosphofructokinase (PFK)] were measured by qRT-PCR. The mitochondrial membrane depolarization sensor, 5, 50, 6, 60-tetrachloro-1, 10, 3, 30 tetraethyl benzimidazolo carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) assay was used for the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). Additionally, glycolytic metabolism, lactate production, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis were also analyzed. Results: Andro inhibited human NSCLC cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-time or dose-dependent manner via activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Andro inhibited glycolysis, promoted the gluconeogenesis pathway, and increased the levels of cleaved caspase 9, cleaved caspase 8, cleaved caspase 3, Bax, Bak, PEPCK1, FBP1, and PFK, and decreased the levels of Bcl-2, PKM2, LDHA, and GLUT1. Moreover, it also decreased the DeltaPsim and facilitated the release of cyto C from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, Andro enhanced the mitochondrial translocation of Bak, glucose uptake, lactate release, and intracellular ATP synthesis. Suppression of endogenic Bak and FBP1 expression significantly reduced the effects of Andro in H1975 cells. Conclusions: Andro represses NSCLC cell proliferation through the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and by reprogramming glucose metabolism.",['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

It has been shown that Shen Qi Sha Bai Decoction (SQSBD) has been extensively used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the mechanism of SQSBD in treating AML remains unclear. In this study, we employed network pharmacology to analyze the potential active components and elucidate molecular mechanism of SQSBD in treating AML. A total of 268 active components were identified from SQSBD, among which 9 key components (Quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, licochalcone A, formononetin, wogonin, beta-sitosterol, oroxylin A, naringenin, and baicalein) were hit by the 6 hub targets (CDK1, MAPK1, JUN, PCNA, HSB1, STAT3) associated with leukemia. Molecular docking showed that two core active components, quercetin and licochalcone A, exhibited the highest component-like properties (DL), and could bind well to CDK1 and MAPK1 protein. The experimental validation of these two components showed that quercetin inhibited cell growth through CDK1 dephosphorylation-mediated cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in human AML U937 and HL60 cells, and licochalcone A induced cell differentiation in these leukemia cells via activation of MAPK1 and upregulation of CD11b. All these results indicate that SQSBD is effective in the treatment of AML, and quercetin and licochalcone A are the major candidate compounds for AML treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Jia, Jiang, Li, Ding, Lei, Xu and Gao.']","['Jia, Guanfei', 'Jiang, Xiuxing', 'Li, Zhiqiang', 'Ding, Xin', 'Lei, Ling', 'Xu, Shuangnian', 'Gao, Ning']","['Jia G', 'Jiang X', 'Li Z', 'Ding X', 'Lei L', 'Xu S', 'Gao N']","['College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Basic Pharmacology of Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Ethnomedicine of Ministry of Education, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211220,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['KEGG', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'go', 'molecular docking', 'network pharmacology']",2022/01/07 06:00,2022/01/07 06:01,['2022/01/06 05:59'],"['2021/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/06 05:59 [entrez]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fcell.2021.796757 [doi]', '796757 [pii]']",epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Dec 20;9:796757. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.796757. eCollection 2021.,9,,796757,,,,PMC8720969,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method: A total of 2,530 pediatric patients who were diagnosed with B-ALL were classified into two groups based on the ETV6/RUNX1 status by using a retrospective cohort study method from February 28, 2008, to June 30, 2020, at 22 participating ALL centers. Results: In total, 461 (18.2%) cases were ETV6/RUNX1-positive. The proportion of patients with risk factors (age <1 year or >/=10 years, WB>/=50x10(9)/L) in ETV6/RUNX1-positive group was significantly lower than that in negative group (P<0.001), while the proportion of patients with good early response (good response to prednisone, D15 MRD < 0.1%, and D33 MRD < 0.01%) in ETV6/RUNX1-positive group was higher than that in the negative group (P<0.001, 0.788 and 0.004, respectively). Multivariate analysis of 2,530 patients found that age <1 or >/=10 years, SCCLG-ALL-2016 protocol, and MLL were independent predictor of outcome but not ETV6/RUNX1. The EFS and OS of the ETV6/RUNX1-positive group were significantly higher than those of the negative group (3-year EFS: 90.11 +/- 4.21% vs 82 +/- 2.36%, P<0.0001, 3-year OS: 91.99 +/- 3.92% vs 88.79 +/- 1.87%, P=0.017). Subgroup analysis showed that chemotherapy protocol, age, prednisone response, and D15 MRD were important factors affecting the prognosis of ETV6/RUNX1-positive children. Conclusions: ETV6/RUNX1-positive pediatric ALL showed an excellent outcome but lack of independent prognostic significance in South China. However, for older patients who have the ETV6/RUNX1 fusion and slow response to therapy, to opt for more intensive treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Qiu, Xu, Luo, Mai, Liao, Yang, Zheng, Wan, Wu, Liu,

In this study, we report the characteristics and outcomes of children with cancer-associated thrombosis. METHODS: We reviewed institutional databases for all children with cancer and a diagnosis of VTE at King Hussein Cancer Center in Jordan. Variables reviewed are patients' clinical characteristics, treatment for cancer, and anticoagulation therapy. RESULTS: Between January 2011 and December 2018, a total of 45 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and the median age was 10.4 (0.8-17.9) years. The most common underlying diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 13, 29%). At the time of VTE, 29 (64.4%) patients were receiving chemotherapy, and eight (17.8%) had a central venous catheter (CVC). The majority of patients (n = 37, 82%) developed VTE within 30 days of hospitalization. Thrombosis mostly involved the extremities (n = 23, 51%) and sagittal vein (n = 12, 26.7%). All patients were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), complicated by bleeding in three (6.6%) patients. CONCLUSION: In contrast to adults, VTE in pediatric cancer patients is more associated with chemotherapy and recent hospitalization. LMWH is a safe and effective therapy for children with cancer who develop VTE.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Hashem et al.']","['Hashem, Hasan', 'Zeineddin, Momen', 'Bater, Rayan', 'Amayiri, Nisreen', 'Al Qasem, Wiam', 'Hammo, Bilasan', 'Sultan, Iyad', 'AlMasri, Rama', 'Abdel-Razeq, Hikmat']","['Hashem H', 'Zeineddin M', 'Bater R', 'Amayiri N', 'Al Qasem W', 'Hammo B', 'Sultan I', 'AlMasri R', 'Abdel-Razeq H']","['Department of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, JOR.', 'Department of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, JOR.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, JOR.', 'Department of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, JOR.', 'Department of Pharmacy, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, JOR.', 'Department of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, JOR.', 'Department of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, JOR.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Istishari Hospital, Amman, JOR.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, JOR.', 'Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Jordan, Amman, JOR.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211201,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['anticoagulation', 'cancer', 'pediatrics thrombosis', 'thromboprophylaxis', 'venous thromboembolism']",2022/01/07 06:00,2022/01/07 06:01,['2022/01/06 05:58'],"['2021/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/06 05:58 [entrez]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.20084 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Dec 1;13(12):e20084. doi: 10.7759/cureus.20084. eCollection 2021 Dec.,13,12,e20084,,,,PMC8719720,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ph-positive leukemia most often presents with hypercellularity and hypoplasia is a rare condition. The present study reports an extremely rare case of hypocellular biclonal Ph-positive MPAL, which was diagnosed by biopsy and genetic analysis of bone marrow, and successfully treated with dasatinib and steroids. Briefly, a 77-year-old man presented with pancytopenia and flow cytometry of bone marrow could not be evaluated due to hypocellularity. The patient was finally diagnosed with hypocellular Ph-positive MPAL by genetic analysis and immunostaining of bone marrow biopsy. Although blood cells recovered with methylprednisolone pulse administration alone for concurrent optic neuritis, hematopoietic function rapidly normalized with dasatinib administered after definitive diagnosis of Ph-positive leukemia. Dasatinib and oral prednisolone were continued following methylprednisolone pulse administration and the patient achieved molecular complete remission (CR) on day 140 of treatment; molecular CR was maintained thereafter without any severe adverse events. In conclusion, the combination of dasatinib and a steroid may be one of the tolerable treatment options for elderly patients with hypocellular biclonal Ph-positive MPAL. Furthermore, genetic analysis and immunostaining of bone marrow biopsy can help with the diagnosis of leukemia with hypocellular bone marrow.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Spandidos Publications.']","['Lee, Shin', 'Fujita, Kei', 'Wakayama, Hiroto', 'Kito, Yusuke', 'Hara, Takeshi', 'Tsurumi, Hisashi']","['Lee S', 'Fujita K', 'Wakayama H', 'Kito Y', 'Hara T', 'Tsurumi H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Matsunami General Hospital, Gifu 501-6062, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Matsunami General Hospital, Gifu 501-6062, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Matsunami General Hospital, Gifu 501-6062, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Matsunami General Hospital, Gifu 501-6062, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Matsunami General Hospital, Gifu 501-6062, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Matsunami General Hospital, Gifu 501-6062, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20211214,England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome', 'biclonal', 'dasatinib', 'hypocellular', 'mixed phenotype']",2022/01/07 06:00,2022/01/07 06:01,['2022/01/06 05:56'],"['2021/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/06 05:56 [entrez]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/mco.2021.2466 [doi]', 'MCO-16-2-02466 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2022 Feb;16(2):33. doi: 10.3892/mco.2021.2466.

The patient experienced elevated liver enzymes with ascites at 21 days from the last INO dose. Although she met the criteria for VOD/SOS, the diagnosis was challenging because of her ongoing hepatic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and normal portal vein flow on Doppler sonogram. The radiologist suggested liver cirrhosis based on computed tomography, with VOD/SOS, liver cirrhosis, and GVHD assumed to be differential diagnoses. She received supportive care with GVHD management; however, due to progressive hepatic failure, we conducted emergent deceased-donor liver transplantation, and the pathologic findings indicated VOD/SOS. Her leukemia was stable, but she died of sepsis after 3 months. INO use is a high-risk factor for VOD/SOS, but an accurate diagnosis can be challenging due to various hepatic complications. Early diagnosis and proper management for VOD/SOS is important for improved outcomes.","['(c) The Author(s), 2021.']","['Lee, Joonyeop', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Kwag, Daehun', 'Lee, Jong-Hyuk', 'Kim, Tong

Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is used for prophylactic T-cell depletion and GVHD prevention, but there are no clear guidelines for the optimal dosing of ATG. It is suspected that for patients with low absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs), current weight-based dosing of ATG can be excessive, which can result in profound T-cell depletion and poor transplant outcome. Methods: The objective of the study is to evaluate the association of low preconditioning ALC with outcomes in patients undergoing matched unrelated donor (MUD) alloSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and ATG. We conducted a single-center retrospective longitudinal cohort study of acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patients over 18 years old undergoing alloSCT. In total, 64 patients were included and dichotomized into lower ALC and higher ALC groups with the cutoff of 500/mul on D-7. Results: Patients with preconditioning ALC <500/mul were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and higher infectious mortality. The incidence of acute GVHD and moderate-severe chronic GVHD as well as relapse rates did not differ according to preconditioning ALC. In multivariate analyses, low preconditioning ALC was recognized as an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS. Conclusion: Patients with lower ALC are exposed to excessive dose of ATG, leading to profound T-cell depletion that results in higher infectious mortality and shorter OS. Our results call for the implementation of more creative dosing regimens for patients with low preconditioning ALC.","['(c) The Author(s), 2021.']","['Seo, Jeongmin', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Kim, Inho', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Min Byun, Ja', 'Hong, Junshik']","['Seo J', 'Shin DY', 'Koh Y', 'Kim I', 'Yoon SS', 'Min Byun J', 'Hong J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital 101, Daehak-ro, Jongro-gu, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital 101, Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211219,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,['NOTNLM'],"['absolute lymphocyte count', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'anti-thymocyte globulin', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'matched unrelated donors']",2022/01/07 06:00,2022/01/07 06:01,['2022/01/06 05:55'],"['2021/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/06 05:55 [entrez]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/20406207211063783 [doi]', '10.1177_20406207211063783 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2021 Dec 19;12:20406207211063783. doi: 10.1177/20406207211063783. eCollection 2021.,12,,20406207211063783,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9992-6273', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1780-5553']",,PMC8721408,,"['Conflict of interest statement: The authors declared no potential conflicts of', 'interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this', 'article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the number of patients undergoing allo-HCT increases, it will become imperative to determine safe and effective treatment options for patients with GVHD, especially those who become refractory to systemic steroid therapy. Daratumumab (Dara), a humanized IgG1 (k subclass) monoclonal antibody targeting the CD38 epitope, is used for the treatment of multiple myeloma. CD38 is a multifunctional ectoenzyme that behaves either as an enzyme, a cell adhesion molecule or a cell surface receptor involved in cell signaling. CD38 is also expressed on various immune effector and suppressor cells. However, the role of CD38 in the immune response remains elusive. We questioned whether CD38 is a potential therapeutic target against alloreactive T cells in the GVHD pathological process. Here, we investigated the impact of Dara on xenogeneic GVHD (xeno-GVHD) and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects in a humanized murine model of transplantation, where human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were adoptively transplanted into immunocompromised NOD.SCID.gc-null (NSG) mice. Mice receiving Dara treatment experienced less weight loss, longer survival and lower GVHD scores compared with those in the control group. Histological evaluations, flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing and RT-qPCR analysis revealed that Dara efficaciously mitigated GVHD through multiple mechanisms including inhibition of the proliferation, activation and differentiation of CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells, reduced expression of cytotoxic effector molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and chemoattractant receptors by T cells and promotion of immunosuppressive T cells. More importantly, Dara preserved the GVL effect in a humanized mouse model of leukemia by metabolic reprograming of T cells to promote the induction of Th17, Th1/17and Tc1/17 cells. Our findings indicate that Dara may be an attractive therapeutic option to separate GVHD from GVL effects in patients with hematopoietic malignancies receiving allo-HCT.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Gao, Shan, Gu, Zhang, Wu, Li, Zeng, Zhou, Chen and Xiao.']","['Gao, Yang', 'Shan, Wei', 'Gu, Tianning', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Wu, Yibo', 'Li, Xiaoqing', 'Zeng, Xiangjun', 'Zhou, Hongyu', 'Chen, Zhi', 'Xiao, Haowen']","['Gao Y', 'Shan W', 'Gu T', 'Zhang J', 'Wu Y', 'Li X', 'Zeng X', 'Zhou H', 'Chen Z', 'Xiao H']","['Department of Hematology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Liangzhu Laboratory, Zhejiang University Medical Center, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Liangzhu Laboratory, Zhejiang University Medical Center, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Liangzhu Laboratory, Zhejiang University Medical Center, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Liangzhu Laboratory, Zhejiang University Medical Center, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Liangzhu Laboratory, Zhejiang University Medical Center, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211220,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CD38', 'chemoattractant receptor', 'chemokine', 'daratumumab', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'graft-versus-leukemia']",2022/01/07 06:00,2022/01/07 06:00,['2022/01/06 05:53'],"['2021/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/06 05:53 [entrez]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.785774 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Dec 20;12:785774. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.785774. eCollection 2021.,12,,785774,,,,PMC8720868,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These approaches, however, do not describe dynamic scenarios in which cells continuously change their biochemical properties and downstream 'behavioural' outputs(3-5). Here we used 4D live imaging to record tens to hundreds of morpho-kinetic parameters describing the dynamics of individual leukocytes at sites of active inflammation. By analysing more than 100,000 reconstructions of cell shapes and tracks over time, we obtained behavioural descriptors of individual cells and used these high-dimensional datasets to build behavioural landscapes. These landscapes recognized leukocyte identities in the inflamed skin and trachea, and uncovered a continuum of neutrophil states inside blood vessels, including a large, sessile state that was embraced by the underlying endothelium and associated with pathogenic inflammation. Behavioural screening in 24 mouse mutants identified the kinase Fgr as a driver of this pathogenic state, and interference with Fgr protected mice from inflammatory injury. Thus, behavioural landscapes report distinct properties of dynamic environments at high cellular resolution.","['(c) 2022.

Although complete or partial remission of the disease can be achieved, the risk of relapse or refractory leukemia is still high. More effective and safe therapy options are yet unmet needs. In recent years' new therapeutic approaches have been widely used. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) presents significant limitations and the outcome of the consolidation treatment is patient dependent. Side effects such as Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are extremely common, therefore, using alternative methods to address these challenges for treatment seems crucial. In the last decade, T cells genetically engineered with Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) treatment for the ALL are largely studied and represent the new era of strategy. According to the Phase I/II clinical trials, this technology results seem very promising and can be used in the next future as an effective and safe treatment for ALL treatment. In this review different generations, challenges, and clinical studies related to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells for ALL treatment are discussed.",['(c) 2021.

We studied clinico-hematological profile and survival outcome of adult acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients harboring these mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: De novo APL cases (> 12 years), enrolled between January 2019 and June 2020, were evaluated for FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations (A, B, D mutations) by conventional and real-time qualitative PCR respectively. RESULTS: FLT3-ITD mutation was detected in 12 of 36 (33.3%) de novo APLs cases while NPM1 mutation was not detected. FLT3-ITD was more frequently associated with Sanz high-risk category as compared to the intermediate-risk category (75% vs. 29%, P = .02), with BCR3 transcript type (P = .08) and higher median WBC count [22.7 x 10(9)/L)(range 1.3-184), P = .018]. One and half-years overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were not significantly altered by the presence/absence of FLT3-ITD mutation (OS 86% vs. 70%, P = .32; EFS 86% vs. 70%, P = .33), between genders (OS, EFS both 89% in males vs. 69% in females, P = .15) and between adolescent and younger adults (AYA) (</= 30 years) and older adult APL cases (> 30 years) (OS 86% vs. 78%, P = .55; EFS 85% vs. 77%, P = .55), however were significantly lower with BCR3 transcript as compared to BCR1 transcript (OS 56% vs. 91%, P = .019; EFS 56% vs. 91%, P = .016) in univariate analysis, although not in multivariate analysis. One and half-year OS and EFS was 57% (6/14, P = .009 for each) in high-risk APL.

We aimed to investigate the role of CRLF2 overexpression and JAK2 mutation in the diagnosis and prognosis of newly diagnosed pediatric B-ALL patients. METHODS: CRLF2 expression was assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 115 pediatric patients newly diagnosed with precursor B-ALL patients compared with 24 age- and sex-matched controls. JAK2 R683G mutation status was performed by the qBiomarker Somatic Mutation PCR Assay. RESULTS: CRLF2 overexpression was identified in 21 patients (18.3%), while the JAK2 R683G mutant type was found in only in 7 patients (6.1%). There was a significant CRLF2 overexpression in patients with high initial TLC, high blast count in blood, and organomegaly (P .04, 0.005 & 0.05 respectively). No patients with CRLF2 overexpression expressed any recurrent cytogenetic translocations. 4 patients with CRLF2 overexpression showed JAK2 R683G mutation. CRLF2 levels and JAK2 R683G mutation status did not have a significant impact on either overall survival or disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: CRLF2 expression was significantly higher in Egyptian precursor B-ALL pediatric patients. CRLF2 overexpression was associated with a number of unfavorable prognostic factors with high tumor load, but was not an adverse independent parameter in pediatric BCP-ALL patients.

However, patients with CML still relapse without taking TKIs and cases in the accelerated phase or aggressive blast crisis rarely achieved deep response to TKIs. Drug resistance and persistence of leukemia stem cell (LSC) remain great challenges. BCR-ABL kinase dependent or independent mechanism of action are still far from being understood. To achieve a stable deep molecular response and treatment-free remission, finding new targets, eliminating LSC, reducing recurrence and improving prognosis are problems urgently to be solved. It is revealed that tumor microenvironment is crucial for survival, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. As an adhesion molecule, CD44, a single-chain transmembrane glycoprotein, is not only being identified as a marker for cancer stem cells, but also plays a crucial role in microenvironmental communication and transmitting intracellular signaling for cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and contributes to tumorigenesis.

Methods: The clinical data of 3 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) complicated with mucormycosis treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between October 2020 and January 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. Literature search and review covered the China national knowledge infrastructure, Wanfang database and Pubmed using the keywords of ""acute lymphoblastic leukemia"" and ""mucormycosis"" up to June 2021. Results: Case 1, a 12-year-old boy, was diagnosed with ALL, developed fever and chest pain during induction therapy. The Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) testing of alveolar perfusion fluid suggested infection with Rhizopus oryzae. Amphotericin B combined with posaconazole was applied and amphotericin B was removed after improvement. Bone destruction was indicated by CT. Amphotericin B was applied again. Case 2, a 4-year-old boy, with a history of pallor and tetter, was diagnosed with ALL. He developed cough and fever during induction therapy. mNGS of blood suggested infection with Rhizomucor pusillus. Amphotericin B combined with voriconazole was applied, but the situation was not significantly improved. The disseminated infection occurred. Amphotericin B combined with posaconazole was applied and vacuum sealing drainage was performed. Case 3, a 2-year-old girl, was diagnosed with ALL, developed fever and cough during induction therapy. Rhizomucor pusillus was indicated by mNGS. Amphotericin B combined with posaconazole was used, and posaconazole was stopped after improvement. Follow-up until June 2021, the condition of the 3 children improved. There was no recurrent Mucor infection, and the primary hematopathy was in complete remission. According to the literature, 7 reports were found in Chinese journals, while 17 reports were found in English literature, 25 cases have been reported. Among a total of 28 children, 11 cases rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis, four pulmonary mucormycosis, 2 cutaneous mucormycosis, 2 gastrointestinal mucormycosis and 9 disseminated mucormycosis. There were 17 cases developed infection during induction chemotherapy, 8 cases during maintenance therapy, 3 cases after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Voriconazole was used in 15 cases; 19 cases were treated with combined surgery, 7 cases were treated with drugs only, 2 cases were untreated; 21 cases showed improvement after treatment. Death occurred in seven cases. Conclusions: ALL complicated with mucormycosis often occurs in the stage of induction therapy. The clinical features lacked specificity, mNGS can help find the pathogen and provide evidence for diagnosis.

The present study investigated the mechanisms behind long-term cognitive dysfunction after juvenile animals are treated with MTX. Male and female Long-Evans rats were treated with a combination of 6 systemic doses (0.5 mg/kg/dose intraperitoneally) and 4 intrathecal doses (1 mg/kg) beginning at post-natal age 3 weeks, a schedule designed to mimic repeated exposure given to children with leukemia. Behavioral testing was conducted at 60-61 weeks of age, followed by analysis of brain histolopathology. This MTX regimen had no acute toxicity and no effect on growth. The spatial memory and visual memory deficits observed at 13 and 17 weeks of age persisted 1 year after MTX exposure in both females and males. Significantly decreased cell proliferation and increased hippocampal microglial activation were observed in MTX-treated females when compared to the controls, with a similar trend in the male groups. In addition, MTX treatment significantly increased the number of TUNEL positive cells in the periventricular area. Our study demonstrates that a clinically relevant regimen of systemic and intrathecal MTX induces persistent deficits in cognition, lasting approximately 1 year after the last injection. The mechanisms behind MTX-induced deficits are likely multifactorial, including suppression of neurogenesis, microglial activation, and increased brain cell apoptosis.

Small-compound AMPK activators show anti-cancer activity in preclinical models. Using the direct AMPK activator GSK621, we show that the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated by AMPK in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Mechanistically, the UPR effector protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) represses oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and pyrimidine biosynthesis and primes the mitochondrial membrane to apoptotic signals in an AMPK-dependent manner. Accordingly, in vitro and in vivo studies reveal synergy between the direct AMPK activator GSK621 and the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Thus, selective AMPK-activating compounds kill AML cells by rewiring mitochondrial metabolism that primes mitochondria to apoptosis by BH3 mimetics, holding therapeutic promise in AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: In this prospective, investigator-led, open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of horse ATG plus cyclosporine with or without eltrombopag as front-line therapy in previously untreated patients with severe aplastic anemia. The primary end point was a hematologic complete response at 3 months. RESULTS: Patients were assigned to receive immunosuppressive therapy (Group A, 101 patients) or immunosuppressive therapy plus eltrombopag (Group B, 96 patients). The percentage of patients who had a complete response at 3 months was 10% in Group A and 22% in Group B (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 7.8; P = 0.01). At 6 months, the overall response rate (the percentage of patients who had a complete or partial response) was 41% in Group A and 68% in Group B. The median times to the first response were 8.8 months (Group A) and 3.0 months (Group B). The incidence of severe adverse events was similar in the two groups. With a median follow-up of 24 months, a karyotypic abnormality that was classified as myelodysplastic syndrome developed in 1 patient (Group A) and 2 patients (Group B); event-free survival was 34% and 46%, respectively. Somatic mutations were detected in 29% (Group A) and 31% (Group Beta) of the patients at baseline; these percentages increased to 66% and 55%, respectively, at 6 months, without affecting the hematologic response and 2-year outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of eltrombopag to standard immunosuppressive therapy improved the rate, rapidity, and strength of hematologic response among previously untreated patients with severe aplastic anemia, without additional toxic effects.

The aim was to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) for the treatment of CT-induced OM children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in 40 pediatric patients 3 to 18 years of age, who were hospitalized for the diagnosis of leukemia and underwent CT between June 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019. They were randomly divided into 2 groups with 20 cases in each group. The LLLT group was treated with GaAlAs diode laser (l): 830 nm (infrared), power: 150 mW, dose: 4.5 J/cm2 and the control group underwent bicarbonate treatment. Patients received intervention for 3 days. The grade of OM was clinically assessed by the World Health Organization (WHO) Common Toxicity Criteria Scale. Visual Analog Scale was used on the same days with OM grade to evaluate the pain status. RESULTS: While there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of OM grade at the beginning of the treatment and on the first, second, fourth, and 11th days of the treatment, the average OM grade of the LLLT group was found to be statistically significantly lower on the third, fifth, sixth, and seventh days of the treatment. The Visual Analog Scale score of the LLLT group was statistically significantly lower compared with the control group at all examinations starting from the first day of treatment (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: In the treatment of oral OM that occurs in children after CT, both standard care and LLLT treatment improve the grade and pain of OM.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A total of 142 healthy blood donors and 111 leukemia patients were collected. The genomic sequence of HLA-E was amplified by high-fidelity reaction system and identified by Sanger and cloning sequencing. The dual luciferase reporter gene assay was used to detect the transcription activity of promoter variation at nucleotide position-26. In the HLA-E genomic sequence results, a total of 16 alleles and 32 genotypes were detected; the HLA-E*01:01:01:06 allele had a significantly lower frequency in leukemia patients than in healthy participants (p = 0.026 < 0.05).

Transfusing MDS patients with prophylactically RH-KEL1 antigen-matched (PAM) RBC units is recommended to avoid RBC allo-immunization. D+C-E-c+e+, D+C-E+c+e- and D+C+E-c-e+ phenotypes are infrequent among French blood donors. To preserve infrequent phenotype RBC units for patients other than MDS, and to manage frequent phenotype RBC unit stocks, we let, for 1 year, higher-risk non-immunized chronically transfused MDS and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients receive RBC transfusions matched only for D. Our objectives were to evaluate the impact of non-PAM transfusions on the transfusion policy (which would be modified in case of RBC allo-immunization) for frequent and infrequent phenotypes patients and to estimate the number of infrequent phenotypes RBC units that could be redistributed to other patients. RESULTS: Ninety patients were enrolled. Thirty-five patients had infrequent phenotypes, nine received only PAM RBC (143 units) and 26 PAM and non-PAM RBC (415 and 532, respectively): none developed allo-immunization. Fifty-five patients had frequent RBC phenotypes, 34 received only PAM RBC (561 units) and three developed antibodies (2 non-RH-KEL1 and one anti-E); 21 received PAM and non-PAM RBC (436 and 109, respectively) and one developed allo-immunization (unknown specificity). Our strategy enabled us to preserve 532 infrequent phenotypes RBC units: 216 D+C-E-c+e+, 33 D+C-E+c+e- and 283 D+C+E-c-e+ units, representing 48.8% of the total number of RBC units received by infrequent phenotypes patients during the study period.

DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on the presence of sustained (>3 months) peripheral blood monocytosis (>/=1 x 10(9) /L; monocytes >/=10%), usually with accompanying bone marrow dysplasia. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occur in ~ 30% of patients, while >90% have somatic gene mutations. Mutations involving TET2 (~60%), SRSF2 (~50%), ASXL1 (~40%) and the oncogenic RAS pathway (~30%) are frequent, while the presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and the absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact over-all survival. RISK STRATIFICATION: Molecularly integrated prognostic models include the Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies (GFM), Mayo Molecular Model (MMM) and the CMML specific prognostic model (CPSS-Mol). Risk factors incorporated into the MMM include presence of truncating ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count>10 x 10(9) /L, hemoglobin <10 gm/dl, platelet count <100 x 10(9) /L and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells. The MMM stratifies CMML patients into 4 groups: high (>/=3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor) and low (no risk factors), with median survivals of 16, 31, 59 and 97 months, respectively. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine are commonly used, with overall response rates of ~40-50% and complete remission rates of ~7-17%; with no impact on mutational allele burdens. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only potentially curative option but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This article is protected by copyright.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of CD10/CD34 surface markers in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in 79 children with ALL. Possible correlation between leukemia prognosis and CD10 CD34 immunophenotype was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. A CD10- CD34- pre-B-ALL cell line was generated from a patient with resistant ALL. RN95 was characterized using light microscopy, immunophenotyping, karyotyping, and Western blotting. Drug sensitivity and resistant genes' expression profile were assessed using MTT and RT-PCR assays. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis showed negative correlation between CD10/CD34 double negativity and patients' 2- and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS). Multivariate analysis indicated that the absence of CD10 and CD34 expression in the ALL patients was an independent negative prognostic marker for 2- and 5-year DFS. A novel cell line model, RN95, was developed with similar immunophenotype from a primary relapsed sample. Cells showed p53 positive functionality and demonstrated partial sensitivity to Vincristine, but complete resistance to Cytarabine. Overexpression of ABCB1, ABCA2, and ABCA3 was detected. CONCLUSION: In the current study, simultaneous absence of CD10 and CD34 cell surface markers was introduced as an unfavorable prognostic factor in pediatric B-ALL. Moreover, a special cell line was established to help delineation of novel therapeutics for B-ALL drug resistance.","['(c) 2022.

For 24 years, the patient suffered from sclerodermiform chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin and lung with partial lung resection and immunosuppressive therapy. Recurrent ulcerations developed on the lower legs at the sites affected by cutaneous GVHD. The patient presented to our clinic with an ulcer progressive in size with resistance to previous therapy. Histologically, squamous cell carcinoma was found. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bone involvement and cutaneous in-transit metastasis, and computed tomography revealed a metastasis in the sacrum. Before therapy was initiated, the patient died suddenly as a result of his previous illnesses. The development of cutaneous GVHD is common in patients with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The risk for the development of squamous cell carcinoma is increased. Patients should be under close dermatologic surveillance.

It may precede, present concurrently or follow acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in de novo case or may also be present and might be the only manifestation of recurrent AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia. It frequently involves skin, orbit, bone, periosteum, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tract, soft tissue, central nervous system, and testis. Because of its different localization and symptoms, and the lack of diagnostic algorithm, MS is a real diagnostic challenge particularly in patients without initial bone marrow involvement. The correct diagnosis of MS is important for optimum therapy, which is often delayed because of a high misdiagnosis rate. We reported three cases of MS derived from spine presented with back pain, paraplegia, paraparesis, respectively, and reviewed the relevant literature.","['MedIntel Services Pvt Ltd.

Aims We aim to evaluate the responses and safety of upfront Nilotinib therapy in Indian CML patients. Setting and Design We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of CML patients who received Nilotinib as an upfront treatment at our center between January 1, 2011 and October 15, 2019.The follow-up was taken till March 31, 2020. Results Forty One patients ( n = 36 chronic phase and five accelerated-phase CML) received frontline Nilotinib. Median age was 39 years (21-63) with male-to-female ratio of 1.1: 1. At 3 months, 96.9% patients achieved BCR-ABL of </=10% at international scale. By the end of 12 months, 71.5% patients achieved major molecular response (BCR-ABL </=0.1%) and 91.4% patients achieved complete cytogenetic response assessed by BCR-ABL polymerase chain reaction of </=1%. Common toxicities observed were weight gain, thrombocytopenia, corrected QT prolongation, and elevated serum amylase in 14 (34.1%), 7(17.07%), 4(9.7%), and 4(9.7%) patients, respectively. Overall, five patients had loss of response with further progression and death in three patients. At a median of 43.7 months, 38 patients survived with estimated 3 year event-free survival and overall survival of 65 +/- 9 and 93 +/- 5%.

Aim To determine the prevalence of overt DIC in AL using the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) scoring system. Materials and Methods This prospective observational study was performed on 57 newly diagnosed or relapsed cases of AL. Detailed clinical history and coagulation profile of the patients were evaluated. Diagnosis of overt and nonovert DIC was established using the ISTH scoring system and results tabulated. Observations A total of 57 patients with AL participated in the study, including 31 (54.39%) patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 26 (45.61%) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In total, 18 of 57 patients (31.58%) with AL fulfilled the criteria of overt DIC according to the ISTH scoring system, including 10 (32.25%) patients with ALL and 8 (30.76%) patients with AML. The highest prevalence of DIC was seen in the M3 subtype among AML and the L1 subtype among ALL, respectively. The mean ISTH score in patients of overt DIC in ALL and AML patients was 5.1 and 5, respectively. Abnormalities in platelet count and D-dimer levels were the most useful parameters in diagnosing overt DIC and the difference between overt DIC and nonovert DIC groups was highly significant. Conclusions Overt DIC was observed in approximately one-third of patients with AL. Prevalence of overt DIC was found to be comparable in patients with ALL and AML. Mean platelet count and D-dimer levels were the most useful parameters in detecting overt DIC.","['MedIntel Services Pvt Ltd.

RHOH was initially identified as a translocation partner with BCL-6 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and aberrant somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the 5' untranslated region of the RHOH gene has also been detected in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Recent data suggest a correlation between RhoH expression and disease progression in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). However, the effects of RHOH mutations and translocations on RhoH expression and malignant transformation remain unknown. We found that aged Rhoh(-/-) (KO) mice had shortened lifespans and developed B cell derived splenomegaly with an increased Bcl-6 expression profile in splenocytes. We utilized a murine model of Bcl-6 driven DLBCL to further explore the role of RhoH in malignant behaviour by crossing Rhoh(KO) mice with Imicro-HABcl-6 transgenic (Bcl-6(Tg)) mice. The loss of Rhoh in Bcl-6(Tg) mice led to a more rapid disease progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that deletion of Rhoh in these murine lymphoma cells was associated with decreased levels of the RhoH binding partner KAISO, a dual-specific Zinc finger transcription factor, de-repression of KAISO target Bcl-6, and downregulation of the BCL-6 target Blimp-1. Re-expression of RhoH in Rhoh(KO)Bcl-6(Tg) lymphoma cell lines reversed these changes in expression profile and reduced proliferation of lymphoma cells in vitro. These findings suggest a previously unidentified regulatory role of RhoH in the proliferation of tumour cells via altered BCL-6 expression.

Using whole genome sequencing, we characterized constitutional and somatic SNVs/indels and structural variants in a monozygotic twin pair with concordant ETV6-RUNX1 positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). In addition, digital PCR (dPCR) was applied to evaluate the presence of and quantify selected somatic variants at birth, diagnosis and remission. A shared somatic complex rearrangement involving chromosomes 11, 12 and 21 with identical fusion sequences in leukemias of both twins offered direct proof of a common clonal origin. The ETV6-RUNX1 fusion detected at diagnosis was found to originate from this complex rearrangement. A shared somatic frameshift deletion in UBA2 was also identified in diagnostic samples. In addition, each leukemia independently acquired analogous deletions of three genes recurrently targeted in BCP-ALLs (ETV6, ATF7IP and RAG1/RAG2) providing evidence of a convergent clonal evolution, only explained by a strong concurrent selective pressure. Quantification of the UBA2 deletion by dPCR surprisingly indicated it persisted in remission. This, for the first time to our knowledge, provided evidence of a UBA2 variant preceding the well-established initiating event ETV6-RUNX1. Further, we suggest the UBA2 deletion exerted a leukemia predisposing effect and that its essential role in SUMOylation, regulating nearly all physiological and pathological cellular processes such as DNA-repair by non-homologous end joining, may hold a mechanistic explanation for the predisposition.",['Copyright (c) 2022 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Bang, Benedicte', 'Eisfeldt, Jesper', 'Barbany, Gisela', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Zachariadis, Vasilios', 'Taylan, Fulya', 'Nordgren, Ann Cecilia']","['Bang B', 'Eisfeldt J', 'Barbany G', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Heyman M', 'Zachariadis V', 'Taylan F', 'Nordgren AC']","['Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical genetics, Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical genetics, Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden.', 'Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden.', 'Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden.', 'Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220104,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2022/01/05 06:00,2022/01/05 06:00,['2022/01/04 17:20'],"['2021/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/04 17:20 [entrez]', '2022/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['483331 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005703 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Adv. 2022 Jan 4. pii: 483331. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021005703.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6907-4954', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3185-2962', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7637-1949', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2907-0235']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients with CML receiving TKI could be expected to have a survival and 'quality of life' of the age- and sex-matched healthy people. Several TKI pathways may be selected for the first line CML treatment, including first-generation original/generic imatinib or second-generation TKIs, such as bosutinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. Individual characteristics of the CML patients, TKI drug compliance, lifestyle preferences, comorbidities, distinct toxicity profile of the TKI drug, and physician-clinical center experience are among the critical factors to be taken into account while deciding on the proper first line TKI in the newly diagnosed CML patients. Identifying CML patients at a higher risk for the disease progression or TKI resistance is essential and could influence the choice of primary TKI.

Therapeutic drug monitoring is crucial for adjusting the dosage of methotrexate according to its plasma concentration and reducing adverse effects. Micro-sampling strategies, like dried plasma spot, is an attractive but underutilized method that has the desired features of easy collection, storage, and transport, and overcomes known hematocrit issues in dried blood spot analysis. This study describes a dried plasma spot-based liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for quantification of methotrexate. The assay showed good linearity over 30-2000 ng/mL (R(2) >/= 0.995) as well as excellent precision (0.6-9.3%) and accuracy (89.2-108.3%). Methotrexate was extracted from dried plasma spot and wet plasma samples with recoveries greater than 92.1%, and no significant matrix effect was observed. A comparison of dried plasma spot and wet plasma concentrations was assessed in 27 patients treated with methotrexate and Passing-Bablok regression coefficients showed that no significant difference between the two methods. Bland-Altman plots showed similar agreement between the methods, indicating that the proposed dried plasma spot sampling method is an effective way to monitor the concentration of methotrexate in human plasma.

The pathogenicity of the mutation was confirmed by in vitro assays on transfected cell lines and primary cells. The p.G572V mutation causes impaired stability of the TLR8 protein, cross-reactivity to TLR7 ligands and reduced ability of TLR8 to attenuate TLR7 signaling. This imbalance towards TLR7-dependent signaling leads to increased pro-inflammatory responses, such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNFalpha. This unique TLR8 mutation with partial TLR8 protein loss and hyperinflammatory phenotype mediated by TLR7 ligands represents a novel inborn error of immunity with childhood-onset and a good response to TLR7 inhibition.

FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations (FLT3-ITD) have consistently been shown to be adversely prognostic, particularly those with high allelic ratio (AR). Current AML treatment strategies, including high dose cytarabine, purine analogs, FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i), and with or without allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) have been shown to improve the outcomes in patients with FLT3 mutations. We analyzed a consecutive cohort of newly diagnosed patients with AML treated at a large academic medical center from January 2012 to January 2020. A total of 1576 patients with a new diagnosis of AML were reviewed. Among these, 1438 (91%) had molecular testing for FLT3 mutations and 21% (304/1438) had an FLT3 mutation, including 17% with an FLT3-ITD mutation. We show that FLT3-ITD high AR with NPM1 wild-type have significantly improved survival compared with other European LeukemiaNet (ELN) adverse risk disease. In multivariable cox proportional hazards model of patients receiving intensive or low-intensity induction regimens, FLT3 mutations did not have prognostic significance. The use of allogeneic SCT in CR1 for patients with FLT3 mutations appears to improve survival, particularly in those with ELN adverse risk disease.

In this first clinical, phase 1, dose-escalation and -expansion study (CC-90002-AML-001; NCT02641002), we evaluated CC-90002 in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). CC-90002 was administered in escalating doses of 0.1-4.0 mg/kg, using a modified 3 + 3 design. Primary endpoints included dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), non-tolerated dose (NTD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary endpoints included preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and presence/frequency of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Between March 2016 and July 2018, 28 patients were enrolled (24 with AML and 4 with MDS) at 6 sites across the USA. As of July 18, 2018, all patients had discontinued, mainly due to death or progressive disease. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea (46.4%), thrombocytopenia (39.3%), febrile neutropenia (35.7%), and aspartate aminotransferase increase (35.7%). Four patients experienced DLTs (1 patient had grade 4 disseminated intravascular coagulation and grade 5 cerebral hemorrhage, 1 had grade 3 purpura, 1 had grade 4 congestive cardiac failure and grade 5 acute respiratory failure, and another had grade 5 sepsis). The NTD and MTD were not reached. No objective responses occurred. CC-90002 serum exposure was dose-dependent. ADAs were present across all doses, and the proportion of ADA-positive patients in cycle 1 increased over time. Despite no unexpected safety findings, the CC-90002-AML-001 study was discontinued in dose escalation for lack of monotherapy activity and evidence of ADAs. However, as other anti-CD47 agents in clinical trials are showing promising early results for AML and MDS, understanding preclinical and clinical differences between individual agents in this class will be of high importance.","['(c) 2021.

Epigenetic changes and methylation of the suppressor of the cytokine signaling 1 promoter (SOCS1) CpG region silence SOCS1 expression in cancer. In the current study, we evaluated the impact of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and RG108 on SOCS1 promoter methylation and expression in U937 cells. Methods: In the current study, U937 leukemic cells were treated with EGCG and RG108 for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h and SOCS1 promoter methylation and its expression were measured by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. Results: The outcomes indicated that the SOCS1 promoter is methylated in U937 cells, and treatment of these cells with either EGCG or RG108 reduced its methylation. Moreover, we observed that SOCS1 expression was significantly upregulated in a time-dependent manner by both EGCG and RG108 in U937 cells compared with control cells. In the RG108-treated group at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, SOCS1 expression was upregulated by 1, 4.2, 16.6, and 32.6 -fold respectively, and in the EGCG-treated group, by 0.5, 3.2, 10.8, and 22.3 -fold, respectively. Conclusion: Treatment with either EGCG or RG108 reduced SOCS1 promoter methylation and increased SOCS1 expression in U937 cells in a time-dependent manner, which may play a role in leukemia therapy.",,"['Alizadeh, Mohsen', 'Nafari, Amirhossein', 'Safarzadeh, Ali', 'Veiskarami, Saeed', 'Almasian, Mohammad', 'Asghar Kiani, Ali']","['Alizadeh M', 'Nafari A', 'Safarzadeh A', 'Veiskarami S', 'Almasian M', 'Asghar Kiani A']","['Student Research Committee, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran.', 'Department of animal science, Lorestan Agricultural and Natural Resources Research and Education Center, Iran.', 'School of Medicine, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Rep Biochem Mol Biol,Reports of biochemistry & molecular biology,101637937,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA Methylation', 'EGCG', 'Leukemia', 'RG108', 'SOCS1']",2022/01/05 06:00,2022/01/05 06:01,['2022/01/04 06:07'],"['2021/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/04 06:07 [entrez]', '2022/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.52547/rbmb.10.3.455 [doi]', 'rbmb-10-455 [pii]']",ppublish,Rep Biochem Mol Biol. 2021 Oct;10(3):455-461. doi: 10.52547/rbmb.10.3.455.,10,3,455-461,,,,PMC8718778,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that fluctuating DNA methylation marks can be used as clocks in cells where ongoing methylation and demethylation cause repeated 'flip-flops' between methylated and unmethylated states. We identify endogenous fluctuating CpG (fCpG) sites using standard methylation arrays and develop a mathematical model to quantitatively measure human adult stem cell dynamics from these data. Small intestinal crypts were inferred to contain slightly more stem cells than the colon, with slower stem cell replacement in the small intestine. Germline APC mutation increased the number of replacements per crypt. In blood, we measured rapid expansion of acute leukemia and slower growth of chronic disease. Thus, the patterns of human somatic cell birth and death are measurable with fluctuating methylation clocks (FMCs).",['(c) 2022.

Skin toxicity associated with bendamustine is one of the characteristic adverse effects. We retrospectively examined the relationship between bendamustine-associated drug rashes and disease prognosis of iBCL and MCL at our institution. Between January 2011 and August 2019, 65 patients (39 men and 26 women, median age 68, range 41-84 years) were treated with bendamustine alone (n=11, 120 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2) or a combination of rituximab and bendamustine (n=54, 90 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2). Of these patients, 47 had follicular lymphoma (FL), 10 had MCL and 8 had other iBCLs. Drug rash occurred in 27 (41.5%). Eight cases (29.6%) were grade 1, 5 (18.5%) were grade 2 and 14 (51.9%) were grade 3. The onset was in the first course in 17 (63.0%), 2nd course in 5 (18.5%), 3rd course in 2 (7.4%), 4th course in 1 (3.7%) and 5th course in 2 (7.4%). No treatment was administered in 1 case (3.7%), topical steroid was applied in 10 (37.0%), antiallergic drug was administered in 2 (7.4%), topical steroid and antiallergic drug were administered in 5 (18.5%), and oral and topical steroid and antiallergic drug were administered in 9 (33.3%). The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with rash development were 80.0% and 85.5%, respectively, and those in patients without development were 36.4% and 54.0%, respectively (p=0.009 and 0.02, respectively).

Childhood survival rates have significantly improved within the last 40 years due to a rapid advancement in therapeutic interventions. However, in high-risk groups, survival rates remain poor. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data of cancer medications in children are limited and thus current dosing regimens are based on studies with small sample sizes. In adults, large variability in PK is observed and dose individualisation (plasma concentration guided dosing) has been associated with improved clinical outcomes; whether this is true for children is still unknown. This provides an opportunity to explore this strategy in children to potentially reduce toxicities and ensure optimal dosing. This paper will provide a protocol to systematically review studies that have used dose individualisation of drugs used in the treatment of childhood leukaemias. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Systematic review methodology will be applied to identify, select and extract data from published plasma guided dosing studies conducted in a paediatric leukaemia cohort. Databases (eg, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Cochrane) and clinical trial registries (CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN) will be used to perform the systematic literature search (up until February 2021). Only full empirical studies will be included, with primary clinical outcomes (progression-free survival, toxicities, minimal residual disease status, complete cytogenetic response, partial cytogenetic response and major molecular response) being used to decide whether the study will be included. The quality of included studies will be undertaken, with a subgroup analysis where appropriate. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This systematic review will not require ethics approval as there will not be collection of primary data. Findings of this review will be made available through publications in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. Gaps will be identified in current literature to inform future-related research. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021225045.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Repression by GFI1 is attributable to recruitment of LSD1-containing protein complexes via its SNAG domain. However, the full complement of GFI1 partners in transcriptional control is not known. We show that in T-ALL cells, GFI1 and IKAROS are transcriptional partners that co-occupy regulatory regions of hallmark T cell development genes. Transcriptional profiling reveals a subset of genes directly transactivated through the GFI1-IKAROS partnership. Among these is NOTCH3, a key factor in T-ALL pathogenesis. Surprisingly, NOTCH3 expression by GFI1 and IKAROS requires the GFI1 SNAG domain but occurs independent of SNAG-LSD1 binding. GFI1 variants deficient in LSD1 binding fail to activate NOTCH3, but conversely, small molecules that disrupt the SNAG-LSD1 interaction while leaving the SNAG primary structure intact stimulate NOTCH3 expression. These results identify a non-canonical transcriptional control mechanism in T-ALL which supports GFI1-mediated transactivation in partnership with IKAROS and suggest competition between LSD1-containing repressive complexes and others favoring transactivation. Implications: Combinatorial diversity and cooperation between DNA binding proteins and complexes assembled by them can direct context-dependent transcriptional outputs to control cell fate and may offer new insights for therapeutic targeting in cancer.","['Copyright (c)2022, American Association for Cancer Research.']","['Sun, Wenxiang', 'Guo, Jingtao', 'McClellan, David', 'Poeschla, Alexandra', 'Bareyan, Diana', 'Casey, Mattie J', 'Cairns, Bradley R', 'Tantin, Dean', 'Engel, Michael E']","['Sun W', 'Guo J', 'McClellan D', 'Poeschla A', 'Bareyan D', 'Casey MJ', 'Cairns BR', 'Tantin D', 'Engel ME']","['Pathology, University of Utah.', 'University of Utah.', 'Oncological Sciences, University of Utah.', 'Pathology, University of Utah.', 'Oncological Sciences, University of Utah.', 'Oncological Sciences, University of Utah.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute.', 'Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine.', 'Pediatrics, University of Virginia mee2mj@virginia.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20220103,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,,,2022/01/05 06:00,2022/01/05 06:00,['2022/01/04 06:00'],"['2021/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2022/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-21-0352 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-21-0352 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Mol Cancer Res. 2022 Jan 3. pii: 1541-7786.MCR-21-0352. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-21-0352.,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4470-2437', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9864-8811', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2878-9707']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inactivation of any MMR gene(s), including hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, and hPMS2, can result in MSI. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a sensitive and specific screening tool for MSI that can detect loss of expression of one or more MMR components. Of the four MMR markers, hMLH1 and hMSH2 are considered most informative of MSI status. There has been renewed interest in MSI status in view of its favorable association with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in some cancers. MMR expression patterns in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been evaluated systematically. METHODS: We used clinically-validated IHC assays to assess the expression of hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, and/or hPMS2 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of bone marrow core biopsies from patients diagnosed with AML. Mutation profiling was performed using next-generation sequencing to assess for mutations in MMR genes. RESULTS: The study group included 236 patients with AML, including a cohort treated on a clinical trial of azacitidine and nivolumab (NCT02397720). In addition, hMSH6, and/or hPMS2 expression was assessed in 99 AML patients with diploid karyotype. All patients, except two, had retained expression of all MMR markers assessed: One patient from the azacytidine+nivolumab group had zonal patchy loss of staining of hMLH1 and, to a lesser extent, a similar staining pattern of hMSH2; and one patient from the AML with diploid karyotype group had loss of hMSH2 but retained expression of hMLH1, hMSH6 and hPMS2. In addition, a retrospective analysis on a separate cohort of 139 patients with primary AML, on which next generation sequencing profiling was performed, identified 14 cases with alterations in MMR genes. CONCLUSION AND REMARKS: MMR loss is a rare event in AML, thus does not appear to underlie response patterns to anti-PD1 therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Higher risks of hematological malignancies (HM) were observed in SLE patients, which was associated with higher mortality. The mechanism and risk factors of HM oncogenesis in SLE patients are still under investigation. The aim of this study was to explore clinical characteristics, risk factors, and prognosis of SLE patients with or without HM in the Chinese population. METHODS: A retrospective, case-controlled study was conducted in 72 SLE patients between January 2013 and December 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and compared between the two groups of patients with HM and those without HM. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine risk factors of HM oncogenesis. The survival rate was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. RESULTS: Among 72 SLE patients in this study, fifteen complicated with HM and 57 without HM were identified. The incidence rate of HM was approximately 0.24% with elevated standardized incidence ratios of lymphoma and leukemia (27.559 and 12.708, respectively). Patients with HM were older when diagnosed with SLE, with a higher frequency of infection and splenomegaly, lower levels of hemoglobin and high-density lipoprotein compared with those without HM. Fewer patients with HM expressed positive anti-dsDNA antibody (26.7% vs 66.7%, P = 0.005) or received hydroxychloroquine treatment (40.0% vs 86.0%, P = 0.001). Older age at SLE diagnosis (OR=1.122, 95% CI: 1.037-1.214) was regarded as an independent risk factor of HM oncogenesis. Female (RR= 0.219, 95% CI: 0.070-0.681) and hydroxychloroquine (RR= 0.281, 95% CI: 0.094-0.845) were protective factors of mortality in SLE patients. CONCLUSIONS: SLE patients with an older age are at an increased risk of HM carcinogenesis. The prognosis of male patients with SLE tends to be poorer whether complicated with HM. The association of antinuclear antibody spectrum, medication, and HM oncogenesis in SLE needs further investigation.",['(c) 2021.

Bcr-Abl oncogene that results from a reciprocal translocation between human chromosome 9 and 22, is associated with several hematological malignancies. However, the role of lncRNAs in Bcr-Abl-induced leukemia remains largely unexplored. METHODS: LncRNA cDNA microarray was employed to identify key lncRNAs involved in Bcr-Abl-mediated cellular transformation. Abl-transformed cell survival and xenografted tumor growth in mice were evaluated to dissect the role of imatinib-upregulated lncRNA 1 (IUR1) in Abl-induced tumorigenesis. Primary bone marrow transformation and in vivo leukemia transplant using lncRNA-IUR1 knockout (KO) mice were further conducted to address the functional relevance of lncRNA-IUR1 in Abl-mediated leukemia. Transcriptome RNA-seq and Western blotting were performed to determine the mechanisms by which lncRNA-IUR1 regulates Bcr-Abl-induced tumorigenesis. RESULTS: We identified lncRNA-IUR1 as a critical negative regulator of Bcr-Abl-induced tumorigenesis. LncRNA-IUR1 expressed in a very low level in Bcr-Abl-positive cells from chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Interestingly, it was significantly induced in Abl-positive leukemic cells treated by imatinib. Depletion of lncRNA-IUR1 promoted survival of Abl-transformed human leukemic cells in experiments in vitro and xenografted tumor growth in mice, whereas ectopic expression of lncRNA-IUR1 sensitized the cells to apoptosis and suppressed tumor growth. In concert, silencing murine lncRNA-IUR1 in Abl-transformed cells accelerated cell survival and the development of leukemia in mice. Furthermore, lncRNA-IUR1 deficient mice were generated, and we observed that knockout of murine lncRNA-IUR1 facilitated Bcr-Abl-mediated primary bone marrow transformation. Moreover, animal leukemia model revealed that lncRNA-IUR1 deficiency promoted Abl-transformed cell survival and development of leukemia in mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that lncRNA-IUR1 suppressed Bcr-Abl-induced tumorigenesis through negatively regulating STAT5-mediated GATA3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings unveil an inhibitory role of lncRNA-IUR1 in Abl-mediated cellular transformation, and provide new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying Abl-induced leukemogenesis.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: Samples were collected for analysis from AML patients at diagnosis. We evaluated the level of CD33 expression by flow cytometry analysis of bone marrow. Chi-square or t- tests were used to assess the association between the high and low CD33 expression groups. Survival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression model method. RESULTS: In this study we evaluated the level of CD33 expression in de novo patients diagnosed from November 2013 until January 2019. The mean value of 73.4% was used as the cutoff for the two groups. Statistical analysis revealed that 53 of the 86 (61.2%) AML patients were above the mean. Although there was no statistical significance between CD33 expression level and gene mutation, FLT3 mutation (P = 0.002) and NPM1 mutation (P = 0.001) were more likely to be seen in the high CD33 group. The overall survival (OS) was worse in the high CD33 group (39.0 m vs. 16.7 m, x(2) = 13.06, P < 0.001). The Cox survival regression display that the CD33 is independent prognostic marker (HR =0.233,p = 0.008). Univariate analysis showed that the high expression of CD33 was an unfavorable prognostic factor. Of the 86 patients, CD33-high was closely related to the patients with normal karyotype (x(2) = 4.891,P = 0.027), high white blood cell count (WBC, t = 2.804, P = 0.007), and a high ratio of primitive cells (t = 2.851, P = 0.005).

To determine the potential roles of lncRNAs involved in pathogenesis of B-ALL, we analyzed the expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs in B-ALL, respectively, and constructed lncRNAs/mRNAs interaction network. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing of 10 non-leukemic blood disease donors and 10 B-ALL patients for Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Interactions among mRNAs were predicted using the STRING database. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to verify the RNA-seq data of lncRNAs and mRNAs. Potential functions of subtype-specific lncRNAs were determined by using coexpression-based analysis on distally (trans-pattern) located protein-coding genes. RESULTS: A total of 1813 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) and 2203 lncRNAs were identified. Moreover, 10 dysregulated lncRNAs and 10 mRNAs were randomly selected, and further assessed by RT-qPCR in vitro. Go and KEGG analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed mRNAs were most closely associated with myeloid leukocyte activation and in transcriptional misregulation in cancer, respectively. In addition, co-expression analysis demonstrated that these lncRNAs, including MSTRG.27994.3, MSTRG.21740.1, ENST00000456341, MSTRG.14224.1 and MSTRG.20153.1, may mediate the pathogenesis and development of B-ALL via lncRNA-mRNA network interactions. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that several mRNAs and lncRNAs are aberrantly expressed in the bone marrow of B-ALL patients and play potential roles in B-ALL development, and be useful for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes in pediatric B-ALL.

The MLL gene can be rearranged to generate partial tandem duplications (MLL-PTD), which occurs in about 5-10% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a normal karyotype and in 5-6% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is currently one of the curative therapies available for AML and MDS with excess blasts (MDS-EB). However, how the prognosis of patients with high levels of MLL-PTD after allo-HSCT, and whether MLL-PTD could be used as a reliable indicator for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in transplant patients remains unknown. Our study purposed to analyze the dynamic changes of MLL-PTD peri-transplantation and the best threshold for predicting relapse after transplantation. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the clinical data of 48 patients with MLL-PTD AML or MDS-EB who underwent allo-HSCT in Peking University People's Hospital. The MLL-PTD was examined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) at the diagnosis, before transplantation and the fixed time points after transplantation. Detectable MLL-PTD/ABL > 0.08% was defined as MLL-PTD positive in this study. RESULTS: The 48 patients included 33 AML patients and 15 MDS-EB patients. The median follow-up time was 26(0.7-56) months after HSCT. In AML patients, 7 patients (21.2%) died of treatment-related mortality (TRM), 6 patients (18.2%) underwent hematological relapse and died ultimately. Of the 15 patients with MDS-EB, 2 patients (13.3%) died of infection. The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and TRM were 13.7 +/- 5.2, 67.8 +/- 6.9, 68.1 +/- 6.8 and 20.3% +/- 6.1%, respectively. ROC curve showed that post-transplant MLL-PTD >/= 1.0% was the optimal cut-off value for predicting hematological relapse after allo-HSCT. There was statistical difference between post-transplant MLL-PTD >/= 1.0% and MLL-PTD < 1.0% groups (3-year CIR: 75% +/- 15.3% vs. 0%, P < 0.001; 3-year OS: 25.0 +/- 15.3% vs. 80.7% +/- 6.6%, P < 0.001; 3-year DFS: 25.0 +/- 15.3% vs. 80.7 +/- 6.6%, P < 0.001; 3-year TRM: 0 vs. 19.3 +/- 6.6%, P = 0.277). However, whether MLL-PTD >/= 1% or MLL-PTD < 1% before transplantation has no significant difference on the prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that MLL-PTD had a certain stability and could effectively reflect the change of tumor burden. The expression level of MLL-PTD after transplantation can serve as an effective indicator for predicting relapse.",['(c) 2021.

Therefore, qualification and/or quantification of GST-P1 in biological fluids can be noteworthy in cancer diagnostic and/or prognostic methods. Whereas costly immunoassays methods are routinely used for clinical analysis, long analysis time per sample is still considered as their disadvantages. To create a fast, efficient, and economical GST-P1 qualification and/or quantification technique, we developed an affinity magnetic nanoparticle-MS method. In proposed method there is no need for any pretreatment for reducing the complexity of sample and depletion of high abundant proteins that are used in routinely immunoassays methods. After enrichment of GST-P1 from blood plasma samples by affinity magnetic nanoparticle (without any pretreatment), the final eluent was analyzed using MALDI-TOF, IM-Q-TOF and LC-ESI-Q-TOF MS. For the first time this study demonstrates the suitability of affinity magnetic nanoparticle-MS method for qualification/quantification of GST-P1 from acute lymphoblastic leukemia blood plasma samples with the limit-of-detection 0.0094 ppm in less than 5 h.

Eosinophilia is a distinctive and common feature associated with this rearrangement. Although few cases have been described, the prognosis of patients with ETV6::ACSL6 is considered poor. We report two additional cases of t(5;12)(q31;p13)/ETV6::ACLS6 rearrangement and eosinophilia.

The concurrence of these two rare abnormalities has never been reported and may suggest a cooperative role of t(5;12) and t(6;9), leading to disease relapse. Moreover, at relapse, both cases presented with eosinophilia, further strengthening the association of t(5;12) with eosinophilia in myeloid malignancies. Given the poor prognosis and the non-responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of cases of ETV6::ACSL6 rearrangement, in contrast to cases of ETV6::PDGFRB rearrangement, we recommend the introduction of testing for this abnormality in myeloid malignancies with eosinophilia.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to explore the prognostic significance of early high PLT values in patients with de novo non-M3 AML who achieved first complete remission (CR). METHODS: A total of 206 patients with de novo non-M3 AML were analysed in this retrospective study. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal PLT cut-off. The overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: 312x10(9) /L was confined as the cut-off of the PLT count. The estimated 3-year OS of patients with high PLT was higher than that of their counterparts (72.3% vs. 34.6%, p = 0.001). In subgroup analysis, patients with high PLT had better OS in the favourable- and intermediate-risk (non-adverse-risk) AML (p = 0.001). The estimated 3-year RFS for the high and low PLT groups was 75.1% and 45.7% respectively (p = 0.078). Multivariate analyses revealed that high PLT count was an independent favourable variable for OS (HR = 0.264, p < 0.001) and RFS (HR = 0.375, p = 0.011) in the non-adverse-risk group. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that early high PLT count recovery at first CR in non-adverse-risk AML patients is a positive prognostic marker for survival outcomes.","['(c) 2022 The Authors.

Children (>28 days, <18 years) with CD19+ R/R B-ALL received up to five cycles of blinatumomab by continuous infusion (cycle: 4 weeks on/2 weeks off). The primary endpoint was incidence of adverse events. Secondary endpoints included complete response (CR) and measurable residual disease (MRD) response within the first two cycles, relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) after treatment. At final data cutoff (1/10/20), 110 patients were enrolled (median age, 8.5 years; 88% >/=5% blasts at baseline). Blinatumomab treatment resulted in a low incidence of grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome (n=2 [1.8%]) and neurologic events (n=4 [3.6%]). No blinatumomab-related fatal adverse events were reported. The probability of response was not affected by the presence of cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities. Median OS was 14.6 months (95%CI: 11.0 horizontal line not estimable) and was significantly greater for MRD responders versus MRD non-responders (not estimable vs 9.3; HR 0.18, 95%CI: 0.08 horizontal line 0.39). One-year OS probability was higher for patients who received alloHSCT versus without alloHSCT post-blinatumomab (87% versus 29%).

Of patients achieving CR after 2 cycles, 73.5% (95%CI: 61.4%-83.5%) proceeded to alloHSCT. These findings support the use of blinatumomab as a safe and efficacious treatment for pediatric R/R B-ALL.

The aim of this study is to assess the incidence and timeframe of thyroid complications in cancer patients, followed systematically since their radiation therapy, and to identify risk factors for the development of hypothyroidism and thyroid cancer. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study, including 282 subjects, who received neck, craniospinal, or total body irradiation (TBI). Patients were grouped into four primary diagnostic clusters: leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease, central nervous system, and head and neck tumours. RESULTS: Hypothyroidism was observed in 56.7% of patients, on average 6.8 +/- 5.9 years after the treatment. Neck and craniospinal irradiation presented a 3.5-fold increased risk for the development of hypothyroidism compared to TBI.

It is important to distinguish the two due to increased risk of developing marrow fibrosis, acute leukemia, and thrombosis in the former. Molecular studies are the main tools to differentiate the two but are not available in all hospitals. We aimed to design a highly sensitive scoring system using routine lab data to classify thrombocytosis as essential or reactive. Methods: A total of 145 patients were enrolled in this study. Potential predictors included patient demographics and clinical laboratory parameters. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to decide the optimal cutoff level. Multivariate logistic regression with forward model selection method was performed to decide the predictors. Results: The risk scores by multivariate analysis were as follows: 1 point for WBC > 13,500/muL; 2.5 points for Hb > 10.9 g/dL; 3 points for platelet count > 659,000/muL; and 2 points for MPV > 9.3 fL. The cut off value was set as 4.5 points, and sensitivity of 91.1% and specificity of 75.8% were noted. Conclusion: In this study, we investigated lab data and developed a high-sensitivity convenient-to-use scoring system to differentiate ET from RT. The scoring system was assigned to the resulting model to make it more economical, simple, and convenient for clinical practice.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Shen, Hsieh, Wang, Huang, Chu and Wu.']","['Shen, Chih-Lung', 'Hsieh, Tsung-Cheng', 'Wang, Tso-Fu', 'Huang, Wei-Han', 'Chu, Sung-Chao', 'Wu, Yi-Feng']","['Shen CL', 'Hsieh TC', 'Wang TF', 'Huang WH', 'Chu SC', 'Wu YF']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medical Sciences, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Tzu-Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program in Pharmacology and Toxicology, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211216,Switzerland,Front Med (Lausanne),Frontiers in medicine,101648047,,['NOTNLM'],"['essential thrombocytosis', 'hemoglobin', 'mean platelet volume', 'platelet count', 'reactive thrombocytosis', 'scoring system', 'white blood count']",2022/01/04 06:00,2022/01/04 06:01,['2022/01/03 05:48'],"['2021/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/03 05:48 [entrez]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmed.2021.736150 [doi]'],epublish,Front Med (Lausanne). 2021 Dec 16;8:736150. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2021.736150. eCollection 2021.,8,,736150,,,,PMC8716506,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of allo-HCT in AML is a consequence of a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect that is mediated by T lymphocytes, and unique mechanisms of immune evasion underlying post-allo-HCT AML relapses have recently been characterized. Relapsed AML following allo-HCT presents a particularly vexing clinical challenge because transplant-related toxicities, such as graft-versus-host (GVHD) and infections, increase the risk of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. In general, the prognosis of relapsed AML following allo-HCT is poor with most patients failing to achieve a subsequent remission and 2-year survival consistently <15%. The two factors that have been found to predict a better prognosis are a longer duration of post-transplant remission prior to relapse and a lower disease burden at the time of relapse. When considered in combination with a patient's age; co-morbidities; and performance status, these factors can help to inform the appropriate therapy for the treatment of post-transplant relapse. This review discusses the options for the treatment of post-transplant AML relapse with a focus on the options to achieve a subsequent remission and consolidation with cellular immunotherapy, such as a second transplant or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). While intensive reinduction therapy and less intensive approaches with hypomethylating agents have long represented the two primary options for the initial treatment of post-transplant relapse, molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapy are emerging as potential alternative options to achieve remission. Herein, we highlight response and survival outcomes achieved specifically in the post-transplant setting using each of these approaches and discuss how some therapies may overcome the immunologic mechanisms that have been implicated in post-transplant relapse. As long-term survival in post-transplant relapse necessarily involves consolidation with cellular immunotherapy, we present data on the efficacy and toxicity of both DLI and second allo-HCT including when such therapies are integrated with reinduction. Finally, we provide our general approach to the treatment of post-transplant relapse, integrating both novel therapies and our improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying post-transplant relapse.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Webster, Luznik and Gojo.']","['Webster, Jonathan A', 'Luznik, Leo', 'Gojo, Ivana']","['Webster JA', 'Luznik L', 'Gojo I']","['Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211216,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopietic stem cell transplantation', 'donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)', 'immunotherapy', 'targeted therapy']",2022/01/04 06:00,2022/01/04 06:01,['2022/01/03 05:47'],"['2021/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/03 05:47 [entrez]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.812207 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 16;11:812207. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.812207. eCollection 2021.,11,,812207,,,,PMC8716583,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), clonal evolution underpins leukemic progression and therapeutic resistance, with differences in clonal evolutionary dynamics accounting for its characteristically diverse clinical course. The past few years have witnessed profound changes in our understanding of CLL clonal evolution, facilitated by a maturing definition of high-risk CLL and an increasing sophistication of next-generation sequencing technology. In this review, we offer a modern perspective on clonal evolution of high-risk CLL, highlighting recent discoveries, paradigm shifts and unresolved questions. We appraise recent advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of CLL clonal evolution, focusing on the genetic and non-genetic sources of intratumoral heterogeneity, as well as tumor-immune dynamics. We review the technological innovations, particularly in single-cell technology, which have fostered these advances and represent essential tools for future discoveries. In addition, we discuss clonal evolution within several contexts of particular relevance to contemporary clinical practice, including the settings of therapeutic resistance to CLL targeted therapy and immunotherapy, as well as Richter transformation of CLL to high-grade lymphoma.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Kwok and Wu.'],"['Kwok, Marwan', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Kwok M', 'Wu CJ']","['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, United States.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211216,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['Richter syndrome', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'clonal evolution', 'intratumoral heterogeneity', 'single-cell analysis']",2022/01/04 06:00,2022/01/04 06:01,['2022/01/03 05:47'],"['2021/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/03 05:47 [entrez]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.790004 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 16;11:790004. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.790004. eCollection 2021.,11,,790004,,,,PMC8716560,,"['CW holds equity in BioNTech, Inc. and receives research funding support from', 'Pharmacyclics.

The combination of TBI with chemotherapy has demonstrated superior survival outcomes in patients with acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia when compared with conditioning regimens based only on chemotherapy. The clinical application of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)-based methods (volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and TomoTherapy) seems to be promising and has been actively used worldwide. The optimized conformal total body irradiation (OC-TBI) method described in this study provides selected dose reduction for organs at risk with respect to the most significant toxicity (lungs, kidneys, lenses). This study included 220 pediatric patients who received OC-TBI with subsequent chemotherapy and allogenic HSCT with TCRalphabeta/CD19 depletion. A group of 151 patients received OC-TBI using TomoTherapy, and 40 patients received OC-TBI using the Elekta Synergy linac with an Agility-MLC (Elekta, Crawley, UK) using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Twenty-nine patients received OC-TBI with supplemental simultaneous boost to bone marrow-(SIB to BM) up to 15 Gy: 28 patients (pts)-TomoTherapy; one patient-VMAT. The follow-up duration ranged from 0.3 to 6.4 years (median follow-up, 2.8 years). Overall survival (OS) for all the patients was 63% (95% CI: 56-70), and event-free survival (EFS) was 58% (95% CI: 51-65). The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 10.7% (95% CI: 2.2-16) for all patients. The incidence of early TRM (<100 days) was 5.0% (95% CI: 1.5-8.9), and that of late TRM (>100 days) was 5.7 (95% CI: 1.7-10.2). The main causes of death for all the patients were relapse and infection. The concept of OC-TBI using IMRT VMAT and helical treatment delivery on a TomoTherapy treatment unit provides maximum control of the dose distribution in extended targets with simultaneous dose reduction for organs at risk. This method demonstrated a low incidence of severe side effects after radiation therapy and predictable treatment effectiveness. Our initial experience demonstrates that OC-TBI appears to be a promising technique for the treatment of pediatric patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Kobyzeva, Shelikhova, Loginova, Kanestri, Tovmasyan, Maschan,', 'Khismatullina, Ilushina, Baidildina, Myakova and Nechesnyuk.']","['Kobyzeva, Daria', 'Shelikhova, Larisa', 'Loginova, Anna', 'Kanestri, Francheska', 'Tovmasyan, Diana', 'Maschan, Michael', 'Khismatullina, Rimma', 'Ilushina, Mariya', 'Baidildina, Dina', 'Myakova, Natalya', 'Nechesnyuk, Alexey']","['Kobyzeva D', 'Shelikhova L', 'Loginova A', 'Kanestri F', 'Tovmasyan D', 'Maschan M', 'Khismatullina R', 'Ilushina M', 'Baidildina D', 'Myakova N', 'Nechesnyuk A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Onco-hematology, Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Dmitry Rogachev National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211216,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['IMRT', 'TBI', 'TomoTherapy', 'Total marrow and lymphoid irradiation', 'acute leukemia', 'boost to bone marrow', 'pediatric patients', 'total body irradiation']",2022/01/04 06:00,2022/01/04 06:01,['2022/01/03 05:47'],"['2021/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/03 05:47 [entrez]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.785916 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 16;11:785916. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.785916. eCollection 2021.,11,,785916,,,,PMC8716385,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It plays an important role in the development of some tumors. SAMHD1 was also reported as a barrier to cytarabine, a common chemotherapy drug for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and as a biomarker of grim prognosis for acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) patients. However, SAMHD1 expression and function in MCL have not been well-defined. In the present study, we evaluated SAMHD1 expression by immunohistochemistry and its gene structure by Sanger sequencing in MCL. Our results showed that SAMHD1 was positive in 36 (62.1%) patients. Importantly, SAMHD1-positive patients were associated with lower chemotherapy response rate (p = 0.023) and shorter overall survival (p = 0.039) than SAMHD1-negative cases. These results suggest that SAMHD1 is an adverse biomarker for MCL patients, which is due to the high expression of SAMHD1 and rapid cell proliferation. These findings were confirmed in an in vitro study using the siRNA technique. Silencing the SAMHD1 gene in the MCL cell line Jeko-1 significantly decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis. The MCL cell line with SAMHD1 knockdown showed lower Ki-67 proliferation index, higher caspase-3, and higher sensitivity to cytarabine. Furthermore, for the first time, four previously unreported missense mutations (S302Y, Y432C, E449G, and R451H) in exon 8 and exon 12 of the SAMHD1 gene were discovered by sequencing. The mutations had not been found to corelate with SAMHD1 protein expression detected by immunohistochemistry. The biological functions of this mutated SAMHD1 remain to be investigated.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Yue, Tang, Ye, Yu, Liu, Jiao, Liu, Yin, Chen, Gao, Yang', 'and He.']","['Wang, Tao', 'Yue, Wenqin', 'Tang, Gusheng', 'Ye, Mingyu', 'Yu, Jiechen', 'Liu, Bin', 'Jiao, Lijuan', 'Liu, Xuefei', 'Yin, Shuyi', 'Chen, Jie', 'Gao, Lei', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'He, Miaoxia']","['Wang T', 'Yue W', 'Tang G', 'Ye M', 'Yu J', 'Liu B', 'Jiao L', 'Liu X', 'Yin S', 'Chen J', 'Gao L', 'Yang J', 'He M']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211217,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['SAMHD1', 'cytarabine resistance', 'gene silencing', 'immunohistochemistry', 'mantle cell lymphoma', 'mutations', 'patient risk stratification', 'prognosis']",2022/01/04 06:00,2022/01/04 06:01,['2022/01/03 05:46'],"['2021/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/03 05:46 [entrez]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.763151 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 17;11:763151. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.763151. eCollection 2021.,11,,763151,,,,PMC8719590,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is defined by blasts with strong expression of CD56 and weak to absent expression of CD45, HLA-DR....., and CD38 and characterized by significantly worse outcome [1]. Little is known about the clinical presentation and this immunophenotype is not widely recognized in clinical practice. We describe a case of AML with RAM immunophenotype in a 5-year-old male patient with a unique presentation, including extensive mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Diagnostic studies included bilateral bone marrow and lymph node biopsies, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and next generation sequencing. Bone marrow biopsy revealed >90% blasts, positive for CD34, CD117, and CD56 by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Next generation sequencing revealed BCOR loss and CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion. Following induction chemotherapy, bone marrow biopsy showed residual disease and a stem cell transplant was performed. The patient relapsed three months after transplant and subsequently passed away eleven months after initial diagnosis. Limited literature is available describing this newly identified AML subset. The RAM immunophenotype has been identified as an independent prognostic factor for relapse rate and overall and disease-free survival [1].

However, these drugs may cause side effects, such as electrolyte disturbances. This literature review aimed to provide a comparison of the effects of imatinib and nilotinib on blood potassium and calcium levels. It also summarized their hypothetical mechanism. A comprehensive electronic search of the different databases was conducted using 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'imatinib', 'nilotinib', 'potassium', 'calcium', 'electrolytes' as keywords. This review used PubMed- MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar as the source databases. Sixteen articles published from 2006 to 2020 were reviewed. Changes in blood potassium levels range from increased to decreased levels, while changes in blood calcium levels range from the lower normal values to below normal values (hypocalcemia). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including imatinib and nilotinib, have a non-specific target, namely plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), which indirectly affects blood potassium and calcium levels in CML patients.

The five-year survival rate of OSCC remains low despite the advances in clinical methods. miR-141-3p has been shown to activate or inhibit tumorigenesis. However, the effects of miR-141-3p on invasion and migration of OSCC remain unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of miR-141-3p on invasion, proliferation, and migration in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Reverse transcription quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to detect microRNA(miR)-141-3p and pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox-1 (PBX1) expression in OSCC tissues and cell lines. The luciferase reporter assay was used to detect targets of miR-141-3p in OSCC. MTT, Transwell and wound healing assays were used to determine the cell proliferation and invasive and migratory abilities, respectively. Expression of constitutive phosphorylated (p)-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was detected using western blotting in tissues and cells. miR-141-3p expression was decreased in OSCC tissues and cells, while PBX1 protein expression was increased compared with non-cancerous controls. The result from the dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that PBX1 was the direct target of miR-141-3p in OSCC tissues. Furthermore, miR-141-3p overexpression and PBX1 knockdown could reduce cell invasion, proliferation and migration, and inhibit the JAK2/STAT3 pathway; however, miR-141-3p downregulation had the opposite effects. In addition, silencing of PBX1 using small interfering RNA could weaken the effects of miR-141-3p inhibitor on JAK2/STAT3 pathway and cell progression in CAL27 cells. In summary, the findings from this study indicated that miR-141-3p upregulation could inhibit OSCC cell invasion, proliferation and migration, by targeting PBX1 via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.",['Copyright: (c) Cao et al.'],"['Cao, Mingguo', 'Tian, Kebin', 'Sun, Weifeng', 'Xu, Jun', 'Tang, Yu', 'Wu, Shilian']","['Cao M', 'Tian K', 'Sun W', 'Xu J', 'Tang Y', 'Wu S']","['School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Lishui University, Lishui, Zhejiang 323000, P.R.

An increasing number of CAR-T therapies are being developed for cancer treatment, but the frequent and varied adverse events, such as ""on-target, off-tumor toxicity"", limit CAR-T application. Here, we identify the target antigen expression patterns of CAR therapies in 18 tissues and organs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, heart, ascending aortic tissue, trachea, lung, skin, kidney, bladder, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, rectum, liver, common bile duct, and pancreas) from healthy human samples. The atlas determines target antigens expressed on some normal cell types, which facilitates elucidating the cause of ""on-target, off-tumor toxicity"" in special tissues and organs by targeting some antigens, but not others. Moreover, we describe the target antigen expression patterns of B-lineage-derived malignant cells, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and solid tumors. Overall, the present study indicates the pathogenesis of ""on-target, off-tumor toxicity"" during CAR therapies and provides guidance on taking preventive measures during CAR treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhang, Li, Cao, Wang, Xie, Li, Wang, Guo, Jiang and Guo.']","['Zhang, Yinyin', 'Li, Yingmei', 'Cao, Weijie', 'Wang, Fang', 'Xie, Xinsheng', 'Li, Yadan', 'Wang, Xiaoyi', 'Guo, Rong', 'Jiang, Zhongxing', 'Guo, Rongqun']","['Zhang Y', 'Li Y', 'Cao W', 'Wang F', 'Xie X', 'Li Y', 'Wang X', 'Guo R', 'Jiang Z', 'Guo R']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211216,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T cells)', 'malignant cells', 'off-tumor toxicity', 'on-target', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'target antigen']",2022/01/04 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2022/01/03 05:38'],"['2021/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/03 05:38 [entrez]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.799206 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Dec 16;12:799206. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.799206. eCollection 2021.,12,,799206,,,,PMC8716389,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they display multiple defects in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients leading to reduced anti-tumor potential. Our limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying these defects hampers the development of strategies to restore NK cell potential. Here, we have used a mouse model of AML to gain insight into these mechanisms. We found that leukemia progression resulted in NK cell maturation defects and functional alterations. Next, we assessed NK cell cytokine signaling governing their behavior. We showed that NK cells from leukemic mice exhibit constitutive IL-15/mTOR signaling and type I IFN signaling. However, these cells failed to respond to IL-15 stimulation in vitro as illustrated by reduced activation of the mTOR pathway. Moreover, our data suggest that mTOR-mediated metabolic responses were reduced in NK cells from AML-bearing mice. Noteworthy, the reduction of mTOR-mediated activation of NK cells during AML development partially rescued NK cell metabolic and functional defects. Altogether, our data strongly suggest that NK cells from leukemic mice are metabolically and functionally exhausted as a result of a chronic cytokine activation, at least partially IL-15/mTOR signaling. NK cells from AML patients also displayed reduced IL-2/15Rbeta expression and showed cues of reduced metabolic response to IL-15 stimulation in vitro, suggesting that a similar mechanism might occur in AML patients. Our study pinpoints the dysregulation of cytokine stimulation pathways as a new mechanism leading to NK cell defects in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Bou-Tayeh, Laletin, Salem, Just-Landi, Fares, Leblanc,', 'Balzano, Kerdiles, Bidaut, Herault, Olive, Aurrand-Lions, Walzer, Nunes and', 'Fauriat.']","['Bou-Tayeh, Berna', 'Laletin, Vladimir', 'Salem, Nassim', 'Just-Landi, Sylvaine', 'Fares, Joanna', 'Leblanc, Raphael', 'Balzano, Marielle', 'Kerdiles, Yann M', 'Bidaut, Ghislain', 'Herault, Olivier', 'Olive, Daniel', 'Aurrand-Lions, Michel', 'Walzer, Thierry', 'Nunes, Jacques A', 'Fauriat, Cyril']","['Bou-Tayeh B', 'Laletin V', 'Salem N', 'Just-Landi S', 'Fares J', 'Leblanc R', 'Balzano M', 'Kerdiles YM', 'Bidaut G', 'Herault O', 'Olive D', 'Aurrand-Lions M', 'Walzer T', 'Nunes JA', 'Fauriat C']","['Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'IBiSA Immunomonitoring Platform, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', ""Aix-Marseille Universite, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Marseille, France."", 'Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'Cibi Technological Platform, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR 7292, LNOx Team, Francois Rabelais University, Tours, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'IBiSA Immunomonitoring Platform, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), Inserm U1111, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS UMR5308, Lyon, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UMR7258, Inserm UMR1068, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Research Center of Marseille (CRCM), Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211217,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-15/mTOR signaling', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*chronic stimulation', '*exhaustion', '*metabolism', '*natural killer cells']",2022/01/04 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2022/01/03 05:38'],"['2021/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/03 05:38 [entrez]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.730970 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Dec 17;12:730970. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.730970. eCollection 2021.,12,,730970,,,,PMC8718679,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age of the 31 cases was 46 (28-51) years, male to female ratio 1.38:1, and 90-day mortality rate 54.8%. The most common underlying disease was acute myeloid leukemia (58.1%). The main clinical symptoms were fever (100%), cough (87.1%), sputum (80.6%), chest pain (61.3%), and hemoptysis (19.4%). Reversed halo sign (83.9%) was the most common computed tomography sign. A total of 48.4% of patients also had aspergillus or bacterial infections. Discriminative models were constructed by random forest with 17 non-survivors and 14 survivors. Procalcitonin, the duration of intravenous administration of amphotericin B or amphotericin B liposomes, and neutropenia at death or 90 days of survival were the leading risk factors for poor prognosis, with area under the curve of 0.975 (95% CI 0.934-1). We chose 0.6775 as death prediction threshold (with 82.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity) and validated the model successfully in another 15 patients. Chest pain and reversed halo sign are specific clinical and image signs of hematological disease complicated with mucormycosis. Neutropenia, elevated procalcitonin, and insufficient use time of amphotericin B or amphotericin B liposomes are risk factors for death.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Ma, Li, Cao, Li, Zhang, Li, Xing, Tian, Jiao, Chen, Zhang, Xu', 'and Xing.']","['Ma, Xiaoxu', 'Li, Ang', 'Cao, Weijie', 'Li, Huiling', 'Zhang, Suping', 'Li, Li', 'Xing, Haizhou', 'Tian, Wenliang', 'Jiao, Pengfei', 'Chen, Jiajun', 'Zhang, Qingxian', 'Xu, Aiguo', 'Xing, Lihua']","['Ma X', 'Li A', 'Cao W', 'Li H', 'Zhang S', 'Li L', 'Xing H', 'Tian W', 'Jiao P', 'Chen J', 'Zhang Q', 'Xu A', 'Xing L']","['Department of Respiration, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Gene Hospital of Henan Province, Precision Medicine Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Respiration, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Respiration, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Respiration, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Respiration, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Respiration, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211215,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,['NOTNLM'],"['death prediction model', 'hematological diseases', 'high-risk factors', 'mucormycosis', 'random forest']",2022/01/04 06:00,2022/01/04 06:01,['2022/01/03 05:37'],"['2021/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/03 05:37 [entrez]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2021.784974 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2021 Dec 15;12:784974. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2021.784974. eCollection 2021.,12,,784974,,,,PMC8714886,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The observed synergy of their antibacterial activity suggested the prospect of introducing antimicrobial peptides or small antimicrobial proteins into the gelatinized coating of AgNPs. Conjugates with protegrin-1, indolicidin, protamine, histones, and lysozyme were comparatively tested for their antibacterial properties and compared with unconjugated nanoparticles and antimicrobial polypeptides alone. Their toxic effects were similarly tested against both normal eukaryotic cells (human erythrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and dermal fibroblasts) and tumor cells (human erythromyeloid leukemia K562 and human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cell lines). The AMPs/APs retained their ability to enhance the antibacterial activity of AgNPs against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including drug-resistant strains, when conjugated to the AgNP surface. The small, membranolytic protegrin-1 was the most efficient, suggesting that a short, rigid structure is not a limiting factor despite the constraints imposed by binding to the nanoparticle. Some of the conjugated AMPs/APs clearly affected the ability of nanoparticle to permeabilize the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, but none of the conjugated AgNPs acquired the capacity to permeabilize its cytoplasmic membrane, regardless of the membranolytic potency of the bound polypeptide. Low hemolytic activity was also found for all AgNP-AMP/AP conjugates, regardless of the hemolytic activity of the free polypeptides, making conjugation a promising strategy not only to enhance their antimicrobial potential but also to effectively reduce the toxicity of membranolytic AMPs. The observation that metabolic processes and O2 consumption in bacteria were efficiently inhibited by all forms of AgNPs is the most likely explanation for their rapid and bactericidal action. AMP-dependent properties in the activity pattern of various conjugates toward eukaryotic cells suggest that immunomodulatory, wound-healing, and other effects of the polypeptides are at least partially transferred to the nanoparticles, so that functionalization of AgNPs may have effects beyond just modulation of direct antibacterial activity. In addition, some conjugated nanoparticles are selectively toxic to tumor cells.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the CSF3R mutations (CSF3Rmut) in AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities for potential synergistic pathomechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively screened 1102 adult de novo AML patients with available next-generation sequencing (NGS) information on 132 genes related to hematologic disorders. The chi(2), Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze their associations with clinicopathologic characteristics, and a propensity score matching (PSM) followed by Kaplan-Meier method was applied to measure their prognostic effects. RESULTS: Overall, CSF3Rmut were detected in 40 (3.6%) of 1102 patients with adult de novo AML. CSF3Rmut were predominantly enriched in AML with the CEBPA double mutations (CEBPAdm) (16/122, 13.1%), t(8;21) (12/186, 6.5%) and mutated RUNX1 (3/50, 6.0%), respectively. The CSF3Rmut loci and types differed according to AML subtypes, with frameshift-indels and premature stop confined in the t(8;21) AML [10/12 (83.3%)], and missense recurrently aggregated in the CEBPAdm AML [16/16 (100%)]. Cases with CSF3Rmut had a lower WBC count versus those with CSF3R wild-type (CSF3Rwt) in the t(8;21) AML cohort, with a borderline significance [median 5.45 (range 0.94-20.30) x 10(9)/L) vs. 8.80 (range 0.96-155.00) x 10(9)/L, P = .046]. CSF3Rmut were non-significantly associated with higher WBC counts [median 33.6 (range 6.8-287.6) x 10(9)/L vs. 18.1 (range 1.7-196.0) x 10(9)/L, P = .156] and significantly with lower immunophenotypic CD15 positivity [0/8 (0%) vs. 44/80 (55%), P = .009] as compared to CSF3Rwt in the CEBPAdm AML cohort. After propensity score matching followed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, CSF3Rmut cases had comparable disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) to those with CSF3Rwt (P = .607 and P = .842, respectively) in the t(8;21) AML cohort. By contrast, CSF3Rmut showed an inclination towards inferior DFS compared to CSF3Rwt in the CEBPAdm AML cohort [median DFS 19.8 (95%CI 3.1-36.5) months vs. not reached (NR), P = .086]. No significant difference was found for OS between CSF3Rmut and CSF3Rwt cases (P = .943). CONCLUSION: We concluded that CSF3Rmut were frequently enriched in patients with t(8;21) and CEBPAdm subtypes among AML, but showed divergent clinicopathologic features, mutation loci and types and differing prognostic aspects.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Humans have eight genes for these myosins. Class I Myosins have different functions: regulate membrane tension, participate in endocytosis, exocytosis, intracellular trafficking and cell migration. Cell migration is influenced by many cellular components including motor proteins, like myosins. Recently has been reported that changes in myosin expression have an impact on the migration of cancer cells, the formation of infiltrates and metastasis. We propose that class I myosins might be potential markers for future diagnostic, prognostic or even as therapeutic targets in leukemia and other cancers.Abbreviations: Myo1g: Myosin 1g; ALL: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, TH1: Tail Homology 1; TH2: Tail Homology 2; TH3: Tail Homology 3.",,"['Diaz-Valencia, Juan D', 'Estrada-Abreo, Laura A', 'Rodriguez-Cruz, Leonor', 'Salgado-Aguayo, Alfonso R', 'Patino-Lopez, Genaro']","['Diaz-Valencia JD', 'Estrada-Abreo LA', 'Rodriguez-Cruz L', 'Salgado-Aguayo AR', 'Patino-Lopez G']","[""Immunology and Proteomics Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico."", ""Immunology and Proteomics Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico."", 'Cell Biology and Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Metropolitan Autonomous University, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Cell Biology and Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Metropolitan Autonomous University, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Rheumatic Diseases Laboratory, National Institute of Respiratory Diseases ""Ismael Cosio Villegas"", Mexico City, Mexico.', ""Immunology and Proteomics Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Adh Migr,Cell adhesion & migration,101469464,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Class I Myosin', '*cancer', '*cell migration', '*leukemia', '*metastasis', '*tissue infiltration']",2022/01/04 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2022/01/03 05:20'],"['2022/01/03 05:20 [entrez]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/19336918.2021.2020705 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Adh Migr. 2022 Dec;16(1):1-12. doi: 10.1080/19336918.2021.2020705.,16,1,1-12,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8716-722X'],,PMC8741282,,,,,,,20220112,['EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)'],"['Cell Movement', 'Humans', '*Myosins', '*Neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The observational retrospective study was conducted in February-March 2019 at the Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant, the Children's Hospital and the Institute of Child Health, Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised data of all paediatric patients of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who expired during treatment from January 2017 till September 2018. Death due to relapse and deaths before treatment were excluded. Data was analysed using SPSS 16. RESULTS: Of the 247 deaths during the study period, 144(58.3%) were treatment-related mortality cases; 81(56.2%) males and 63(43.8%) females with an overall mean age of 5.0+/-3.83 years. The commonest cause was sepsis 126(87.5%), followed by haemorrhagic complications 11(7.6%), drug toxicity 4(2.8%), tumour lysis syndrome 2(1.4%) and thromboembolism 1(0.7%). Significant factors associated with treatment-related mortality were weight-for-age, immunophenotype, the reason for admission, and absolute neutrophil count (p<0.05).

We present a subgroup analysis of MAIA by frailty status. Frailty assessment was performed retrospectively using age, Charlson comorbidity index, and baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score. Patients were classified as fit, intermediate, non-frail (fit + intermediate), or frail. Of the randomized patients (D-Rd, n = 368; Rd, n = 369), 396 patients were non-frail (D-Rd, 196 [53.3%]; Rd, 200 [54.2%]) and 341 patients were frail (172 [46.7%]; 169 [45.8%]). After a 36.4-month median follow-up, non-frail patients had longer PFS than frail patients, but the PFS benefit of D-Rd versus Rd was maintained across subgroups: non-frail (median, not reached [NR] vs 41.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.48; P < 0.0001) and frail (NR vs 30.4 months; HR, 0.62; P = 0.003). Improved rates of complete response or better and minimal residual disease (10(-5)) negativity were observed for D-Rd across subgroups.

Second, we aimed to estimate preliminary treatment effects of VR compared to an active distraction control (iPad). METHODS: A single-site pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing VR to iPad distraction was conducted. Eligible children were aged 8-18 years undergoing treatment for cancer with upcoming SCP needle insertions. Intervention acceptability was evaluated by child, parent, and nurse self-report. Preliminary effectiveness outcomes included child-reported pain intensity, distress, and fear. Preliminary effectiveness was determined using logistic regression models with outcomes compared between groups using pre-procedure scores as covariates. RESULTS: Twenty participants (mean age 1250% shaded blocky) were randomized to each group. The most common diagnosis was acute lymphocytic leukemia (n=23, 58%). Most eligible children (62%) participated, and one withdrew after randomization to the iPad group. Nurses, parents, and children reported the interventions in both groups to be acceptable, with the VR participants reporting significantly higher immersion in the distraction environment (P=0.0318). Although not statistically significant, more VR group participants indicated no pain (65% vs. 45%) and no distress (80% vs. 47%) during the procedure compared to the iPad group. Fear was similar across groups, with approximately 60% of the sample indicating no fear. DISCUSSION: VR was feasible and acceptable to implement as an intervention during SCP access. Preliminary effectiveness results indicate that VR may reduce distress and distress compared to iPad distraction. These data will inform design of a future full-scale RCT.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This research aimed at utilizing experimental and theoretical approaches to characterize the binding mechanism between EDB and human serum albumin (HSA). Formation of an EDB-HSA static complex was demonstrated by quenching of the HSA intrinsic fluorescence by EDB. Using well known mathematical relations (e.g. Stern-Volmer and Lineweaver-Burk equations), the recorded EDB-HSA fluorescence data were interpreted and revealed binding constants in the magnitude order of 10(4) M(-1) for the different investigated temperatures. These determined results were taken into further mathematical calculations to reveal the thermodynamic properties of EDB-HSA binding. Results demonstrated that spontaneous EDB and HSA binding takes place led by electrostatic forces. Computational docking studies have further confirmed the latter finding showing that EDB fits into the HSA Sudlow site I. Molecular dynamic simulation was performed to calculate the root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg) and hydrogen bond parameters for the EDB-HSA complex.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The relapse risk is associated with therapy intensity, suggesting that other somatic mutations may influence iAMP21-ALL prognosis. This abnormality is characterized by multiple copies of the RUNX1 gene in chromosome 21 and appears to arise through multiple breakage-fusion bridge cycles and chromothripsis. Rob(15;21) or a ring chromosome 21 have been associated with an increased risk for iAMP21-ALL, suggesting that constitutional genetic abnormalities may also drive leukemogenesis. Here we describe homozygous deletion of the SH2B3 gene, chromothripsis of chromosome 21, and a non-Robertsonian somatic t(15;21)(q25.3;q22.1) with NTRK3 gene rearrangement in an adolescent with iAMP21-B-ALL. Molecular cytogenetic studies detected iAMP21 with aCGH analysis revealing further genomic imbalances. The RT-qPCR analysis detected elevated expression levels of RUNX1 (68-fold) and reduced expression of CDK6 (0.057-fold). Studies with constitutive cells collected from mouth swabs showed that SH2B3 biallelic deletion was a somatic alteration occurring during clonal evolution. The identification of novel secondary genetic changes was valuable to discuss sporadic iAMP21 leukemogenic mechanisms. For the first time, we show a t(15;21)(q25.3;q22.1) with NTRK3 rearrangement in an adolescent with iAMP21-ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

To date, ten clinical trials investigating mtIDH1 inhibitors among patients with diverse malignancies (cholangiocarcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, chondrosarcoma, glioma) have been published. Almost every trial (80%) has investigated ivosidenib. In multiple phase I trials, ivosidenib treatment resulted in promising radiographic and biochemical responses with improved survival outcomes (relative to historic data) among patients with both solid and hematologic mtIDH1 malignancies. Among patients enrolled in a phase III trial with advanced cholangiocarcinoma, ivosidenib resulted in a PFS rate of 32% at 6 months, as compared to 0% with placebo. There was a 5.2 month increase in OS with ivosidenib relative to placebo, after considering crossover. The treatment-specific grade >/=3 adverse event rate of ivosidenib was 2%-26% among all patients, and was just 3.6% among 284 patients who had a solid tumor across four trials. Although <1% of malignancies harbor IDH1 mutations, small molecule mtIDH1 inhibitors, namely ivosidenib, appear to be biologically active and well tolerated in patients with solid and hematologic mtIDH1 malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Since sirtuin2 (SIRT2) is an important epigenetic regulator and associated with several cancer types including breast cancer, development and evaluation of new SIRT2 inhibitors to probe their therapeutic potentials is currently desirable. A highly selective SIRT2 inhibitor named I was previously developed by us, which showed activity to inhibit non-small cell lung cancer cell lines in vitro. We herein report expanded screening of I and its structurally similar inactive compound II against other cancer cell lines, and found that I had a wide spectrum of anticancer activity while II had no such effects. The I-sorafenib combination treatment exerted obvious synergistic reduction on cell viability of MCF-7 cells. We observed that the combination treatment could suppress cell proliferation, survival and migration, arrest cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, and induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, when compared with the single treatment. In vivo studies revealed that the combination treatment showed stronger tumor growth inhibition (87%), comparing with I-(42.8%) or sorafenib-solely-treated groups (61.1%) in MCF-7 xenograft model. In conclusion, this work clearly revealed a potential synthetic lethality effect for I combined with sorafenib, and will probably offer a new strategy at least for breast cancer treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

However, cardiotoxicity associated with IMA is included among the therapeutic strategies. The present study was aimed to discover whether ferroptosis, a programmed iron-dependent cell death, is involved in IMA-induced cardiotoxicity. In vivo, mouse model was established after treated with 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg IMA. Serum CK, LDH, AST activities were determined. Cardiac tissues were examined by H&E and Oil Red O staining. MDA was measured to assess production of lipid peroxide. Tissue iron and GSH content were measured. In vitro, cell viability, mitochondria membrane potential, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular iron levels were performed to explore the mechanism of IMA. The in vivo results revealed that IMA treatment significantly increased serum CK, LDH and AST. H&E staining showed that IMA caused cardiac structural injuries. The dose-dependent decrease of GSH and increase of tissue iron and MDA were observed in IMA-treated groups. Oil Red O staining suggested obvious cardiac lipid accumulation after treated with IMA. In H9c2 cardiomyocytes, IMA significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Mitochondria membrane potential assay showed that IMA destroyed the mitochondrial function. Additionally, IMA increased the cellular ROS and iron levels. Furthermore, IMA down-regulated the expression of Nrf2 and up-regulated the expression of P53 and TfR. These results provided compelling evidence that ferroptosis participates in IMA-induced cardiotoxicity. Ferroptosis could be regarded as a target to protect against cardiotoxicity in IMA-exposed patients.",['Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

It is known that deregulation of adipokine pathways is probably implicated in the ontogenesis of ALL. The present work aims at investigating the role of adiponectin and its effects on an ALL cell line. The CCRF-CEM cells were used as a model. Cells have been treated with adiponectin, with different concentrations up to 72 h. Cytotoxicity and cell cycle distribution were investigated for all concentrations using flow cytometry. Selected concentrations were also used for additional microarray analysis, using a small gene set of cancer-related genes. Lower and higher adiponectin concentrations did not produce an inhibition of proliferation, as well as an increase in cell death. It was found that adiponectin regulated differentially genes, such as CD22, CDH1, IFNG, LCK, MSH2, SPINT2, and others. At the same time, it appeared that adiponectin-related gene expression was more active on chromosomes 18 and 1. Machine learning classification algorithms showed that several genes were grouped together indicating common regulatory mechanisms. The present study showed that adiponectin is able to induce gene differential expression in leukemic cells in vitro, suggesting a possible role in the progression of leukemia. It is also an indication that more studies are required in order to further understand the role of adiponectin and adipokines in general in the role of human neoplasms.","['(c) 2021.

Rhabdomyosarcoma, on the other hand, is a rare type of malignancy which belongs to the primitive neuroectodermal family of tumors. The aim of the present study was to use computational methods in order to examine the similarities and differences of the two different tumors using two cell lines as a model, the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM and rhabdomyosarcoma TE-671, and, in particular, similarities of the metabolic pathways utilized by two different cell types in vitro. Both cell lines were studied using microarray technology. Differential expression profile has revealed genes with similar expression, suggesting that there are common mechanisms between the two cell types, where some of these mechanisms are preserved from their ancestor embryonic cells. Expression of identified species was modeled using known functions, in order to find common patterns in metabolism-related mechanisms. Species expression manifested very interesting dynamics, and we were able to model the system with elliptical/helical functions. We discuss the results of our analysis in the context of the commonly occurring genes between the two cell lines and the respective participating pathways as far as extracellular signaling and cell cycle regulation/proliferation are concerned. In the present study, we have developed a methodology, which was able to unravel some of the underlying dynamics of the metabolism-related species of two different cell types. Such approaches could prove useful in understanding the mechanisms of tumor ontogenesis, progression, and proliferation.","['(c) 2021.

Treatment options in the relapse setting are limited, still relying predominantly on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and cytotoxic chemotherapy, with poor outcomes. Novel targeted and venetoclax-based combinations are being investigated and have shown encouraging results. Immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with low-intensity chemotherapy demonstrated encouraging response rates and survival among patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) AML, especially in the pre- and post-allo-HSCT setting. Blocking the CD47/SIRPalpha pathway is another strategy that showed robust anti-leukemic activity, with a response rate of around 70% and an encouraging median overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed, higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and patients with AML with a TP53 mutation. One approach that was proven to be very effective in the relapsed setting of lymphoid malignancies is chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. It relies on the infusion of genetically engineered T cells capable of recognizing specific epitopes on the surface of leukemia cells. In AML, different CAR constructs with different target antigens have been evaluated and demonstrated safety and feasibility in the R/R setting. However, the difficulty of potently targeting leukemic blasts in AML while sparing normal cells represents a major limitation to their use, and strategies are being tested to overcome this obstacle. A different approach is based on endogenously redirecting the patient's system cells to target and destroy leukemic cells via bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) or dual antigen receptor targeting (DARTs). Early results have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of these agents, and research is ongoing to develop BiTEs with longer half-life, allowing for less frequent administration schedules and developing them in earlier and lower disease burden settings.","['(c) 2021.

Approximately 20 to 45% of CBF-AML patients have KIT mutations which are having poor prognosis and high incidence of relapse. There is still insufficient data to categorize the patients with c-kit mutation into which risk group and there is a debate around whether Tyrosine kinase inhibitors can decrease the relapse risk and improve the prognosis of those patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted throughout a period of 3 years, where 102 CBF-AML were enrolled in our study. We analyzed the incidence of c-KIT exon 8 and 17 D816V mutations in CBF-AML patients and studied the prognosis. RESULTS: The prevalence of CBF-AML was 102 of 989 (10.3%), 13.7% and 8.7% in pediatrics and adults' groups respectively. c-KIT fragment mutation analysis revealed a mutant form in 27 of 102 (26.5%) patients. Exon 8 mutation was found in 4 of 40 pediatric and 2 of 62 adult patients, while exon 17 mutation was found in 9 of 40 pediatric and 12 of 62 adult patients. The c-KIT mutations was more common in t(8;21). There was no significant relationship between c-kit mutation and CR rates, while there was a significant inferior overall, disease free as well as progression free survival in the c-KIT mutant patients as compared to the wild group (P value .045, .036 and .024 respectively) in the pediatric group, however, this significance was not evident in the adults' group. CONCLUSION: According to our study, the results may suggest c-KIT mutation as a poor risk factor in pediatric CBF-AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to determine the incidence of infectious diseases as a cause of death among cancer patients and analyze the trends and risk factors associated with mortality. METHODS: In total, 151,440 cancer patients who died from infectious diseases in the US diagnosed between 1973 and 2014 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program were enrolled. A trend analysis of annual cancer deaths caused by infectious diseases was conducted. Cox proportional hazards model and survival decision tree model were performed. RESULT: The most common infectious diseases were pneumonia and influenza (n = 72,133), parasitic and other infectious (n = 47,310) diseases, and septicemia (n = 31,119). The patients' mean age was 66.33 years; majority of them were male (62%). The overall incidence from 1973 to 2014 showed an insignificant decrease (annual percentage change = - 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = - 2.2-1.7, P = 0.8). Parasitic and other infectious diseases, including HIV (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.69-1.84), had the highest incidence, followed by septicemia (SIR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.81-0.88), tuberculosis (SIR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.51-0.99), and pneumonia (SIR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.61-0.64). Based on the Cox regression analysis, old black male patients with intrahepatic tumor or acute leukemia of different grades, except the well-differentiated grade, had the highest risk of dying from infectious diseases. CONCLUSION: Infectious diseases remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer patients. Early recognition of risk factors and timely intervention may help mitigate the negative consequences on patients' quality of life and prognosis, improving the prognosis and preventing early death from infection, which is preventable in most cases.",['(c) 2021.

The multicohort, phase 1 KEYNOTE-155 study evaluated the safety and antitumor activity of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab plus the CDK9 inhibitor dinaciclib in patients with relapsed or refractory (rr) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multiple myeloma (MM). Patients enrolled were >/=18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of CLL, DLBCL, or MM. The study included 2 phases: a dose-evaluation phase to determine dose-limiting toxicities and a signal-detection phase. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks plus dinaciclib 7 mg/m2 on day 1 and 10 mg/m2 on day 8 of cycle 1 and 14 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of cycles 2 and later. Primary endpoint was safety, and a key secondary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), Seventy-two patients were enrolled and received >/=1 dose of study treatment (CLL, n = 17; DLBCL, n = 38; MM, n = 17). Pembrolizumab plus dinaciclib was generally well tolerated and produced no unexpected toxicities. The ORRs were 29.4% (5/17, rrCLL), 21.1% (8/38, rrDLBCL), and 0% (0/17, rrMM), respectively. At data cutoff, all 72 patients had discontinued treatment, 38 (52.8%) because of progressive disease. These findings demonstrate activity with combination pembrolizumab plus dinaciclib and suggest that a careful and comprehensive approach to explore anti-PD-1 and CDK9 inhibitor combinations is warranted.

Thus, development of a safe and effective therapeutic agent to treat this disease is crucial to address this unmet medical need. BRD4, a member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein family, and cyclic AMP response element binding protein binding protein (CBP) and p300, two paralogous histone acetyltransferases, are all considered cancer drug targets and simultaneous targeting of these proteins may have therapeutic advantages. Here, we demonstrate that a BET/CBP/p300 multi-bromodomain inhibitor, CN470, has anti-tumor activity against MLL-r ALL in vitro and in vivo. CN470, potently inhibited ligand binding to the bromodomains of BRD4, CBP, and p300 and suppressed the growth of MLL-r ALL cell lines and patient-derived cells with MLL rearrangements. CN470 suppressed mRNA and protein expression of MYC and induced apoptosis in MLL-r ALL cells, following a cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Moreover, CN470 reduced BRD4 binding to acetylated histone H3. The in vivo effects of CN470 were investigated using SEM(Luc/GFP) cells expressing luminescent markers in an orthotopic mouse model. Mice administered CN470 daily had prolonged survival compared to the vehicle group. Further, CN470 also showed anti-tumor effects against an MLL-r ALL patient-derived xenograft model. These findings suggest that inhibition of BET/CBP/p300 by the multi-bromodomain inhibitor, CN470, represents a promising therapeutic approach against MLL-r ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

A long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA)-microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA coexpression and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network was constructed by bioinformatics analysis based on a benzene-induced aplastic anemia (BIAA) mouse model. In this population-based study, we observed a trend consistent with that in the BIAA mice: lincRNA-p21 and p21 were upregulated, while miRNA-17-5p expression was downregulated in benzene-exposed workers. Moreover, multiple linear regressions indicated that lincRNA-p21 was negatively associated with white blood cell (WBC) counts. Predictive thresholds of hematotoxicity were identified by ROC curve analysis with S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA) and lincRNA-p21 showing a better predictive ability than the other parameters and the combination of SPMA and lincRNA-p21 exhibiting the highest predictive value for hematotoxicity. LincRNA-p21 was predominantly present in the cytoplasm of bone marrow cells (BMCs) and K562 cells as assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Upon exploring the underlying mechanism by which lincRNA-p21 mediates benzene-induced hematotoxicity, we observed that the negative regulation of 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ) on cell cycle arrest and inhibition of K562 cell proliferation was partially relieved by lincRNA-p21 knockdown, which can inhibit the expression of P21 and thereby suppress the toxic effects of 1,4-BQ. Finally, dual-luciferase reporter gene and RIP assay showed that, by acting as a sponge, lincRNA-p21 reduced the activity of miRNA-17-5p and consequently increased the expression of p21. In conclusion, our research suggested that benzene induces hematotoxicity via the lincRNA-p21/miRNA-17-5p/p21 signaling which might contribute to the underlying mechanism of lincRNA-p21 in benzene-induced hematotoxicity. Therefore, lincRNA-p21 can serve as a potential biomarker for the early detection of hematopoiesis inhibition in individuals with long-term exposure to low-dose benzene.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, the development and validation of simple and low-cost methods are essential for a rapid CML diagnosis in less specialized and equipped centers. In this study, we develop and demonstrate an accessible, rapid, and low-cost method using RT-LAMP for BCR-ABL1 detection in both cell lines and CML clinical samples, using fluorescent and colorimetric assays. Both methods demonstrated diagnostic specificity of 100% and while diagnostic sensitivity reaches more than 90% in samples with RT-qPCR cycle threshold above 31.

The molecular mechanism that drives the generation of iT cells remains unclear. Here, we report that the cytokine receptor gammac plays a previously unappreciated role for thymic iT cells by controlling their cellular abundance, lineage commitment, and subset differentiation. As such, gammac overexpression on thymocytes dramatically altered iT cell generation in the thymus, as it skewed the subset composition of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells and promoted the generation of IFNgamma-producing innate CD8 T cells. Mechanistically, we found that the gammac-STAT6 axis drives the differentiation of IL-4-producing iNKT cells, which in turn induced the generation of innate CD8 T cells. Collectively, these results reveal a cytokine-driven circuity of thymic iT cell differentiation that is controlled by the abundance of gammac proteins.","['(c) 2021.

Due to limited sensitivity of current approaches, peripheral blood (PB) is not a reliable source for identifying patients needing treatment changes. We sought to determine if high-throughput sequencing (HTS) (next-generation sequencing) of rearranged immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes can overcome this and be used to measure MRD in PB. PROCEDURE: We employed a quantitative HTS approach to accurately measure MRD from one million cell equivalents of DNA from 17 PB samples collected at day 29 after induction therapy in patients with precursor B-cell ALL. We compared these results to the gold-standard real-time PCR result obtained from their paired BM samples, median follow-up 49 months. RESULTS: With the increased sensitivity, detecting up to one abnormal cell in a million normal cells, we were able to detect MRD in the PB by HTS in all those patients requiring treatment intensification (MRD >/= 0.005% in BM). CONCLUSION: This is proof of principle that using the increased sensitivity of HTS, PB can be used to measure MRD and stratify children with ALL. The method is cost effective, rapid, accurate, and reproducible, with inherent advantages in children. Importantly, increasing the frequency testing by PB as opposed to intermittent BM sampling may allow extension of the dynamic range of MRD, giving a more complete picture of the kinetics of disease remission while improving relapse prediction and speed of detection.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Bartram, Jack', 'Wright, Gary', 'Adams, Stuart', 'Archer, Paul', 'Brooks, Tony', 'Edwards, Darren', 'Hancock, Jerry', 'Knecht, Henrik', 'Inglott, Sarah', 'Mountjoy, Edward', 'Roynane, Marie', 'Wakeman, Stephanie', 'Moppett, John', 'Hubank, Mike', 'Goulden, Nick']","['Bartram J', 'Wright G', 'Adams S', 'Archer P', 'Brooks T', 'Edwards D', 'Hancock J', 'Knecht H', 'Inglott S', 'Mountjoy E', 'Roynane M', 'Wakeman S', 'Moppett J', 'Hubank M', 'Goulden N']","['Depatment of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Cancer Section, Institute of Child Health, University College London, UK.', 'Depatment of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Depatment of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Bristol Genetics Laboratory, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, UK.', 'UCL Genomics, Institute of Child Health, University College London, UK.', 'Cancer Section, Institute of Child Health, University College London, UK.', 'Bristol Genetics Laboratory, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Depatment of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, UK.', 'Depatment of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Bristol Genetics Laboratory, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, UK.', 'Centre for Molecular Pathology, The Royal Marsden, Sutton, UK.', 'Depatment of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Trapehade, Monferran-Plaves, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211231,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'high-throughput sequencing', 'minimal residual disease', 'pediatrics']",2022/01/01 06:00,2022/01/01 06:00,['2021/12/31 08:41'],"['2021/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/31 08:41 [entrez]', '2022/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.29513 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec 31:e29513. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29513.,,,e29513,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1573-2506'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although successful results were obtained with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, several patients show resistance. For this reason, the identification of new strategies and therapeutic biomarkers represents an attractive goal. The role of Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels as possible drug targets has been elucidated in different types of cancer. Among natural compounds known to activate TRPs, cannabidiol (CBD) displays anti-cancer properties. By using FACS analysis, confocal microscopy, gene silencing and cell growth assay, we demonstrated that CBD, through TRPV2, inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle in CML cells. It promoted mitochondria dysfunction and mitophagy as shown by mitochondrial mass reduction and up-regulation of several mitophagy markers. These effects were associated with changes in the expression of OCT-4 and PU.1 markers regulated during cellular differentiation. Interestingly, a synergistic effect by combining CBD with the standard drug imatinib was found and imatinib-resistant cells remain susceptible to CBD effects. Therefore, the targeting of TRPV2 by using CBD, through the activation of mitophagy and the reduction in stemness, could be a promising strategy to enhance conventional therapy and improve the prognosis of CML patients.",['This article is protected by copyright.

With traditional therapies, patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) ALL have a survival that may be measured in months; in these patients, inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO) is an effective therapy. IO was linked to increased risk of veno-occlusive disease/sinusoid obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS), liver injury, and various grade of liver-related complications during clinical trials and real-life settings; however, hepatologic monitoring protocol is not established in this population. In our institution, 21 patients who received IO (median of 6 doses of IO administered) for R/R ALL were prospectively followed for hepatologic surveillance, including clinical evaluation, ultrasonography, and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) biochemistry. After a median follow-up of 17.2 months, two SOS events were reported (both after allogeneic transplant) as IO potentially related clinically relevant adverse event. Mild alterations were reported in almost the totality of patients and moderate-severe liver biochemical alterations in a quarter of patients. Within biochemicals value, AST and ALP showed an augment related to IO administration. LSM linearly augmented for each IO course administered. Baseline LSM was related to liver-related changes, especially with the severity of portal hypertension (PH)-related complications. Pre-transplant LSM was higher in patients receiving IO when compared with a control cohort. PH-related complications were discovered in nearly 77% of patients, with clinically significant PH occurrence and development of ascites in 38% and 14%, respectively. This prospective experience constitutes the rationale to design a hepatologic monitoring program in patients receiving IO. LSM may be of pivotal importance in this program, constituting a rapid and effective screening that quantitatively correlates with liver alterations.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

A total of 942 bone marrow (BM) samples from 123 infants were studied for MFC-MRD and FGT-MRD. In total, 383 samples (40.7%) were concordantly MRD-negative. MRD was detected by the two methods in 441 cases (46.8%); 99 samples (10.5%) were only FGT-MRD-positive and 19 (2.0%) were only MFC-MRD-positive. A final concordance rate of 87.4% was established. Most discordance occurred if residual leukaemia was present at levels close to the sensitivity limits. Neither the type of KMT2A fusion nor a new type of treatment hampering MFC methodology had an influence on the concordance rate. The prognostic value of MFC-MRD and FGT-MRD differed. MFC-MRD was able to identify a rapid response at early time-points, whereas FGT-MRD was a reliable relapse predictor at later treatment stages. Additionally, the most precise risk definition was obtained when combining the two methods. Because of the high comparability in results, these two rather simple and inexpensive approaches could be good options of high clinical value.",['(c) 2021 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Popov, Alexander', 'Tsaur, Grigory', 'Verzhbitskaya, Tatiana', 'Riger, Tatiana', 'Permikin, Zhan', 'Demina, Anna', 'Mikhailova, Ekaterina', 'Shorikov, Egor', 'Arakaev, Oleg', 'Streneva, Olga', 'Khlebnikova, Olga', 'Makarova, Olga', 'Miakova, Natalia', 'Fominikh, Veronika', 'Boichenko, Elmira', 'Kondratchik, Konstantin', 'Ponomareva, Natalia', 'Novichkova, Galina', 'Karachunskiy, Alexander', 'Fechina, Larisa']","['Popov A', 'Tsaur G', 'Verzhbitskaya T', 'Riger T', 'Permikin Z', 'Demina A', 'Mikhailova E', 'Shorikov E', 'Arakaev O', 'Streneva O', 'Khlebnikova O', 'Makarova O', 'Miakova N', 'Fominikh V', 'Boichenko E', 'Kondratchik K', 'Ponomareva N', 'Novichkova G', 'Karachunskiy A', 'Fechina L']","['National Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russian Federation.', ""Regional Children's Hospital, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation."", 'Research Institute of Medical Cell Technologies, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation.', 'Ural State Medical University, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation.', ""Regional Children's Hospital, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation."", 'Research Institute of Medical Cell Technologies, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation.', ""Regional Children's Hospital, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation."", ""Regional Children's Hospital, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation."", 'Ural State Medical University, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation.', ""Regional Children's Hospital, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation."", 'Research Institute of Medical Cell Technologies, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation.', 'National Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'PET-Technology Center of Nuclear Medicine, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation.', ""Regional Children's Hospital, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation."", ""Regional Children's Hospital, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation."", 'Research Institute of Medical Cell Technologies, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation.', ""Regional Children's Hospital, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation."", ""Regional Children's Hospital, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation."", 'National Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'National Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russian Federation.', ""City Children's Hospital numero sign1, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation."", ""Morozov Children's Hospital, Moscow, Russian Federation."", ""Republican Children's Hospital, Moscow, Russian Federation."", 'National Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'National Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russian Federation.', ""Regional Children's Hospital, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation."", 'Research Institute of Medical Cell Technologies, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211230,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['flow cytometry', 'fusion gene transcript', 'infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'minimal residual disease']",2022/01/01 06:00,2022/01/01 06:00,['2021/12/31 06:11'],"['2021/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/31 06:11 [entrez]', '2022/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.18021 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Br J Haematol. 2021 Dec 30. doi: 10.1111/bjh.18021.,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0889-6986', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9881-6221']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics, pregnancy outcomes and maternal and neonatal prognoses of 52 patients with P-AL collected from January 2013 to December 2020 in our center. Seventeen (32.7%) patients received chemotherapy during pregnancy (exposed cohort), while 35 (67.3%) received chemotherapy after abortion/delivery (nonexposed cohort). Twenty-six (50.0%) pregnancies ended with abortion, and 26 (50.0%) babies were born through spontaneous delivery or cesarean section. Seven infants (26.9%) were born in the exposed cohort, while 19 infants (73.1%) were born in the nonexposed cohort. Fetuses in the exposed cohort had lower gestational ages (P=0.030) and birth weights (P=0.049). Considering the safety of the fetus, seven patients in the exposed cohort received low-dose chemotherapy, one patient received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and one patient only received corticosteroids as induction therapy. Patients received low-dose chemotherapy as induction therapy had a lower complete remission (CR) rate (P=0.041), and more patients in this group received HSCT (P=0.010) than patients received intensive chemotherapy. Patients who delayed chemotherapy in the nonexposed cohort experienced a trend toward a higher mortality rate than patients who received timely chemotherapy (P=0.191). The CR (P = 0.488), OS (P=0.655), and DFS (P=0.453) were similar between the exposed and nonexposed cohorts. Overall, the 4-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were estimated at 49.1% and 57.8%, respectively. All newborns were living, without deformities, or developmental and intellectual disabilities. Our study indicated that P-AL patients in the first trimester might tend to receive chemotherapy after abortion. Both the status of disease and patients' willingness should be taken into consideration when clinicians were planning treatment strategies in the second or third trimester. Low-dose or delayed chemotherapy might decrease the efficacy of induction therapy and survival rate of patients, but HSCT could improve the prognosis.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Yang, Shan, Lu, Zhang, Li, Hu, Tian, Xu and Wu.']","['Wang, Peng', 'Yang, Zhen', 'Shan, Meng', 'Lu, Shenqi', 'Zhang, Luwei', 'Li, Shijia', 'Hu, Shuhong', 'Tian, Hong', 'Xu, Yang', 'Wu, Depei']","['Wang P', 'Yang Z', 'Shan M', 'Lu S', 'Zhang L', 'Li S', 'Hu S', 'Tian H', 'Xu Y', 'Wu D']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211214,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'fetal', 'maternal', 'outcome', 'pregnancy']",2022/01/01 06:00,2022/01/01 06:01,['2021/12/31 06:06'],"['2021/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/31 06:06 [entrez]', '2022/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.803994 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 14;11:803994. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.803994. eCollection 2021.,11,,803994,,,,PMC8712699,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pathologically, diffuse infiltration of round cells containing atypical nuclei with marked cleavage was observed mainly in the pancreas head, peripancreatic lymph nodes, spleen, bilateral lung, and bone marrow. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were negative for CD20, CD79a, CD3, CD5, c-kit, CD34, and TdT and positive for myeloperoxidase, CD33, CD68, and CD163. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed underexpression of CD11c and aberrant expression of CD56 in the monocyte subset. The peripheral blood smear showed an increase in monocytes and atypia in neutrophils and monocytes, as well as enlarged platelets and polychromatic erythroblasts. Hence, it was suggested that the myeloid sarcoma was derived from the acute transformation of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Myeloid sarcoma is an extramedullary-mass-forming hematologic malignancy that is difficult to diagnose, especially when the initial presentation is a pancreatic mass. However, early diagnosis is important for appropriate therapy. Although bone marrow examination could not be performed because of the patients' severe condition, the pathological specimen obtained with autopsy helped subtype the patient's leukemia.

Here, we describe a case of a 76-year-old Caucasian male patient who moved from California to Wisconsin with a history of coccidioidomycosis infection of the left knee that reactivated decades later in his prosthetic knee shortly after being initiated on ibrutinib (Imbruvica), a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). There have been some case reports regarding coccidioidomycosis infections after initiating ibrutinib therapy but none with a 50 year latency period before reactivation.

Comorbidities worsen clinical outcomes and are associated with lower quality of life among cancer patients. We aimed at estimating chronic disease comorbidities and associated factors among cancer patients attending oncology services at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QECH) and Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in Blantyre and Lilongwe respectively. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study at QECH and KCH in Malawi from January to March 2021. Participants were recruited using simple random sampling technique at the oncology clinics and were interviewed using structured questionnaires. The College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee (COMREC) approved the study and informed consent was obtained with each participant. Data were analyzed in Stata version 14 and summary statistics were presented as frequencies and proportions. Results: we interviewed 398 cancer patients and the mean age was 45.4years (SD+/- 12.77). The common cancers were cervical (30%), Kaposi s sarcoma (24%), breast (11%), esophageal (4%) and leukemia (4%). The prevalence of chronic disease comorbidities was 61.56% (n=398) and common conditions included: HIV and AIDS (43%), depression (9%) hypertension (8%) and anemia (9%). Chronic disease comorbidities were significantly associated with formal employment (p<0.01) and obesity (p<0.02).

A 12-year-old adolescent female patient recently diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia presented with fever and was hospitalized for antibiotic management after 22 days of being treated with a treatment protocol based on daunorubicin, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and prophylaxis with dexamethasone, the patient developed erythematous skin lesions located mostly on the extremities. Lesions evolved into painful subcutaneous nodules, and one lesion evolved into a 2.5-cm blister with a purple and necrotic base. A skin biopsy was performed and showed neutrophilic dermatosis which confirmed the diagnosis of SS. The patient's clinical features complied with criteria for differentiation syndrome complicated by shock. Two days after ATRA was suspended, the patient presented resolution of the fever and skin lesions. SS is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis secondary to an innate immune disorder classified into four categories: classical (idiopathic), para-inflammatory, paraneoplastic or pregnancy-related. SS has been described in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in adults secondary to the use of drugs such as ATRA or as a part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. SS can occur exceptionally in children with myeloid leukemia secondary to the use of drugs such as ATRA.","['Copyright 2021, Ramirez et al.']","['Ramirez Melo, Jorge Luis', 'Cruz Osorio, Rosa Margarita', 'Santoyo Cueva, Jessica', 'Sanchez Zubieta, Fernando', 'Chavez, Pablo Alejandro', 'Fernandez Mendoza, Luis Tonatiuh', 'Bustos Rodriguez, Felipe de Jesus', 'Burbano Figueroa, Christian David', 'Burbano Figueroa, Johana Alexandra']","['Ramirez Melo JL', 'Cruz Osorio RM', 'Santoyo Cueva J', 'Sanchez Zubieta F', 'Chavez PA', 'Fernandez Mendoza LT', 'Bustos Rodriguez FJ', 'Burbano Figueroa CD', 'Burbano Figueroa JA']","['Pediatric Department, Pediatric Oncology-Hematology Division, Hospital Civil de Guadalajara ""Dr. Juan I.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability was analyzed by trypan blue staining and automated counting of live and dead cells. Apoptosis was analyzed by FITC-Annexin V test. Oxidative stress was evaluated by the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protein-carbonyl products. RESULTS: Most combinations (alpha-TS plus anticancer drug) exerted additive or antagonistic effects on the proliferation and viability of leukemia lymphocytes. alpha-TS combined with barasertib, bortezomib or lonafarnib showed a strong synergistic cytotoxic effect, which was best expressed in the case of barasestib. It was accompanied by impressive induction of apoptosis and increased production of ROS, but insignificant changes in protein-carbonyl levels. alpha-TS plus barasertib did not alter the viability and did not induce oxidative stress and apoptosis in normal lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: alpha-TS could be a promising adjuvant in second-line anticancer therapy, particularly in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, to reduce the therapeutic doses of barasertib, bortezomib, and lonafarnib, increasing their effectiveness and minimizing their side effects.","['Copyright (c) 2022 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Ivanova, Donika', 'Zhelev, Zhivko', 'Zlateva, Genoveva', 'Lazarova, Dessislava', 'Yaneva, Zvezdelina', 'Panovska, Radmila', 'Aoki, Ichio', 'Bakalova, Rumiana']","['Ivanova D', 'Zhelev Z', 'Zlateva G', 'Lazarova D', 'Yaneva Z', 'Panovska R', 'Aoki I', 'Bakalova R']","['Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'Institute of Biophysics and Biomedical Engineering, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Sofia University ""St. Kliment Ohridski"", Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Sofia University ""St. Kliment Ohridski"", Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'National Institutes for Quantum Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Sofia University ""St. Kliment Ohridski"", Sofia, Bulgaria bakalova.rumiana@qst.go.jp.', 'National Institutes for Quantum Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'alpha-tocopheryl succinate', 'apoptosis', 'oxidative stress']",2022/01/01 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2021/12/31 05:50'],"['2021/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/31 05:50 [entrez]', '2022/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['42/1/547 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.15512 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2022 Jan;42(1):547-554. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.15512.,42,1,547-554,,,,,,,,,,,20220112,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Succinates)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Succinates/pharmacology', 'alpha-Tocopherol/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of comorbidities to predict patients' vulnerability toward immunochemotherapy has been well establish, especially since some of the tools commonly used to evaluate patients' fitness were employed to determine treatment eligibility in randomized trials. Nevertheless, is it still unclear how much fitness weights on treatment outcome with targeted agents and which assessment should be preferred. There are key differences in the toxicity profile between novel agents that are getting much more evident in retrospective, real-life experiences, rather than clinical trials. Therefore, an individual patient's comorbid medical conditions may be a deciding factor in therapy selection. Here, we analyze main evidence in literature on the predicting value of comorbidity assessment on outcome and management of CLL patients receiving novel agents.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Patients with primary or secondary antibody deficiency are at increased risk of persistent infection. This challenging clinical scenario is associated with adverse patient outcome and potentially creates an ecological niche for the evolution of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune evasion capacity. Case reports and/or series have implied a therapeutic role for convalescent plasma (CP) to secure virological clearance, although concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of CP and its potential to drive viral evolution, and it has largely been withdrawn from clinical use in the UK. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases in which persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection was cleared following administration of the monoclonal antibody combination casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2, Ronapreve). A 55-year-old male with follicular lymphoma, treated with B cell depleting therapy, developed SARS-CoV-2 infection in September 2020 which then persisted for over 200 days. He was hospitalised on four occasions with COVID-19 and suffered debilitating fatigue and malaise throughout. There was no clinical response to antiviral therapy with remdesivir or CP, and SARS-CoV-2 was consistently detected in nasopharyngeal swabs. Intrahost evolution of several spike variants of uncertain significance was identified by viral sequence analysis. Delivery of REGN-COV2, in combination with remdesivir, was associated with clinical improvement and viral clearance within 6 days, which was sustained for over 150 days despite immunotherapy for relapsed follicular lymphoma. The second case, a 68-year-old female with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia on ibrutinib, also developed persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite a lack of response to remdesivir, infection promptly cleared following REGN-COV2 in combination with remdesivir, accompanied by resolution of inflammation and full clinical recovery that has been maintained for over 290 days. CONCLUSIONS: These cases highlight the potential benefit of REGN-COV2 as therapy for persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection in antibody deficient individuals, including after failure of CP treatment. Formal clinical studies are warranted to assess the effectiveness of REGN-COV2 in antibody-deficient patients, especially in light of the emergence of variants of concern, such as Omicron, that appear to evade REGN-COV2 neutralisation.",['(c) 2021.

However, this notion in MDS has not been well proved. In our cohort of 287 MDS, patients with microMKs showed lower overall survival (OS) (HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.47-3.06; p = 0.000036) and higher risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolution (HR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.9-11.01; p = 0.00021). Results were validated with an independent cohort. In multivariate analysis, the presence of microMKs maintained its independent association with OS (HR, 1.54, 95% CI, 1.13-2.1, p = 0.0059) and AML transformation (HR, 2.28, 95% CI, 1.2-4.4, p = 0.014).

Conventional single-cell analysis methods typically provide only indirect, static phenotypic readouts.

Here, we describe an end-to-end deep learning platform, UPSIDE (Unsupervised Phenotypic State IDEntification), for discovering cell states and their dynamics from transmitted light movies. UPSIDE uses the variational auto-encoder architecture to learn latent cell representations, which are then clustered for state identification, decoded for feature interpretation, and linked across movie frames for transition rate inference. Using UPSIDE, we identified distinct blood cell types in a heterogeneous dataset. We then analyzed movies of patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia cells, from which we identified stem-cell associated morphological states as well as the transition rates to and from these states.

EZH2 catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3-lysine 27-trimethylated (H3K27me3). These epigenetic alterations silence the expression of the genes that suppress leukemogenesis. Reversal of this gene silencing by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, and by 3-deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep), an inhibitor of EZH2, results in synergistic gene reactivation and antileukemic interaction. The objective of this study is to determine if the addition of another epigenetic agent could further enhance the antileukemic action of these inhibitors of DNA and histone methylation. Vitamin C (Vit C) is reported to enhance the antineoplastic action of 5-Aza-CdR on AML cells. The mechanism responsible for this action of Vit C is due to its function as a cofactor of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (alpha-KGDD). The enhancement by Vit C of the catalytic activity of alpha-KGDD of the ten eleven translocation (TET) pathway, as well as of the Jumonji C histone demethylases (JHDMs), is shown to result in demethylation of DNA and histones, leading to reactivation of tumor suppressor genes and an antineoplastic effect. This action of Vit C has the potential to complement the antileukemic action of 5-Aza-CdR and DZNep. We observe that Vit C remarkably increases the antineoplastic activity of 5-Aza-CdR and DZNep against myeloid leukemic cells. An important step to bring this novel epigenetic therapy to clinical trial in patients with AML is the determination of its optimal dose schedule.",,"['Momparler, Richard L', 'Cote, Sylvie', 'Momparler, Louise F']","['Momparler RL', 'Cote S', 'Momparler LF']","['Departement de Pharmacologie-Physiologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Centre de Recherche, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210324,Switzerland,Epigenomes,Epigenomes,101736595,,['NOTNLM'],"['3-deazaneplanocin-A', ""5-aza-2'-deoxycytine"", 'DNA methylation', 'EZH2', 'chemotherapy', 'epigenetics', 'histone methylation', 'leukemia', 'vitamin C']",2021/12/31 06:00,2021/12/31 06:01,['2021/12/30 17:14'],"['2021/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/30 17:14 [entrez]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:01 [medline]']","['epigenomes5020007 [pii]', '10.3390/epigenomes5020007 [doi]']",epublish,Epigenomes. 2021 Mar 24;5(2). pii: epigenomes5020007. doi: 10.3390/epigenomes5020007.,5,2,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9186-6269'],"['Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal']",PMC8594729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Curative therapy of AML requires the complete eradication of the leukemic stem cells (LSCs). One aspect of LSCs that is poorly understood is their low frequency in the total population of leukemic cells in AML patients. After each cell division of LSCs, most of the daughter cells lose their capacity for self-renewal. Investigations into the role of Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations in AML provide some insight on the regulation of the proliferation of LSCs. The primary role of IDH is to convert isocitrate to alpha-keto-glutarate (alpha-KG). When IDH is mutated, it converts alpha-KG to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an inhibitor of the TET pathway and Jumonji-C histone demethylases (JHDMs). The demethylating action of these enzymes removes the epigenetic gene-silencing markers, DNA methylation, H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 and can lead to the differentiation of LSCs. This enzymatic action is blocked by 2-HG in mutated IDH (mut-IDH) AML patients, who can be induced into remission with antagonists of 2-HG. These observations suggest that there exists in cells a natural enzymatic mechanism that uses demethylation to reverse epigenetic gene-silencing, leading to a loss of the self-renewal capacity of LSCs. This mechanism limits the proliferative potential of LSCs. Epigenetic agents that inhibit DNA and histone methylation exhibit a synergistic antineoplastic action on AML cells. It is possible that the therapeutic potential of this epigenetic therapy may be enhanced by demethylation enzymes, resulting in a very effective treatment for AML.",,"['Momparler, Richard L', 'Cote, Sylvie', 'Momparler, Louise F']","['Momparler RL', 'Cote S', 'Momparler LF']","['Departement de pharmacologie-physiologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada.', ""Service d'hematologie-oncologie, Centre de recherche, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada."", ""Service d'hematologie-oncologie, Centre de recherche, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada."", ""Service d'hematologie-oncologie, Centre de recherche, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200301,Switzerland,Epigenomes,Epigenomes,101736595,,['NOTNLM'],"['3-deazaplanocin-A', ""5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine"", 'DNA methylation', 'epigenetics', 'histone methylation', 'leukemic stem cells', 'self-renewal']",2020/03/01 00:00,2020/03/01 00:01,['2021/12/30 17:13'],"['2020/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/30 17:13 [entrez]', '2020/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/01 00:01 [medline]']","['epigenomes4010003 [pii]', '10.3390/epigenomes4010003 [doi]']",epublish,Epigenomes. 2020 Mar 1;4(1). pii: epigenomes4010003. doi: 10.3390/epigenomes4010003.,4,1,,,,"['n/a/Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal']",PMC8594708,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCR-ABL oncoprotein is a key molecular basis for the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) via activation of several downstream signaling pathways including JAK/STAT pathway. Development of leukemia involves constitutive activation of signaling molecules including, JAK2, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B. Thymoquinone (TQ) is a bioactive constituent of Nigella sativa that has shown anticancer properties in various cancers. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of TQ on the expression of BCR ABL, JAK2, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B genes and their consequences on the cell proliferation and apoptosis in K562 CML cells. METHODS: BCR-ABL positive K562 CML cells were treated with TQ. Cytotoxicity was determined by Trypan blue exclusion assay. Apoptosis assay was performed by annexin V-FITC/PI staining assay and analyzed by flow cytometry. Transcription levels of BCR ABL, JAK2, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B genes were evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Protein levels of JAK2 and STAT5 were determined by Jess Assay analysis. RESULTS: TQ markedly decreased the cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in K562 cells (P < 0.001) in a concentration dependent manner. TQ caused a significant decrease in the transcriptional levels of BCR ABL, JAK2, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B genes (P < 0.001). TQ induced a significant decrease in JAK2 and STAT5 protein levels (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: our results indicated that TQ inhibited cell growth of K562 cells via downregulation of BCR ABL/ JAK2/STAT3 and STAT5 signaling and reducing JAK2 and STAT5 protein levels.",,"['Al-Rawashde, Futoon Abedrabbu', 'Wan Taib, Wan Rohani', 'Ismail, Imilia', 'Johan, Muhammad Farid', 'Al-Wajeeh, Abdullah Saleh', 'Al-Jamal, Hamid Ali Nagi']","['Al-Rawashde FA', 'Wan Taib WR', 'Ismail I', 'Johan MF', 'Al-Wajeeh AS', 'Al-Jamal HAN']","['School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Terengganu 21300, Malaysia.', 'School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Terengganu 21300, Malaysia.', 'School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Terengganu 21300, Malaysia.', 'Department of Haematology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan 16150, Malaysia.', 'Anti-Doping Lab Qatar, Doha, Qatar.', 'School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Terengganu 21300, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211201,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'BCR-ABL', 'CML', 'STAT', 'thymoquinone']",2021/12/31 06:00,2021/12/31 06:00,['2021/12/30 10:55'],"['2021/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/30 10:55 [entrez]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.12.3959 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Dec 1;22(12):3959-3965. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.12.3959.,22,12,3959-3965,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3701-4006', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6344-0220', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6194-2729']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant urate oxidase (RUO) is used in both the prophylaxis and treatment of TLS. However, in resource-constrained countries, its role is mostly limited to the treatment of established TLS and data regarding the use of RUO and its outcome is sparse. OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcome of Pediatric TLS following the use of a fixed - dose of RUO. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all children <15 years of age admitted in the Department of Paediatric Oncology, Kidwai Cancer Institute from April 2017 to July 2018 with TLS and treated with a single, fixed - dose (1.5 mg) RUO was undertaken. RESULTS: During the study period, 255 children with hemato-lymphoid malignancies were diagnosed to be at risk of developing TLS. Of these, only 22 (8.6%) children developed TLS and received RUO. Among those with TLS, 15 (68.2%) had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) while 7 (31.8%) had Non - Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 91% (20/22) children had spontaneous TLS and the remainder developed therapy-related TLS. Median age at presentation was 8 years (IQR 5.25,1.75) with 4.5:1 male: female ratio. The mean urate level at admission was 19.12 mg/dl (+/- 8mg/dl) (Range: 10.7-34.5). 91% (20/22) children received RUO at less than 0.15 mg/kg and the median dose of RUO was 0.05 mg/kg (IQR 0.038-0.08). Of the 22 children with TLS, 2 children failed to achieve normal serum urate levels at 24 hours in response to a single fixed-dose of RUO and hence received an extra dose of RUO. Serum urate levels remarkably declined following RUO administration from 19.12 mg/dl (+/-8) to 8.2 mg/dl (+/-3.9), 3.99 mg/dl (+/-1.6) and 2.84 mg/dl (+/-1.3) at 12h, 24h and 48h respectively. AKI was present in 15 (68.2%) children. The median eGFR of the group at diagnosis was 49 ml/min/1.73m2 (IQR 26.3, 70). None of the children required hemodialysis. No significant adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: Fixed-dose RUO can achieve rapid, adequate and sustained drop in serum urate levels in Paediatric TLS. It is a useful strategy for managing TLS in resource-constrained settings.",,"['L, Appaji', 'Reddy, Jyothi M', 'Chebbi, Pooja Gujjal', 'Kumar, Nuthan', 'Ar, Arun Kumar', 'M, Padma', 'B S, Aruna Kumari']","['L A', 'Reddy JM', 'Chebbi PG', 'Kumar N', 'Ar AK', 'M P', 'B S AK']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211201,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Tumour lysis syndrome', 'haematological malignancies', 'hyperuricemia', 'rasburicase', 'renal failure']",2021/12/31 06:00,2021/12/31 06:00,['2021/12/30 10:55'],"['2021/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/30 10:55 [entrez]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.12.3897 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Dec 1;22(12):3897-3901. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.12.3897.,22,12,3897-3901,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2669-8609'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we decided to study both lnRNA ANRIL and lnRNA SNHG14 gene expressions in patients with AML to better understand their role in AML risk development, clinical presentation, and prognosis. METHODS: The current prospective study included two hundred participants, 100 AML patients and 100 control subjects. Bone marrow analysis was made to all patients, in addition to gene expression molecular testing of both lnRNA ANRIL and lnRNA SNHG14. RESULTS: Both lnRNA SNHG14 and lnRNA ANRIL showed high expression levels in AML bone marrow samples compared to non-AML subjects and were remarkably associated with lower Complete Remission (OR: 3.449, 95% CI: 1.324-8.985, p=0.011 for ANRIL and OR: 3.955, 95% CI: 1.510-10.356, p=0.005 for SNHG14), Relapse Free Survival (HR=3.504, 95%CI: 1.662-7.387, p=0.001 for ANRIL and HR=4.094, 95%CI: 1.849-9.067, p=0.001 for SNHG14) and Overall Survival (HR=3.353, 95%CI: 1.434-7.839, p=0.005 for ANRIL and HR=3.094, 95%CI: 1.277-7.494, p=0.012 for SNHG14), favouring poor prognostic significance in AML.

However, the robustness of this assay requires a large multicenter validation and the assessment of its feasibility on bone marrow (BM) samples, as some centers may not have access to PB. METHODS: PB and/or BM samples from patients displaying monocytosis were assessed with the ""monocyte assay"" by 10 ELN iMDS Flow working group centers with harmonized protocols. The corresponding files were reanalyzed in a blind fashion and the cMo percentages obtained by both analyses were compared. Confirmed diagnoses were collected when available. RESULTS: The comparison between cMo percentages from 267 PB files showed a good global significant correlation (r = 0.88) with no bias. Confirmed diagnoses, available for 212 patients, achieved a 94% sensitivity and an 84% specificity. Hence, 95/101 CMML patients displayed cMo >/=94% while cMo <94% was observed in 83/99 patients with reactive monocytosis and in 10/12 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) with monocytosis. The established Receiver Operator Curve again provided a 94% cut-off value of cMo. The 117 BM files reanalysis led to an 87% sensitivity and an 80% specificity, with excellent correlation between the 43 paired samples to PB. CONCLUSIONS: This ELN multicenter study demonstrates the robustness of the monocyte assay with only limited variability of cMo percentages, validates the 94% cutoff value, confirms its high sensitivity and specificity in PB and finally, also confirms the possibility of its use in BM samples.",['(c) 2021 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Wagner-Ballon, Orianne', 'Bettelheim, Peter', 'Lauf, Jeroen', 'Bellos, Frauke', 'Della Porta, Matteo', 'Travaglino, Erica', 'Subira, Dolores', 'Lopez, Irene Nuevo', 'Tarfi, Sihem', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Johansson, Ulrika', 'Psarra, Katherina', 'Karathanos, Serafeim', 'Matarraz, Sergio', 'Colado, Enrique', 'Gupta, Monali', 'Ireland, Robin', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Van De Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['Wagner-Ballon O', 'Bettelheim P', 'Lauf J', 'Bellos F', 'Della Porta M', 'Travaglino E', 'Subira D', 'Lopez IN', 'Tarfi S', 'Westers TM', 'Johansson U', 'Psarra K', 'Karathanos S', 'Matarraz S', 'Colado E', 'Gupta M', 'Ireland R', 'Kern W', 'Van De Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Hematology and Immunology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University Hospital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.', 'Inserm U955 IMRB, Universite Paris-Est Creteil (UPEC), Creteil, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Ordensklinikum Linz Elisabethinen, Linz, Austria.', 'Department of Hematology, Ordensklinikum Linz Elisabethinen, Linz, Austria.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.', 'IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University Hospital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.', 'Inserm U955 IMRB, Universite Paris-Est Creteil (UPEC), Creteil, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory Medicine, SI-HMDS, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK.', 'Immunology Histocompatibility Dept, Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Immunology Histocompatibility Dept, Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Cancer Research Center (IBMCC-USAL/CSIC), Department of Medicine and Cytometry Service, University of Salamanca, Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL) and Biomedical Research Networking Centre Consortium of Oncology (CIBERONC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Service and AGC de Laboratorio de Medicina, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias and Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', ""Immunophenotyping, Department of Haematology and SE-HMDS, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."", ""Immunophenotyping, Department of Haematology and SE-HMDS, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."", 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211230,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Mutant IDH1/2 induce a block in differentiation and thereby contribute to the stemness and oncogenesis of their cells of origin. Recently, small-molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH1/2 have been Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of IDH1/2-mutated acute myeloid leukemia.

Conceptually, CPC-defining mutations are somatic alterations shared by the initial and relapsed tumours, mostly B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2)/immunoglobulin heavy locus (IGH) translocations and other recurrent gene mutations. Through complementary approaches for highly sensitive mutation detection, we do not find CPC-defining mutations in highly purified BCL2/IGH-negative haematopoietic progenitor cells in clinical remission samples from three patients with relapsed FL. Instead, we find cells harbouring the same BCL2/IGH translocation but lacking CREB binding protein (CREBBP), lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and other recurrent gene mutations. Thus, (i) the BCL2/IGH translocation can precede CPC-defining mutations in human FL, and (ii) BCL2/IGH-translocated cells can persist in clinical remission.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Next, scFv optimization studies for CD19, CD38, HER2, GD2 or EGFR were overviewed, showing that tuning the affinity of scFv could alleviate the on-target/off-tumor toxicity. The affinities of scFvs for different antigens were also summarized to designate a relatively optimal working range for CAR design. Last, a synthetic biology approach utilizing a low-affinity synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor to achieve ultrasensitivity of antigen-density discrimination and murine models to assay the on-target/off-tumor toxicity of CARs were highlighted.

It primarily affects older people (median age at diagnosis ~72 years). There are many challenges encountered in its treatment. One striking issue is the lack of strong clinical evidence from large randomized clinical trials for treating this disease. Another issue is that patients with CMML have highly variable outcomes with current treatments. Additional challenges include a wider application of current knowledge, an improved understanding of pathogenesis, development of new therapies, and management of refractory cases/disease progression. It is clear that there is still progress to be made. Here, we review the available first-line treatment options for advanced CMML. Emphasis has been placed on choosing between hypomethylating agents and cytotoxic treatments, on the basis on disease-specific and patient-specific characteristics.

FS is a diagnosis of exclusion, which poses a challenge for the clinician since accurate diagnosis is required to treat this condition effectively. A 52-year-old woman with a 15-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was admitted due to dyspnea and pain in the right ankle and left arm for two weeks. She was hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Physical examination revealed right ankle swelling and tenderness, left forearm tenderness, abdominal distension, and swan-neck finger deformities. Laboratory tests were notable for pancytopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2900 x 10(3)/muL (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1800/muL). Rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide tests were positive. Synovial fluid analysis of the right ankle showed no crystals or bacteria, and a WBC count of 192 x 10(3)/muL. Left upper extremity computed tomography (CT) revealed two abscesses, in the forearm and elbow, respectively. CT chest and abdomen revealed a wedge-shaped consolidation in the left upper lobe, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, and splenomegaly. Abdominal ultrasonography showed portal hypertension with no clear findings of cirrhosis. Blood cultures were negative. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography showed no vegetation. Incision and drainage were performed for the right ankle swelling, and left forearm and elbow abscesses. Left forearm abscess culture revealed Staphylococcus hemolyticus. Transbronchial needle aspiration and culture of the left upper lobe lesion showed acute and chronic inflammation with no signs of malignancy or microbial growth. Repeat TTE and blood cultures were negative. Bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry showed no evidence of large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia. The patient was diagnosed with FS complicated by disseminated infections and pulmonary necrobiotic nodules. Empiric ceftriaxone and vancomycin were initiated. The patient was discharged after the resolution of her symptoms. FS is a rare extra-articular presentation of RA with a triad of a > 10-year history of RA, neutropenia (ANC < 2000/muL), and splenomegaly. IE can also present with disseminated infections and splenomegaly. Repeat TTE and blood cultures were performed due to concerns regarding the high mortality rate of IE and the possibility of false-negative echocardiography results. LGL leukemia also presents with RA and neutropenia, which was deemed less likely in our patient based on unremarkable bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry results. FS is a rare condition. Therefore, it is important to keep its possibility in mind in the setting of RA while performing workup for the most likely conditions.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Hoshina et al.']","['Hoshina, Yoji', 'Teaupa, Siale', 'Chang, Derek']","['Hoshina Y', 'Teaupa S', 'Chang D']","['Department of Neurology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Utah, School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Utah, School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20211226,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['academic rheumatology', 'diferential diagnosis', 'differential diagnostic process', 'physical diagnosis', 'rheumatology & autoimmune diseases']",2021/12/31 06:00,2021/12/31 06:01,['2021/12/30 05:41'],"['2021/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/30 05:41 [entrez]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.20713 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Dec 26;13(12):e20713. doi: 10.7759/cureus.20713. eCollection 2021 Dec.,13,12,e20713,,,,PMC8710312,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML patients' RNA sequencing data as well as clinical characteristics were obtained from the public TARGET database. Then, differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in female and male AML samples. By adopting univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, AML patients' survival was predicted by a seven-lncRNA signature. It was found that 95 abnormal expressed lncRNAs existed in AML. Then, the analysis of multivariate Cox regression showed that, among them, 7 (LINC00461, RP11-309M23.1, AC016735.2, RP11-61I13.3, KIAA0087, RORB-AS1, and AC012354.6) had an obvious prognostic value, and according to their cumulative risk scores, these 7 lncRNA signatures could independently predict the AML patients' overall survival.

The identification of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of B-ALL can contribute to the development of novel therapeutic methods and drugs, which can improve the survival outcomes of patients with B-ALL. The present study aimed to identify downregulated circular RNAs (circRNAs) in patients with B-ALL. RNA sequencing was performed to construct the circRNA expression profiles in B-ALL cells and normal human lymphoblasts. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery was used to perform Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR analysis was performed to detect the expression levels of the downregulated circRNAs. A total of 263 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified, including 76 upregulated and 187 downregulated circRNAs, respectively. The upregulated circRNAs were mainly enriched in 'macromolecule modification', 'protein modification' and 'cellular protein modification processes', while the downregulated circRNAs were mainly enriched in the 'negative regulation of RNA biosynthetic processes', 'natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity' and 'viral carcinogenesis'. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that two of the downregulated circRNAs (hsa_circ_0000745 and chr15:87949594-87966067-), identified during microarray analysis were also significantly downregulated in Ball-1 cells and B-ALL bone marrow samples.

The purpose of this review is to outline the most recent venetoclax-based combination therapies in newly diagnosed or relapsed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML patients. RECENT FINDING: Venetoclax has been incorporated in various therapeutic regimens - either with chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapies. These combinations achieve high remission rates with deep molecular responses, as suggested by measurable residual disease measurements. There are concerns regarding the incomplete count recovery, prolonged cytopenia and infection rates, especially when combined with chemotherapy. There is also limited data concerning durability of these remissions, and the effectiveness in high-risk population (i.e. p53-mutated AML patients). SUMMARY: Venetoclax-based combination therapies encompass novel therapeutic possibilities in MDS and AML with encouraging initial results. However, the exact role of each combination therapy and the long-term effects on patients' outcome are yet to be defined.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

How these stressors are successfully managed determines how well these caregivers adapt to the illness situation over time. Previous studies suggest that caregivers will adapt gradually to the adverse consequences of caring for their child with a long-term illness. However, studies of the psychological adaptation process of family caregivers of children with leukemia are limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to study the psychological adaptation process of the parent caregivers of pediatric leukemia patients. METHODS: In this qualitative study, we interviewed 32 caregivers of children with leukemia in China. Data were collected through semistructured interviews and analyzed using the content analysis method. RESULTS: The psychological adaptation process in caregivers of pediatric leukemia patients seems to involve 5 stages: initial devastation, accumulation of hope, fluctuation in feelings, integration, and psychological adaptation. Significant emotional changes were observed at each stage. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified commonalities in the psychological adaptation process experienced by caregivers of children with leukemia in the Chinese social and cultural context. It also characterized the different emotions that the caregivers had in the 5 stages of adaptation. In addition, our research identified the possible psychological interventions at different stages. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The study described the adaptation process of Chinese parents of children with leukemia. The findings of this study will help nurses identify main coping resources, controllable intervention factors, and the timing of intervention for these caregivers of children with leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A dearth of information exists on how symptoms differ by individual factors such as age and gender. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to describe symptoms in AYAs across 5 cancer diagnostic groups by the individual factors of age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and time since diagnosis; and then to describe symptoms based on these individual factors within diagnostic groups. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of baseline data pooled from 2 multisite studies on symptoms in AYAs with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, brain cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and sarcoma. Symptoms were assessed using the Computerized Symptom Capture Tool. RESULTS: Data from 118 AYAs with cancer, aged 13 to 29 years, were analyzed. Eight of the most commonly reported symptoms were reported in at least 4 diagnostic groups. Across diagnostic groups, symptoms varied little based on individual factors. Within groups, certain symptoms differed in frequency by individual factors. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of major differences in symptom prevalence based on individual factors across diagnostic groups supports a heterogeneous approach to symptom research with AYAs. The study identified individual factors within diagnostic groups worthy of further exploration. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Providers can facilitate discussions with AYAs about symptoms by being aware of common symptoms that may occur in certain cancer diagnostic groups and based on individual factors. The significance of the individual symptom experience should not be underestimated, emphasizing the importance of person-centered symptom assessment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate this potential in hMSCs from AML patients (hMSCs-AML) and whether it is associated with BMP4 expression. The results showed that bone formation potential in vivo was reduced in hMSCs-AML compared to hMSCs from healthy donors (hMSCs-HD). Moreover, the fact that hMSCs-AML were not able to develop supportive haematopoietic cells or to differentiate into osteocytes suggests possible changes in the bone marrow microenvironment. Furthermore, the expression of BMP4 was decreased, indicating a lack of gene expression committed to the osteogenic lineage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The incidence and nature of thyroid disease (hypothyroidism, thyroiditis, and thyroid can-cer) were studied in children-survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) being in remission from 6 to 25 years.The distribution of patients by leukemia subtypes was as follows: <<common>> - 67.4 %, pre-B - 23.9 %, pro-B andT-cell - 4.3 %. Children had been receiving chemo- and radiotherapy according to the protocol. Regarding the ageof patients at the time of ALL diagnosis the prepubertal, pubertal and postpubertal periods were taken into account.The endocrine diseases in family history, body weight at birth, serum content of free thyroxine, pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone, cortisol, iron, ferritin and thyroperoxidase antibodies were evaluated and assayed. RESULTS: Thyroid disease in children was emerging in the first 2-3 years after the ALL treatment with an incidenceof 22.8 % (hypothyroidism - 14.1 %, autoimmune thyroiditis - 7.6 %, papillary cancer - 1.1 %). Seven children inthis group had received radiotherapy (12-18 Gy doses) on the central nervous system (CNS). No correlation wasfound between the radiation exposure event itself, radiation dose to the CNS and thyroid disease in the long-termfollow-up period. Thyroid cancer had developed in a child 11 years upon chemo- and radiotherapy. Hypothyroidismwas more often diagnosed in the patients of prepubertal age (rs = 0.49). There were endocrine diseases in thefamily history in about a half of children, being significantly higher than in the general sample (small er, Cyrillic < 0.05). The bodyweight at birth of a child who had later developed hypothyroidism was less than in children having got thyroiditis(rs = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Disorders in endocrine regulation and of thyroid in particular can affect the prognosis of blood can-cer course in the long-term follow-up in children, especially in prepubertal age, which requires systematic supervi-sion by hematologist and endocrinologist.","['V.

METHODS: Analysis was performed in the main group of 34 CLL patients irradiated due to the Chornobyl NPP acci-dent (30 clean-up workers, and 4 evacuees) and in the control group of 27 non-irradiated CLL patients. Groups ofpatients were comparable by age, sex, stage of disease, mutational status of IGHV genes. Expression of the main andalternative transcripts of SORL1 gene was evaluated by Quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TheIGHV gene mutational status, TP53 and SF3B1 mutations were studied by PCR followed by direct sequencing. Data wereanalyzed with the SPSS software package, version 20.0. RESULTS: Relative expression level of the main transcript of SORL1 gene was low (mean 1.71 +/- 0.55, median 0.57),did not correlate with the IGHV gene mutational status, TP53 and SF3B1 mutations, stage of disease. The expressionof B transcript was not detected, F transcript was expressed at a very low level in 9 patients. The average relativeexpression level of SORL1-Delta2 transcript was 14.1 +/- 6.04 (median 3.48; range 0.01-90.51). The expression of SORL1-Delta2transcript above the median was more frequent among patients on C stage (p = 0.001), and in patients with unmu-tated IGHV genes was associated with an extremely negative course of CLL (median of overall survival 9 months vs61 months at low expression). Relative expression levels of the main and alternative transcripts of SORL1 gene inpatients of the main and the control groups did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggest that increased expression of SORL1-Delta2 transcript in CLL patients withunmutated IGHV genes can be considered as a negative prognostic marker.","['I. V.

Using the Comet assay, the relative level ofDNA damage was evaluated. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase (small er, Cyrillic < 0.001) in the level of DNA damage in PBL culture of conditionallyhealthy individuals after co-cultivation with malignant cells of CLL patients was observed. After irradiation, a drop in the level of cells with a high degree of DNA damage was noted, which was connected with an increase in the frequency of cells that were delayed in division at the S stage of the cell cycle. An increase in apoptotic activity in cultures of bystander cells was observed in all variants of the experiment (small er, Cyrillic < 0.001).

To guide its use, it is important to understand the factors that could lead to false-positive or negative results, such as inappropriate release and inadequate clearance of HBP. HBP is presumably released only by neutrophils, and the organs responsible for its elimination are unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine whether non-neutrophil cells can be a source of circulating HBP and which organs are responsible for its removal. We found that in two cohorts of neutropenic patients, 12% and 19% of patients in each cohort, respectively, had detectable plasma HBP levels. In vitro, three leukemia-derived monocytic cell lines and healthy CD14+ monocytes constitutively released detectable levels of HBP. When HBP was injected intravenously in rats, we found that plasma levels of HBP decreased rapidly, with a distribution half-life below 10 min and an elimination half-life of 1-2 h. We measured HBP levels in the liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, and urine using both ELISA and immunofluorescence quantitation, and found that the majority of HBP was present in the liver, and a small amount was present in the spleen. Immunofluorescence imaging indicated that HBP is associated mainly with hepatocytes in the liver and monocytes/macrophages in the spleen. The impact of hematologic malignancies and liver diseases on plasma HBP levels should be explored further in clinical studies.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by S.

Mutations result in protein changes that orchestrate growth alterations characteristic of leukemia. Proteomics is a methodology appropriate for study of protein changes found in leukemia. The high-throughput reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technology is particularly well-suited for the assessment of protein changes in samples derived from clinical trials. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the technical, methodological, and analytical issues related to the successful development of acute leukemia RPPAs. EXPERT COMMENTARY: To obtain representative protein sample lysates, samples should be prepared from freshly collected blood or bone marrow material. Variables such as sample shipment, transit time, and holding temperature only have minimal effects on protein expression. CellSave preservation tubes are preferred for cells collected after exposure to chemotherapy, and incorporation of standardized guidelines for antibody validation is recommended. A more systematic biological approach to analyze protein expression is desired, searching for recurrent patterns of protein expression that allow classification of patients into risk groups, or groups of patients that may be treated similarly. Comparing RPPA protein analysis between cell lines and primary samples shows that cell lines are not representative of patient proteomic patterns.",,"['Hoff, Fieke W', 'Horton, Terzah M', 'Kornblau, Steven M']","['Hoff FW', 'Horton TM', 'Kornblau SM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, TX, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211229,England,Expert Rev Proteomics,Expert review of proteomics,101223548,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'RPPA', 'acute leukemia', 'classification', 'methodology', 'network-based approach', 'proteomics', 'sample handling']",2021/12/30 06:00,2021/12/30 06:00,['2021/12/29 17:10'],"['2021/12/29 17:10 [entrez]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14789450.2021.2020655 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Expert Rev Proteomics. 2021 Dec 29:1-11. doi: 10.1080/14789450.2021.2020655.,,,1-11,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7128-1255'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mtDNA copy numbers, TFAM, POLG, and c-myc gene expression were significantly higher in ALL patients than controls (all p-values< 0.01). Gene Expression of PGC-1alpha was higher in tumor samples. The analysis of the correlation between PGC-1alpha expression and morphology parameters i.e., both M/C ratio and cristae cross-sectional area revealed a positive trend (r = 0.3, p = 0.1). The increased area occupied by mitochondria and increased cristae area support the occurrence of cristae remodelling in ALL.

Recently, some case reports have described the association of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) with MGUS, even with a relatively low monoclonal immunoglobulin burden. T large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by clonal expansion of T large granular lymphocytes, which is rare in China. There are some reports about T-LGL leukemia in patients with B-cell lymphoma; however, it is very rare that T-LGLL coexists with MGUS and clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (CB-LPD). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old man was hospitalized because of anemia. He was diagnosed with MGUS, CB-LPD, and PRCA. During the development of the disease, a group of abnormal T lymphocytes was detected by flow cytometry of peripheral blood. DIAGNOSIS: Combining clinical manifestations with the result of T cell receptor gene rearrangement and immunophenotype, it was consistent with the diagnosis of T large granular lymphocyte leukemia. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treat with bortezomib and dexamethasone regimen, Rituximab and sirolimus. OUTCOMES: The patient was transfusion independent after therapies. LESSONS: We report a patient with 4 concomitant hematological disorders: T-LGLL, MGUS, CB-LPD, and PRCA, aiming to represent the clinical and flow cytometry characteristics of these concomitant diseases, analyze the mechanism between diseases, and provide a clinical reference.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

METHODS: We reviewed the immunophenotype, karyotype, and mutations at the time of initial diagnosis and relapse of adults with AML with KMT2A rearrangement in our institution between 2007 and 2020. RESULTS: We identified 102 patients: 44 men and 58 women with a median age of 52 years (range, 18-87). Forty-three patients were considered to be therapy-related. Twenty-four out of 64 patients relapsed from complete remission after induction therapy, 34 had persistent/progressive disease, and 58 patients died with a median overall survival of 17 months. We detected five immunophenotypes: immature monocytic (38%); myelomonocytic (22%); myeloblastic (22%); mature monocytic (10%); and acute promyelocytic (APL)-like (8%). By chromosomal breakpoints, we presumed 11 different partners; t(9;11) (p22;q23)/MLLT3-KMT2A was the most common rearrangement (n = 56, 55%), followed by t(6;11) (q27;q23)/AFDN-KMT2A (n = 13,13%). Patients with t(6;11) (q27;q23)/AFDN-KMT2A preferentially showed a myeloblastic phenotype (p = 0.026). Mutations were detected in 39/64 (61%) cases, and RAS pathway (NRAS/KRAS/PTPN11) was involved in 26/64 (41%) cases. None of the APL-like cases had mutations detected. At the time of disease relapse, 10/24 (42%) showed major immunophenotypic change, and 7/10 cases gained additional cytogenetic and/or molecular alterations. CONCLUSION: The immunophenotype of AML with KMT2A rearrangement is more diverse than previously recognized, with a substantial subset showing no evidence of monocytic differentiation.

METHODS: One hundred thirty-seven subjects at our institution were diagnosed with excess blasts (EB)-1, EB-2, and acute myeloid leukemia with a low blast count (20%-30%). The immunophenotypes of progenitor cells in their bone marrow (BM) were determined by CD45-gating flow cytometry. A false-positive reaction to CD41 was eliminated by examining the flow cytometry data of lymphocytes and monocytes in addition to progenitors and by examining CD42b in histological sections. The characteristics were compared between CD41+ and CD41- MDS patients. RESULTS: Forty-three patients (31%) were CD41+. Additionally, 91% of the CD41+ MDS patients were very high-risk defined by the Revised International Prognostic Score System, which was higher than in patients with CD41- MDS (p = 0.015). Approximately 60% of the CD41+ MDS patients had a monosomal karyotype and very poor cytogenetics, which was higher than in CD41- MDS patients (p < 0.001). Normal cytogenetics was less common in CD41+ patients (p = 0.0016). Blasts with bleb formation were more abundant in CD41+ MDS patients (p = 0.026). All CD41+ MDS patients were positive for CD13 and were mostly positive for CD33.

We hypothesized that integrated germline sequencing could improve clinical interpretation and enhance the identification of germline variants with significant hereditary risks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumors from pediatric patients with high-risk, extracranial solid malignancies were sequenced with a targeted panel of cancer-associated genes. Later, germline DNA was analyzed for a subset of these genes. We performed a post hoc analysis to identify how an integrated analysis of tumor and germline data would improve clinical interpretation. RESULTS: One hundred sixty participants with both tumor-only and germline sequencing reports were eligible for this analysis. Germline sequencing identified 38 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants among 35 (22%) patients. Twenty-five (66%) of these were included in the tumor sequencing report. The remaining germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were single-nucleotide variants filtered out of tumor-only analysis because of population frequency or copy-number variation masked by additional copy-number changes in the tumor. In tumor-only sequencing, 308 of 434 (71%) single-nucleotide variants reported were present in the germline, including 31% with suggested clinical utility. Finally, we provide further evidence that the variant allele fraction from tumor-only sequencing is insufficient to differentiate somatic from germline events. CONCLUSION: A paired approach to analyzing tumor and germline sequencing data would be expected to improve the efficiency and accuracy of distinguishing somatic mutations and germline variants, thereby facilitating the process of variant curation and therapeutic interpretation for somatic reports, as well as the identification of variants associated with germline cancer predisposition.",['(c) 2021 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Schienda, Jaclyn', 'Church, Alanna J', 'Corson, Laura B', 'Decker, Brennan', 'Clinton, Catherine M', 'Manning, Danielle K', 'Imamovic-Tuco, Alma', 'Reidy, Deirdre', 'Strand, Gianna R', 'Applebaum, Mark A', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'DuBois, Steven G', 'Glade-Bender, Julia L', 'Kang, Wenjun', 'Kim, AeRang', 'Laetsch, Theodore W', 'Macy, Margaret E', 'Maese, Luke', 'Pinto, Navin', 'Sabnis, Amit J', 'Schiffman, Joshua D', 'Colace, Susan I', 'Volchenboum, Samuel L', 'Weiser, Daniel A', 'Nowak, Jonathan A', 'Lindeman, Neal I', 'Janeway, Katherine A', 'Crompton, Brian D', 'Kamihara, Junne']","['Schienda J', 'Church AJ', 'Corson LB', 'Decker B', 'Clinton CM', 'Manning DK', 'Imamovic-Tuco A', 'Reidy D', 'Strand GR', 'Applebaum MA', 'Bagatell R', 'DuBois SG', 'Glade-Bender JL', 'Kang W', 'Kim A', 'Laetsch TW', 'Macy ME', 'Maese L', 'Pinto N', 'Sabnis AJ', 'Schiffman JD', 'Colace SI', 'Volchenboum SL', 'Weiser DA', 'Nowak JA', 'Lindeman NI', 'Janeway KA', 'Crompton BD', 'Kamihara J']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia/University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Center for Research Informatics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia/University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", ""Children's Hospital Colorado and University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO."", 'Division of Pediatrics (Pediatric Hematology and Oncology University of Utah), Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, San Francisco, CA.', 'Division of Pediatrics (Pediatric Hematology and Oncology University of Utah), Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and BMT, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Cellular Therapy, Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, NY."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211222,United States,JCO Precis Oncol,JCO precision oncology,101705370,,,,2021/12/30 06:00,2021/12/30 06:01,['2021/12/29 05:39'],"['2021/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/29 05:39 [entrez]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1200/PO.21.00281 [doi]', 'PO.21.00281 [pii]']",epublish,JCO Precis Oncol. 2021 Dec 22;5. pii: PO.21.00281. doi: 10.1200/PO.21.00281. eCollection 2021.,5,,,,,,PMC8710335,,"['Alanna J.

It can include altered mental status, fever, critical electrolyte derangements, and coagulopathies. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this simulation was created as a telesimulation in order to adhere to mandatory physical distancing guidelines while addressing learning objectives. Methods: This simulation was designed for pediatric emergency medicine fellows and featured a pediatric patient presenting with fever, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. After an initial assessment and appropriate workup, the patient developed tumor lysis syndrome, coagulopathies, and new-onset neurologic changes requiring appropriate interventions. A debriefing guide and participant evaluation form were utilized. Results: This telesimulation was implemented at five different institutions, with evaluation surveys completed by 22 pediatric emergency medicine fellows. The scenario was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) and was generally well received, with participants rating the simulation as effective in teaching the recognition (M = 4.8) and management (M = 4.6) of hyperleukocytosis. Participants felt that virtual telesimulation was effective compared to other distance learning methods (M = 3.9). Discussion: This simulation-based curriculum allows learners to practice identifying and managing hyperleukocytosis. We found that it was well received in both in-person and virtual formats.",['(c) 2021 Koff et al.'],"['Koff, Abby', 'Burns, Rebekah', 'Auerbach, Marc', 'Lee, Brittany', 'Pearce, Jean', 'Ciener, Daisy', 'Augenstein, Julie', 'Yeung, Claudia', 'Thomas, Anita']","['Koff A', 'Burns R', 'Auerbach M', 'Lee B', 'Pearce J', 'Ciener D', 'Augenstein J', 'Yeung C', 'Thomas A']","[""Pediatrics Resident, Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine and Seattle Children's Hospital."", 'Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Division of Emergency Medicine, and Associate Director of the Pediatric Clerkship Outpatient Core, University of Washington School of Medicine.', 'Professor of Pediatrics (Emergency Medicine) and Emergency Medicine, Yale Medical School; Director of Pediatric Simulation, Yale Center for Medical Simulation.', ""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Fellow, Seattle Children's Hospital."", 'Assistant Professor, Division of Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin.', 'Program Director of the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Fellowship and Assistant Professor of Clinical Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center.', ""Base Hospital Medical Director, Quality and Safety Medical Director, and Attending Physician, Phoenix Children's Hospital; Clinical Assistant Professor of Child Health and Emergency Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science and University of Arizona College of Medicine."", ""Associate Program Director, Pediatric Emergency Medicine Fellowship, Phoenix Children's Hospital; Clinical Assistant Professor, University of Arizona School of Medicine - Phoenix; Clinical Assistant Professor, Creighton University School of Medicine; Clinical Instructor, Mayo School of Medicine; Adjunct Clinical Assistant Professor, A.

The aim of this review is to document all the reported cases of adenoviral infection is patients having undergone bone marrow transplantation (BMT). A comprehensive literature search of the databases Pubmed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar was conducted to identify all the case reports of adenoviral infections in BMT patients. A total of 30 articles with 44 patients were included. The most common underlying condition was acute lymphocytic leukemia (23%) followed by acute myeloid leukemia (18%). The most common site of infection was disseminated (50%), followed by liver infection (8%) and hemorrhagic cystitis (8%). Cidofovir was administered in 40.9% of the cases, and death was reported in 34.4% of them. Ribavirin was administered as monotherapy in 15.9% of patients, with a mortality rate of 57.1%. We found that the antiviral drug option had no statistically significant effect on the mortality rate (p=0.242). Also, the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was not associated with an improved outcome (p=0.523). There was, however, a statistically significant difference in the outcome based on the site of infection (p=0.005), with a higher rate of mortality in the disseminated and gastrointestinal cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review documenting all the cases of adenoviral infections in BMT patients.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate DNR-induced cell death signaling pathways in CML cell lines K562 and KU812. DNR-triggered apoptosis in K562 cells was characterized by inhibition of MCL1 expression, while restoration of MCL1 expression protected K562 cells from DNR-mediated cytotoxicity. In addition, DNR induced NOX4-dependent ROS production, leading to the activation of p38 MAPK and inactivation of Akt and ERK. Activated p38 MAPK stimulated protein phosphatase 2A-dependent dephosphorylation of CREB. Since Akt-mediated activation of ERK reduced beta-TrCP mRNA stability, the inactivation of Akt-ERK axis increased beta-TrCP expression, which in turn promoted proteasomal degradation of Sp1. Inhibition of CREB phosphorylation and Sp1 expression simultaneously reduced MCL1 transcription and protein expression. DNR-induced MCL1 suppression was not reliant on its ability to induce DNA damage. In addition, DNR induced the expression of drug exporter ABCB1 in K562 cells through the p38 MAPK/NFkappaB-mediated pathway, while imatinib or ABT-199 inhibited the DNR-induced effect. The combination of imatinib or ABT-199 with DNR showed synergistic cytotoxicity in K562 cells by increasing intracellular DNR retention. Cumulatively, our data indicate that DNR induces MCL1 downregulation in K562 cells by promoting p38 MAPK-mediated dephosphorylation of CREB and inhibiting the Akt-ERK axis-mediated Sp1 protein stabilization. Furthermore, experimental evidence indicates that DNR-induced death of KU812 cells occurs through a similar pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Clinically, DNA demethylating drug decitabine (DAC) combined with traditional chemotherapies reveals better efficacy on AML patients than the conventional chemotherapies alone. Our previous results revealed that human SH3-domain-binding glutamic acid-rich protein-like protein (SH3BGRL) plays a tumor suppressive role in AML but whether there is a connection between DAC and SH3BGRL expression remains elusive. METHODS: Here, we tentatively treated AML cell lines U937, MV4, and HL-60 with DAC and Western Blots. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of SH3BGRL. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined using Annexin V/7-AAD staining. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot were used to determine the expression of SH3BGRL mRNA and protein. Methylation-specific PCR was used to quantify the DNA methylation in AML cell lines. RESULTS: DAC had cytotoxicity in HL-60, MV4, and U937. In U937 cell lines, treatment with DAC showed the up-regulation of caspase, PARP, and SH3BGRL. Upon treatment, up-regulation of SH3BGRL mRNA and protein was dose-dependent and this activity was partially inhibited in endogenous SH3BGRL knockdown cell lines. CONCLUSION: Thus, our results demonstrated a possibly cytotoxic role of DAC on AML cells by upregulation of SH3BGRL expression at epigenetic modulation level and the methylation status in the SH3BGRL promoter region could be a supplemental diagnostic marker to the precise administration of DAC to AML patients.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Chen, Xiaomin', 'Liu, Fengqi', 'Rong, Dade', 'Xu, Limei', 'Tong, Xiuzhen', 'Wang, Haihe']","['Chen X', 'Liu F', 'Rong D', 'Xu L', 'Tong X', 'Wang H']","['Department of hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Department of hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Department of hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Department of hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211228,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,IM,['NOTNLM'],,2021/12/30 06:00,2021/12/30 06:00,['2021/12/29 05:23'],"['2021/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/29 05:23 [entrez]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-119728 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520622666211228110630 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2021 Dec 28. pii: ACAMC-EPUB-119728. doi: 10.2174/1871520622666211228110630.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, molecular insights into the molecular interactions between an immune checkpoint leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor b4 (LILRB4) and its mAb h128-3 was explored using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for the biomimetic design of peptide inhibitor of LILRB4. Both hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction were found favorable for the binding of the mAb h128-3 on LILRB4, and hydrophobic interaction was identified as the main driving force. The key amino acid residues for the binding of mAb h128-3 on LILRB4 were identified as Y93, D94, D106, Y34, S103, W107, Y61, N30, E27, Y33, Y59, W95, S92 through MM-PBSA (molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) method. Based on this, an inhibitor library with the sequence of SXDXYXSY (Where X is an arbitrary amino acid residue) were designed. Two peptide inhibitors, SADHYHSY and SVDWYHSY were obtained through screening using molecular docking and MD simulations, and then validated by successful blocking of LILRB4 through the covering of LILRB4 surface by these inhibitors.

The aim of this study was to identify laboratory biomarkers that predict which children with ALL are at risk for VTE during induction chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed ALL patients admitted to Children's Hospital Los Angeles with a central venous catheter (CVC) were eligible to participate. Participants' blood samples (complete blood count [CBC], quantitative D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2 [PTF 1.2], and thrombin-antithrombin complexes [TAT]) were collected at day 0 (baseline/prior to induction), day 7 (+/-2 days), day 14 (+/-2 days), day 21 (+/-2 days), and day 28 (+/-2 days) of induction chemotherapy or until participants presented with a symptomatic VTE. RESULTS: Seventy-five participants aged 1-21 years were enrolled and included in the final analysis. Twenty-six (35%) of the 75 participants were diagnosed with a CVC-associated VTE (22 asymptomatic and four symptomatic). There was a statistically significant difference between VTE and non-VTE participants for D-dimer (odds ratio [OR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.59-1.64), TAT (OR 1.34, 95% CI: 1.32-1.38), and PTF 1.2 (OR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.25-1.37) at all time points.

Although hypomethylating agents (HMA) have improved survival in higher-risk MDS, most patients eventually succumb to progressive disease. Utilizing samples collected prospectively from three MDS clinical trials, we analyzed genetic and immunological biomarkers and correlated them with clinical outcomes. METHODS: 154 samples were analyzed from 133 de novo MDS patients for T-cell and myeloid cell immunophenotyping and gene expression analysis. Treatments were with HMA or immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) alone or in combination. RESULTS: We observed differences in immune cell subsets between lower and higher risk IPSS groups with NKT cells, MDSCs, intermediate-proinflammatory and non-classical monocytes being higher in the latter group while naive CD4+ T-cells were reduced. Intermediate-proinflammatory monocytes were increased in non-responders and those failing to achieve at least a hematological improvement. Pro-inflammatory NKT cells were increased at diagnosis for patients failing to derive clinical benefit after 12 months of treatment. Gene expression analysis of paired bone marrow (BM) colony-forming units (CFUs) from diagnosis and 4 cycles post-treatment confirmed that genes involved in cytokine signaling were downregulated in C4 normal colonies. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the central roles of dysregulation in innate immunity and inflammatory signaling in the pathogenesis of MDS which correlated with clinical outcomes post-treatment.",['This article is protected by copyright.

The results show that in comparison with its counterparts, the optimal Au25/3DOM In2O3 presents higher sensitivity, shorter response/recovery times, better selectivity, and excellent reproducibility. More attractively, the responses to FA are dependent on the size of Au particles loaded on In2O3. We suggest that the enhanced FA responses for the optimal material are mainly attributed to the electronic and chemical-sensitization effects of Au25 NCs, and the size-dependent effect of FA responses is ascribed to the size of Au NPs affecting the formation of oxygen-adsorbing species. This work provides an efficient way for fabricating noble metal NP-loaded MOSs with tunable gas-sensing properties.",,"['Li, Xue-Ying', 'Sun, Guang-Ting', 'Fan, Fan', 'Li, Yan-Yang', 'Liu, Qing-Chao', 'Yao, Hong-Chang', 'Li, Zhong-Jun']","['Li XY', 'Sun GT', 'Fan F', 'Li YY', 'Liu QC', 'Yao HC', 'Li ZJ']","['Green Catalysis Center, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.', 'Green Catalysis Center, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.', 'Green Catalysis Center, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.', 'Guangdong Fangyuan Environment Co., Ltd., Jiangmen, Guangdong 529145, China.', 'Green Catalysis Center, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.', 'Green Catalysis Center, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.', 'Green Catalysis Center, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.', 'Green Catalysis Center, College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211228,United States,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,ACS applied materials & interfaces,101504991,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['3DOM In2O3', 'Au25 nanoclusters', 'formaldehyde', 'gas sensing', 'size effect']",2021/12/29 06:00,2021/12/29 06:01,['2021/12/28 17:08'],"['2021/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/29 06:01 [medline]', '2021/12/28 17:08 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acsami.1c16552 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces. 2022 Jan 12;14(1):564-573. doi: 10.1021/acsami.1c16552.

We addressed this gap by examining patterns of EOL care, with a focus on location of death and hospice utilization. METHODS: We used MarketScan - a nationally representative dataset with Medicaid and commercial claims to conduct a retrospective observational study of children with cancer who died between 2011 and 2017 at age </=21 years. We examined rates of (a) home death, (b) hospice utilization, (c) and medically intense interventions in the last 30 days (e.g., intubation). RESULTS: Of the 1492 children in the cohort, 44% had Medicaid and 56% commercial insurance; 71% carried a solid tumor diagnosis, and 37% were between the ages of 15 and 21 years at the time of death. Forty percent died at home; children with Medicaid were less likely to die at home (relative risk [RR] = 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-0.92; reference: commercial). Forty-five percent enrolled in hospice, for a median of 2 days. Hospice enrollment rates did not vary with insurance. However, children with Medicaid spent less time enrolled (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.17-0.27). Among children with Medicaid, Black children were less likely to die at home (RR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52-0.92) and enroll on hospice (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.91) than non-Hispanic White children. Medically intense interventions did not vary with insurance or race. CONCLUSION: Only 40% of children with cancer die at home, and the duration of hospice enrollment is short. EOL care varies significantly with insurance. It is imperative that we determine if these patterns and disparities represent EOL preferences, provider biases, or differences in quality or availability of hospice.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Johnston, Emily E', 'Davis, Elizabeth S', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Kenzik, Kelly']","['Johnston EE', 'Davis ES', 'Bhatia S', 'Kenzik K']","['Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211228,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['end-of-life care', 'hospice', 'location of death', 'medical intensity', 'pediatric oncology']",2021/12/29 06:00,2021/12/29 06:00,['2021/12/28 12:20'],"['2021/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/28 12:20 [entrez]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.29521 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec 28:e29521. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29521.,,,e29521,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9126-2169'],"[""CDA/St. Baldrick's Foundation"", 'Fellow Award/Leukemia Lymphoma Society', 'CDA/Conquer Cancer Foundation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using a prospective longitudinal study design, this study evaluated peripheral blood parameters pre-aPBSCT and on day 100, at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years in 304 patients treated with aPBSCT. The relation between peripheral blood parameters and subsequent development of t-MN was examined, and nomograms were developed to identify patients at risk for t-MN. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients developed t-MN at a median of 1.95 years post-aPBSCT. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell, and platelet counts were lower among patients who developed t-MN compared to those who did not; these differences appeared soon after aPBSCT, persisted, and preceded development of t-MN. Older age at aPBSCT (hazard ratio [HR]per_year_increase = 1.08, P = .007), exposure to total body irradiation (TBI) (HR = 2.90, P = .04), and low 100-day platelet count (HRincrease_per_unit_decline_in_PLT = 1.01, P = .002) predicted subsequent t-MN. These parameters and primary diagnosis allowed identification of patients at high risk of t-MN (eg, an HL patient undergoing aPBSCT at the age of 70 years with TBI and with a day 100 PLT between 100,000 and 150,000 would have a 62% probability of developing t-MN at 6 years post-aPBSCT).

(Geraniaceae), has little research on pharmacological activity; whether suchilactone has inhibitory effect on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antitumor effect of suchilactone and its mechanism in AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of suchilactone on cell growth were detected by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. Network pharmacology was conducted to explore target of suchilactone. Gene expression was detected by western blot and RT-PCR. SHI-1 cells (1 x 10(6) cell per mouse) were subcutaneously inoculated into the female SCID mice. Suchilactone (15 and 30 mg/kg) was dissolved in PBS with 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium and administered (i.g.) to mice once a day for 19 days, while the control group received PBS with 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium. Tumour tissues were stained with Ki-67 and TUNEL. RESULTS: Suchilactone exerted an effective inhibition on the growth of SHI-1 cells with IC50 of 17.01 muM. Then, we found that suchilactone binds to the SHP2 protein and inhibits its activation, and suchilactone interacted with SHP2 to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis via blocking the activation of SHP2. Moreover, Suchilaction inhibited tumour growth of AML xenografts in mice, as the tumour weight decreased from 0.618 g (control) to 0.35 g (15 mg/kg) and 0.258 g (30 mg/kg). Suchilactone inhibited Ki-67 expression and increased TUNEL expression in tumour tissue. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to demonstrate suchilactone inhibits AML growth, suggesting that suchilactone is a candidate drug for the treatment of AML.",,"['Wu, Jingjing', 'Deng, Yuan', 'Zhang, Xin', 'Ma, Jingjing', 'Zheng, Xinqi', 'Chen, Yue']","['Wu J', 'Deng Y', 'Zhang X', 'Ma J', 'Zheng X', 'Chen Y']","[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Huaian No.1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Huaian No.1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Huaian No.1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Huaian No.1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Huaian No.1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Huaian No.1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['ERK pathway proliferation apoptosis', 'Monsonia angustifolia', 'network pharmacology']",2021/12/29 06:00,2021/12/29 06:00,['2021/12/28 12:10'],"['2021/12/28 12:10 [entrez]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13880209.2021.2017467 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2022 Dec;60(1):144-153. doi: 10.1080/13880209.2021.2017467.,60,1,144-153,,,,PMC8725822,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising therapeutic approach, for which MM is an ideal candidate; indeed, the pleural location provides direct access for the intra-tumoral injection of oncolytic viruses (OVs). Some non-human OVs offer advantages over human OVs, including the non-pathogenicity in humans and the absence of pre-existing immunity.

Here, we assessed CpHV-1 effects on MM (NCI-H28, MSTO, NCI-H2052) and non-tumor mesothelial (MET-5A) cells. We found that CpHV-1 reduced cell viability and clonogenic potential in all MM cell lines without affecting non-tumor cells, in which, indeed, we did not detect intracellular viral DNA after treatment. In particular, CpHV-1 induced MM cell apoptosis and accumulation in G0/G1 or S cell cycle phases. Moreover, CpHV-1 strongly synergized with cisplatin, the drug currently used in MM chemotherapy, and this agent combination did not affect normal mesothelial cells. Although further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the selective CpHV-1 action on MM cells, our data suggest that the CpHV-1-cisplatin combination could be a feasible strategy against MM.",,"['Forte, Iris Maria', 'Indovina, Paola', 'Montagnaro, Serena', 'Costa, Aurora', 'Iannuzzi, Carmelina Antonella', 'Capone, Francesca', 'Camerlingo, Rosa', 'Malfitano, Anna Maria', 'Pentimalli, Francesca', 'Ferrara, Gianmarco', 'Quintiliani, Massimiliamo', 'Portella, Giuseppe', 'Giordano, Antonio', 'Ciarcia, Roberto']","['Forte IM', 'Indovina P', 'Montagnaro S', 'Costa A', 'Iannuzzi CA', 'Capone F', 'Camerlingo R', 'Malfitano AM', 'Pentimalli F', 'Ferrara G', 'Quintiliani M', 'Portella G', 'Giordano A', 'Ciarcia R']","['Cell Biology and Biotherapy Unit, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, IRCCS, Fondazione G.

However, after administration, it exhibits several limitations, including restricted diffusion and cellular internalization due to its hydrophilicity, and a rapid enzymatic degradation by adenosine deaminase. The aim of this study was to improve the drug cell diffusion and protect it from metabolic degradation via the synthesis of amphiphilic prodrugs and their potential self-assembly. Azacitidine was conjugated to two different omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The carboxylic acid group of the omega-3 fatty acids was effectively conjugated to the amine group of the azacitidine base, yielding two amphiphilic prodrugs. Nanoprecipitation of the obtained prodrugs was performed and self-assemblies were successfully obtained for both prodrugs, with a mean diameter of 190 nm, a polydispersity index below 0.2 and a positive zeta potential. The formation of self-assemblies was confirmed using pyrene as a fluorescent dye, and the critical aggregation concentrations were determined: 400 microM for AzaEPA and 688 microM for AzaDHA. Additionally, the stability of the obtained self-assemblies was studied and after 5 days their final stable arrangement was reached. Additionally, cryo-TEM revealed that the self-assemblies attain a multilamellar vesicle supramolecular structure.

HDAC inhibitors are promising epigenetic anticancer drugs and new HDAC inhibitors are sought for in order to obtain potent drug candidates. The new HDAC inhibitor SF5-SAHA was synthesized and analyzed for its anticancer properties. The new compound SF5-SAHA showed strong inhibition of tumor cell growth with IC50 values similar to or lower than that of the clinically applied reference compound vorinostat/SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid). Target specific HDAC inhibition was demonstrated by Western blot analyses. Unspecific cytotoxic effects were not observed in LDH-release measurements. Pro-apoptotic formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 activity induction in prostate carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines DU145 and Hep-G2 seem to be further aspects of the mode of action. Antiangiogenic activity of SF5-SAHA was observed on chorioallantoic membranes of fertilized chicken eggs (CAM assay). The presence of the pentafluorothio-substituent of SF5-SAHA increased the antiproliferative effects in both solid tumor and leukemia/lymphoma cell models when compared with its parent compound vorinostat.

All of SHP-1, SOCS-1, and SOCS-3 are TSGs that negatively regulate JAK/STAT signaling. Enhanced re-expression of TSGs through de-methylation represents a therapeutic target in several cancers. Thymoquinone (TQ) is a major component of Nigella sativa seeds with anticancer effects against several cancers. However, the effects of TQ on DNA methylation are not entirely understood. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of TQ to re-express SHP-1, SOCS-1, and SOCS-3 in MV4-11 AML cells through de-methylation. Cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell cycle assays were performed using WSTs-8 kit, Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit, and fluorometric-red cell cycle assay kit, respectively. The methylation of SHP-1, SOCS-1, and SOCS-3 was evaluated by pyrosequencing analysis. The expression of SHP-1, SOCS-1, SOCS-3, JAK2, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, FLT3-ITD, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TET2, and WT1 was assessed by RT-qPCR. The molecular docking of TQ to JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5 was evaluated. The results revealed that TQ significantly inhibited the growth of MV4-11 cells and induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, the results showed that TQ binds the active pocket of JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5 to inhibit their enzymatic activity and significantly enhances the re-expression of SHP-1 and SOCS-3 through de-methylation. In conclusion, TQ curbs MV4-11 cells by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of JAK/STAT signaling through hypomethylation and re-expression of JAK/STAT negative regulators and could be a promising therapeutic candidate for AML patients.",,"['Al-Rawashde, Futoon Abedrabbu', 'Johan, Muhammad Farid', 'Taib, Wan Rohani Wan', 'Ismail, Imilia', 'Johari, Syed Ahmad Tajudin Tuan', 'Almajali, Belal', 'Al-Wajeeh, Abdullah Saleh', 'Nazari Vishkaei, Mansoureh', 'Al-Jamal, Hamid Ali Nagi']","['Al-Rawashde FA', 'Johan MF', 'Taib WRW', 'Ismail I', 'Johari SATT', 'Almajali B', 'Al-Wajeeh AS', 'Nazari Vishkaei M', 'Al-Jamal HAN']","['School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Kuala Nerus 21300, Terengganu, Malaysia.', 'Department of Haematology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian 16150, Kelantan, Malaysia.', 'School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Kuala Nerus 21300, Terengganu, Malaysia.', 'School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Kuala Nerus 21300, Terengganu, Malaysia.', 'Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases and Biotechnology (CeRIDB), Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin, Kuala Terengganu 20400, Terengganu, Malaysia.', 'School of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), Kuala Nerus 21300, Terengganu, Malaysia.', 'Anti-Doping Lab Qatar, Doha P.O.

They are known for their anticancer properties against solid tumors of the liver or lung, as well as diffuse cancers, such as multiple myeloma or leukemia. Currently, the most commonly used statins are simvastatin, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. The anti-tumor activity of statins is largely related to their ability to induce apoptosis by targeting cancer cells with high selectivity. Statins are also involved in the regulation of the histone acetylation level, the disturbance of which can lead to abnormal activity of genes involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. As a result, tumor growth and its invasion may be promoted, which is associated with a poor prognosis. High levels of histone deacetylases are observed in many cancers; therefore, one of the therapeutic strategies is to use their inhibitors.

EBL is widespread in dairy herds and causes a direct economic impact due to reduced milk production and the early culling of BLV-infected cattle. The BLV infection status in Taiwan remains largely unknown; a high prevalence of BLV in dairy cows was recently revealed. The present study further investigated BLV infections in beef cattle. Surprisingly, the prevalence of BLV proviral DNA was as low as 11.8% (23/195), which is significantly lower than that noted in dairy cows, which was 42.5% (102/240) (p < 0.001). Factors associated with BLV infections were subsequently investigated. Due to the differences in herd management, an analysis of risk factors for a BLV infection was independently conducted in these two sectors. Several factors associated with a BLV infection were identified. Age was significantly associated with BLV infection status in dairy cows (p < 0.001) but not in beef cattle.

However, the dysregulation of tyrosine kinase pathways occurs in malignancy, including hematological leukemias such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Particularly, the fusion oncoprotein BCR-ABL1 in CML and the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway in CLL are critical for leukemogenesis. Therapeutic management of these two hematological conditions was fundamentally changed in recent years, making the role of conventional chemotherapy nearly obsolete. The first, second, and third generation inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib) of BCR-ABL1 and the allosteric inhibitor asciminib showed deep genetic and molecular remission rates in CML, leading to the evaluation of treatment discontinuation in prospective trials. The irreversible BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, tirabrutinib, and spebrutinib) covalently bind to the C481 amino acid of BTK. The reversible BTK inhibitor pirtobrutinib has a different binding site, overcoming resistance associated with mutations at C481. The PI3K inhibitors (idelalisib and duvelisib) are also effective in CLL but are currently less used because of their toxicity profiles. These tyrosine kinase inhibitors are well-tolerated, do have some associated in-class side effects that are manageable, and have remarkably improved outcomes for patients with hematologic malignancies.",,"['De Novellis, Danilo', 'Cacace, Fabiana', 'Caprioli, Valeria', 'Wierda, William G', 'Mahadeo, Kris M', 'Tambaro, Francesco Paolo']","['De Novellis D', 'Cacace F', 'Caprioli V', 'Wierda WG', 'Mahadeo KM', 'Tambaro FP']","['Hematology and Transplant Center, University ""Hospital San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi D\'Aragona"", 84131 Salerno, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa di Trapianto di Cellule Staminali Ematopoietiche e Terapie Cellulari, Azienda Ospedaliera di Rilievo Nazionale Santobono-Pausilipon, 80123 Napoli, Italy.', 'Unita Operativa di Trapianto di Cellule Staminali Ematopoietiche e Terapie Cellulari, Azienda Ospedaliera di Rilievo Nazionale Santobono-Pausilipon, 80123 Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, CARTOX Program, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Unita Operativa di Trapianto di Cellule Staminali Ematopoietiche e Terapie Cellulari, Azienda Ospedaliera di Rilievo Nazionale Santobono-Pausilipon, 80123 Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211220,Switzerland,Pharmaceutics,Pharmaceutics,101534003,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1-inhibitors', 'BTK-inhibitors', 'PI3K-inhibitors', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'targeted therapy', 'treatment discontinuation']",2021/12/29 06:00,2021/12/29 06:01,['2021/12/28 01:03'],"['2021/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/28 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/29 06:01 [medline]']","['pharmaceutics13122201 [pii]', '10.3390/pharmaceutics13122201 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceutics. 2021 Dec 20;13(12). pii: pharmaceutics13122201. doi: 10.3390/pharmaceutics13122201.,13,12,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2590-0529'],,PMC8709313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although chemotherapy is a common treatment for cancer, it has a wide range of serious side effects, including myelo- and immunosuppression, hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity.

A screening assay, flow cytometry and Western blotting were used to analyze apoptosis occurrence, oxidative stress, DNA damage and stress/survival/apoptotic pathway modulation induced by the tested substances in Jurkat cells. We demonstrate for the first time that PSE and Phy treatment-induced intrinsic caspase-dependent cell death was associated with increased oxidative stress, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest with the activation of cell cycle checkpoint proteins p53, p21 and p27 and stress/survival kinases p38 MAPK, JNK and PI3K/Akt.

There is accumulating direct evidence of excess risk of cancer in a number of populations exposed at lower acute doses or doses received over a protracted period. There is evidence that relative risks are generally higher after radiation exposures in utero or in childhood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We reviewed and summarised evidence from 60 studies of cancer or benign neoplasms following low- or moderate-level exposure in utero or in childhood from medical and environmental sources. In most of the populations studied the exposure was predominantly to sparsely ionising radiation, such as X-rays and gamma-rays. There were significant (p<0.001) excess risks for all cancers, and particularly large excess relative risks were observed for brain/CNS tumours, thyroid cancer (including nodules) and leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the totality of this large body of data relating to in utero and childhood exposure provides support for the existence of excess cancer and benign neoplasm risk associated with radiation doses<0.1Gy, and for certain groups exposed to natural background radiation, to fallout and medical X-rays in utero, at about 0.02Gy.",['Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],"['Little, Mark P', 'Wakeford, Richard', 'Bouffler, Simon D', 'Abalo, Kossi', 'Hauptmann, Michael', 'Hamada, Nobuyuki', 'Kendall, Gerald M']","['Little MP', 'Wakeford R', 'Bouffler SD', 'Abalo K', 'Hauptmann M', 'Hamada N', 'Kendall GM']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-9778, USA.

Impaired immunity secondary to an underlying malignancy or recent receipt of antineoplastic systemic therapies can result in less robust antibody titers following vaccination and possible risk of breakthrough infection. As clinical trials evaluating COVID-19 vaccines largely excluded patients with a history of cancer and those on active immunosuppression (including chemotherapy), limited evidence is available to inform the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination across the spectrum of patients with cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the clinical features of patients with cancer who developed symptomatic COVID-19 following vaccination and compare weighted outcomes with those of contemporary unvaccinated patients, after adjustment for confounders, using data from the multi-institutional COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19). RESULTS: Patients with cancer who develop COVID-19 following vaccination have substantial comorbidities and can present with severe and even lethal infection. Patients harboring hematologic malignancies are over-represented among vaccinated patients with cancer who develop symptomatic COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination against COVID-19 remains an essential strategy in protecting vulnerable populations, including patients with cancer. Patients with cancer who develop breakthrough infection despite full vaccination, however, remain at risk of severe outcomes. A multilayered public health mitigation approach that includes vaccination of close contacts, boosters, social distancing, and mask-wearing should be continued for the foreseeable future.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

While childhood T-ALL is associated with high cure rates, adult T-ALL is not, and both are associated with significant short- and long-term morbidities. Thus, less toxic and effective strategies to treat T-ALL are needed. CD99 is overexpressed on T-ALL blasts at diagnosis and at relapse. Although targeting CD99 with cytotoxic antibodies has been proposed, the molecular features required for their activity are undefined. We identified human antibodies that selectively bound to the extracellular domain of human CD99, and the most potent clone, 10A1, shared an epitope with a previously described cytotoxic IgM antibody. We engineered clone 10A1 in bivalent, trivalent, tetravalent, and dodecavalent formats. Increasing the antibody valency beyond two had no effects on binding to T-ALL cells. In contrast, a valency of >/=3 was required for cytotoxicity, suggesting a mechanism of action in which an antibody clusters >/=3 CD99 molecules to induce cytotoxicity. We developed a human IgG-based tetravalent version of 10A1 that exhibited cytotoxic activity to T-ALL cells but not to healthy peripheral blood cells. The crystal structure of the 10A1 Fab in complex with a CD99 fragment revealed that the antibody primarily recognizes a proline-rich motif (PRM) of CD99 in a manner reminiscent of SH3-PRM interactions. This work further validates CD99 as a promising therapeutic target in T-ALL and defines a pathway toward the development of a selective therapy against T-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Extracellular matrix proteins including laminin are important BM niche components. However, their role in hematopoiesis regeneration and leukemia is unknown. Laminin alpha4 (Lama4), a major receptor-binding chain of several laminins, is altered in BM niches in mice with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). So far, the impact of Lama4 on leukemia progression remains unknown. We here report that Lama4 deletion in mice resulted in impaired hematopoiesis regeneration following irradiation-induced stress, which is accompanied with altered BM niche composition and inflammation. Importantly, in a transplantation-induced MLL-AF9 AML mouse model, we demonstrate accelerated AML progression and relapse in Lama4-/-mice. Upon AML exposure, Lama4-/- mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibited dramatic molecular alterations including upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that favor AML growth. Lama4-/- MSCs displayed increased anti-oxidant activities and promoted AML stem cell proliferation and chemoresistance to cytarabine, which was accompanied by increased mitochondrial transfer from the MSCs to AML cells and reduced reactive oxygen species in AML cells in vitro. Similarly, we detected lower levels of reactive oxygen species in AML cells from Lama4-/- mice post-cytarabine treatment. Notably, LAMA4 inhibition or knockdown in human MSCs promoted human AML cell proliferation and chemoprotection. Together, our study for the first time demonstrates a critical role of Lama4 in impeding AML progression and chemoresistance. Targeting Lama4 signaling pathways may offer potential new therapeutic options for AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Cai, Huan', 'Kondo, Makoto', 'Sandhow, Lakshmi', 'Xiao, Pingnan', 'Johansson, Anne-Sofie', 'Sasaki, Takako', 'Zawacka-Pankau, Joanna', 'Tryggvason, Karl', 'Ungerstedt, Johanna S', 'Walfridsson, Julian', 'Ekblom, Marja', 'Qian, Hong']","['Cai H', 'Kondo M', 'Sandhow L', 'Xiao P', 'Johansson AS', 'Sasaki T', 'Zawacka-Pankau J', 'Tryggvason K', 'Ungerstedt JS', 'Walfridsson J', 'Ekblom M', 'Qian H']","['Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211227,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/12/27 17:11'],"['2021/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/27 17:11 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['483253 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021011510 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Dec 27. pii: 483253. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021011510.,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2752-5598', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5978-0043', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0514-9931', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2512-9199']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its dysfunction, caused by either fusions or mutations, is frequently reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, RUNX1 mutations have been largely under-explored compared with RUNX1 fusions mainly due to their elusive genetic characteristics. Here, based on 1741 patients with AML, we report a unique expression pattern associated with RUNX1 mutations in AML. This expression pattern was coordinated by target repression and promoter hypermethylation. We first reanalyzed a joint AML cohort that consisted of three public cohorts and found that RUNX1 mutations were mainly distributed in the Runt domain and almost mutually exclusive with NPM1 mutations. Then, based on RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas AML cohort, we developed a 300-gene signature that significantly distinguished the patients with RUNX1 mutations from those with other AML subtypes. Furthermore, we explored the mechanisms underlying this signature from the transcriptional and epigenetic levels. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data, we found that RUNX1 target genes tended to be repressed in patients with RUNX1 mutations. Through the integration of DNA methylation array data, we illustrated that hypermethylation on the promoter regions of RUNX1-regulated genes also contributed to dysregulation in RUNX1-mutated AML. This study revealed the distinct gene expression pattern of RUNX1 mutations and the underlying mechanisms in AML development.",['(c) 2021.

Farmers of such animals may also be engaged in ruminant breeding. The current research was aimed at documenting bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), and bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) infections in sera collected from dromedary camels in four different geographical regions of Turkey during the years 2019-2021. All samples were tested for BVDV, BHV-1 and BLV antibodies as well as BVDV antigen by ELISA. Antibodies against BVDV were found in 16.8% of the camel sera tested. However, none of the camels sampled were positive in terms of BHV-1 and BLV antibodies as well as BVDV antigen. The prevalence was observed higher in the herds in which ruminants were raised in addition to camels (OR = 4.583, 95% CI, 1.298-16.182), (p = 0.018), while the prevalence was observed lower in the herds in which only camels were raised. This study showed that BVDV infection was more prevalent than BHV-1 and BLV infections in Turkish dromedary camels. Herewith, the camels, being a susceptible species to numerous viral ruminant diseases, may also serve as an important source of BVDV infection for other ruminant animals in the same flock.","['(c) 2021.

They include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and non-CML MPS such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. The latter are distinguished by somatic pathogenic variants affecting JAK2, CALR, or MPL genes. Apparent germline pathogenic variants have been reported in the general population. Here, we found that two gnomAD data-sets report more homozygotes than expected for the JAK2 c.1849G > T(Val617Phe) variant. We propose that somatic gene conversion can explain the presence of those unexpected homozygotes in normal populations. Consistently, homozygous individuals are older than 65 years. We also found a lower-than-expected frequency of the JAK2 variant in younger individuals suggesting that somatic mutation can underlie its presence in (at least some) heterozygotes. Regarding pathogenic variants in MPL and CALR, they are also present in the gnomAD data-sets explored. However, we cannot conclude that such seemingly germline variants are in fact somatic alterations. These results suggest that apparently normal individuals bearing MPS-related variants can be subclinical/undiagnosed MPS cases of somatic origin. It would be interesting to assess the hematologic phenotype of such individuals and the presence of the relevant variants in other tissues.",['(c) 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S .

RUNX1 encodes a transcription factor that can regulate the expression of hematopoietic genes. In addition, tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) performs an important function for malignant tumors in immune surveillance. However, the regulatory mechanism of TRAIL expression remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, tetradecanoylphorbol 13acetatetreated megakaryocytic differentiated K562 cells was used to examine the effect of RUNX1 on TRAIL expression. Luciferase assay series of TRAIL promoters for the cells cotransfected with RUNX1 and corebinding factor beta (CBFbeta) expression vectors were performed to evaluate the nature of TRAIL transcriptional regulation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay of the RUNX1 consensus sequence of the TRAIL promoter with recombinant RUNX1 and CBFbeta proteins was also performed. BloodSpot database analysis for TRAIL expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia were performed. The expression of TRAIL, its receptor Death receptor 4 and 5 and RUNX1 in K562 cells transfected with the RUNX1 expression vector and RUNX1 siRNA were evaluated by reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR (RTqPCR). TRAIL and RUNX1ETO expression was also measured in Kasumi1 cells transfected with RUNX1ETO siRNA and in KG1 cells transfected with RUNX1ETO expression plasmid, both by RTqPCR. Cell counting, lactate dehydrogenase assay and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry were performed on Kasumi1, KG1, SKNO1 and K562 cells treated with TRAIL and HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate or valproic acid. The present study demonstrated that RUNX1 is a transcriptional regulator of TRAIL. It was initially found that the induction of TRAIL expression following the megakaryocytic differentiation of human leukemia cells was RUNX1dependent. Subsequently, overexpression of RUNX1 was found to increase TRAIL mRNA expression by activating its promoter activity. Additional analyses revealed that RUNX1 regulated the expression of TRAIL in an indirect manner, because RUNX1 retained its ability to activate this promoter following the mutation of all possible RUNX1 consensus sites. Furthermore, TRAIL expression was reduced in leukemia cells carrying the t(8;21) translocation, where the RUNX1ETO chimeric protein interfere with normal RUNX1 function. Exogenous treatment of recombinant TRAIL proteins was found to induce leukemia cell death. To conclude, the present study provided a novel mechanism, whereby TRAIL is a target gene of RUNX1 and TRAIL expression was inhibited by RUNX1ETO. These results suggest that TRAIL is a promising agent for the clinical treatment of t(8;21) AML.",,"['Yoshida, Tatsushi', 'Yamasaki, Kenta', 'Tadagaki, Kenjiro', 'Kuwahara, Yasumichi', 'Matsumoto, Akifumi', 'Sofovic, Adem Ejub', 'Kondo, Noriko', 'Sakai, Toshiyuki', 'Okuda, Tsukasa']","['Yoshida T', 'Yamasaki K', 'Tadagaki K', 'Kuwahara Y', 'Matsumoto A', 'Sofovic AE', 'Kondo N', 'Sakai T', 'Okuda T']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, KawaramachiHirokoji, Kamigyoku, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, KawaramachiHirokoji, Kamigyoku, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, KawaramachiHirokoji, Kamigyoku, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, KawaramachiHirokoji, Kamigyoku, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, KawaramachiHirokoji, Kamigyoku, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, KawaramachiHirokoji, Kamigyoku, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, KawaramachiHirokoji, Kamigyoku, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Discovery Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, KawaramachiHirokoji, Kamigyoku, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, KawaramachiHirokoji, Kamigyoku, Kyoto 6028566, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211227,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia 1', 'apoptosis', 'runtrelated transcription factor 1', 'transcription', 'tumornecrosis factorrelated apoptosis inducing ligand']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/12/27 08:47'],"['2021/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/27 08:47 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/ijo.2021.5296 [doi]', '6 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2022 Jan;60(1). pii: 6. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2021.5296.

However, AML prognosis is still unfavorable particularly in adults. So, further reliable markers are urgently needed to improve the risk stratification and treatment decisions. CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1; CD318) and endoglin (CD105) are new markers correlated with poor prognosis in different solid tumors, but their role in AML prognosis is not fully evaluated. OBJECTIVES: This work aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of CD318 and CD105 in AML and their impact on the outcomes. METHODS: Sixty-five newly diagnosed AML patients were included in this study. CD318 and CD105 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Patients were followed up for approximately 2 years to evaluate the prognostic impact of gene expression on the outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with high CD318 and CD105 showed higher white blood cell (WBC) count, M2 subtype, poor cytogenetic risk, reduced complete remission, and a greater number of deaths compared to low CD318 and CD105. CD318 was correlated with CD105, and both were correlated with WBC count, bone marrow blasts, and peripheral blood blasts. After a follow-up period of up to 24 months, relapse-free survival for high CD318 and CD105 was significantly different (42.1% and 52.6% vs. 64.5% and 58.1% for low CD318 and CD105, respectively). Survival was worse in patients with high CD318 and CD105, as the mean survival time was 13.9 and 13.3 months compared to 24 and 22.7 months in low CD318 and CD105, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CD318 and CD105 are upregulated in AML patients. Their overexpression was associated with poor response to treatment and poor outcomes. Therefore, CD318 and CD105 can be useful prognostic markers in AML.",,"['Ebian, Huda F', 'Issa, Dina R', 'Al-Karamany, Amira S', 'Etewa, Rasha L', 'El Maghraby, Hanaa M', 'Hussein, Samia']","['Ebian HF', 'Issa DR', 'Al-Karamany AS', 'Etewa RL', 'El Maghraby HM', 'Hussein S']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Helwan University, Egypt.', 'Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Pathology Department College of Medicine, Jouf University, Sakaka, Saudi Arabia.', 'Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Egypt.', 'Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211217,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CDCP1 (CD318)', 'endoglin (CD105)']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/12/27 08:44'],"['2021/12/27 08:44 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['CBM210346 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-210346 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Biomark. 2021 Dec 17. pii: CBM210346. doi: 10.3233/CBM-210346.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smad4 is a tumor inhibitor that transduces TGF-beta signaling and modulates genomic stability. Previous studies have indicated that decreased Smad4 expression played a bidirectional role in chemosensitivity in many types of cancers. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the association between IM sensitivity and decreased Smad4 expression in human CML K562 cells.Methods: Bone marrow (BM) samples were acquired from the patients prior to treatment. qRT-PCR, Western Blotting (WB), colony formation assay (CFA), and apoptosis assay were used to detect relevant indices.Results: Smad4 expression was downregulated in the bone marrow and plasma of patients with multidrug-resistant CML as well as IM-resistant K562 (K562R) cells compared with samples collected from CML patients and K562 cells. Smad4 overexpression inhibited IM-treated K562R cell proliferation and augmented apoptosis, whereas Smad4 silencing promoted viability and inhibited apoptosis in IM-treated K562 cells. In addition, Smad4 expression was inversely correlated with laminin subunit gamma 1 (LAMC1) expression. The upregulation or downregulation of LAMC1 expression partially abolished the effect of Smad4 overexpression or silencing on the IM resistance of CML cells.Conclusion: The downregulation of Smad4 expression might induce drug resistance in CML cells and displayed a possible mechanism through which Smad4 modulates CML cell survival and apoptosis upon IM treatment.",,"['Zhang, Jiangzhao', 'Zhang, Min', 'Liang, Yan', 'Liu, Min', 'Huang, Zhiping']","['Zhang J', 'Zhang M', 'Liang Y', 'Liu M', 'Huang Z']","[""Department of Hematology, Jingzhou Central Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Jingzhou Central Hospital, Jingzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jingzhou Central Hospital, Jingzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jingzhou Central Hospital, Jingzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jingzhou Central Hospital, Institute of Hematology, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'K562', 'LAMC1', 'Smad4', 'apoptosis', 'chemoresistance', 'imatinib', 'proliferation']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/12/27 08:43'],"['2021/12/27 08:43 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.2010331 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2022 Dec;27(1):43-52. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.2010331.,27,1,43-52,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7165-9019'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role and working mechanism of circ_0000745 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) development remain largely unclear. METHODS: The expression of circ_0000745, sperm antigen with calponin homology and coiled-coil domains 1 (SPECC1), microRNA-494-3p (miR-494-3p), and neuroepithelial cell transforming 1 (NET1) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot assay. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was assessed to analyze cell glycolysis. Cell viability was analyzed by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay. Ferroptosis was assessed through measuring the intracellular levels of iron and lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were conducted to validate the interaction between miR-494-3p and circ_0000745 or NET1. RESULTS: Circ_0000745 expression was elevated in ALL patients and cell lines. Circ_0000745 knockdown restrained cell cycle progression and glycolysis and triggered cell apoptosis and ferroptosis. Circ_0000745 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-494-3p in ALL cells. miR-494-3p silencing partly diminished circ_0000745 knockdown-induced anti-tumor effects in ALL cells. NET1 was a target of miR-494-3p, and miR-494-3p overexpression-induced anti-tumor influences were partly counteracted by the accumulation of NET1 in ALL cells. Circ_0000745 can positively regulate NET1 expression by sponging miR-494-3p in ALL cells. CONCLUSION: Circ_0000745 contributed to ALL development partly by binding to miR-494-3p to induce NET1 expression.0020.",,"['Yang, Xi', 'Li, Yanbi', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Liu, Jingzhen']","['Yang X', 'Li Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu J']","[""Department of Pediatric, Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Xiangyang, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The Central Hospital of Enshi Autonomous Prefecture, Enshi, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The Central Hospital of Enshi Autonomous Prefecture, Enshi, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'NET1', 'circ_0000745', 'miR-494-3p']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/12/27 08:43'],"['2021/12/27 08:43 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.2008590 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2022 Dec;27(1):11-22. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.2008590.,27,1,11-22,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4212-5958'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The expression of SPRY1 and the prognostic values of SPRY1 were assessed through the analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas. Meanwhile, the expression of SPRY1 in AML cells was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. Then, the biological function of SPRY1 on the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis in K-562 and HL-60 cells were tested using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, colony-formation assay, 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine assay and flow cytometry. Additionally, the protein expressions were measured by western blot. RESULTS: We found that SPRY1 was markedly overexpressed in the cells of the patients with AML, and the patients with AML having a high SPRY1 expression has a bad prognosis. The proliferation and cell cycle progression in K-562 and HL-60 cells were notably promoted by SPRY1 overexpression, but inhibited by SPRY1 knockdown. Meanwhile, the apoptosis of K-562 and HL-60 cells was significantly repressed by SPRY1 overexpression and facilitated by SPRY1 knockdown. In addition, we found that SPRY1 overexpression significantly activated the Hedgehog pathway in AML cells. The function of SPRY1 on the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis was reversed by Gli1 in K-562 and HL-60 cells.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the overall efficacy and safety of GO in combination with conventional chemotherapy regimens in patients with AML.Methods: We searched several databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library). Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS); odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated for the other outcomes.Results: Ten records involving 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. GO plus induction chemotherapy significantly increased RFS (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73-0.98), decreased the incidence of relapse (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.68-0.91) and resistant disease (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.61-0.84), and had no significant effect on the rate of complete remission (CR) with or without incomplete platelet recovery (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.94-1.55), 30-day mortality (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.99-1.57). Subgroup analysis showed significant OS benefits for patients with favorable cytogenetic (HR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28-0.89) or given GO at induction stage (HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84-1.00). Compared with other dosing schedule groups, 3 mg/m(2) fractionated schedule had a greater RFS benefit (HR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.36-0.76) and lower relapse risk (OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.28-0.84).Conclusions: Adding low-dose GO to induction or both induction and post-remission chemotherapy has considerable efficacy and unequivocal safety for newly diagnosed adult AML.",,"['Guo, Yuancheng', 'Deng, Lijuan', 'Qiao, Yanhong', 'Liu, Bei']","['Guo Y', 'Deng L', 'Qiao Y', 'Liu B']","[""The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Xi'an Central Hospital, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'antibody-drug conjugate', 'gemtuzumab ozogamicin', 'induction chemotherapy', 'meta-analysis', 'systematic review']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/12/27 08:43'],"['2021/12/27 08:43 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.2013410 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2022 Dec;27(1):53-64. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.2013410.,27,1,53-64,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9574-2685', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4331-2138']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism relevant to glucocorticoid (GC) resistance remains ambiguous. METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were performed to detect the expressions of paraoxonase 2 (PON2), Bcl-2 and Bax. shRNA was used to knockdown PON2 expression in SUP-B15 and REH cell. CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay were conducted to monitor the changes of proliferation and apoptosis in ALL cells. The growth of ALL REH cells in vivo was determined using transplanted tumor model. RESULTS: This study was designed to identify GC resistance-associated genes by means of the transcriptome chip from the public Gene Expression Omnibus database, and preliminarily investigation of dexamethasone (DEX)-resistance mechanism in ALL. We disclosed that PON2 expression was elevated in ALL patients and especially higher in DEX-resistance ALL patients. Then, cell apoptosis assay suggested that silencing of PON2 dramatically promoted in DEX-resistant ALL cells apoptosis and the activity of Caspase 3 induced by DEX administration. In xenograft tumor model, PON2 knockdown significantly reduced DEX-resistant ALL cells growth in immunodeficient mice.

This study aimed to determine the frequency of IKZF1 deletions and deletions in other B-cell differentiation and cell cycle control genes, and their prognostic impact in Slovenian pediatric B-ALL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a cohort of 99 patients diagnosed with B-ALL from January 2012 to December 2020 and treated according to the ALL IC-BFM 2009 protocol. Eighty-eight bone marrow or peripheral blood samples were analysed for copy number variations (CNVs) using the SALSA MLPA P335 ALL-IKZF1 probemix. RESULTS: At least one CNV was detected in more than 65% of analysed samples. The most frequently altered genes were PAX5 and CDKN2A/B (30.7%, 26.1%, and 25.0%, respectively). Deletions in IKZF1 were present in 18.2% of analysed samples and were associated with an inferior 5-year event-free survival (EFS; 54.8% vs. 85.9%, p = 0.016). The IKZF1 (plus) profile was identified in 12.5% of the analysed samples, and these patients had an inferior 5-year EFS than those with deletions in IKZF1 only and those without deletions (50.8% vs. 75.0% vs. 85.9%, respectively, p = 0.049). Overall survival (OS) was also worse in patients with the IKZF1 (plus) profile than those with deletions in IKZF1 only and those without deletions (5-year OS 76.2% vs. 100% vs. 93.0%, respectively). However, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in concordance with the results obtained in larger cooperative clinical trials. Copy number variations analysis using the SALSA MLPA kit is a reliable tool for initial diagnostic approach in children with B-ALL, even in smaller institutions in low- and middle-income countries.","['(c) 2021 Klementina Crepinsek, Gasper Marinsek, Marko Kavcic, Tomaz Prelog,', 'Lidija Kitanovski, Janez Jazbec, Marusa Debeljak, published by Sciendo.']","['Crepinsek, Klementina', 'Marinsek, Gasper', 'Kavcic, Marko', 'Prelog, Tomaz', 'Kitanovski, Lidija', 'Jazbec, Janez', 'Debeljak, Marusa']","['Crepinsek K', 'Marinsek G', 'Kavcic M', 'Prelog T', 'Kitanovski L', 'Jazbec J', 'Debeljak M']","[""Clinical Institute for Special Laboratory Diagnostics, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."", 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', ""Clinical Institute for Special Laboratory Diagnostics, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."", 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', ""Department of Oncology and Haematology, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."", ""Department of Oncology and Haematology, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."", ""Department of Oncology and Haematology, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."", 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', ""Department of Oncology and Haematology, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."", ""Clinical Institute for Special Laboratory Diagnostics, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."", 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211222,Poland,Radiol Oncol,Radiology and oncology,9317213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'IKZF1 deletions', 'IKZF1plus', 'MLPA', 'copy number variations (CNVs)', 'pediatric']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/12/27 06:57'],"['2021/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/27 06:57 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['raon-2021-0050 [pii]', '10.2478/raon-2021-0050 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Radiol Oncol. 2021 Dec 22. pii: raon-2021-0050. doi: 10.2478/raon-2021-0050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical guidelines can struggle to keep pace with an evolving treatment and evidence landscape and therefore identifying the most appropriate front-line treatment is challenging for clinicians. Here, we combined drug eligibility criteria and genetic risk stratification into a digital format, allowing the full range of possible treatment eligibility scenarios to be defined. Using exemplar cases representing each of the 22 identified scenarios, we sought to generate consensus on treatment choice from a panel of nine aUK AML experts. We then analysed >2500 real-world cases using the same algorithm, confirming the existence of 21/22 of these scenarios and demonstrating that our novel approach could generate a consensus AML induction treatment in 98% of cases. Our approach, driven by the use of decision trees, is an efficient way to develop consensus guidance rapidly and could be applied to other disease areas. It has the potential to be updated frequently to capture changes in eligibility criteria, novel therapies and emerging trial data. An interactive digital version of the consensus guideline is available.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The clinical picture, course, and prognosis vary substantially among patients, depending on the anatomic site, grade and stage of the disease. The most frequently involved organ is the skin, followed by hematopoietic organs (lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and bone marrow) and mucosal sites of the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract. In cutaneous mast cell tumors, several grading and staging systems have been introduced. However, no comprehensive classification and no widely accepted diagnostic criteria have been proposed to date. To address these open issues and points we organized a Working Conference on canine mast cell neoplasms in Vienna in 2019. The outcomes of this meeting are summarized in this article. The proposed classification includes cutaneous mast cell tumors and their sub-variants defined by grading- and staging results, mucosal mast cell tumors, extracutaneous/extramucosal mast cell tumors without skin involvement, and mast cell leukemia (MCL). For each of these entities, diagnostic criteria are proposed. Moreover, we have refined grading and staging criteria for mast cell neoplasms in dogs based on consensus discussion. The criteria and classification proposed in this article should greatly facilitate diagnostic evaluation and prognostication in dogs with mast cell neoplasms and should thereby support management of these patients in daily practice and the conduct of clinical trials.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Willmann, Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, Marconato, Dacasto,', 'Hadzijusufovic, Hermine, Sadovnik, Gamperl,

Existing CNS-directed therapies are associated with a significant risk of short- or long-term toxicities. Leukemic cells can metabolically adapt and survive in the microenvironment of the CNS. The supporting role of the CNS microenvironment in leukemia progression and dissemination has not received sufficient attention. Understanding the mechanism by which leukemic cells survive in the nutrient-poor and oxygen-deprived CNS microenvironment will lead to the development of more specific and less toxic therapies. Here, we review the current literature regarding the roles of metabolic reprogramming in leukemic cell adhesion and survival in the CNS.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Sharma, Keewan and Matlawska-Wasowska.']","['Sharma, Nitesh D', ""Keewan, Esra'a"", 'Matlawska-Wasowska, Ksenia']","['Sharma ND', 'Keewan E', 'Matlawska-Wasowska K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, United States.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, United States.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, United States.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211210,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['CNS', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell adhesion', 'central nervous system', 'meninges', 'metabolism']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:01,['2021/12/27 06:33'],"['2021/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/27 06:33 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fcell.2021.767510 [doi]', '767510 [pii]']",epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Dec 10;9:767510. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.767510. eCollection 2021.,9,,767510,,,,PMC8703109,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optimising Chemotherapeutic Options for Irradiation-Free Conditioning for Paediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia.,10.3389/fped.2021.775485 [doi],"Total-body irradiation (TBI) based conditioning prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is generally regarded as the gold-standard for children >4 years of age with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Retrospective studies in the 1990's suggested better survival with irradiation, confirmed in a small randomised, prospective study in the early 2000's. Most recently, this was reconfirmed by the early results of the large, randomised, international, phase III FORUM study published in 2020. But we know survivors will suffer a multitude of long-term sequelae after TBI, including second malignancies, neurocognitive, endocrine and cardiometabolic effects. The drive to avoid TBI directs us to continue optimising irradiation-free, myeloablative conditioning. In chemotherapy-based conditioning, the dominant myeloablative effect is provided by the alkylating agents, most commonly busulfan or treosulfan. Busulfan with cyclophosphamide is a long-established alternative to TBI-based conditioning in ALL patients. Substituting fludarabine for cyclophosphamide reduces toxicity, but may not be as effective, prompting the addition of a third agent, such as thiotepa, melphalan, and now clofarabine. For busulfan, it's wide pharmacokinetic (PK) variability and narrow therapeutic window is well-known, with widespread use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to individualise dosing and control the cumulative busulfan exposure. The development of first-dose selection algorithms has helped achieve early, accurate busulfan levels within the targeted therapeutic window. In the future, predictive genetic variants, associated with differing busulfan exposures and toxicities, could be employed to further tailor individualised busulfan-based conditioning for ALL patients. Treosulfan-based conditioning leads to comparable outcomes to busulfan-based conditioning in paediatric ALL, without the need for TDM to date. Future PK evaluation and modelling may optimise therapy and improve outcome. More recently, the addition of clofarabine to busulfan/fludarabine has shown encouraging results when compared to TBI-based regimens. The combination shows activity in ALL as well as AML and deserves further evaluation. Like busulfan, optimization of chemotherapy conditioning may be enhanced by understanding not just the PK of clofarabine, fludarabine, treosulfan and other agents, but also the pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics, ideally in the context of a single disease such as ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Ben Hassine, Powys, Svec, Pozdechova, Versluys, Ansari and', 'Shaw.']","['Ben Hassine, Khalil', 'Powys, Madeleine', 'Svec, Peter', 'Pozdechova, Miroslava', 'Versluys, Birgitta', 'Ansari, Marc', 'Shaw, Peter J']","['Ben Hassine K', 'Powys M', 'Svec P', 'Pozdechova M', 'Versluys B', 'Ansari M', 'Shaw PJ']","['Cansearch Research Platform for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Gynecology and Obstetrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.', ""Blood Transplant and Cell Therapies, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia.', ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Institute of Children's Diseases, Bratislava, Slovakia."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia.', ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Institute of Children's Diseases, Bratislava, Slovakia."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Cansearch Research Platform for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Gynecology and Obstetrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Department of Women, Child and Adolescent, University Geneva Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', ""Blood Transplant and Cell Therapies, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Speciality of Child and Adolescent Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211210,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)', 'chemotherapy', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)', 'pharmacodynamics (PD)', 'pharmacogenetics', 'pharmacokinetics']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:01,['2021/12/27 06:33'],"['2021/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/27 06:33 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.775485 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Dec 10;9:775485. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.775485. eCollection 2021.,9,,775485,,,,PMC8705537,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

Herein, we reported three patients with R/R AML who were unresponsive to venetoclax plus azacitidine (VA) but were successfully treated with VA when chidamide was added to the regimen. MCL1 is one of the anti-apoptotic proteins. Chidamide targets the MCL1 protein, which may permit venetoclax resistance when upregulated. We determined MCL1 protein expression in different AML cell lines, and chidamide could downregulate MCL1 expression in venetoclax resistance AML cells. In general, our experience showed that the chidamide/VA combination could improve the condition of R/R AML patients who are resistant to VA.

Identification of frailty is useful in prognostication and treatment decision-making for older adults with HMs. This real-world analysis describes 311 older adults with HMs evaluated in a multidisciplinary oncogeriatric clinic. The accumulation of geriatric conditions [1-unit increase, hazards ratio (HR) = 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.27, p = 0.04] and frailty assessed by the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS, mild/moderate/severe frailty vs. very fit/well, HR = 2.59, 95% CI 1.41-4.78, p = 0.002) were predictive of worse overall survival.

Relapsed or refractory disease is generally considered incurable by conventional therapeutic approaches, although durable responses can be achieved with novel monoclonal antibodies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) may have potential value by inducing graft vs-lymphoma (GvL) effects, but there is currently no consensus regarding the timing of alloHSCT or type of conditioning regimen. Here we present the case of a male patient who achieved a complete remission (CR) of primary refractory SS after non-myeloablative alloHSCT. Patient: Two years prior to HSCT, the patient had been refractory to CHOEP-based chemotherapy, interferon, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), and bexarotene. Directly prior to alloHSCT brentuximab-vedotin (BV) was applied resulting in a partial remission of the skin compartment and overall in a stable disease. Prior to HSCT, flow cytometry of the bone marrow and peripheral blood showed an infiltration with T-cells positive for CD5, CD4, low CD3, low CD2 and negative for CD7, CD38, HLA-DR and CD8. The trephine biopsy showed a 7% infiltration of SS cells. The CD4:CD8 ratio in peripheral blood (pb) was massively increased at 76.67, with 63.5% of white blood cells expressing a SS immune phenotype. The conditioning regimen included 30 mg/m2 fludarabine on days -5, -4 and -3 and total body irradiation with 2 Gy on day -1. Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A from day-1 and mycophenolate mofetil from day 0. The patient received 6.55x106 CD34+ cells and 1.11x108 CD3+ cells/kg body weight. Bone marrow evaluation on day 28 still showed persistent SS cells by flow cytometry. After tapering immunosuppression until day 169, the CD4:CD8 ratio in pb normalized. CR was documented on day 169 after alloHSCT and is now ongoing for almost 3 years after alloHSCT. Conclusions: We confirm that an alloHSCT can be a curative option for refractory patients with SS. The achievement of a CR after tapering the immunosuppressive therapy indicates a significant role of the GvL effect. In present treatment algorithms for patients with SS, the timing of an alloHSCT and the intensity of conditioning should be further explored.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Franke, Dumann, Jentzsch, Monecke, Doehring, Nehring-Vucinic,', 'Schwind, Niederwieser, Platzbecker, Ziemer and Vucinic.']","['Franke, Georg-Nikolaus', 'Dumann, Konstantin', 'Jentzsch, Madlen', 'Monecke, Astrid', 'Doehring, Christine', 'Nehring-Vucinic, Claudia', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Ziemer, Mirjana', 'Vucinic, Vladan']","['Franke GN', 'Dumann K', 'Jentzsch M', 'Monecke A', 'Doehring C', 'Nehring-Vucinic C', 'Schwind S', 'Niederwieser D', 'Platzbecker U', 'Ziemer M', 'Vucinic V']","['Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Clinic for Dermatology, Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute for Pathology, Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Internal Oncology and Gastroenterology, Asklepios Hospital Weissenfels, Weissenfels, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Clinic for Dermatology, Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20211209,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['Sezary syndrome', 'allogeneic hematopietic stem cell transplantation', 'brentuximab vedodin', 'graft vs leukemia effect', 'non-myeloablative conditioning']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:01,['2021/12/27 06:32'],"['2021/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/27 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.749691 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 9;11:749691. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.749691. eCollection 2021.,11,,749691,,,,PMC8695846,,"['G-NF, MJ, SS, UP, DN, KD, MZ, and VV receive honoraria from Takeda.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for inhibitors to suppress the deubiquitination activity of USP2a so as to upregulate FAS protein degradation. We first analyzed the relationship between the expression level of USP2a and survival using The Cancer Genome Atlas Head-Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC) data collection. Our results suggested survival rates were lower among HNSC patients expressing higher levels of USP2a. We then investigated two thiopurine drugs, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), to determine whether they could potentially serve as inhibitors of USP2a. Western blot analysis showed that levels of two USP2a target proteins, FAS and Mdm2, were dose-dependently decreased in A253 submaxillary carcinoma cells treated with 6-TG or 6-MP. Responding to the degradation of Mdm2, levels of p53 were increased. We found that 6-TG and 6-MP also suppressed levels of both USP2a mRNA and protein, suggesting these two thiopurines do not act solely through direct inhibition of USP2a. The effects of 6-TG and 6-MP were not cell type-specific, as they elicited similar decreases in FAS protein in leukemia, prostate and cervical cancer cell lines. 6-TG and 6-MP had effects on several cell cycle proteins, including another USP2a target protein, cyclin D1. The populations of cells in subG1 and S phase were increased by 6-TG and 6-MP, which was accompanied by reductions in G1 phase cells. In untreated cells, USP2a transfection increased FAS and cyclin D1 levels compared to an enzyme-dead USP2a C276A mutant, which lacked deubiquitinating activity. However, USP2a transfection failed to reverse the suppressive effects of 6-TG and 6-MP on FAS levels. In summary, these findings suggest 6-TG and 6-MP reduce the stability of some USP2a targets, including FAS and Mdm2, by inhibiting USP2a-catalyzed deubiquitination in some cancer cells. Our work also provides repurposing evidence supporting 6-TG and 6-MP as target therapeutic drugs, such as USP2a/FAS in this study.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Cheng, Liu, Chiu, Huang and Ho.']","['Cheng, Chiao-Pei', 'Liu, Shu-Ting', 'Chiu, Yi-Lin', 'Huang, Shih-Ming', 'Ho, Ching-Liang']","['Cheng CP', 'Liu ST', 'Chiu YL', 'Huang SM', 'Ho CL']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211210,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['USP2a', 'cyclin D1', 'fatty acid synthase', 'thiopurine', 'ubiquitin']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:01,['2021/12/27 06:32'],"['2021/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/27 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.749661 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 10;11:749661. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.749661. eCollection 2021.,11,,749661,,,,PMC8702617,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of studies on the discontinuation of 2G-TKIs have been conducted and recently published. A meta-analysis was conducted in this study to assess the rate of treatment-free remission (TFR) rate as well as the long-term safety of 2G-TKI discontinuation in CML patients with stable deep molecular response (DMR). 517 patients were recruited in 5 single-armed, prospective cohort studies. The overall weighted mean TFR rate at the follow-up of 12 months reached 57% (95% CI 51-64%; I (2) = 56.4%). The weighted mean TFR rate at the 24-month follow-up was 53% (95% CI 47-60%; I (2) = 47.1%). The loss of TFR was primarily concentrated in the first 12 months. 96.5% of patients, having restarted TKI therapy after a molecular relapse, achieved major molecular response (MMR) rapidly. There were four deaths at the two-year follow-up. As suggested from the results of the final study, 2G-TKI discontinuation in CML patients with stable DMR was reported to be feasible. Relapsed patients were retreated with 2G-TKI, and over 95% of patients could reach MMR. Almost no deaths occurred due to adverse events in two years after discontinuation, and more than half of the patients could maintain a TFR.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Qiongnan Di et al.'],"['Di, Qiongnan', 'Deng, Huiyang', 'Zhao, Yingxin', 'Li, Bo-Ya', 'Qin, Ling']","['Di Q', 'Deng H', 'Zhao Y', 'Li BY', 'Qin L']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211216,United States,Comput Math Methods Med,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,101277751,IM,,,2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/12/27 06:27'],"['2021/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/27 06:27 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/3110622 [doi]'],epublish,Comput Math Methods Med. 2021 Dec 16;2021:3110622. doi: 10.1155/2021/3110622. eCollection 2021.,2021,,3110622,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4257-8444'],,PMC8702334,,"['All authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies show that the expression of activating NK cell receptors is pivotal for efficient recognition of blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and that high expression levels impact favorably on patient survival. This study investigated the potential impact of activating receptor gene variants on NK cell receptor expression and survival in a cohort of AML patients receiving relapse-preventive immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride and low-dose IL-2 (HDC/IL-2). Patients harboring the G allele of rs1049174 in the KLRK1 gene encoding NKG2D showed high expression of NKG2D by CD56(bright) NK cells and a favorable clinical outcome in terms of overall survival. For DNAM-1, high therapy-induced receptor expression entailed improved survival, while patients with high DNAM-1 expression before immunotherapy associated with unfavorable clinical outcome. The previously reported SNPs in NCR3 encoding NKp30, which purportedly influence mRNA splicing into isoforms with discrete functions, did not affect outcome in this study. Our results imply that variations in genes encoding activating NK cell receptors determine receptor expression and clinical outcome in AML immunotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Hussein, Hallner, Wennstrom, Brune, Martner, Hellstrand,', 'Bernson and Thoren.']","['Hussein, Brwa Ali', 'Hallner, Alexander', 'Wennstrom, Lovisa', 'Brune, Mats', 'Martner, Anna', 'Hellstrand, Kristoffer', 'Bernson, Elin', 'Thoren, Fredrik B']","['Hussein BA', 'Hallner A', 'Wennstrom L', 'Brune M', 'Martner A', 'Hellstrand K', 'Bernson E', 'Thoren FB']","['Tumor Immunology (TIMM) Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Tumor Immunology (TIMM) Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Tumor Immunology (TIMM) Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Tumor Immunology (TIMM) Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Tumor Immunology (TIMM) Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Tumor Immunology (TIMM) Laboratory at Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211209,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Histamine/IL-2', 'NK cell receptors', 'Re:Mission trial', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'gene variants', 'immunotherapy', 'single nucleotide polymorphism']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/12/27 06:25'],"['2021/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/27 06:25 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.796072 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Dec 9;12:796072. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.796072. eCollection 2021.,12,,796072,,,,PMC8695486,,"['Authors AM, KH, and FT are authors of issued or pending patents protecting the', 'use of histamine dihydrochloride in cancer immunotherapy.

In particular, progressive alterations of BM stromal cells sustain the survival, proliferation, and drug resistance of tumor B cells during diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The current review describes how the crosstalk between BM stromal cells and lymphoma tumor cells triggers the establishment of the tumor supportive niche. DLBCL, FL, and CLL display distinct patterns of BM involvement, but in each case tumor-infiltrating stromal cells, corresponding to cancer-associated fibroblasts, exhibit specific phenotypic and functional features promoting the recruitment, adhesion, and survival of tumor cells. Tumor cell-derived extracellular vesicles have been recently proposed as playing a central role in triggering initial induction of tumor-supportive niches, notably within the BM. Finally, the disruption of the BM stroma reprogramming emerges as a promising therapeutic option in B-cell lymphomas. Targeting the crosstalk between BM stromal cells and malignant B cells, either through the inhibition of stroma-derived B-cell growth factors or through the mobilization of clonal B cells outside their supportive BM niche, should in particular be further evaluated as a way to avoid relapses by abrogating resistance niches.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Dumontet, Mancini and Tarte.']","['Dumontet, Erwan', 'Mancini, Stephane J C', 'Tarte, Karin']","['Dumontet E', 'Mancini SJC', 'Tarte K']","['Univ Rennes, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Etablissement Francais du Sang (EFS) Bretagne, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) U1236, Rennes, France.', 'CHU Rennes, Pole de Biologie, Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Etablissement Francais du Sang (EFS) Bretagne, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) U1236, Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Etablissement Francais du Sang (EFS) Bretagne, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) U1236, Rennes, France.', 'CHU Rennes, Pole de Biologie, Rennes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211208,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas', 'cancer-associated fibroblasts', 'extracellular vesicles', 'stroma cell', 'tumor microenvironment']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/12/27 06:25'],"['2021/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/27 06:25 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.784691 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Dec 8;12:784691. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.784691. eCollection 2021.,12,,784691,,,,PMC8694563,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose-dependent neurotoxicity is the main factor restricting VCR's clinical application. VCR-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) sometimes results in dose reduction or omission, leading to clinical complications or affecting the patient's quality of life. With regard to the genetic basis of drug responses, preemptive pharmacogenomic testing and simultaneous blood level monitoring could be helpful for the transformation of various findings into individualized therapies. In this review, we discussed the potential associations between genetic variants in genes contributing to the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of VCR and VIPN incidence and severity in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Of note, genetic variants in the CEP72 gene have great potential to be translated into clinical practice. Such a genetic biomarker may help clinicians diagnose VIPN earlier. Besides, genetic variants in other genes, such as CYP3A5, ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2, TTPA, ACTG1, CAPG, SYNE2, SLC5A7, COCH, and MRPL47, have been reported to be associated with the VIPN, but more evidence is needed to validate the findings in the future. In fact, a variety of complex factors jointly determine the VIPN. In implementing precision medicine, the combination of genetic, environmental, and personal variables, along with therapeutic drug monitoring, will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms of VIPN, improving the effectiveness of VCR treatment, reducing adverse reactions, and improving patients' quality of life.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Yang, Hu, Guo, Xia, Zhang, Fang, Li, Xu, Chen, Wang and Wang.']","['Yang, Qing-Yan', 'Hu, Ya-Hui', 'Guo, Hong-Li', 'Xia, Ying', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Fang, Wei-Rong', 'Li, Yun-Man', 'Xu, Jing', 'Chen, Feng', 'Wang, Yong-Ren', 'Wang, Teng-Fei']","['Yang QY', 'Hu YH', 'Guo HL', 'Xia Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Fang WR', 'Li YM', 'Xu J', 'Chen F', 'Wang YR', 'Wang TF']","[""Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'School of Basic Medical Sciences and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'School of Basic Medical Sciences and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'Department of Pharmacology, Addiction Science and Toxicology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211209,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['CEP72', 'VCR- induced peripheral neuropathy', 'pharmacogenomics', 'polymorphism', 'vincristine']",2021/12/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:01,['2021/12/27 06:23'],"['2021/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/27 06:23 [entrez]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.771487 [doi]', '771487 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Dec 9;12:771487. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.771487. eCollection 2021.,12,,771487,,,,PMC8696478,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Older patients who initially receive intensive cytotoxic induction may choose to not proceed with cytotoxic consolidation therapy. Lenalidomide is an orally-administered immunomodulatory small molecule with activity in AML and a favorable safety profile in older adults with active leukemia. We conducted a phase Ib study of lenalidomide as post-remission therapy in older adults and assessed its impact on geriatric functional domains. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were patients with AML over age 60 years who had undergone induction therapy and were poor candidates for cytotoxic consolidation. Lenalidomide was administered for 28 days in three dose cohorts. A Bayesian dose-escalation method determined cohort assignment and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Geriatric assessment (GA) was performed before and after the cycle of lenalidomide. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with median age 68 were treated with at least one 28-day course of lenalidomide. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in three participants at 25 mg, zero participants at 35 mg, and one participant at 50 mg. MTD was 35 mg. Median relapse-free survival was 4.3 months. GA was completed before and after treatment in fifteen patients, demonstrating improved cognitive function and no changes in physical, psychological, or social function after lenalidomide. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide can be safely administered to older adults with AML with preservation of functional domains important to older patients. Serial GA can be performed in a novel drug study as a tool to characterize treatment tolerability.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Recently, cell-free DNA next-generation sequencing (cfDNA NGS) has been used for the timely detection of infectious pathogens including mucormycosis. Herein, we described an 18-year-old male with Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received a timely diagnosis of R. pusillus infection by cell-free DNA next-generation sequencing, and confirmed by silver staining and qPCR on biopsy tissue. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first case of disseminated R. pusillus infection detected by cfDNA NGS and confirmed by histology in an adult leukemia patient. In addition, this case was supposed to be the most extensive R. pusillus infection diagnosed, involving the lung, skin, liver, kidney, spleen and brain, and the only one case who survived the infection had a favorable outcome through treatment with liposome amphotericin B sequential posaconazole. This case suggested that cfDNA NGS could be used to successfully detect rare pathogen infections, and this was especially important for R. pusillus because timely diagnosis and effective treatment could improve the prognosis of this kind of patient.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association', 'for Infectious Diseases.

The authors hypothesized that T cells expressing CARs directed toward two different AML-associated antigens would eradicate tumors and prevent relapse. METHODS: For co-transduction with the authors' previously optimized CLL-1 CAR currently in clinical study (NCT04219163), the authors generated two CARs targeting either CD123 or CD33. The authors then tested the anti-tumor activity of T cells expressing each of the three CARs either alone or after co-transduction. The authors analyzed CAR T-cell phenotype, expansion and transduction efficacy and assessed function by in vitro and in vivo activity against AML cell lines expressing high (MOLM-13: CD123 high, CD33 high, CLL-1 intermediate), intermediate (HL-60: CD123 low, CD33 intermediate, CLL-1 intermediate/high) or low (KG-1a: CD123 low, CD33 low, CLL-1 low) levels of the target antigens. RESULTS: The in vitro benefit of dual expression was most evident when the target cell line expressed low antigen levels (KG-1a). Mechanistically, dual expression was associated with higher pCD3z levels in T cells compared with single CAR T cells on exposure to KG-1a (P < 0.0001). In vivo, combinatorial targeting with CD123 or CD33 and CLL-1 CAR T cells improved tumor control and animal survival for all lines (KG-1a, MOLM-13 and HL-60); no antigen escape was detected in residual tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings demonstrate that combinatorial targeting of CD33 or CD123 and CLL-1 with CAR T cells can control growth of heterogeneous AML tumors.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy.

DESIGN: Single-center randomized controlled design. SETTING: A tertiary care center of national importance PARTICIPANTS: A total of 36 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the maintenance phase of the treatment. INTERVENTION: A five-session (540 min) brief, multidomain, audiovisually aided, therapist-facilitated conjoint intervention module for children with cancer and their parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardized psychological tools for children including CBCL, CPSS (Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Scale), PedsQol (Pediatric Quality of Life), and NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences) neuropsychological battery and parents including PTSD CC (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Civilian Checklist), CHIP (Coping Health Inventory for Parents), CBS (Caregiver Burden Scale), and SRQ (Self-Reporting Questionnaire). RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were randomized to an experimental or a control group. Over 80% agreement was observed on indices of expert evaluation; 100% of participants found the sessions to be helpful, useful, appropriate in terms of time, duration, and place, and interventionist. The participation rate in the sessions was 94% and the study flow was smooth; 97.3% eligible candidates agreed to participate. Furthermore, 100% agreement on performance of activities was observed and the attrition rate was 5.26%. CONCLUSION: This pilot study presents the CIMPALL, which to the best of our knowledge is the first of its kind in India. The data suggest that the CIMPALL intervention is feasibly delivered by a clinical psychologist and that the CIMPALL intervention has an impact on important psychosocial variables for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and their parents.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Bromodomain and extra-terminal inhibitors (BETi) are promising agents for treatment of hematological malignancies; however, the mechanisms underlying sensitivity to BETi and biomarkers to predict sensitivity are yet to be clarified. Here, we established OTX015-resistant MLL-r cell lines (OTX015-R cells) and used them to explore therapeutic targets in BETi-resistant MLL-r leukemia. OTX015-R cells exhibited resistance to various BETi, and levels of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) and BRD4-regulated molecules, such as c-MYC and B-cell/CLL lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), were remarkably increased in OTX015-R cells relative to those in the parental cells; however, BRD4 mRNA transcript levels were not elevated. These results suggest that overexpression of BRD4 protein, through suppression of BRD4 degradation, may contribute to BETi-resistance. Notably, expression of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L5 (UCHL5) was increased in OTX015-R cells. Further, a UCHL5 inhibitor, b-AP15, and UCHL5 knockdown had antitumor effects by degrading BRD4. In addition, sensitivity to OTX015 was partially recovered in OTX015-R cells pretreated with b-AP15. Furthermore, cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibition decreased UCHL5 expression, suppressed OTX015-R cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis. These results indicate that the CDK4/6-UCHL5-BRD4 axis confers resistance to BETi by suppressing BRD4 degradation. We propose that this pathway is a potential novel therapeutic target in BETi-resistant MLL-r leukemia with BRD4 overexpression.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Comparison of incidence of allergic reactions to pegylated E.coli asparaginase (PEGasparaginase) across contemporary paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) protocols is lacking. METHOD AND PATIENTS: Questionnaires were sent to all members of the international ALL Ponte di Legno Toxicity Working Group. Meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the incidence of three types of hypersensitivity (allergy, allergic-like reaction and silent inactivation). Information on protocol level regarding PEGasparaginase dosing regimen, administration route and use of therapeutic drug monitoring was collected for risk analysis. RESULTS: Newly diagnosed patients with ALL (n = 5880), aged 1-24 years old, were enrolled in seven different upfront ALL protocols using PEGasparaginase as first-line treatment. The incidence of allergic reactions (sum of allergies and allergic-like reactions) [95% confidence interval] was 2% [1%; 3%] during induction and 8% [5%; 11%] during postinduction. Route of administration, number of doses, dosage and number of PEGasparaginase-free weeks did not significantly influence risk of hypersensitivity. Multivariate meta-regression analysis suggests that initiation of PEGasparaginase in postinduction and higher number of PEGasparaginase-free intervals increased the risk for allergic reactions. 9-16% and 23-29% of all hypersensitivities were allergic-like reactions and silent inactivation, respectively. CONCLUSION: The incidence of allergic reactions is lower in protocols using PEGasparaginase as first-line treatment compared with that reported for E.coli asparaginase or PEGasparaginase after E.coli asparaginase. Postinduction phase, a higher number of PEGasparaginase-free intervals, and initiation of PEGasparaginase in postinduction phase are risk factors for allergic reactions. These results are important for planning of PEGasparaginase administrations in future frontline therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Other retroviral accessory proteins such as the glycosylated Gag (glycoGag) from the murine leukemia virus (MLV) can also antagonize SER5. In addition, some viruses escape SER5 restriction by expressing a SER5-insensitive envelope (Env) glycoprotein. Here, we studied the activity of human and feline SER5 on HIV-1 and on the two pathogenic retroviruses in cats, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). HIV-1 in absence of Nef is restricted by SER5 from domestic cats and protected by its Nef protein. The sensitivity of feline retroviruses FIV and FeLV to human and feline SER5 is considerably different: FIV is sensitive to feline and human SER5 and lacks an obvious mechanism to counteract SER5 activity, while FeLV is relatively resistant to SER5 inhibition. We speculated that similar to MLV, FeLV-A or FeLV-B express glycoGag proteins and investigated their function against human and feline SER5 in wild type and envelope deficient virus variants. We found that the endogenous FeLV recombinant virus, FeLV-B but not wild type exogenous FeLV-A envelope mediates a strong resistance against human and feline SER5. GlycoGag has an additional but moderate role to enhance viral infectivity in the presence of SER5 that seems to be dependent on the FeLV envelope. These findings may explain, why in vivo FeLV-B has a selective advantage and causes higher FeLV levels in infected cats compared to infections of FeLV-A only.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Its antiangiogenic properties offer the potential for therapeutic intervention in conditions such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that intravitreal administration of recombinant human opticin can safely protect against the development of pathological angiogenesis and promote its regression. We generated and purified recombinant human opticin and investigated its impact on the development and regression of pathological retinal neovascularization following intravitreal administration in murine oxygen-induced retinopathy. We also investigated its effect on normal retinal vascular development and function, following intravitreal injection in neonatal mice, by histological examination and electroretinography. In oxygen-induced retinopathy, intravitreal administration of human recombinant opticin protected against the development of retinal neovascularization to similar extent as aflibercept, which targets VEGF. Opticin also accelerated regression of established retinal neovascularization, though the effect at 18 h was less than that of aflibercept. Intravitreal administration of human recombinant opticin in neonatal mice caused no detectable perturbation of subsequent retinal vascular development or function. In summary we found that intraocular administration of recombinant human opticin protects against the development of pathological angiogenesis in mice and promotes its regression.",['Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

PBSCT recipients have shown higher incidences of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) compared with BMT recipients. In recent years, the efficacy and safety of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for PBSCT recipients has been evaluated worldwide. In the present study, we aimed to compare BMT and PBSCT recipients to identify current improvements and unmet needs among MRD PBSCT recipients. In addition, we evaluated the impact of ATG administration on the outcomes of PBSCT recipients. We retrospectively analyzed patients age >/=16 years with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myelogenous leukemia who underwent their first BMT or PBSCT from an MRD between 2009 and 2018 in Japan. A total of 3599 transplantations were performed (BMT, n=1218; PBSCT without ATG [PBSCT-ATG(-)], n=2288; PBSCT with ATG [PBSCT-ATG(+)], n=93). The PBSCT-ATG(-) group had a higher NRM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.57; P=.005) and lower overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.30; P=.011) compared with the BMT group. Furthermore, the PBSCT-ATG(-) group had higher incidences of grade III-IV, stage 2-4 gut, high-risk, and steroid-refractory acute GVHD compared with the BMT group. Acute GVHD had a negative impact on NRM and OS. The PBSCT-ATG(-) group also was associated with an elevated risk of chronic GVHD (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.57; P < .001) and extensive chronic GVHD (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.68; P < .001). The incidences of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and NRM and chronic GVHD-free relapse-free survival rates were comparable between the PBSCT-ATG(+) and BMT groups. The OS of patients with acute GVHD was similar in the 3 donor groups. Patients treated with reduced-intensity conditioning in the PBSCT-ATG(+) group had a higher relapse rate and lower OS rate compared with those in the BMT group. In this Japanese cohort, standard calcineurin inhibitor-based GVHD prophylaxis was not sufficient for recipients of MRD PBSCT because of the high incidence of severe acute GVHD. Prophylactic ATG was found to be a promising strategy against GVHD.",['Copyright (c) 2022.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical outcomes of haplo-cord HSCT in B-ALL patients. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 112 B-ALL patients who received haplo-cord HSCT and 64 patients who received haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) in our center from 2010 to 2020 were retrospectively included in this study, and clinical outcomes and prognostic factors were further analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 94.6% (106/112) of the haplo-cord patients achieved complete haploidentical chimerism, while 5.4% (6/112) of patients had mixed cord blood chimerism. No differences were observed in neutrophil and platelet recovery or the incidences of GVHD, CMV/EBV viremia, bloodstream infection or hemorrhagic cystitis between the haplo-cord HSCT and haplo-HSCT groups. Compared to haplo-HSCT group, the haplo-cord HSCT group had a higher absolute number of CD3(+) cells (P=0.029) and a lower ratio of CD3(+)CD4(+) /CD3(+)CD8(+) cells (P=0.049) at 1 month after transplantation. Moreover, Haplo-cord HSCT patients showed lower minimal residual disease (MRD) levels at 1 month (P=0.020) and 100 days (P=0.038) after transplantation and better 3-year prognoses than the haplo-HSCT group (OS: P=0.016; DFS: P=0.041; cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR): P=0.016). The CIRs in patients with adverse genomic features (P=0.040) or flow cytometry-based minimal residual disease (FCM-MRD)>/=1x10(-4) (P=0.033) were improved by haplo-cord HSCT. By multivariate analysis, we found that haplo-cord HSCT could independently improve the 3-year OS, DFS and CIR of B-ALL patients (OS: P=0.029; DFS: P=0.024; CIR: P=0.024). Additionally, allo-HSCT at CR1 was an independent parameter associated with 3-year OS for B-ALL patients (P=0.014). FCM-MRD>/=1x10(-4) pre-HSCT could independently predict unfavorable 3-year DFS and CIR (DFS: P=0.020; CIR: P=0.036) in B-ALL patients.

Here, we aim to investigate the activity of VP79s and associated mechanisms of action in multiple myeloma (MM) cells in vitro and ex vivo. MAIN METHODS: The effects of VP79s on cell viability and induction of apoptosis was examined in a panel of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant MM cell lines, as well as ex vivo patient samples and normal donor lymphocytes and platelets. Cell signaling pathways associated with the biological effects of VP79s were analysed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry. Gene expression changes were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. KEY FINDINGS: VP79s was found to rapidly inhibit both constitutively active and IL-6-induced STAT3 signaling with concurrent downregulation of the IL-6 receptors, CD130 and CD126. VP79s induced a rapid and dose-dependent downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (MCL-1). VP79s enhanced bortezomib induced cell death and was also found to overcome bone marrow stromal cell induced drug resistance. VP79s exhibited activity in ex vivo patient samples at concentrations which had no effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lymphocytes and platelets isolated from healthy donors.

Inhibitors against BCR-ABL are effective for the treatment of leukemia; however, a gatekeeper mutation (T315I) in BCR-ABL results in resistance to these inhibitors, which markedly impedes their efficacy. We herein demonstrated that a bis-pyridinium fullerene derivative (BPF) significantly induced apoptosis in human CML-derived K562 cells and ALL-derived SUP-B15 cells via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). BPF reduced the expression of Bcr-Abl mRNA by inhibiting expression of c-Myc through ROS production. BPF also accelerated protein degradation of BCR-ABL through ROS production. Furthermore, BPF down-regulated the expression of not only BCR-ABL but also T315I-mutated BCR-ABL in ROS-dependent manner. As a result, BPF effectively induced apoptosis in transformed Ba/F3 cells expressing both BCR-ABL and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL. Collectively, these results indicate the potential of BPF as an effective leukemia drug that overcomes resistance to BCR-ABL inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Finding specific molecules responsible for mediating drug resistance in AML contributes to the effective reversal of drug resistance. Recent studies have found that mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) is of great significance in the occurrence and development of tumors. In the current study, MSK1 was found highly expressed in drug-resistant AML patients. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been previously validated to be associated with drug resistance in AML. Our study revealed a positive correlation between MSK1 and HO-1 in patient samples. In vitro experiments revealed that the sensitivity of AML cell lines THP-1 and U937 to cytarabine (Ara-C) significantly decreased after overexpression of MSK1. Meanwhile, downregulation of MSK1 by siRNA transfection or treatment of pharmacological inhibitor SB-747651A in AML cell lines and primary AML cells enhanced the sensitivity to Ara-C. Flow cytometry analysis showed that downregulation of MSK1 in AML cells accelerated apoptosis and arrested cell cycle progression in G0/G1 phase. However, the increased cell sensitivity induced by MSK1 downregulation was reversed by the induction of HO-1 inducer Hemin. Through further mechanism exploration, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis demonstrated that brahma related gene 1 (BRG1) was involved in the regulatory effect of MSK1 on HO-1. High expression of MSK1 could promote the resistance of AML through BRG1-mediated upregulation of HO-1. Downregulation of MSK1 enhanced the sensitivity of AML cells to Ara-C. Our findings provide novel ideas for developing effective anti-AML targets.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

A better grasp of the processes of carcinogenesis, aggressiveness, metastasis, treatment resistance, detection of the illness at an earlier stage, and obtaining a better therapeutic response will be made possible. Researchers have discovered that cancerous mutations mainly affect signaling pathways. The Hippo pathway, as one of the main signaling pathways of a cell, has a unique ability to cause cancer. In order to treat cancer, a complete understanding of the Hippo signaling system will be required. On the other hand, interaction with other pathways like Wnt, TGF-beta, AMPK, Notch, JNK, mTOR, and Ras/MAP kinase pathways can contribute to carcinogenesis. Phosphorylation of oncogene YAP and TAZ could lead to leukemogenesis, which this process could be regulated via other signaling pathways.

This study analysed 49 C auris isolates for alterations in hotspot-1 and hotspot-2 of FKS1 for the detection of mutations conferring reduced susceptibility to echinocandins. METHODS: C auris isolates (n = 49) obtained from 18 immunocompromised patients during June 2016-December 2018 were analysed. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed by Etest and broth microdilution-based MICRONAUT-AM assay. Mutations in hotspot-1 and hotspot-2 regions of FKS1 were detected by PCR sequencing and fingerprinting of the isolates was done by short tandem repeat typing. RESULTS: The patients had multiple comorbidities/risk factors for Candida spp. infection including cancer/leukaemia/lymphoma/myeloma (n = 16), arterial/central line (n = 17), urinary catheter (n = 17), mechanical ventilation (n = 14) and major surgery (n = 9) and received antifungal drugs as prophylaxis and/or empiric treatment. Seven patients developed C auris candidemia/breakthrough candidemia, nine patients had candiduria with/without candidemia and four patients developed surgical site/respiratory infection. Resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B was detected in 44 and four isolates, respectively. Twelve C auris isolates from eight patients showed reduced susceptibility to echinocandins. Seven isolates contained hostspot-1 mutations and three isolates from a candidemia patient contained R1354H mutation in hotspot-2 of FKS1. Ten patients died, five were cured, two were lost to follow-up and treatment details for one patient were not available.

Multi-state models can provide additional insights to supplement the original intention-to-treat analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT). We re-analyzed the HOVON102/SAKK30/09 phase III RCT for newly diagnosed AML patients, which randomized between standard induction chemotherapy with or without clofarabine. Using multi-state models, we evaluated the effects of induction chemotherapy outcomes (complete remission [CR], measurable residual disease [MRD]), and post-remission therapy with allogeneic stem cell transplantation [alloSCT] on relapse and death. Through the latter a consistent reduction in the hazard of relapse in the clofarabine arm compared to the standard arm was found, which occurred irrespective of MRD status or post-remission treatment with alloSCT, demonstrating a strong and persistent antileukemic effect of clofarabine. During the time period between achieving CR and possible post-remission treatment with alloSCT, non-relapse mortality was higher in patients receiving clofarabine. An overall net benefit of treatment with clofarabine was identified using the composite endpoint current leukemia-free survival (CLFS).

Its expression has been related to the negative regulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and the polarization of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, thereby altering immunosurveillance and inflammatory mechanisms. An abnormal inflammatory status in the bone marrow microenvironment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) has recently been demonstrated; moreover, in chronic myeloid leukemia a downregulated expression of IRF4 has been found. In this context, we evaluated the IRF4 expression in 119 newly diagnosed consecutive Philadelphia negative MPNs (Ph- MPNs), showing a low expression among the MPNs phenotypes with a more significant decrease in primary myelofibrosis patients. Lower IRF4 levels were associated with JAK2 + and triple negatives cases carrying the worst prognosis. Furthermore, the IRF4 levels were related to leukemic transformation and a shorter leukemia-free survival; moreover, the risk of myelofibrosis transformation in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia patients was more frequent in cases with lower IRF4 levels. Overall, our study demonstrates an IRF4 dysregulated expression in MPNs patients and its association with a worse prognosis. Further studies could validate these data, to improve our knowledge of the MPNs pathogenesis and confirm the IRF4 role as a new prognostic factor.",['(c) 2021.

It suffers from three challenges in practical applications: noise, gene grouping, and adaptive gene selection. This paper aims to solve the above problems by developing the logistic regression with adaptive sparse group lasso penalty (LR-ASGL). A noise information processing method for cancer gene expression profile data is first presented via robust principal component analysis. Genes are then divided into groups by performing weighted gene co-expression network analysis on the clean matrix. By approximating the relative value of the noise size, gene reliability criterion and robust evaluation criterion are proposed. Finally, LR-ASGL is presented for simultaneous cancer diagnosis and adaptive gene selection. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the other four methods in three simulation settings: Gaussian noise, uniformly distributed noise, and mixed noise. The acute leukemia data are adopted as an experimental example to demonstrate the advantages of LR-ASGL in prediction and gene selection.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The burden of late effects across a large number of conditions, in-patient hospitalisation and critical care admissions have not been described using a population-based dataset. We aim to systematically quantify the cumulative burden of late effects across all cancer subtypes, treatment modalities and chemotherapy drug classes. Methods: We employed primary care records linked to hospitals, the death registry and cancer registry from 1998-2020. CTYA survivors were 25 years or younger at the time of cancer diagnosis had survived >/=5 years post-diagnosis. Year-of-birth and sex-matched community controls were used for comparison. We considered nine treatment types, nine chemotherapy classes and 183 physical and mental health late effects. Cumulative burden was estimated using mean cumulative count, which considers recurring events. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the association between treatment exposures and late effects. Excess years of life lost (YLL) attributable to late effects were estimated. Findings: Among 4,063 patients diagnosed with cancer, 3,466 survived >/= 5 years (85%); 13,517 matched controls were identified. The cumulative burden of late effects at age 35 was the highest in survivors of leukaemia (23.52 per individual [95% CI:19.85-29.33]) and lowest in survivors of germ cell tumours (CI:6.04 [5.32-6.91]). In controls, the cumulative burden was 3.99 (CI:3.93-4.08) at age 35 years. When survivors reach age 45, the cumulative burden for immunological conditions and infections was the highest (3.27 [CI:3.01-3.58]), followed by cardiovascular conditions (3.08 [CI:1.98-3.29]). Survivors who received chemotherapy and radiotherapy had the highest disease burden compared to those who received surgery only. These patients also had the highest burden of hospitalisation (by age 45: 10.43 [CI:8.27-11.95]). Survivors who received antimetabolite chemotherapy had the highest disease and hospitalisation burden, while the lowest burden is observed in those receiving antitumour antibiotics. Regression analyses revealed that survivors who received only surgery had lower odds of developing cardiovascular (adjusted odds ratio 0.73 [CI:0.56-0.94]), haematological (aOR 0.51 [CI:0.37-0.70]), immunology and infection (aOR 0.84 [CI:0.71-0.99]) and renal (aOR 0.51 [CI:0.39-0.66]) late effects. By contrast, the opposite trend was observed in survivors who received chemo-radiotherapy. High antimetabolite chemotherapy cumulative dose was associated with increased risks of subsequent cancer (aOR 2.32 [CI:1.06-4.84]), metastatic cancer (aOR 4.44 [CI:1.29-11.66]) and renal (aOR 3.48 [CI:1.36-7.86]) conditions. Patients who received radiation dose of >/=50Gy experienced higher risks of developing metastatic cancer (aOR 5.51 [CI:2.21-11.86]), cancer (aOR 3.77 [CI:2.22-6.34]), haematological (aOR 3.43 [CI:1.54-6.83]) and neurological (aOR 3.24 [CI:1.78-5.66]) conditions. Similar trends were observed in survivors who received more than three teletherapy fields. Cumulative burden analyses on 183 conditions separately revealed varying dominance of different late effects across cancer types, socioeconomic deprivation and treatment modalities. Late effects are associated with excess YLL (i.e., the difference in YLL between survivors with or without late effects), which was the most pronounced among survivors with haematological comorbidities. Interpretation: To our knowledge, this is the first study to dissect and quantify the importance of late morbidities on subsequent survival using linked electronic health records from multiple settings. The burden of late effects is heterogeneous, as is the risk of premature mortality associated with late effects. We provide an extensive knowledgebase to help inform treatment decisions at the point of diagnosis, future interventional trials and late-effects screening centred on the holistic needs of this vulnerable population.",['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],"['Chang, Wai Hoong', 'Katsoulis, Michail', 'Tan, Yen Yi', 'Mueller, Stefanie H', 'Green, Katherine', 'Lai, Alvina G']","['Chang WH', 'Katsoulis M', 'Tan YY', 'Mueller SH', 'Green K', 'Lai AG']","['Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.', 'Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.', 'Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.', 'Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.', 'Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.', 'Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211114,England,Lancet Reg Health Eur,The Lancet regional health.

In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), realgar is usually processed by the water-grinding method clinically, but the mechanism of realgar processing detoxification is still unclear. However, it is necessary to take safety and efficacy into account while evaluating a drug. Methods: Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into control group, realgar products-treated groups, and corresponding subgroups. Biochemistry analysis and histopathological examination were performed in the study, and plasma samples were collected from all the rats for metabolomics analysis. Results: No significant toxicity was observed in rats treated with 0.64 g/kg/day grinding realgar (G-r) and water-grinding realgar (WG-r). When the dose increased to 1.92 g/kg/day, the liver weight coefficients of the rats treated with G-r (HG-r: 3.65 +/- 0.26%) and WG-r (HWG-r: 3.67 +/- 0.14%) increased significantly and severe hepatic injury occurred in comparison to the control group (Group C: 3.00 +/- 0.21%). After one week's withdrawal, the liver injury caused by the high dose of WG-r significantly recovered, while the liver damage caused by G-r was more difficult to recover. In metabolomics analysis, 14 metabolites were identified as the potential biomarkers in realgar-treated rats. These metabolites indicated that there were perturbations of the primary bile acid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism in the realgar-treated groups. Conclusions: These results illustrate that, as a TCM processing method, water grinding had the effect of reducing toxicity, and the metabolomics method may be a valuable tool for studying the toxicity induced by TCM and the mechanism of TCM processing.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Ting Han et al.'],"['Han, Ting', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Xu, Wenjuan', 'Li, Chunshuai', 'Wang, Min', 'Bai, Yuying', 'Yang, Linlin', 'Zhang, Shuyan', 'Jia, Zhe', 'Xu, Xinfang', 'Zhao, Chongjun', 'Wei, Feng', 'Li, Xiangri']","['Han T', 'Zhang H', 'Xu W', 'Li C', 'Wang M', 'Bai Y', 'Yang L', 'Zhang S', 'Jia Z', 'Xu X', 'Zhao C', 'Wei F', 'Li X']","['Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd., Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211214,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:01,['2021/12/24 05:48'],"['2021/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 05:48 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/8538287 [doi]'],epublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2021 Dec 14;2021:8538287. doi: 10.1155/2021/8538287. eCollection 2021.,2021,,8538287,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1730-5455'],,PMC8692000,,['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment of MKD focuses on the suppression of recurrent hyperinflammatory attacks using anti-inflammatory drugs. Recently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) was shown to successfully ameliorate autoinflammatory attacks in patients with MKD. Here, we report a case of an infant who showed severe recurrent systemic inflammation and was diagnosed with MA. Although she responded to steroids, her symptoms relapsed after the dose was tapered, and organ deterioration occurred. Therefore, at the age of 11 months, HCT from a matched, unrelated donor was performed for curative treatment. However, at 50 days after transplantation, acute myeloid leukemia was diagnosed, which was chemo-refractory. A second HCT from her haploidentical father was performed to treat the acute myeloid leukemia, but the patient died of sepsis on day 4 after transplantation. This is the first report of malignancy following HCT for MA. Our findings suggest that normalizing the mevalonate pathway after HCT in patients with MKD impacts patients differently depending on the clinical spectrum and severity of disease.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Kim, Lee, Do, Kim, Kang, Koh and Im.']","['Kim, Hyery', 'Lee, Beom Hee', 'Do, Hyo-Sang', 'Kim, Gu-Hwan', 'Kang, Sunghan', 'Koh, Kyung-Nam', 'Im, Ho Joon']","['Kim H', 'Lee BH', 'Do HS', 'Kim GH', 'Kang S', 'Koh KN', 'Im HJ']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."", 'Medical Genetics Center, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Medical Genetics Center, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.""]",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20211207,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'inflammation', 'mavalonic kinase deficiency', 'mevalonic aciduria']",2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:00,['2021/12/24 05:47'],"['2021/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 05:47 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.782780 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Dec 7;12:782780. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.782780. eCollection 2021.,12,,782780,,,,PMC8691729,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: A detailed NMR study revealed that only two of the five tested drugs, Torsemide and Deferasirox, interacted with Mcl-1. NMR data analysis allowed the complete characterization of the binding mode of both drugs to Mcl-1, including the estimation of their affinity for Mcl-1. Biological assays evidenced that the biological activity of Torsemide was lower as compared to the Deferasirox, which was able to efficiently and selectively inhibit the anti-apoptotic activity of Mcl-1. Finally, docking and molecular dynamics led to a 3D model for the Deferasirox:Mcl-1 complex and revealed the positioning of the drug in the Mcl-1 P2/P3 pockets as well as almost all synthetic Mcl-1 inhibitors. Interestingly, contrary to known synthetic Mcl-1 inhibitors which interact through Arg263, Deferasirox, establishes a salt bridge with Lys234. Conclusion: Deferasirox could be a potential candidate for drug repositioning as Mcl-1 inhibitor.",['(c) 2021 Bourafai-Aziez et al.'],"['Bourafai-Aziez, Asma', 'Benabderrahmane, Mohammed', 'Paysant, Hippolyte', 'Weiswald, Louis-Bastien', 'Poulain, Laurent', 'Carlier, Ludovic', 'Ravault, Delphine', 'Jouanne, Marie', 'Coadou, Gael', 'Oulyadi, Hassan', 'Voisin-Chiret, Anne-Sophie', 'Sopkova-de Oliveira Santos, Jana', 'Sebban, Muriel']","['Bourafai-Aziez A', 'Benabderrahmane M', 'Paysant H', 'Weiswald LB', 'Poulain L', 'Carlier L', 'Ravault D', 'Jouanne M', 'Coadou G', 'Oulyadi H', 'Voisin-Chiret AS', 'Sopkova-de Oliveira Santos J', 'Sebban M']","['Normandie Universite, UNIROUEN, INSA de Rouen, CNRS Laboratoire COBRA (UMR 6014 & FR 3038), Rouen, 76000, France.', 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, CERMN, Caen, 14000, France.', 'Normandie Universite, UNICAEN, Inserm U1086 ANTICIPE <<Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment>>, Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Ovarian Cancers Group (BioTICLA), Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer F.

Few studies have researched the relationship between maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) and cancer risk. We hypothesized long non-coding RNA MEG3 polymorphisms might influence the risk of childhood ALL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a total of 266 patients with childhood ALL and 266 healthy controls, genotypes of MEG3 rs7158663, rs3087918, rs11160608 and rs4081134 single nucleotide polymorphisms were investigated for their associations with childhood ALL. RESULTS: MEG3 rs7158663 AG and AA genotypes were significantly associated with ALL [odds ratio=1.61 (95% confidence interval=1.12-2.31) and 2.21 (1.16-4.22), respectively]. The A allele also exhibited a statistical association with higher risk of ALL (p=0.0015). There was no positive association as for rs3087918, rs11160608 or rs4081134. Interestingly, a significant interaction between MEG3 rs7158663 and age (>/=3.5 years) and gender (male) was found. CONCLUSION: MEG3 rs7158663 AG/AA genotypes were associated with higher susceptibility to childhood ALL.

However, there is little knowledge of the relation between muscle strength decline and clinical outcomes of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). This study aimed to determine the impact of pre-transplant lower extremity muscle strength (LEMS) on post-transplant overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 97 adult patients underwent allo-HSCT during 2012-2020. LEMS was defined as knee extension force divided by patient's body weight. The patients were divided into low and high LEMS groups based on pre-transplant LEMS. OS was measured using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model. The cumulative incidence of NRM was evaluated using the Fine and Gray method, with relapse considered as a competing risk event. RESULTS: Probability of OS was significantly lower in the low LEMS groups (HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.20 to 5.12, p=0.014) than in the high LEMS group on multivariate analysis. Five-year OS was 25.8% and 66.4% in the low and high LEMS groups, respectively. Risk of NRM was significantly higher in the low LEMS group (HR 4.49, 95% CI 1.28 to 15.68, p=0.019) than in the high LEMS group.

However, adherence to exercise was lower in older adults compared to their younger counterparts. We then leveraged a mobile app to deliver EXCAP((c)(R)) and adapted the intervention [Geriatric-Oncology (GO)-EXCAP] for older patients with myeloid neoplasms. In this pilot randomized trial, the primary goal is to determine effect sizes. We propose to assess the preliminary efficacy of GO-EXCAP compared to a behavioral placebo control on physical function, patient-reported outcomes (fatigue, mood, and quality of life), and inflammatory markers in 100 patients aged >/=60 years with myeloid neoplasms receiving outpatient chemotherapy. METHODS: GO-EXCAP consists of the EXCAP((c)(R)) exercise prescription (daily home-based progressive aerobic walking and resistance exercises with rated perceived exercise of 5-8), EXCAP((c)(R)) kit (i.e., activity tracker, resistance bands, print manual, bag), a mobile app, and an in-person or virtual session with the exercise physiologist to deliver exercise prescription. The intervention will last for three cycles of chemotherapy (approximately 12 weeks). The primary outcome measure will be physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery). Secondary outcome measures include fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory), mood (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia). Exploratory outcome measures include inflammatory markers. DISCUSSION: Older adults with myeloid neoplasms receiving outpatient chemotherapy serve as an ideal model for studying an individually tailored mobile health exercise intervention in vulnerable older patients receiving cancer treatments to prevent physical function decline and improve symptoms.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The OGG1 glycosylase function depletion has been seen to obstruct pathological conditions such as inflammation, A3 T-cell lymphoblastic acute leukemia growth, and neurodegenerative diseases, thus warranting OGG1 as an attractive anti-cancer enzyme. Herein, we employed several drug libraries intending to screen non-toxic inhibitory molecules against the active pocket of the enzyme that achieved stable binding mode in dynamics. Two anti-cancer compounds ([O-]C1=C(CC2=CC=CC=C2)SC(=[N+]1CC(=O)NC3=NC=C(CC4=CC=CC=C4)S3)S and CCCN(CCC)[S]-(=O)(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)NNC2=NC3=CC=C(Br)C=C3C(=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4) from Selleckchem.com were identified to occupy the active pocket of OGG1 and bind with greater affinity than Control TH5487. The binding affinity of Top-1 is -11.6 kcal/mol while that of Top-2 is -10.7 kcal/mol in contrast to TH5487 Control (-9 kcal/mol). During molecular dynamic simulations versus time, the said compounds are tightly held by the enzyme with no minor structural deviations reported except flexible loops in particular those present at the N and C-terminal. Both the compounds produced extensive hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme along with stable hydrogen bonding. The docking and molecular dynamics simulations predictions were further validated by molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) and Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA), and WaterSwap binding energies that validated strong binding of the compounds to the enzyme. The MM/GBSA binding free energy for Top-1 complex is -28.10 kcal/mol, Top-2 complex is -50.14 kcal/mol) and Control is -46.91 kcal/mol while MM/PBSA value for Top-1, Top-2 and Control is -23.38 kcal/mol, -35.29 kcal/mol and -38.20 kcal/mol, respectively. Computational pharmacokinetics support good druglike candidacy of the compounds with acceptable profile of pharmacokinetics and very little toxicity.

The most frequent cause of death from haematological malignancies is multiple organ failure due to neoplastic organ infiltration and/or septic shock. Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare malignant nodal or extranodal tumour with histiocytic immunophenotype that originates from a lymphohematopoietic precursor. The patients with HS usually have a poor prognosis due to its aggressive clinical behaviour. Rare cases of undiagnosed sudden HS death have been described in the literature. METHODS: A forensic autopsy of a 46-year-old white male who died at home suddenly and unexpectedly without warning conditions or known diseases. Gross analysis, histology and toxicology were also performed. RESULTS: The diagnosis of HS of the ileum with secondary nodal and cardiac metastatization was made.

Its multiresistant character is becoming a major health problem, yet the pathogenicity of S. pettenkoferi is poorly characterized. In this study, the pathogenicity of a S. pettenkoferi clinical isolate from diabetic foot osteomyelitis was compared with a Staphylococcus aureus strain in various in vitro and in vivo experiments. Growth kinetics were compared against S. aureus, and bacteria survival was assessed in the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line, the THP-1 human leukemia monocytic cell line, and the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. Ex vivo analysis was performed in whole blood survival assays and in vivo assays via the infection model of zebrafish embryos. Moreover, whole-genome analysis was performed. Our results show that S. pettenkoferi was able to survive in human blood, human keratinocytes, murine macrophages, and human macrophages. S. pettenkoferi demonstrated its virulence by causing substantial embryo mortality in the zebrafish model.

We recently found that Tax-1 interacts with transcription elongation factor for RNA polymerase II 2, ELL2, which enhances Tax-1-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-1 promotor. Here, we characterize the Tax-1:ELL2 interaction and its impact on viral transactivation by confocal imaging, co-immunoprecipitation, and luciferase assays. We found that Tax-1 and ELL2 not only co-precipitate, but also co-localize in dot-like structures in the nucleus. Tax-1:ELL2 complex formation occurred independently of Tax-1 point mutations, which are crucial for post translational modifications (PTMs) of Tax-1, suggesting that these PTMs are irrelevant for Tax-1:ELL2 interaction. In contrast, Tax-1 deletion mutants lacking either N-terminal (aa 1-37) or C-terminal regions (aa 150-353) of Tax-1 were impaired in interacting with ELL2. Contrary to Tax-1, the related, non-oncogenic Tax-2B from HTLV-2B did not interact with ELL2. Finally, we found that ELL2-R1 (aa 1-353), which carries an RNA polymerase II binding domain, and ELL2-R3 (aa 515-640) are sufficient to interact with Tax-1; however, only ELL2-truncations expressing R1 could enhance Tax-1-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-1 promoter.

However, the effect of LIF as a tumor microenvironment factor on plasticity control in breast cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, an in vitro investigation is conducted to determine the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and fibroblasts. Based on the results, cancer-associated fibroblasts are producers of LIF in the cocultivation system with breast cancer cells. Treatment with the CAF-CM and human LIF protein significantly promoted stemness through the dedifferentiation process and regaining of stem-cell-like properties. In addition, the results indicate that activation of LIFR signaling in breast cancer cells in the existence of CAF-secreted LIF can induce Nanog and Oct4 expression and increase breast cancer stem cell markers CD24-/CD44+. In contrast, suppression of the LIF receptor by human LIF receptor inhibition antibody decreased the cancer stem cell markers. We found that LIF was frequently overexpressed by CAFs and that LIF expression is necessary for dedifferentiation of breast cancer cell phenotype and regaining of cancer stem cell properties.

This study aimed to identify the prevalence of IDH1/2 mutations in acute leukemia patients. The study cohort included 43 AML patients and 30 childhood ALL patients, from whom DNA bone marrow samples were taken. The alteration hotspots in codons IDH1 (R132) and IDH2 (R172 and R140) were examined via direct sequencing. Mutations in IDH1 were detected in 7 out of 43 (16.2%) AML patients; 5 of them occurred at codon R132. The other two mutations included a single-nucleotide polymorphism, which affected codon G105 in one patient. However, no mutation was detected in the IDH2 in any of the patients. Moreover, no mutations were detected in either IDH1 or IDH2 in ALL patients. The dominance of IDH1 mutations in AML, which was 16%, emphasizes the existence of the mutation in our population.

Aging-associated changes in the immune system are connected to other age-related diseases, suggesting that immune system rejuvenation may provide a feasible route to improving overall health in the elderly. The Sir2 family of proteins, also called sirtuins, have been broadly implicated in genome homeostasis, cellular metabolism, and aging. Sirtuins are key responders to cellular and environmental stress and, in the case of the nuclear sirtuins, they do so by directing responses to chromatin that include gene expression regulation, retrotransposon repression, enhanced DNA damage repair, and faithful chromosome segregation. In the immune system, sirtuins instruct cellular differentiation from hematopoietic precursors and promote leukocyte polarization and activation. In hematopoietic stem cells, sirtuins safeguard quiescence and stemness to prevent cellular exhaustion. Regulation of cytokine production, which, in many cases, requires NF-kappaB regulation, is the best-characterized mechanism by which sirtuins control innate immune reactivity. In adaptive immunity, sirtuins promote T cell subset differentiation by controlling master regulators, thereby ensuring an optimal balance of helper (Th) T cell-dependent responses. Sirtuins are very important for immune regulation, but the means by which they regulate immunosenescence are not well understood. This review provides an integrative overview of the changes associated with immune system aging and its potential relationship with the roles of nuclear sirtuins in immune cells and overall organismal aging. Given the anti-aging properties of sirtuins, understanding how they contribute to immune responses is of vital importance and may help us develop novel strategies to improve immune performance in the aging organism.",,"['Gamez-Garcia, Andres', 'Vazquez, Berta N']","['Gamez-Garcia A', 'Vazquez BN']","['Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Ctra de Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles s/n, 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Ctra de Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles s/n, 08916 Badalona, Spain.', ""Unitat de Citologia i d'Histologia, Departament de Biologia Cellular, Fisiologia i Immunologia, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB), Cerdanyola del Valles, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211123,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['aging', 'epigenetics', 'immune senescence', 'immune system', 'inflammation', 'sirtuins']",2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:00,['2021/12/24 01:12'],"['2021/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:12 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['genes12121856 [pii]', '10.3390/genes12121856 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2021 Nov 23;12(12). pii: genes12121856. doi: 10.3390/genes12121856.,12,12,,,,"['895979/European Union', 'FI_B 00293/Agency for Administration of University and Research']",PMC8701065,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several of the isolated compounds inhibited the growth of both cell lines. Lignans showed more potent activity than other classes of compounds. A comparison of the activities of compounds 1-8 revealed that the presence of a trans-lactone (linkage of C-6 to C-7) correlated with increased activity. Diterpenes showed moderate activity, and the presence of a ketone moiety at the C-7 position correlated with increased activity in compounds 12-21. In addition, biflavones showed moderate activity, and the presence of methoxy functions appeared to influence the activity of these compounds.

A majority of zinc finger proteins bind DNA and act as transcription factors. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11B (BCL11B) represents one member of the large family of zinc finger proteins. The N-terminal domain of BCL11B was shown to be crucial for BCL11B to exert its proper function by homodimerization. Here, we describe an easy and fast preparation protocol to yield the fluorescently tagged protein of the recombinant N-terminal BCL11B zinc finger domain (BCL11B42-94) for in vitro studies. First, we expressed fluorescently tagged BCL11B42-94 in E. coli and described the subsequent purification utilizing immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography to achieve very high yields of a purified fusion protein of 200 mg/L culture. We proceeded with characterizing the atypical zinc finger domain using circular dichroism and size exclusion chromatography. Validation of the functional fluorescent pair CyPet-/EYFP-BCL11B42-94 was achieved with Forster resonance energy transfer.

In this study, janerin was isolated form Centaurothamnus maximus, and its cytotoxic molecular mechanism was studied in THP-1 human leukemic cells. Janerin inhibited the proliferation of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Janerin caused the cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase by decreasing the CDK1/Cyclin-B complex. Subsequently, we found that janerin promoted THP-1 cell death through apoptosis as indicated by flow cytometry. Moreover, apoptosis induction was confirmed by the upregulation of Bax, cleaved PARP-1, and cleaved caspase 3 and the downregulation of an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 biomarker. In addition, immunoblotting indicated a dose dependent upregulation of P38-MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation during janerin treatment. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that janerin may be capable of inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the MAPK pathway, which would be one of the mechanisms underlying its anticancer activity.

Test extracts were then subjected to a battery of in vitro assays i.e., antioxidants (DDPH scavenging, antioxidant capacity, and reducing power estimation), antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal, and antileishmanial), cytotoxic (brine shrimps, THP-1 human leukemia cell lines and normal lymphocytes), and protein kinase inhibition assays. Maximum phenolic and flavonoid contents were computed in distilled water-acetone and acetone extracts (i.e., 16 +/- 1 mug/mg extract and 8 +/- 0.4/mg extract, respectively).

Results showed that all the extracts of B. subtilis-fermented dehulled adlay (BDA) and dehulled adlay (DA) had no inhibition effect on human embryonic kidney 239T cells. The anti-proliferative activities of the extracts from BDA against six types of tumor cells were almost always significantly higher than DA. Compared with others, the n-butanol extract of BDA (BDA-Nb) exhibited stronger anti-proliferative activities against human leukemia K562 cells and human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells. Importantly, the anti-proliferative activity of fermented dehulled adlay against K562 cells was firstly discovered.

Therefore, it is important to define ineligibility for remission induction chemotherapy. We retrospectively assessed 153 consecutive adult de novo AML patients undergoing remission induction chemotherapy and defined early mortality as death within the first 60 days of treatment. The 153 patients were stratified into the early mortality group (n = 29) and the non-early mortality group (n = 124). We identified potential factors to which early mortality could be attributed, investigated the cumulative incidence of early mortality for each aspect, and quantified the elements. The early mortality rate in our study cohort was 19.0%. Age >/= 65 years (odds ratio (OR): 3.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-9.44; p = 0.041), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >/= 2 (OR: 4.87; 95% CI: 1.77-13.41; p = 0.002), and lactate dehydrogenase >/= 1000 IU/L (OR: 4.20; 95% CI: 1.57-11.23; p = 0.004) were the risk factors that substantially increased early mortality in AML patients.

For instance, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), while most patients achieve a complete remission with conventional chemotherapy or the combination of a hypomethylating agent and venetoclax, de novo or acquired drug resistance often presents an insurmountable challenge, especially in older patients. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP1 and PARP2, are involved in detecting DNA damage and repairing it through multiple pathways, including base excision repair, single-strand break repair, and double-strand break repair. In the context of AML, PARP inhibitors (PARPi) could potentially exploit the frequently dysfunctional DNA repair pathways that, similar to deficiencies in homologous recombination in BRCA-mutant disease, set the stage for cell killing. PARPi appear to be especially effective in AML with certain gene rearrangements and molecular characteristics (RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and PML-RARA fusions, FLT3- and IDH1-mutated). In addition, PARPi can enhance the efficacy of other agents, particularly alkylating agents, TOP1 poisons, and hypomethylating agents, that induce lesions ordinarily repaired via PARP1-dependent mechanisms. Conversely, emerging reports suggest that long-term treatment with PARPi for solid tumors is associated with an increased incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML. Here, we (i) review the pre-clinical and clinical data on the role of PARPi, specifically olaparib, talazoparib, and veliparib, in aggressive myeloid neoplasms and (ii) discuss the reported risk of MDS/AML with PARPi, especially as the indications for PARPi use expand to include patients with potentially curable cancer.",,"['Csizmar, Clifford M', 'Saliba, Antoine N', 'Swisher, Elizabeth M', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Csizmar CM', 'Saliba AN', 'Swisher EM', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Oncology Research, Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211220,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage repair', 'PARP inhibitors', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'base excision repair', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'myeloid neoplasms', 'non-homologous end-joining', 'secondary malignancies', 'synthetic lethality']",2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:01,['2021/12/24 01:07'],"['2021/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:07 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13246385 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13246385 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 20;13(24). pii: cancers13246385. doi: 10.3390/cancers13246385.,13,24,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1221-8854', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5134-7336', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4900-7145']",['P50 CA136393/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC8699275,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does Anomery of Lactose Matter?,6365 [pii] 10.3390/cancers13246365 [doi],"The disaccharide lactose is an excipient commonly used in pharmaceutical products. The two anomers, alpha- and beta-lactose (alpha-L/beta-L), differ by the orientation of the C-1 hydroxyl group on the glucose unit. In aqueous solution, a mutarotation process leads to an equilibrium of about 40% alpha-L and 60% beta-L at room temperature. Beyond a pharmaceutical excipient in solid products, alpha-L has immuno-modulatory effects and functions as a major regulator of TIM-3/Gal-9 immune checkpoint, through direct binding to the beta-galactoside-binding lectin galectin-9. The blockade of the co-inhibitory checkpoint TIM-3 expressed on T cells with anti-TIM-3 antibodies represents a promising approach to combat different onco-hematological diseases, in particular myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. In parallel, the discovery and development of anti-TIM-3 small molecule ligands is emerging, including peptides, RNA aptamers and a few specifically designed heterocyclic molecules. An alternative option consists of targeting the different ligands of TIM-3, notably Gal-9 recognized by alpha-lactose. Modulation of the TIM-3/Gal-9 checkpoint can be achieved with both alpha- and beta-lactose. Moreover, lactose is a quasi-pan-galectin ligand, capable of modulating the functions of most of the 16 galectin molecules. The present review provides a complete analysis of the pharmaceutical and galectin-related biological functions of (alpha/beta)-lactose. A focus is made on the capacity of lactose and Gal-9 to modulate both the TIM-3/Gal-9 and PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoints in oncology. Modulation of the TIM-3/Gal-9 checkpoint is a promising approach for the treatment of cancers and the role of lactose in this context is discussed. The review highlights the immuno-regulatory functions of lactose, and the benefit of the molecule well beyond its use as a pharmaceutical excipient.",,"['Bailly, Christian', 'Thuru, Xavier', 'Quesnel, Bruno']","['Bailly C', 'Thuru X', 'Quesnel B']","['OncoWitan, Scientific Consulting Office, 59290 Lille, France.', 'University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, UMR9020-UMR1277-Canther-Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies, 59000 Lille, France.', 'University of Lille, CNRS, Inserm, CHU Lille, UMR9020-UMR1277-Canther-Cancer Heterogeneity, Plasticity and Resistance to Therapies, 59000 Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211218,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['PD-1/PD-L1', 'TIM-3', 'cancer', 'galectin-9', 'immune checkpoint', 'lactose', 'soluble PD-L1']",2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:01,['2021/12/24 01:07'],"['2021/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:07 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13246365 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13246365 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 18;13(24). pii: cancers13246365. doi: 10.3390/cancers13246365.,13,24,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2973-9357', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0998-4160', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6563-2709']",,PMC8699133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenotype is often observed by evaluating the mitochondrial oxygen consumption of blasts, but most of the oximetry protocols were established from leukemia cell lines without validation on primary leukemia cells. Moreover, the cultures and storage conditions of blasts freshly extracted from patient blood or bone marrow cause stress, which must be evaluated before determining oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Herein, we evaluated different conditions to measure the oxygen consumption of blasts using extracellular flow analyzers. We first determined the minimum number of blasts required to measure OXPHOS. Next, we compared the OXPHOS of blasts cultured for 3 h and 18 h after collection and found that to maintain metabolic organization for 18 h, cytokine supplementation is necessary. Cytokines are also needed when measuring OXPHOS in cryopreserved, thawed and recultured blasts. Next, the concentrations of respiratory chain inhibitors and uncoupler FCCP were established. We found that the FCCP concentration required to reach the maximal respiration of blasts varied depending on the patient sample analyzed.

They can signal using a scaffolding mechanism that involves a conserved split helical dimerization (SHED) module. We recently identified PEAK3 as a novel member of this family based on structural homology; however, its signaling mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we found that, although it can self-associate, PEAK3 shows higher evolutionary divergence than PEAK1/2. Moreover, the PEAK3 protein is strongly expressed in human hematopoietic cells and is upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia. Functionally, PEAK3 overexpression in U2OS sarcoma cells enhanced their growth and migratory properties, while its silencing in THP1 leukemic cells reduced these effects. Importantly, an intact SHED module was required for these PEAK3 oncogenic activities. Mechanistically, through a phosphokinase survey, we identified PEAK3 as a novel inducer of AKT signaling, independent of growth-factor stimulation. Then, proteomic analyses revealed that PEAK3 interacts with the signaling proteins GRB2 and ASAP1/2 and the protein kinase PYK2, and that these interactions require the SHED domain. Moreover, PEAK3 activated PYK2, which promoted PEAK3 tyrosine phosphorylation, its association with GRB2 and ASAP1, and AKT signaling. Thus, the PEAK1-3 pseudo-kinases may use a conserved SHED-dependent mechanism to activate specific signaling proteins to promote oncogenesis.",,"['Ounoughene, Youcef', 'Fourgous, Elise', 'Boublik, Yvan', 'Saland, Estelle', 'Guiraud, Nathan', 'Recher, Christian', 'Urbach, Serge', 'Fort, Philippe', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Fesquet, Didier', 'Roche, Serge']","['Ounoughene Y', 'Fourgous E', 'Boublik Y', 'Saland E', 'Guiraud N', 'Recher C', 'Urbach S', 'Fort P', 'Sarry JE', 'Fesquet D', 'Roche S']","['CRBM, University Montpellier, CNRS, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, F-34000 Montpellier, France.', 'CRBM, University Montpellier, CNRS, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, F-34000 Montpellier, France.', 'CRBM, University Montpellier, CNRS, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, F-34000 Montpellier, France.', 'CRCT, INSERM, CNRS, University of Toulouse, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, F-31037 Toulouse, France.', 'CRCT, INSERM, CNRS, University of Toulouse, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, F-31037 Toulouse, France.', 'CRCT, INSERM, CNRS, University of Toulouse, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, F-31037 Toulouse, France.', 'IGF, CNRS, INSERM, University Montpellier, F-34000 Montpellier, France.', 'CRBM, University Montpellier, CNRS, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, F-34000 Montpellier, France.', 'CRCT, INSERM, CNRS, University of Toulouse, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, F-31037 Toulouse, France.', 'CRBM, University Montpellier, CNRS, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, F-34000 Montpellier, France.', 'CRBM, University Montpellier, CNRS, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, F-34000 Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211217,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT signaling', 'cell growth and migration', 'cell signaling', 'oncogene', 'pseudo-kinase', 'tyrosine kinase']",2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:01,['2021/12/24 01:07'],"['2021/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:07 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13246344 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13246344 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 17;13(24). pii: cancers13246344. doi: 10.3390/cancers13246344.,13,24,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3626-250X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5997-8722', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6704-2032', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5657-9689', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3413-3859']",['Equipe Labellisee LIGUE2017 and 2020/La Ligue Contre le Cancer'],PMC8699254,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this systematic review and network meta-analysis is to evaluate the role of serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) for ovarian reserve screening and the risk of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) according to the subtype of childhood cancer. (2) Methods: PRISMA-NMA guidelines were followed. We carried out a network meta-analysis based on a random effects model for mixed multiple treatment comparisons to rank childhood cancers effects on fertility by surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Studies were selected only if they had an age-matched control group. Quality assessment was performed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The co-primary outcomes were mean AMH levels and the incidence of POI. (3) Results: A total of 8 studies (1303 participants) were included. Women treated for a neuroblastoma during infancy were more likely to be ranked first for impaired AMH levels (SUCRA = 65.4%), followed by mixed CCS (SUCRA = 29.6%). The greatest rates of POI were found in neuroblastoma survivors (SUCRA = 42.5%), followed by acute lymphoid leukemia (SUCRA = 26.3%) or any other neoplasia (SUCR A = 20.5%). (4) Conclusions: AMH represents a trustworthy approach for ovarian reserve screening. Direct and indirect comparisons found no differences in mean AMH levels and POI risk between subtypes of CCS and healthy controls. SUCRA analysis showed that female neuroblastoma survivors were more at risk for reduced serum AMH levels and increased risk of POI.",,"['Torella, Marco', 'Riemma, Gaetano', 'De Franciscis, Pasquale', 'La Verde, Marco', 'Colacurci, Nicola']","['Torella M', 'Riemma G', 'De Franciscis P', 'La Verde M', 'Colacurci N']","['Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit, Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialized Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80128 Naples, Italy.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit, Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialized Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80128 Naples, Italy.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit, Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialized Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80128 Naples, Italy.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit, Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialized Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80128 Naples, Italy.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit, Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialized Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80128 Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211216,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['alkylating agents', 'anti-Mullerian hormone', 'childhood cancer survivors', 'fertility', 'ovarian reserve', 'premature ovarian insufficiency', 'radiotherapy']",2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:01,['2021/12/24 01:07'],"['2021/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:07 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13246331 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13246331 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 16;13(24). pii: cancers13246331. doi: 10.3390/cancers13246331.,13,24,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3676-7716'],,PMC8699404,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed at assessing the feasibility, efficacy, safety, and satisfaction of an osteopathic intervention in CAYA-H attending an 11-week precision-based exercise program (PEx). All of the participants were given 4-10 treatments according to the prescription ordered by the sports medicine doctor in charge of the PEx, and the following outcomes were assessed: (1) spinal column range of motion (ROM) by palpation; (2) lower and upper limb joints ROM by a goniometer; (3) orthostatic posture by plumb line assessment; (4) chest and abdomen mobility by inspection and palpation; (5) cranial-sacral rhythmic impulse (CRI) by palpation; and (6) adverse effects. Goal attainment scaling (GAS) was used to identify the accomplishment of a desired clinical result. Moreover, HSCT patients who were affected with graft-versus-host disease and/or osteonecrosis had their joints assessed in terms of ROM as tools to monitor the effectiveness of immunosuppressive treatment. A total of 231 CAYA-H were identified, and 104 participated in the study (age 10.66 +/- 4.51 yrs; 43% F). PEx plus osteopathy reached positive GAS scores by improving the ROMs of the spinal column and/or limbs (81% and 78%, respectively), chest and abdomen mobility (82%), and CRI (76%). Only minor reversible adverse effects were noticed during the study.

The incidence declines significantly after age 15, and distinct tumor molecular features are seen across the age spectrum. Standard of care treatment consists of maximal safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation and/or chemotherapy. Adjuvant treatment decisions are based on individual patient risk factors and have been informed by decades of prospective clinical trials. These trials have historically relied on arbitrary age cutoffs for inclusion (age 16, 18, or 21, for example), while trials that include adult patients or stratify patients by molecular features of disease have been rare. The aim of this literature review is to review the history of clinical trials in medulloblastoma, with an emphasis on selection criteria, and argue in favor of rational and inclusive trials based on molecular features of disease as opposed to chronological age. We performed a scoping literature review for medulloblastoma and clinical trials and include a summary of those results. We also discuss some of the significant advances made in understanding the molecular biology of medulloblastoma within the past decade, most notably the identification of four distinct subgroups based on gene expression profiling. We will also cite the recent experiences of childhood leukemia and the emergence of tissue-agnostic therapies as examples of successes of rationally designed, inclusive trials translating to improved clinical outcomes for patients across the age spectrum. Despite the prior trial history and recent molecular advances outcomes remain poor for ~30% of medulloblastoma patients.

We aimed to describe time period- and age-dependent outcomes by reporting real-world data of CML patients from Switzerland. METHODS: Population-based incidence, mortality, and survival were assessed for four different study periods and age groups on the basis of aggregated data from Swiss Cantonal Cancer Registries. RESULTS: A total of 1552 new CML cases were reported from 1995 to 2017. The age-standardized rate (ASR) for the incidence remained stable, while the ASR for mortality decreased by 50-80%, resulting in a five-year RS from 36% to 74% over all four age groups. Importantly, for patients <60 years (yrs), the five-year RS increased only in earlier time periods up to 92%, whereas for older patients (+80 yrs), the five-year RS continued to increase later, however, reaching only 53% until 2017. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based study of CML patients in Switzerland confirming similar data compared to other population-based registries in Europe. The RS increased significantly in all age groups over the last decades after the establishment of TKI therapy. Interestingly, we found a more prominent increase in RS of patients with older age at later observation periods (45%) compared to patients at younger age (10%), implicating a greater benefit from TKI treatment for elderly occurring with delay since the establishment of TKI therapy. Our findings suggest more potential to improve CML therapy, especially for older patients.",,"['Daskalakis, Michael', 'Feller, Anita', 'Noetzli, Jasmine', 'Bonadies, Nicolas', 'Arndt, Volker', 'Baerlocher, Gabriela Maria', 'The Nicer Working Group']","['Daskalakis M', 'Feller A', 'Noetzli J', 'Bonadies N', 'Arndt V', 'Baerlocher GM', 'The Nicer Working Group']","['Department of Hematology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Freiburgstrasse 18, 3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of BioMedicalResearch (DMBR), University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 40, 3008 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Foundation National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration (NICER), University of Zurich, Seilergraben 49, 8001 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'National Agency for Cancer Registration (NACR) Operated by NICER, University of Zurich, 8001 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Freiburgstrasse 18, 3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Cabinet Noetzli, Avenue de Rumine 35, 1005 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Freiburgstrasse 18, 3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of BioMedicalResearch (DMBR), University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 40, 3008 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Foundation National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration (NICER), University of Zurich, Seilergraben 49, 8001 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Unit of Cancer Survivorship, Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of BioMedicalResearch (DMBR), University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 40, 3008 Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211214,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'incidence', 'mortality', 'relative survival', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:01,['2021/12/24 01:06'],"['2021/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13246269 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13246269 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 14;13(24). pii: cancers13246269. doi: 10.3390/cancers13246269.,13,24,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8138-0505', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8761-2066', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9320-8684']",,PMC8699480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether pediatric and adult CML have unique molecular characteristics, we studied the transcriptomic signature of pediatric and adult CML CD34+ cells and healthy pediatric and adult CD34+ control cells. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we found 567 genes (207 up- and 360 downregulated) differentially expressed in pediatric CML CD34+ cells compared to pediatric healthy CD34+ cells. Directly comparing pediatric and adult CML CD34+ cells, 398 genes (258 up- and 140 downregulated), including many in the Rho pathway, were differentially expressed in pediatric CML CD34+ cells. Using RT-qPCR to verify differentially expressed genes, VAV2 and ARHGAP27 were significantly upregulated in adult CML CD34+ cells compared to pediatric CML CD34+ cells. NCF1, CYBB, and S100A8 were upregulated in adult CML CD34+ cells but not in pediatric CML CD34+ cells, compared to healthy controls. In contrast, DLC1 was significantly upregulated in pediatric CML CD34+ cells but not in adult CML CD34+ cells, compared to healthy controls. These results demonstrate unique molecular characteristics of pediatric CML, such as dysregulation of the Rho pathway, which may contribute to clinical differences between pediatric and adult

It is the so-called ""don't eat me signal"" because it protects the cells against phagocytosis. The CD47 interacts with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) on the surface of macrophages, leading to downstream inhibitory signaling that dampens phagocytic capacity. Since macrophages exert immune surveillance against cancers, cancer cells overexpress CD47 to defend themselves against phagocytosis. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC), and similar to other types of cancers, leukemic blasts show enhanced levels of CD47. In patients with AML, CD47 has been associated with a higher disease burden and poor overall survival. Blockage of CD47-SIRPalpha signaling leads to improved phagocytosis of AML cells and better overall survival in xenograft models. However, the introduction of a pro-phagocytic signal is needed to induce greater phagocytic capacity. These pro-phagocytic signals can be either Fc receptor stimulants (such as monoclonal antibodies) or natural pro-phagocytic molecules (such as calreticulin). Based on these pre-clinical findings, various clinical trials investigating the blockade of CD47-SIRPalpha interaction have been designed as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-leukemic agents. In this review, we will discuss CD47 biology, highlight its implications for AML pathophysiology, and explore the potential clinical translation of disrupting CD47-SIRPalpha to treat patients with AML.",,"['Melo Garcia, Luciana', 'Barabe, Frederic']","['Melo Garcia L', 'Barabe F']","['MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211213,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD47', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'phagocytosis']",2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:01,['2021/12/24 01:06'],"['2021/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13246258 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13246258 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 13;13(24). pii: cancers13246258. doi: 10.3390/cancers13246258.,13,24,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0024-3611'],,PMC8699809,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML represents one of the most common types of leukemia, mostly affecting elderly patients. To date, standard chemotherapy protocols are only effective in patients at low risk of relapse and therapy-related mortality. The average 5-year overall survival (OS) is approximately 28%. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) improves prognosis but is limited by donor availability, a relatively young age of patients, and absence of significant comorbidities. Moreover, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. However, increasing understanding of AML immunobiology is leading to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Immunotherapy is considered an attractive strategy for controlling and eliminating the disease. It can be a real breakthrough in the treatment of leukemia, especially in patients who are not eligible forintensive chemotherapy.

This study investigates the role of replication stress in sensitivity to inhibition of Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) in pre-clinical models of high-risk NB. Amplification of the oncogene MYCN always imparts high-risk disease and occurs in 25% of all NB. Here, we show that MYCN-induced replication stress directly increases sensitivity to the ATR inhibitors VE-821 and AZD6738. PARP inhibition with Olaparib also results in replication stress and ATR activation, and sensitises NB cells to ATR inhibition independently of MYCN status, with synergistic levels of cell death seen in MYCN expressing ATR- and PARP-inhibited cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that ATR inhibition increases the number of persistent stalled and collapsed replication forks, exacerbating replication stress.

Unlike conventional alphabeta T cells, gammadelta T cells largely populate non-lymphoid peripheral tissues, demonstrating tissue specificity, and they respond to ligands in an MHC-independent manner. gammadelta T cells display rapid activation and effector functions, with a capacity for cytotoxic anti-tumour responses and production of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-gamma or IL-17. Their rapid cytotoxic nature makes them attractive cells for use in anti-cancer immunotherapies. However, upon transformation, gammadelta T cells can give rise to highly aggressive lymphomas. These rare malignancies often display poor patient survival, and no curative therapies exist. In this review, we discuss the diverse roles of gammadelta T cells in immune surveillance and response, with a particular focus on cancer immunity. We summarise the intriguing dichotomy between pro- and anti-tumour functions of gammadelta T cells in solid and haematological cancers, highlighting the key subsets involved. Finally, we discuss potential drivers of gammadelta T-cell transformation, summarising the main gammadelta T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia entities, their clinical features, recent advances in mapping their molecular and genomic landscapes, current treatment strategies and potential future targeting options.",,"['Schonefeldt, Susann', 'Wais, Tamara', 'Herling, Marco', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Bekiaris, Vasileios', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Neubauer, Heidi A']","['Schonefeldt S', 'Wais T', 'Herling M', 'Mustjoki S', 'Bekiaris V', 'Moriggl R', 'Neubauer HA']","['Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210 Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Hematology, Cellular Therapy and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.', 'iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine Flagship, 00014 Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program and Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, 00014 Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Health Technology, Technical University of Denmark, 2800 Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210 Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211209,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer immunity', 'immunotherapy', 'targeted therapy', 'gammadelta T cells', 'gammadelta T-cell lymphoma', 'gammadelta T-cell transformation']",2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:01,['2021/12/24 01:06'],"['2021/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13246212 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13246212 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 9;13(24). pii: cancers13246212. doi: 10.3390/cancers13246212.,13,24,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0816-8241', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0918-9463', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7372-7786']","['SFB-F06109/FWF Austrian Science Fund', 'I 4218-B/FWF Austrian Science Fund', 'I 4157-B/FWF Austrian Science Fund']",PMC8699114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its dysregulation can impact selected groups of RNAs, modifying protein levels independently of transcription. Integral to their suitability for translation, RNAs undergo a series of maturation steps including the addition of the m(7)G cap on the 5' end of RNAs, splicing, as well as cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA). Importantly, each of these steps can be coopted to modify the transcript signal. Factors that bind the m(7)G cap escort these RNAs through different steps of maturation and thus govern the physical nature of the final transcript product presented to the translation machinery. Here, we describe these steps and how the major m(7)G cap-binding factors in mammalian cells, the cap binding complex (CBC) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, are positioned to chaperone transcripts through RNA maturation, nuclear export, and translation in a transcript-specific manner. To conceptualize a framework for the flow and integration of this genetic information, we discuss RNA maturation models and how these integrate with translation.

Patients harboring FLT3-ITD display worse clinical outcomes. The integration and advancement of FLT3 TKI in AML treatment provided significant therapeutic improvement. However, due to the emergence of resistance mechanisms, FLT3-ITD(+) AML remains a clinical challenge. We performed an unbiased drug screen to identify 18 compounds as particularly efficacious against FLT3-ITD(+) AML. Among these, we characterized two investigational compounds, WS6 and ispinesib, and two approved drugs, ponatinib and cabozantinib, in depth. We found that WS6, although not yet investigated in oncology, shows a similar mechanism and potency as ponatinib and cabozantinib. Interestingly, ispinesib and cabozantinib prevent activation of AXL, a key driver and mechanism of drug resistance in FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients. We further investigated synergies between the selected compounds and found that combination treatment with ispinesib and cabozantinib or ponatinib shows high synergy in FLT3-ITD(+) AML cell lines and patient samples. Together, we suggest WS6, ispinesib, ponatinib and cabozantinib as novel options for targeting FLT3-ITD(+) AML.

We reported previously that 8-OHD provoked reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, and induced autophagy, apoptosis, breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (BCR-ABL) degradation, and differentiation in K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. However, how 8-OHD regulates metabolism, the extracellular matrix during invasion and metastasis, and survival signaling pathways in CML remains largely unexplored. High-throughput technologies have been widely used to discover the therapeutic targets and pathways of drugs. Bioinformatics analysis of 8-OHD-downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), c-Myc, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolic pathways were significantly altered by 8-OHD treatment. Western blot analyses validated that 8-OHD significantly downregulated cytosolic JAK2 and the expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 dose- and time-dependently in K562 cells. Zymography and transwell assays also confirmed that K562-secreted MMP9 and invasion activities were dose-dependently inhibited by 8-OHD after 24 h of treatment. RT-qPCR analyses verified that 8-OHD repressed metastasis and OXPHOS-related genes. In combination with DisGeNET, it was found that 8-OHD's downregulation of PI3K/AKT is crucial for controlling CML development. A STRING protein-protein interaction analysis further revealed that AKT and MYC are hub proteins for cancer progression.

However, the efficacy and mechanisms of pyrvinium against myeloid leukemia remain unclear. The growth inhibitory effects of pyrvinium were tested in human AML cell lines. Transcriptome analysis of Molm13 myeloid leukemia cells suggested that pyrvinium pamoate could trigger an unfolded protein response (UPR)-like pathway, including responses to extracellular stimulus [p-value = 2.78 x 10(-6)] and to endoplasmic reticulum stress [p-value = 8.67 x 10(-7)], as well as elicit metabolic reprogramming, including sulfur compound catabolic processes [p-value = 2.58 x 10(-8)], and responses to a redox state [p-value = 5.80 x 10(-5)]; on the other hand, it could elicit a pyrvinium blunted protein folding function, including protein folding [p-value = 2.10 x 10(-8)] and an ATP metabolic process [p-value = 3.95 x 10(-4)]. Subsequently, pyrvinium was verified to induce an integrated stress response (ISR), demonstrated by activation of the eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway and inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, pyrvinium could co-localize with mitochondria and then decrease the mitochondrial basal oxidative consumption rate, ultimately dysregulating the mitochondrial function. Similar effects were observed in cabozantinib-resistant Molm13-XR cell lines. Furthermore, pyrvinium treatment retarded Molm13 and Molm13-XR xenograft tumor growth. Thus, we concluded that pyrvinium exerts anti-tumor activity, at least, via the modulation of the mitochondrial function and by triggering ISR.",,"['Fu, Yu-Hsuan', 'Tseng, Chi-Yang', 'Lu, Jeng-Wei', 'Lu, Wen-Hui', 'Lan, Pei-Qi', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Ou, Da-Liang', 'Lin, Liang-In']","['Fu YH', 'Tseng CY', 'Lu JW', 'Lu WH', 'Lan PQ', 'Chen CY', 'Ou DL', 'Lin LI']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100229, Taiwan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100229, Taiwan.', 'Antimicrobial Resistance Interdisciplinary Research Group, Singapore-MIT-Alliance for Research and Technology, Singapore 138602, Singapore.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100229, Taiwan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100229, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100225, Taiwan.', 'Department of Oncology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100025, Taiwan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100229, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100225, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211209,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'integrated stress response', 'pyrvinium pamoate']",2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:01,['2021/12/24 01:06'],"['2021/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines9121869 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines9121869 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2021 Dec 9;9(12). pii: biomedicines9121869. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines9121869.,9,12,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5917-2961', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2128-2046', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2831-8822', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8368-1141', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3561-1093']",,PMC8698814,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although targeted therapy, such as receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors, has been introduced into clinical practice, its efficacy is limited to patients harboring mutant kinases. Through the analysis of transcriptomic data of 701 leukemia and NB patient samples and cell lines, we revealed that the expression of RTK, such as KIT, FLT3, AXL, FGFR3, and NTRK1, is linked with HDAC class I. Although HDAC inhibitors have antitumor activity, they also have high whole-body toxicity. We developed a novel belinostat derivative named hydrazostat, which targets HDAC class I with limited off-target effects. We compared the toxicity of these drugs within the panel of leukemia and NB cell lines. Next, we revealed that HDAC inhibition with hydrazostat reactivates NTRK1, FGFR3, ROR2, KIT, and FLT3 expression. Based on this finding, we tested the efficacy of hydrazostat in combination with RTK inhibitor imatinib. Additionally, we show the ability of hydrazostat to enhance venetoclax-induced apoptosis.

Two important processes altered in cancer that lead to changes in gene expression include altered microRNA (miRNA) expression and aberrant splicing events. MiRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that play a central role in regulating RNA silencing and gene expression. Alternative splicing increases the diversity of the proteome by producing several different spliced mRNAs from a single gene for translation. MiRNA expression and alternative splicing events are rigorously regulated processes. Dysregulation of miRNA and splicing events promote carcinogenesis and drug resistance in cancers including breast, cervical, prostate, colorectal, ovarian and leukemia. Alternative splicing may change the target mRNA 3'UTR binding site. This alteration can affect the produced protein and may ultimately affect the drug affinity of target proteins, eventually leading to drug resistance. Drug resistance can be caused by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The interplay between miRNA and alternative splicing is largely due to splicing resulting in altered 3'UTR targeted binding of miRNAs. This can result in the altered targeting of these isoforms and altered drug targets and drug resistance. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of cancer drug resistance poses a substantial challenge in the management of the disease. Henceforth, molecular alterations have become highly attractive drug targets to reverse the aberrant effects of miRNAs and splicing events that promote malignancy and drug resistance. While the miRNA-mRNA splicing interplay in cancer drug resistance remains largely to be elucidated, this review focuses on miRNA and alternative mRNA splicing (AS) events in breast, cervical, prostate, colorectal and ovarian cancer, as well as leukemia, and the role these events play in drug resistance. MiRNA induced cancer drug resistance; alternative mRNA splicing (AS) in cancer drug resistance; the interplay between AS and miRNA in chemoresistance will be discussed. Despite this great potential, the interplay between aberrant splicing events and miRNA is understudied but holds great potential in deciphering miRNA-mediated drug resistance.",,"['Marima, Rahaba', 'Francies, Flavia Zita', 'Hull, Rodney', 'Molefi, Thulo', 'Oyomno, Meryl', 'Khanyile, Richard', 'Mbatha, Sikhumbuzo', 'Mabongo, Mzubanzi', 'Owen Bates, David', 'Dlamini, Zodwa']","['Marima R', 'Francies FZ', 'Hull R', 'Molefi T', 'Oyomno M', 'Khanyile R', 'Mbatha S', 'Mabongo M', 'Owen Bates D', 'Dlamini Z']","['SAMRC Precision Oncology Research Unit (PORU), Pan African Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), University of Pretoria, Hatfiel, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'SAMRC Precision Oncology Research Unit (PORU), Pan African Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), University of Pretoria, Hatfiel, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'SAMRC Precision Oncology Research Unit (PORU), Pan African Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), University of Pretoria, Hatfiel, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'SAMRC Precision Oncology Research Unit (PORU), Pan African Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), University of Pretoria, Hatfiel, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Steve Biko Academic Hospital, University of Pretoria, Hatfield, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'SAMRC Precision Oncology Research Unit (PORU), Pan African Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), University of Pretoria, Hatfiel, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'Department of Surgery, Steve Biko Academic Hospital, University of Pretoria, Hatfield, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'SAMRC Precision Oncology Research Unit (PORU), Pan African Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), University of Pretoria, Hatfiel, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Steve Biko Academic Hospital, University of Pretoria, Hatfield, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'SAMRC Precision Oncology Research Unit (PORU), Pan African Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), University of Pretoria, Hatfiel, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'Department of Surgery, Steve Biko Academic Hospital, University of Pretoria, Hatfield, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'SAMRC Precision Oncology Research Unit (PORU), Pan African Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), University of Pretoria, Hatfiel, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'Department of Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery, School of Dentistry, University of Pretoria, Hatfield, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'SAMRC Precision Oncology Research Unit (PORU), Pan African Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), University of Pretoria, Hatfiel, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.', 'Centre for Cancer Sciences, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, Biodiscovery Institute, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK.', 'SAMRC Precision Oncology Research Unit (PORU), Pan African Cancer Research Institute (PACRI), University of Pretoria, Hatfiel, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211202,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,['NOTNLM'],"['MicroRNA (miRNA)', 'alternative mRNA splicing (AS)', 'chemotherapy', 'drug resistance']",2021/12/25 06:00,2021/12/25 06:01,['2021/12/24 01:06'],"['2021/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines9121818 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines9121818 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2021 Dec 2;9(12). pii: biomedicines9121818. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines9121818.,9,12,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5050-7350', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8012-3646']",['N/A/South African Medical Research Council'],PMC8698559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virus infection is associated with tumorigenesis and immunodeficiency and is contributing to the decline of the animal population. Antibody production is an excellent marker of retrovirus infection; however, animals carrying endogenous KoRV are tolerant. Therefore, the therapeutic immunization of animals carrying endogenous KoRV seems to be ineffective. Using the recombinant transmembrane (TM) envelope protein of the KoRV, we immunized goats, rats and mice, obtaining in all cases neutralizing antibodies which recognize epitopes in the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR), and in the membrane-proximal external region (MPER). Immunizing several animal species with the corresponding TM envelope protein of the closely related porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), as well as the feline leukemia virus (FeLV), we also induced neutralizing antibodies with similar epitopes. Immunizing with the TM envelope protein in addition to the surface envelope proteins of all three viruses resulted in higher titers of neutralizing antibodies.

Conceptualizing this on tumour models it can lead to important conclusions about disease progression, as well as the disease's ""starting point"". In the present study we tried to answer two questions: (a) which are the evolving properties of proliferating tumour cells that started from different initial conditions and (b) we have attempted to prove that cell proliferation follows chaotic orbits and it can be described by the use of Poincare maps. As a model we have used the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM. Measurements of cell population were taken at certain time points every 24 h or 48 h. In addition to the population measurements flow cytometry studies have been conducted in order to examine the apoptotic and necrotic rate of the system and also the DNA content of the cells as they progress through. The cells exhibited a proliferation rate of nonlinear nature with aperiodic oscillatory behavior.

Progression to more symptomatic disease, such as overt MF or acute leukemia, represents one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality. There are clinically evident but also subclinical types of MPN progression. Clinically evident progression includes evolution from ET to PV, ET to post-ET-MF, PV to post-PV-MF, or pre-PMF to overt PMF, and transformation of any of these subtypes to myelodysplastic neoplasms or acute leukemia. Thrombosis, major hemorrhage, severe infections, or increasing symptom burden (e.g., pruritus, night sweats) may herald progression. Subclinical types of progression may include increases in the extent of bone marrow fibrosis, increases of driver gene mutational allele burden, and clonal evolution. The underlying causes of MPN progression are diverse and can be attributed to genetic alterations and chronic inflammation. Particularly, bystander mutations in genes encoding epigenetic regulators or splicing factors were associated with progression. Finally, comorbidities such as systemic inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and organ fibrosis may augment the risk of progression. The aim of this review was to discuss types and mechanisms of MPN progression and how their knowledge might improve risk stratification and therapeutic intervention. In view of these aspects, we discuss the potential benefits of early diagnosis using molecular and functional imaging and exploitable therapeutic strategies that may prevent progression, but also highlight current challenges and methodological pitfalls.",,"['Baumeister, Julian', 'Chatain, Nicolas', 'Sofias, Alexandros Marios', 'Lammers, Twan', 'Koschmieder, Steffen']","['Baumeister J', 'Chatain N', 'Sofias AM', 'Lammers T', 'Koschmieder S']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Dusseldorf (CIO ABCD), 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Dusseldorf (CIO ABCD), 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Dusseldorf (CIO ABCD), 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Nanomedicine and Theranostics, Institute for Experimental Molecular Imaging, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Dusseldorf (CIO ABCD), 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Nanomedicine and Theranostics, Institute for Experimental Molecular Imaging, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Dusseldorf (CIO ABCD), 52074 Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20211216,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*MPN', '*diagnosis', '*progression', '*therapy']",2021/12/25 06:00,2022/01/18 06:00,['2021/12/24 01:04'],"['2021/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:04 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10123551 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10123551 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Dec 16;10(12). pii: cells10123551. doi: 10.3390/cells10123551.,10,12,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6096-1952', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4485-3120', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7475-2526', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1090-6805', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1011-8171']","['KO2155/7-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'CH1501/1-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft']",PMC8700229,,,,,,,20220117,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Thrombosis/diagnosis/genetics/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the exact molecular mechanism behind the translocation of these molecules has not been fully investigated. This study used 10% cyclic strain to induce osteogenesis in the murine osteoblast precursor cell line (MC3T3). The translocation of beta-catenin and MKL1 was studied by performing knockdown and overexpression of lamin A/C (LMNA). Cyclic strain increased the expression of osteogenic markers such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), and enhanced ALP staining after seven days of incubation. Resultantly, MKL1 and beta-catenin were translocated in the nucleus from the cytoplasm during the stress-induced osteogenic process. Knockdown of LMNA decreased the accumulation of MKL1 and beta-catenin in the nucleus, whereas overexpression of LMNA increased the translocation of these molecules. In conclusion, our study indicates that both MKL1 and beta-catenin molecules are dependent on the expression of LMNA during strain-induced osteogenesis.",,"['Khan, Asmat Ullah', 'Qu, Rongmei', 'Yang, Yuchao', 'Fan, Tingyu', 'Peng, Yan', 'Sun, Bing', 'Qiu, Xianshuai', 'Wu, Shutong', 'Wang, Zetong', 'Zhou, Zhitao', 'Khan, Muhammad Akram', 'Dai, Jingxing', 'Ouyang, Jun']","['Khan AU', 'Qu R', 'Yang Y', 'Fan T', 'Peng Y', 'Sun B', 'Qiu X', 'Wu S', 'Wang Z', 'Zhou Z', 'Khan MA', 'Dai J', 'Ouyang J']","['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Biomechanics & Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Translation of Medical 3D Printing Application & National Key Discipline of Human Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Biomechanics & Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Translation of Medical 3D Printing Application & National Key Discipline of Human Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Biomechanics & Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Translation of Medical 3D Printing Application & National Key Discipline of Human Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Biomechanics & Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Translation of Medical 3D Printing Application & National Key Discipline of Human Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Biomechanics & Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Translation of Medical 3D Printing Application & National Key Discipline of Human Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Biomechanics & Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Translation of Medical 3D Printing Application & National Key Discipline of Human Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Spine Surgery, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510280, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Biomechanics & Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Translation of Medical 3D Printing Application & National Key Discipline of Human Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'The First Clinical Medicine College, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, PMAS-Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi 46300, Pakistan.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Biomechanics & Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Translation of Medical 3D Printing Application & National Key Discipline of Human Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Biomechanics & Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Translation of Medical 3D Printing Application & National Key Discipline of Human Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211214,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*lamin A/C (LMNA)', '*mechanical strain', '*megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1)', '*osteogenesis', '*beta-catenin']",2021/12/25 06:00,2022/01/07 06:00,['2021/12/24 01:04'],"['2021/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:04 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10123518 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10123518 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Dec 14;10(12). pii: cells10123518. doi: 10.3390/cells10123518.,10,12,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9339-9174'],['2017YFC1105000/National Key R&amp;D Program of China'],PMC8700688,,,,,,,20220106,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Lamin Type A)', '0 (Mrtfa protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta Catenin)']","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Lamin Type A/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Osteogenesis', '*Stress, Mechanical', 'Trans-Activators', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the most notable advances in the treatment of MDS is the hypomethylating agent, decitabine (5-aza-2'deoxycytidine). Although decitabine is well known as an effective method for treating MDS patients, only a subset of patients respond and a tolerance often develops, leading to treatment failure. Moreover, decitabine treatment is costly and causes unnecessary toxicity. Therefore, clarifying the mechanism of decitabine resistance is important for improving its therapeutic efficacy. To this end, we established a decitabine-resistant F-36P cell line from the parental F-36P leukemia cell line, and applied a genetic approach employing next-generation sequencing, various experimental techniques, and bioinformatics tools to determine differences in gene expression and relationships among genes. Thirty-eight candidate genes encoding proteins involved in decitabine-resistant-related pathways, including immune checkpoints, the regulation of myeloid cell differentiation, and PI3K-Akt signaling, were identified. Interestingly, two of the candidate genes, AKT3 and FOS, were overexpressed in MDS patients with poor prognoses. On the basis of these results, we are pursuing development of a gene chip for diagnosing decitabine resistance in MDS patients, with the goal of ultimately improving the power to predict treatment strategies and the prognosis of MDS patients.",,"['Kim, Seungyoun', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Kim, Dayeon', 'Oh, Somi', 'Hong, Junshik', 'Kim, Inho', 'Kim, Eunju']","['Kim S', 'Shin DY', 'Kim D', 'Oh S', 'Hong J', 'Kim I', 'Kim E']","['Division of Radiation Biomedical Research, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul 01812, Korea.', 'Department of Radiological and Medico-Oncological Sciences, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34113, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Center for Medical Innovation, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Division of Radiation Biomedical Research, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul 01812, Korea.', 'Department of Radiological and Medico-Oncological Sciences, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34113, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Center for Medical Innovation, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Division of Radiation Biomedical Research, Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences, Seoul 01812, Korea.', 'Department of Radiological and Medico-Oncological Sciences, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34113, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211210,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*biomarkers', '*decitabine', '*myelodysplastic syndromes', '*resistance']",2021/12/25 06:00,2022/01/06 06:00,['2021/12/24 01:04'],"['2021/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/24 01:04 [entrez]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10123494 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10123494 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Dec 10;10(12). pii: cells10123494. doi: 10.3390/cells10123494.,10,12,,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2887-0385'],"['2017R1D1A1B03031791/National Research Foundation of Korea', '50531-2021/National Research Foundation of Korea']",PMC8700444,,,,,,,20220105,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']","['Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Decitabine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance/drug effects/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Ontology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Protein Interaction Maps/drug effects', 'RNA-Seq', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the impact of Ca(2+) in regulating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell fate in response to the anti-cancer agent all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). We observed that ATRA promotes calcium entry through store-operated calcium (SOC) channels into acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. This response is associated with changes in the expression profiles of ORAI1 and STIM1, two proteins involved in SOC channels activation, as well as with a significant upregulation of several key proteins associated to calcium signaling. Moreover, ATRA treatment of APL cells led to a significant activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) and its downstream effector AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), linking Ca(2+) signaling to autophagy. Pharmacological inhibition of SOC channels and CAMKK2 enhanced ATRA-induced cell differentiation and death. Altogether, our results unravel an ATRA-elicited signaling pathway that involves SOC channels/CAMKK2 activation, induction of autophagy, inhibition of cellular differentiation and suppression of cell death.

Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylations and histone modifications, result in the heritable silencing of genes without a change in their coding sequence. Emerging studies are increasing our understanding of the epigenetic role of leukemogenesis and have demonstrated the potential of DNA methylations and histone modifications as a biomarker for lineage and subtypes classification, predicting relapse, and disease progression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Epigenetic abnormalities are relatively reversible when treated with some small molecule-based agents compared to genetic alterations.

We now know that expression of DUX4 is highly regulated and restricted to the early steps of embryonic development, where DUX4 is involved in transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. While DUX4 is epigenetically silenced in most somatic tissues of healthy humans, its aberrant reactivation is associated with several diseases, including cancer, viral infection and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). DUX4 is also translocated, giving rise to chimeric oncogenic proteins at the basis of sarcoma and leukemia forms. Hence, understanding how DUX4 is regulated and performs its activity could provide relevant information, not only to further our knowledge of human embryonic development regulation, but also to develop therapeutic approaches for the diseases associated with DUX4.

AML cell lines HL-60, KG-1, OCI-AML3, and MOLM-14 released EVs with a peak diameter of approximately 80 nm in serum-free particle-reduced medium. We enriched EVs >100x using tangential flow filtration (TFF) and separated AML-derived soluble factors and cells in parallel. EVs were characterized by electron microscopy, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry, confirming the double-membrane morphology, purity and identity. AML-EVs showed significant enrichment of immune response and leukemia-related pathways in tandem mass-tag proteomics and a significant dose-dependent inhibition of T cell proliferation, which was not observed with AML cells or their soluble factors. Furthermore, AML-EVs dose-dependently reduced NK cell lysis of third-party K-562 leukemia targets.

A Case Report.,2185 [pii] 10.3390/diagnostics11122185 [doi],"The reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBVr) in patients undergoing pharmacological immunosuppression is a potentially fatal clinical event that may occur in patients with overt or occult HBV infection. The risk of HBVr is mainly determined by the type of immunosuppressive therapy and the HBV serologic profile, with a higher risk in patients positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and a lower risk in HBsAg-negative/antibodies to core antigen-positive subjects. Notably, a considerable proportion of patients experiencing HBVr showed a high degree of variability of the HBV S gene, possibly leading to immune escape mutants. These mutations, usually in the ""a-determinant"" of the HBsAg, can cause diagnostic problems and consequently hamper the appropriate management strategy of patients at risk of HBVr.

Whether changes in platelet respiratory function occur in children with or without HM it is unknown. The present pilot study was double-aimed: (i) to investigate whether platelet respiration is age-dependent in non-HM children and (ii) to assess the platelet mitochondrial respiration in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Blood samples obtained from age-grouped children (10-11, 13-14 and 16-17 years) with non-HM and children with ALL (10-11 years) were used to isolate platelets via differential centrifugation. High-resolution respirometry studies of isolated platelets were performed according to a protocol adapted to evaluate complex I and II-supported respiration. An age-related decrease in respiration was observed in the non-HM pediatric population and had comparable values for the 13-14 and 16-17 years. groups. In children with ALL, a significant increase in C I-supported active respiration and decrease in maximal noncoupled respiration were found at the disease onset. In conclusion, in a pediatric population, platelet mitochondrial respiration is age-dependent.

All patients had hematologic malignancies: three subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphomas, two acute lymphoblastic leukemias, two anaplastic large cell lymphomas, and a systemic EBV + T-cell lymphoma of childhood. The incidence rate of M-HLH among leukemia and malignant lymphoma patients in our institution was 1.9%. From the initial diagnosis of HLH, the median time taken to be diagnosed as a malignancy was about 1.3 months. The majority of patients received HLH-targeted immunosuppression and/or etoposide at first. The patients' clinical response to treatment for HLH and malignancies were varied. Five out of the eight patients died, one of whom died due to HLH-related cerebral edema after the initiation of chemotherapy. The median overall survival was 1.6 years.

CHIP develops as a result of certain acquired somatic mutations that predispose to leukaemia, but clinically even more prevalent, associate with increased risk for CVD and CVD-related death. Experimental studies suggest a causal role for CHIP aggravating inflammatory processes in CVD, and recent epidemiologic and genetic studies indicate that classical CVD risk factors may increase the risk of acquiring CHIP driver mutations, thus fuelling a vicious circle. The potential mechanism underlying the associative link between CHIP and CVD and mortality has been the focus of a few recent excellent experimental and observational studies which are summarized and discussed in this concise non-systematic review article. These data support a pathomechanistic view of a spiralling vicious circle in which CHIP aggravates the inflammatory immune response in CVD, and CVD-driven elevated haematopoietic activity promotes CHIP development.",['Thieme.

Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) has several cytoprotective properties such as anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. HO-1 in brain tissues was induced in A. cantonensis-infected group and showed positive modulation in cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP)-treated groups. Assay methods for the therapeutic effect include western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, gelatin zymography, blood-brain barrier permeability evaluation and eosinophil count in cerebrospinal fluid. The combination of albendazole (ABZ) and CoPP significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-5, and IL-33 but significantly increased anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta. In addition, worm recovery, matrix metalloproteinase-9, BBB permeability, and eosinophil counts were decreased in the ABZ and CoPP co-treated groups. Induction of HO-1 with CoPP strongly inhibited the protein levels of caspase-3 and increased the induction of annexin-V and B-cell leukemia 2. Thus, co-treatment with ABZ and CoPP prevented A. cantonensis-induced eosinophilic meningoencephalitis and its anti-apoptotic effect by promoting HO-1 signaling prior to BBB dysfunction. HO-1 induction might be a therapeutic modality for eosinophilic meningoencephalitis.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Kidneys are not frequently invaded by leukemic cells, and patients with adult ALL showing nephromegaly as an initial presentation are rare. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54-year-old man was referred to our institution for mild anemia and thrombocytopenia. Laboratory tests showed bicytopenia with abnormal lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood and mild renal dysfunction. DIAGNOSIS: Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral enlargement of the kidneys. [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT demonstrated a strong increase in metabolic uptake in the bilateral kidneys. A kidney biopsy revealed a leukemia invasion into the parenchyma. Based on the lymphocytic repertoire, the patient's condition was diagnosed as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received hyper-cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone and high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine as induction chemotherapy. After his leukemia relapsed, he received nelarabine as a second induction therapy and underwent haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. OUTCOMES: Complete remission (CR) was achieved after chemotherapy. Chemotherapy also improved renal function associated with the normalization of bilateral nephromegaly. Repeated [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography/CT posttreatment showedregression of metabolic uptake in the bilateral kidneys. The patient underwent cord blood transplantation at the first CR, but his leukemia relapsed 9 months later. At relapse, bilateral nephromegaly reappeared. Then, the second induction therapy induced CR for at least 10 months after induction therapy. LESSONS: Although rare, ALL in the initial and relapsed phases can be associated with bilateral nephromegaly and renal impairment due to the invasion of leukemic cells into the parenchyma with or without abnormal leukemic cells in circulation. Leukemia is an important differential diagnosis of renal impairment with bilateral nephromegaly.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 58-year-old woman presented to our department with fatigue for >10 days. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with an increased proportion of abnormal lymphocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow smear, positive for CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD25, CD123, CD200, and Kappa, partial expression of CD23, but no expression of CD103, positive for BRAF V600E mutation. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Cladribine combined with rituximab achieved complete remission of minor residual disease negativity. CONCLUSION: Hairy cell leukemia is rare, and the diagnosis and differential diagnosis should be made by combining the patient's medical history, clinical manifestations, immunophenotype, gene detection, and other means. Purine nucleoside analogs are the first-line treatments.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

We evaluated the performance of the artificial intelligence-based offering Watson for Genomics (WfG), a variant interpretation platform, in hematologic malignancies for the first time.Next generation sequencing was performed for patients treated for various hematological malignancies at Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, South Korea, between December 2017 and August 2020 using a 54-gene panel. Both WfG and expert manual curation were used to evaluate the performance of WfG. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) molecular profiles were compared between Koreans and other ethnic groups using a publicly available dataset.Seventy-seven patients were analyzed (AML: 45, myeloproliferative neoplasms: 12, multiple myeloma: 7, myelodysplastic syndromes: 6, and others: 7). The concordance between the manual and WfG interpretations of 35 variants in 11 random patients was 94%. Among all patients, WfG identified 39 (51%) with at least 1 clinically actionable therapeutic alteration (i.e., a variant targeted by a United States Food and Drug Administration [US FDA]-approved drug, off-label drug, or clinical trial). Moreover, 46% of these patients (18/39) had genes that were targeted by a US FDA-approved therapy. WfG identified diagnostic or prognostic insights in 65% of the patients with no targetable alterations. In those with AML, FLT3-internal tandem duplications or tyrosine kinase domain mutations were less frequent among Koreans than among Caucasians (6.7% vs 30.2%, P < .001) or Hispanics (6.7% vs 28.3%, P = .005), suggesting ethnic differences.Variant interpretation using WfG correlated well with manually curated expert opinions. WfG provided therapeutic insights (including variant-specific drugs and clinical trials that cannot easily be provided by expert manual curation), as well as diagnostic and/or prognostic information.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

At the same time, the numerous challenges posed by the difficulties in rapid manipulation of primary B cells and the paucity of CLL cell lines have limited the ability to interrogate the function of the discovered putative disease ""drivers,"" defined in human sequencing studies through statistical inference. Mouse models represent a powerful tool to study mechanisms of normal and malignant B-cell biology and for preclinical testing of novel therapeutics. Advances in genetic engineering technologies, including the introduction of conditional knockin/knockout strategies, have opened new opportunities to model genetic lesions in a B-cell-restricted context. These new studies build on the experience of generating the MDR mice, the first example of a genetically faithful CLL model, which recapitulates the most common genomic aberration of human CLL: del(13q). In this review, we describe the application of mouse models to the studies of CLL pathogenesis and disease transformation from an indolent to a high-grade malignancy (ie, Richter syndrome [RS]) and treatment, with a focus on newly developed genetically inspired mouse lines modeling recurrent CLL genetic events. We discuss how these novel mouse models, analyzed using new genomic technologies, allow the dissection of mechanisms of disease evolution and response to therapy with greater depth than previously possible and provide important insight into human CLL and RS pathogenesis and therapeutic vulnerabilities. These models thereby provide valuable platforms for functional genomic analyses and treatment studies.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Ten Hacken, Elisa', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Ten Hacken E', 'Wu CJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA; and.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/12/24 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2021/12/23 12:48'],"['2021/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/12/23 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/12/23 12:48 [entrez]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['483077 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021011993 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Dec 23;138(25):2621-2631. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021011993.,138,25,2621-2631,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3348-5054'],"['P01 CA206978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA216273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8703365,['2022/12/23 00:00'],,,,,,20220113,,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomics', 'Human Genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today, we know that tumors can comprise subclones with common and with subclone-specific genetic alterations. We sequenced DNA and RNA of sequential sister cell lines obtained from patients with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia at different phases of the disease. All five pairs of cell lines carry alterations that are typical for this disease: loss of tumor suppressors (CDKN2A, CDKN2B), expression of fusion genes (ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL1, MEF2D-BCL9) or of genes targeted by point mutations (KRAS A146T, NRAS G12C, PAX5 R38H). MEF2D-BCL9 and PAX R38H mutations in cell lines have hitherto been undescribed, suggesting that YCUB-4 (MEF2D-BCL9), PC-53 (PAX R38H) and their sister cell lines will be useful models to elucidate the function of these genes. All aberrations mentioned above occur in both sister cell lines, demonstrating that the sisters derive from a common ancestor. However, we also found mutations that are specific for one sister cell line only, pointing to individual subclones of the primary tumor as originating cells.

The most common clinical manifestations include splenomegaly, lymphocytosis, and hemocytopenia. A diagnosis of SDRPL can be challenging, as it shares multiple clinical and laboratory features with splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and HCL variant (HCL-v). Obtaining splenic tissue remains the gold standard for diagnosis. In the cases where splenic tissue is not available, diagnosis can be established by a review of peripheral blood and bone marrow studies. SDRPL is characterized by a diffuse involvement of the splenic red pulp by monomorphous small-to-medium sized mature B lymphocytes effacing the white pulp. The characteristic immunophenotype is positive for CD20, DBA.44 (20 to 90%), and IgG, and typically negative for CD5, CD10, CD23, cyclin D1, CD43, annexin A1, CD11c, CD25, CD123, and CD138. The Ki-67 proliferative index is characteristically low. Cyclin D3 is expressed in the majority of SDRPL in contrast with other types of small B-cell lymphomas, thus facilitating the recognition of this disease. There is no standard treatment regimen for SDRPL. Initial treatment options include splenectomy, rituximab monotherapy, or a combination of both.

Although not always encountered in the spleen, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder consisting of a dual population of both clonal B-cells and plasma cells and the frequent presence of the MYD88 L265P mutation, is another CD5-CD10-LPD that can be seen in the spleen. Distinction of these different entities is possible through careful evaluation of morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular features, as well as peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens. A firm understanding of this group of low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders is necessary for accurate diagnosis leading to optimal patient management.",,"['Schmieg, John J', 'Muir, Jeannie M', 'Aguilera, Nadine S', 'Auerbach, Aaron']","['Schmieg JJ', 'Muir JM', 'Aguilera NS', 'Auerbach A']","['The Joint Pathology Center, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.', 'The Joint Pathology Center, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA 22904, USA.', 'The Joint Pathology Center, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211204,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['hairy cell leukemia', 'hairy cell leukemia variant', 'lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma', 'spleen', 'splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma', 'splenic marginal zone lymphoma']",2021/12/24 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/12/23 12:42'],"['2021/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/23 12:42 [entrez]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['curroncol28060430 [pii]', '10.3390/curroncol28060430 [doi]']",epublish,Curr Oncol. 2021 Dec 4;28(6):5124-5147. doi: 10.3390/curroncol28060430.,28,6,5124-5147,,,,PMC8700451,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the heterogeneous expression of antigens on leukaemia blasts, we hypothesized that a novel bispecific CAR, directed to the folate receptor beta (FRbeta)-binding single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and an IL3alpha-binding receptor (CD123) that has more expression in AML blasts, can decrease CAR-T cell exhaustion and increase the efficacy of CAR-T cells to prevent antigen escaping and consequent recurrence of AML. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the survival, proliferation, and cytolysis of CAR-T cells remains suboptimal even with a costimulatory endodomain. Hence, we designed and constructed a tandem CAR that joins an FRbeta and CD123 in the second generation retroviral vector to generate a bispecific tandem CAR (TanCAR-T cell). Results: TanCAR FRbeta-CD123 T cells showed distinct binding to FRbeta or CD123 expressing cells. They could lyse the leukaemia cell lines (66.1 +/- 11%) comparable to the single CAR-T cells against these determinants. TanCAR FRbeta- CD123 T cells simultaneously engaged FRbeta and CD123, which promoted T cell activation in targeting and lysis of the examined leukaemia cell lines. TanCAR-T cell significantly induced interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production more than single CAR-T cells, which produced a synergistic enhancement of TanCAR FRbeta-CD123 T cell function when dual antigens faced simultaneously. Conclusion: Dual-specific TanCAR FRbeta-CD123 T cells showed therapeutic potential to improve AML control by coengaging FRbeta and CD123 molecules in a robust, divalent immune system. This strategy may be a useful therapeutic approach in patients with relapsed B-cell malignancies.",['Copyright(c) by Royan Institute.

A recent systematic review showed that about one in 40 bloodstream infections (BSIs) would be missed if only central venous line (CVL) cultures are obtained. OBJECTIVE: To derive a clinical decision rule for obtaining peripheral blood cultures in pediatric oncology patients presenting to a pediatric emergency department (PED) with fever and a CVL. DESIGN/METHOD: A retrospective chart review was performed on pediatric oncology patients referred to the PED for fever while on therapy. Logistic regression with a random intercept was used to determine independent predictors of BSI and generate a prediction model for obtaining peripheral blood cultures. The decision rule was generated from the best performance as measured by a receiver operator curve. Bootstrapping analysis was performed for internal validation. RESULTS: Predictors that were significant and independently associated with positive peripheral blood cultures included vasopressor support (odds ratio [OR] 16.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.80-97.71), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosis (OR 6.9, 95% CI: 1.81-25.98), hypotension (OR 4.0, 95% CI: 1.05-15.17), mucositis (OR 8.2, 95% CI: 2.48-27.01), and maximum temperature in PED >/=39 degrees C (OR 6.6, 95% CI: 2.36-18.20). The area under the curve (AUC) for this model was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82-0.97) in the derivation cohort and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81-0.98) after the internal validation. CONCLUSIONS: We derived a clinical prediction model for deciding when to obtain peripheral blood cultures in febrile oncology patients with CVLs on active therapy. Future studies should focus on prospective and external validation of this diagnostic prediction tool.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Gorfinkel, Lev', 'Hansen, Caitlin E', 'Teng, Wei', 'Shabanova, Veronika', 'Prozora, Stephanie', 'Rodwin, Rozalyn', 'Qadri, Umar', 'Manghi, Tomas', 'Emerson, Beth', 'Riera, Antonio']","['Gorfinkel L', 'Hansen CE', 'Teng W', 'Shabanova V', 'Prozora S', 'Rodwin R', 'Qadri U', 'Manghi T', 'Emerson B', 'Riera A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale New Haven Health, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Department of Pediatrics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211222,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['febrile neutropenia', 'oncology', 'quality improvement']",2021/12/24 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/12/23 06:13'],"['2021/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/23 06:13 [entrez]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.29519 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec 22:e29519. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29519.,,,e29519,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8781-2276', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5022-8885', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5243-3284']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twice-a-week micafungin at a dose of 9 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) was given during the leukaemic induction treatment with at least one pharmacokinetic assessment. Non-linear mixed-effects modelling was used for analysis. For model building, our paediatric data were strengthened with existing adult data. Monte Carlo simulations were performed with twice-a-week dosing regimens of 5, 7 and 9 mg/kg and flat dosing per weight band. Simulated paediatric exposures were compared with the exposure in adults after a once-daily 100 mg regimen. RESULTS: Sixty-one paediatric patients were included with a median age and weight of 4.0 years (range 1.0-17) and 19.5 kg (range 8.60-182), respectively. A two-compartment model best fitted the data. CL and central Vd were lower (P < 0.01) in paediatric patients compared with adults. Predicted exposures (AUC0-168 h) for the 5, 7 and 9 mg/kg and flat dosing per weight band regimens exceeded the adult reference exposure. CONCLUSIONS: All twice-a-week regimens appeared to result in adequate exposure for Candida therapy, with simulated exposures well above the adult reference exposure. These findings provide the rationale for the pharmacokinetic equivalence of twice-a-week and once-daily micafungin regimens. The greater micafungin exposures seem to be caused by a slower-than-anticipated CL in our paediatric leukaemic patients. The generalizability of our results for Aspergillus prophylaxis cannot be provided without assumptions on target concentrations and within-class identical efficacy.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Using ClonMapper, we identified subpopulations of a chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line with distinct clonal compositions, transcriptional signatures and chemotherapy survivorship trajectories; patterns that were also observed in primary human chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Although cytokine release syndrome is a common complication, a concomitant development of biopsy-proven collapsing glomerulopathy and acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been described with CAR-T cell therapy. We report a man in his early 20s with relapsed/refractory pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and compensated liver cirrhosis who received 3 courses of CD19-directed CAR-T cells. After the third CAR-T cell therapy, he developed severe cytokine release syndrome accompanied by new onset of nephrotic syndrome and AKI. Cytokine release syndrome was treated with tocilizumab. His kidney biopsy showed collapsing glomerulopathy, glomerulitis, and interstitial nephritis along with complete podocyte foot-process effacement. Due to disease progression, he was subsequently treated with bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager antibody, blinatumomab, during which he developed another episode of cytokine release syndrome with exacerbation of nephrotic-range proteinuria and his AKI progressed to stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Excess cytokine-induced podocyte and renal tubulointerstitial injury and/or ""on-target off-tumor"" direct renal cell toxicity are the probable mechanisms of kidney injury.

The availability of novel compounds and low intensity chemotherapy regimens made it possible for a significant proportion of elderly and comorbid patients with AML or ALL to undergo curative treatment protocols. In addition, the expansion of donor availability and the recent dramatic progress in haploidentical stem cell transplant, allow the identification of an available donor for nearly every patient. Therefore, an increasing number of transplants are currently performed in elderly and frail patients with AML or ALL. However, allo-Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in this delicate setting represents an important challenge, especially regarding the selection of the conditioning protocol. Ideally, conditioning intensity should be reduced as much as possible; however, in patients with acute leukemia relapse remains the major cause of transplant failure. In this article we present modern tools to assess the patient health status before transplant, review the available data on the outcome of frail AML an ALL patients undergoing allo-HSCT, and discuss how preparatory regimens can be optimized in this setting.","['(c) 2021 International Academy for Clinical Hematology.

It is a paradigmatic history that has transformed the ""most malignant leukemia form"" into the most curable one. The identification of a balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, resulting in fusion between the promyelocytic leukemia gene and the retinoic acid receptor alpha, has been crucial in understanding the mechanisms of leukemogenesis, and responsible for the peculiar response to targeted therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). We review the milestones that marked successive therapeutic advances, beginning with the introduction of the first successful chemotherapy in the early 1970s, followed by a subsequent incorporation of ATRA and ATO in the late 1980s and early 1990s which have revolutionized the treatment of this disease. Over the past two decades, treatment optimization has relied on the combination of ATRA, ATO, and chemotherapy according to risk-adapted approaches, which together with improvements in supportive therapy have paved the way for cure for most patients with APL.","['(c) 2021 International Academy for Clinical Hematology.

Lysine demethylase 4B (KDM4B) has been identified as a JmjC domain-containing epigenetic modifier that possesses histone demethylase activity. Although recent studies have demonstrated that KDM4B positively regulates the pathogenesis of multiple types of solid tumors, the tissue specificity and context dependency have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated gene expression profiles established from clinical samples and found that KDM4B is elevated specifically in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with chromosomal translocation 8;21 [t(8;21)], which results in a fusion of the AML1 and the eight-twenty-one (ETO) genes to generate a leukemia oncogene, AML1-ETO fusion transcription factor. Short hairpin RNA-mediated KDM4B silencing significantly reduced cell proliferation in t(8;21)-positive AML cell lines. Meanwhile, KDM4B silencing suppressed the expression of AML1-ETO-inducible genes, and consistently perturbed chromatin accessibility of AML1-ETO-binding sites involving altered active enhancer marks and functional cis-regulatory elements. Notably, transduction of murine KDM4B orthologue mutants followed by KDM4B silencing demonstrated a requirement of methylated-histone binding modules for a proliferative surge. To address the role of KDM4B in leukemia development, we further generated and analyzed Kdm4b conditional knockout mice. As a result, Kdm4b deficiency attenuated clonogenic potential mediated by AML1-ETO and delayed leukemia progression in vivo. Thus, our results highlight a tumor-promoting role of KDM4B in AML associated with t(8;21).","['(c)2021 The Authors FASEB BioAdvances published by The Federation of American', 'Societies for Experimental Biology.']","['Ueda, Takeshi', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Komuro, Akiyoshi', 'Amano, Hisayuki', 'Ota, Kazushige', 'Honda, Masahiko', 'Kawazu, Masahito', 'Okada, Hitoshi']","['Ueda T', 'Kanai A', 'Komuro A', 'Amano H', 'Ota K', 'Honda M', 'Kawazu M', 'Okada H']","['Department of Biochemistry Kindai University Faculty of Medicine Osakasayama Japan.', 'Graduate School of Medical Sciences Kindai University Faculty of Medicine Osakasayama Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine Hiroshima University Hiroshima Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry Kindai University Faculty of Medicine Osakasayama Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry Kindai University Faculty of Medicine Osakasayama Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry Kindai University Faculty of Medicine Osakasayama Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry Kindai University Faculty of Medicine Osakasayama Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Signaling National Cancer Center Research Institute Tokyo Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry Kindai University Faculty of Medicine Osakasayama Japan.', 'Graduate School of Medical Sciences Kindai University Faculty of Medicine Osakasayama Japan.', 'Anti-Aging Center Kindai University Higashi-Osaka Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210912,United States,FASEB Bioadv,FASEB bioAdvances,101733210,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chromatin accessibility', 'gene expression analysis', 'gene targeting']",2021/12/24 06:00,2021/12/24 06:01,['2021/12/23 05:55'],"['2021/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/23 05:55 [entrez]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1096/fba.2021-00030 [doi]', 'FBA21279 [pii]']",epublish,FASEB Bioadv. 2021 Sep 12;3(12):1020-1033. doi: 10.1096/fba.2021-00030. eCollection 2021 Dec.,3,12,1020-1033,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9823-6764'],,PMC8664044,,['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of adult T cell leukemia (ATLL) occurs decades following primary infection by HTLV-I. Moreover, identical provirus integration sites have been found in samples recovered several years apart from infected individuals. These observations suggest that infected cells persist in the host for an extended period of time. To endure long term proliferation, HTLV-I pre-leukemic cells must acquire critical oncogenic events, two of which are the bypassing of apoptosis and replicative senescence. In the early stages of disease, interleukin-2 (IL-2)/IL-2R signaling likely plays a major role in combination with activation of anti-apoptotic pathways. Avoidance of replicative senescence in HTLV-I infected cells is achieved through reactivation of human telomerase (hTERT). We have previously shown that HTLV-I viral Tax transcriptionally activates the hTERT promoter. In this study we demonstrate that Tax can stimulate hTERT enzymatic activity independently of its transcriptional effects. We further show that this occurs through Tax-mediated NF-KB activating functions. Our results suggest that in ATLL cells acquire Tax-transcriptional and post-transcriptional events to elevate telomerase activity.",,"['Bellon, M', 'Yuan, Y', 'Nicot, C']","['Bellon M', 'Yuan Y', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210905,United States,J Cancer Sci,Journal of cancer sciences,101673154,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HBZ', 'HTLV-1', 'IKK', 'Tax', 'Telomerase', 'hTERT', 'leukemia']",2021/12/24 06:00,2021/12/24 06:01,['2021/12/23 05:54'],"['2021/12/23 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.13188/2377-9292.1000024 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Sci. 2021 Nov;8(1). doi: 10.13188/2377-9292.1000024.

Imatinib resistance often results from a secondary mutation in BCR-ABL that interferes with drug binding. However, sometimes there is no mutation in BCR-ABL, and the basis of such BCR-ABL-independent imatinib mesylate resistance remains to be elucidated. SOS1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras protein, affects drug sensitivity and resistance to imatinib. The depletion of SOS1 markedly inhibits cell growth either in vitro or in vivo and significantly increases the sensitivity of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to imatinib. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS and RNA-seq assays reveal that SOS1 negatively regulates the expression of SLC22A4, a member of the carnitine/organic cation transporter family, which mediates the active uptake of imatinib into chronic myeloid leukemia cells. HPLC assay confirms that intracellular accumulation of imatinib is accompanied by upregulation of SLC22A4 through SOS1 inhibition in both sensitive and resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cells. BAY-293, an inhibitor of SOS1/Ras, was found to depress proliferation and colony formation in chronic myeloid leukemia cells with resistance and BCR-ABL independence. Altogether these findings indicate that targeting SOS1 inhibition promotes imatinib sensitivity and overcomes resistance with BCR-ABL independence by SLC22A4-mediated uptake transport.",['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],"['Liu, Yanjun', 'Li, Chuting', 'Su, Rui', 'Yin, Zhao', 'Huang, Guiping', 'Yang, Juhua', 'Li, Zhendong', 'Zhang, Keda', 'Fei, Jia']","['Liu Y', 'Li C', 'Su R', 'Yin Z', 'Huang G', 'Yang J', 'Li Z', 'Zhang K', 'Fei J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Guangdong Province for Small Nucleic Acids Drug Development, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Guangdong Province for Small Nucleic Acids Drug Development, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Guangdong Province for Small Nucleic Acids Drug Development, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Guangdong Province for Small Nucleic Acids Drug Development, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Guangdong Province for Small Nucleic Acids Drug Development, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Guangdong Province for Small Nucleic Acids Drug Development, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Shenzhen Technology University, Shenzhen 518118, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Guangdong Province for Small Nucleic Acids Drug Development, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou 510632, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211120,United States,Mol Ther Oncolytics,Molecular therapy oncolytics,101666776,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'RNA-seq', 'SLC22A4', 'SOS1', 'imatinib sensitivity', 'resistance with BCR-ABL independence']",2021/12/24 06:00,2021/12/24 06:01,['2021/12/23 05:54'],"['2021/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/23 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.omto.2021.11.010 [doi]', 'S2372-7705(21)00159-5 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Ther Oncolytics. 2021 Nov 20;23:560-570. doi: 10.1016/j.omto.2021.11.010. eCollection 2021 Dec 17.,23,,560-570,,,,PMC8654699,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the use of tramadol and eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (prilocaine plus lignocaine) (EMLA) for reducing the severity of pain. Materials and Methods In this pilot study, we compared the addition of either tramadol 50 mg per oral (T) or EMLA local application (E) or no intervention (L) in addition to the usual procedure of local infiltration with lignocaine 2% before bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (BMAB) in adults suspected/confirmed with malignancy. Both, tramadol and EMLA were administered 1 hour prior to the procedure. Primary end point was reduction in pain intensity with these interventions compared with local infiltration alone. Pain was assessed using numerical FACES pain scale, a visual analogue scale. Secondary end points were to see the effect on pre procedure apprehension and to find out the other factors associated with increased pain related to the procedure. Statistical Analysis and Results A total of 300 patients were included in the study, 100 each in tramadol (T), EMLA (E), and only lignocaine local infiltration (L) arms, respectively. The mean pain intensity on the visual scale was significantly lower in the tramadol arm (T, E, L-3.4, 4.4, 4.7, respectively) ( p < 0.0005). There was a significant reduction in percentage of patients who experienced moderate/severe pain (four or more) in the tramadol arm (T, E, L-45, 77, 82%, respectively) ( p < 0.0005). Duration of procedure >10 minutes, body mass index >30, ECOG (Eastern Oncology Group) performance status >/=3, and age >50 years were positively correlated with more pain. Leukemia patients experienced significantly more pain compared with patients with lymphoma and other solid malignancies. Tramadol was well tolerated. No significant effect on pre-procedure apprehension was noted in any of the arms. Conclusion Tramadol appears to have a preventive effect on bone marrow aspiration/biopsy-associated pain and appears to be well tolerated, whereas EMLA was not associated with such an effect. Larger studies may be done to ascertain the same.","['MedIntel Services Pvt Ltd.

The present study was performed to evaluate alteration in bone mineral metabolism in children with ALL during chemotherapy. Method Fifty newly diagnosed patients with ALL in the age group of 2 to 14 years were included. Relapsed and refractory cases were excluded. Enrolled children were stratified into standard and high risk according to National Cancer Institute criteria. Quantitative analysis of bone resorptive marker carboxyl-terminal telopeptide of human type 1 collagen (ICTP) was assessed at baseline and 3 months after chemotherapy by the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Results Of 50 patients enrolled, 21 were standard and 29 were high risk. The mean age was 7.75 +/- 4.0 years and the male-to-female ratio was 3.5:1. ICTP levels were analyzed in 44 patients, of which 37 (84%) showed significantly increased levels. The mean ICTP level in patients at diagnosis and controls was 1.78 +/- 1.39 and 0.96 +/- 0.32 microg/L, respectively ( p = 0.001). The mean ICTP level at 3 months after chemotherapy increased to 3.55 +/- 1.40 microg/L ( p = 0.000). It was significantly increased in males ( p = 0.000) and in B cell ALL group ( p = 0.000) in comparison to females and T cell group. Both standard and high risk groups were equally affected ( p = 0.000). On multivariate analysis, no single risk factor could be identified. Conclusion The marker of bone resorption (ICTP) in children with ALL was increased at diagnosis, which further increased during chemotherapy. The disease itself and the intensive chemotherapy both contributed to the increased levels.","['MedIntel Services Pvt Ltd.

Thus, defining mechanisms underlying MLL-r ALL maintenance is critical for developing effective therapy. Methods: GSE13159 and GSE28497 were selected via the Oncomine website. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between MLL-r ALLs and normal samples were identified by R software. Next, functional enrichment analysis of these DEGs were carried out by Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING). Then, the key hub genes and modules were identified by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) ALL (Phase I) of UCSC Xena analysis, qPCR, and Kaplan-Meier analysis were conducted for validating the expression of key hub genes from bone marrow cells of childhood ALL patients or ALL cell lines. Results: A total of 1,045 DEGs were identified from GSE13159 and GSE28497. Through GO, KEGG, GSEA, and STRING analysis, we demonstrated that MLL-r ALLs were upregulating ""nucleosome assembly"" and ""B cell receptor signal pathway"" genes or proteins. WGCNA analysis found 18 gene modules using hierarchical clustering between MLL-r ALLs and normal. The Venn diagram was used to filter the 98 hub genes found in the key module with the 1,045 DEGs. We identified 18 hub genes from this process, 9 of which were found to be correlated with MLL-r status, using the UCSC Xena analysis. By using qPCR, we validated these 9 hub key genes to be upregulated in the MLL-r ALLs (RS4;11 and SEM) compared to the non-MLL-r ALL (RCH-ACV) cell lines. Three of these genes, BCL11A, GLT8D1 and NCBP2, were shown to be increased in MLL-r ALL patient bone marrows compared to the non-MLL-r ALL patient. Finally, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that childhood ALL patients with high BCL11A expression had significantly poor overall survival. Conclusion: These findings suggest that upregulated BCL11A gene expression in childhood ALLs may lead to MLL-r ALL development and BCL11A represents a new potential therapeutic target for childhood MLL-r ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Yan, Tang, Zhang, Liu, Wang, Zhang, Zhou, Li, Jiang,', 'Chen, Wen, Liu and Mai.']","['Wang, Lu-Lu', 'Yan, Dehong', 'Tang, Xue', 'Zhang, Mengqi', 'Liu, Shilin', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhang, Min', 'Zhou, Guichi', 'Li, Tonghui', 'Jiang, Feifei', 'Chen, Xiaowen', 'Wen, Feiqiu', 'Liu, Sixi', 'Mai, Huirong']","['Wang LL', 'Yan D', 'Tang X', 'Zhang M', 'Liu S', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang M', 'Zhou G', 'Li T', 'Jiang F', 'Chen X', 'Wen F', 'Liu S', 'Mai H']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", 'Guangdong Immune Cell Therapy Engineering and Technology Research Center, Center for Protein and Cell-Based Drugs, Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", 'Guangdong Immune Cell Therapy Engineering and Technology Research Center, Center for Protein and Cell-Based Drugs, Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211206,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL11A', 'MLL rearrangement', 'WGCNA', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'differentially expressed gene']",2021/12/24 06:00,2021/12/24 06:01,['2021/12/23 05:52'],"['2021/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/23 05:52 [entrez]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.755188 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 6;11:755188. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.755188. eCollection 2021.,11,,755188,,,,PMC8685382,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, although a high pharmacokinetic variability in patients and an increased risk of pleural effusion are attendant, fixed dosing remains standard practice. Retrospective studies have suggested that dasatinib exposure may be associated with treatment response (efficacy/safety). Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is gradually becoming a practical tool to achieve the goal of individualized medicine for patients receiving targeted drugs. With the help of TDM, these patients who maintain response while have minimum adverse events may achieve long-term survival. This review summaries current knowledge of the clinical pharmacokinetics variation, exposure-response relationships and analytical method for individualized dosing of dasatinib, in particular with respect to therapeutic drug monitoring. In addition, it highlights the emerging insights into several controversial issues in TDM of dasatinib, with the aim of presenting up-to-date evidence for clinical decision-making and insights for future studies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 He, Bian, Shao, Zhang, Hao, Luo, Feng and Huang.']","['He, Shiyu', 'Bian, Jialu', 'Shao, Qianhang', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Hao, Xu', 'Luo, Xingxian', 'Feng, Yufei', 'Huang, Lin']","['He S', 'Bian J', 'Shao Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Hao X', 'Luo X', 'Feng Y', 'Huang L']","[""Department of Pharmacy, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Pharmacy Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing, China."", 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211206,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['analytical method', 'dasatinib', 'exposure-response relationships', 'individualized medicine', 'pharmacokinetics', 'therapeutic drug monitoring']",2021/12/24 06:00,2021/12/24 06:01,['2021/12/23 05:47'],"['2021/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/23 05:47 [entrez]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.797881 [doi]', '797881 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Dec 6;12:797881. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.797881. eCollection 2021.,12,,797881,,,,PMC8685414,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we use a CRISPR-Cas9 screen to focus on genes that have been implicated in tRNA biogenesis, and identify a mechanism by which altered valine tRNA biogenesis enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Expression of valine aminoacyl tRNA synthetase is transcriptionally upregulated by NOTCH1, a key oncogene in T-ALL, underlining a role for oncogenic transcriptional programs in coordinating tRNA supply and demand. Limiting valine bioavailability through restriction of dietary valine intake disrupted this balance in mice, resulting in decreased leukaemic burden and increased survival in vivo. Mechanistically, valine restriction reduced translation rates of mRNAs that encode subunits of mitochondrial complex I, leading to defective assembly of complex I and impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen in differential valine conditions identified several genes, including SLC7A5 and BCL2, whose genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition synergized with valine restriction to reduce T-ALL growth. Our findings identify tRNA deregulation as a critical adaptation in the pathogenesis of T-ALL and provide a molecular basis for the use of dietary approaches to target tRNA biogenesis in blood malignancies.","['(c) 2021.

However, the transcriptomic networks governing hematopoietic differentiation in blood cell development remain incompletely defined. Here we report that the atypical kinase RIOK2 (right open reading frame kinase 2) is a master transcription factor (TF) that not only drives erythroid differentiation, but also simultaneously suppresses megakaryopoiesis and myelopoiesis in primary human stem and progenitor cells. Our study reveals the previously uncharacterized winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and two transactivation domains of RIOK2 that are critical to regulate key hematopoietic TFs GATA1, GATA2, SPI1, RUNX3 and KLF1. This establishes RIOK2 as an integral component of the transcriptional regulatory network governing human hematopoietic differentiation. Importantly, RIOK2 mRNA expression significantly correlates with these TFs and other hematopoietic genes in myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia and chronic kidney disease. Further investigation of RIOK2-mediated transcriptional pathways should yield therapeutic approaches to correct defective hematopoiesis in hematologic disorders.","['(c) 2021.

It was investigated for the treatment of solid tumors and several hematological indications such as relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera or non-hodgkin lymphoma. For safety reasons it cannot be given in healthy volunteers for drug-drug interaction (DDI) explorations. This triggered the need for in silico explorations on top of the one available CYP3A clinical DDI study with posaconazole in solid tumor patients. Idasanutlin's clearance is dependent on CYP3A4/2C8, forming its major circulating metabolite M4, with contributions from UGT1A3 and biliary excretion. Idasanutlin and M4 have low permeability, very low clearance and extremely low unbound fraction in plasma (<0.001) which makes in vitro data showing inhibition on CYP3A4/2C8 enzymes challenging to translate to clinical relevance. PBPK models of idasanutlin and M4 have been established to simulate perpetrator and victim DDI scenarios and to evaluate whether further DDI studies in oncology patients are necessary. Modelling indicated that idasanutlin and M4 would show no or weak clinical inhibition of selective CYP3A4/2C8 substrates. Co-administered strong CYP3A and CYP2C8 inhibitors might lead to weak or moderate idasanutlin exposure increases and the strong inducer rifampicin might cause moderate exposure reduction. Since the simulated idasanutlin systemic exposure changes would be within the range of observed intrinsic variability, the target population can take co-medications which are either CYP2C8/3A4 inhibitors or weak/moderate CYP2C8/3A4 inducers without dose adjustment. Significance Statement Clinical trials for idasanutlin are restricted to cancer patients, which imposes practical, scientific and ethical challenges on DDI investigations. Furthermore, idasanutlin and its major circulating metabolite have very challenging ADME profiles including high protein binding, low permeability and a combination of different elimination pathways each with extremely low clearance. Nonetheless, PBPK models could be established and applied for DDI risk assessment and were especially useful to provide guidance on concomitant medications in patients.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Umehara, Kenichi', 'Cleary, Yumi', 'Fowler, Stephen', 'Parrott, Neil', 'Tuerck, Dietrich W']","['Umehara K', 'Cleary Y', 'Fowler S', 'Parrott N', 'Tuerck DW']","['Pharmaceutical Sciences, Roche Pharmaceutical Research and Early Development, Switzerland kenichi.umehara@roche.com.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences, Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, F.

Obinutuzumab is a novel anti-CD20 antibody agent that has been approved for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) treatment. At the time of approval, it was not linked to SS; however, this phenomenon has been recognised with other anti-CD20 agents like rituximab. SS remains a rare entity, but it is important to be recognised accurately and quickly in the appropriate circumstances, so that effective treatment with corticosteroids can be initiated to alleviate inflammatory symptoms.

Previous studies have demonstrated the essential role of cyclin D3 in T-ALL disease initiation and progression and that targeting of the CDK4/6-cyclin D complex can suppress T-ALL proliferation, leading to efficient cell death in animal models. Studies in leukemia and other malignancies, suggest that schedule is important when combining CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDKis) with cytotoxic agents. Based on these observations, we broadened evaluation of two CDKis, palbociclib (PD-0332991, Pfizer) and ribociclib (LEE011, Novartis) in B and T-ALL as single agent and in combination with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, using different schedules in preclinical models. As monotherapy, CDKis caused cell cycle arrest with a significant decrease in S phase entry and were active in vivo across a broad number of patient-derived xenograft samples. Prolonged monotherapy induces resistance, for which we identified a potential novel mechanism using transcriptome profiling.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using registry data from the Kyoto Stem Cell Transplantation Group for patients with hematological malignancies who received their first allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using a single UCB unit (n = 460) or PTCy-haplo (N = 57) between 2013 and 2019. RESULTS: We found that overall survival in the UCB group was comparable to that in the PTCy-haplo group (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.52), although neutrophil and platelet engraftment were significantly delayed. Nonrelapse mortality risk and the incidence of graft-versus-host disease in the UCB group were also comparable to those in the PTCy-haplo group. Although the relapse risk was similar between the UCB group and the PTCy-haplo group regardless of the disease risk, acute myeloid leukemia patients benefit from UCB transplant with a significantly lower relapse rate (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: UCB transplant gives outcomes comparable to PTCy-haplo transplant, and both UCB and PTCy-haplo units are suitable as alternative donor sources for patients without an HLA-matched sibling or unrelated donor.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In most individuals, infection with C. immitis causes an asymptomatic, self-limited pulmonary infection; however, in a small percentage of individuals, the infection is disseminated and can involve any organ. We present the case of a 50-year-old man who was found unresponsive in his home in the northern portion of the United States. Autopsy revealed a 2163-g spleen. The initial differential diagnosis for the splenomegaly was an infection or a neoplastic process, such as leukemia. Because of the geographic location where the body was found, C. immitis was not initially considered; however, microscopic examination confirmed the presence of C. immitis spherules, which were found in the spleen and other organs. Granulomatous inflammation, often associated with spherules, was also present in a kidney, the pancreas, the thyroid gland, a parathyroid gland, and the heart. Additional investigation after the autopsy revealed that the decedent had spent time in the past in California, which would have allowed for exposure to C. immitis. The decedent had a rare form of a disease process not normally associated with the geographic location in which he was found, which highlights the need for continued diligence in death investigation so as to not allow a first impression to impair the correct final determination.",['Copyright (c) 2021 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.'],"['Amoth, Haley', 'Kemp, Walter L']","['Amoth H', 'Kemp WL']","['From the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Grand Forks, ND.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211221,United States,Am J Forensic Med Pathol,The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology,8108948,IM,,,2021/12/23 06:00,2021/12/23 06:00,['2021/12/22 12:36'],"['2021/12/22 12:36 [entrez]', '2021/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAF.0000000000000736 [doi]', '00000433-900000000-98909 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Am J Forensic Med Pathol. 2021 Dec 21. pii: 00000433-900000000-98909. doi: 10.1097/PAF.0000000000000736.,,,,,,,,,['The authors report no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CAR is manufactured to express T cells through various ways such as using retroviruses, transposons and transposase, electroporation, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Together, it provides flexibility since it recognizes proteins without the need of antigen processing and presentation, can recognize carbohydrates and lipids, and it has been proven to be cost-effective. Despite these benefits however, problems faced by this therapy include unrecognized tumor proteins possibly escaping the system, CAR T cell expression being transient, and the therapy being one of the most expensive cancer drug ever approved. As a result, recent progress has been ongoing where researchers have combined CAR-T cells with natural killer (NK) cells and different cytokines to maximize its efficacy and potency while limiting potential risks such as cytokine release syndrome. Consequently, these cells gained the ability to be universal-being able to be used to treat multiple patients, maintain viability for a longer period, and prevent relapse.",,"['Bangit, Lavina Ery Paula', 'Derwich, Katarzyna']","['Bangit LEP', 'Derwich K']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Trasnplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Trasnplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211217,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T cells', 'CRISPR', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'leukemia', 'natural killer cells']",2021/12/23 06:00,2021/12/23 06:00,['2021/12/22 12:27'],"['2021/12/22 12:27 [entrez]', '2021/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jayao.2021.0102 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2021 Dec 17. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2021.0102.,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7239-4035'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the prognostic significance of CRS has not been well elucidated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between CRS and efficacy after anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy in a retrospective cohort of 22 patients with relapsed/refractory B cell hematological malignancies. The complete remission (CR) rates after CAR-T therapy were 68%, and median value for progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.8 months. Eight of 22 (36.4%) patients showed >/= grade 2 CRS. Statistical analysis found that patients with >/= grade 2 CRS had higher CR rates and longer PFS than those with < grade 2 CRS.

To explore the relationship between CD59, FLAER, and AML, we investigated CD59 and FLAER expression in AML and analyzed their relationship with clinical characteristics of AML patients. METHODS: We employed flow cytometry (FCM) to analyze CD59 and FLAER expression in 161 AML patients at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and evaluated its association with sex, white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet (PLT) count, thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), D-Dimer(D-D), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), followed by analyzing its connection with disease progression and complete remission (CR). RESULTS: CD59 and FLAER deficiencies were identified in AML patients. Compared with CR group, non-CR group patients revealed more CD59 and FLAER deficiency. Compared with non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) group, M3 group patients had more CD59 and FLAER deficiency. CD59(-) level in primordial cells of M3 patients was positively correlated with primordial cell ratio (r = 0.660, p = 0.003). Additionally, we discovered that the decline in CD59 and FLAER levels might be linked to higher D-D and LDH in AML patients. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the decline in CD59 and FLAER levels was associated with leukemia cell proliferation and abnormal coagulation function in AML, suggesting that they could serve as a predictor of AML coagulation dysfunction, particularly in M3.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Population-based study. Patients: Female cancer patients diagnosed with cancer at age 18 years old or older between 1952-2014 (n = 17,952) were compared to fertility of non-cancer controls (n = 89,436). Interventions: Live births in cancer survivors were compared with those in healthy, age-matched controls. Cases and controls were matched in the ratio of 5:1 for birth year, birthplace (Utah, yes/no), and follow-up time in Utah. Main Outcome Measure: Rate of at least one live birth, reported as an incidence rate ratio (IRR). Results: Of all cancer survivors, 3,127 (17.4%) had at least 1 live birth after treatment in comparison to 19,405 healthy, age-matched controls (21.7%) with the same amount of time exposure for attempting pregnancy. Breast cancer was the most common cancer type (23.1% of patients in cohort). Compared with age-matched, healthy controls, IRR of live birth was 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.70) for all cancer types, 0.25 (95% CI, 0.20-0.33) for leukemia, 0.40 (95% CI, 0.28-0.59) for gastrointestinal cancers, 0.44 (95% CI, 0.41-0.48) for breast cancer, 0.53 (95% CI, 0.47-0.59) for central nervous system cancers, and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.44-0.73) for soft tissue cancers. With all cancer types stratified by age at diagnosis, IRR for live births in cancer survivors aged >41 years at diagnosis was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.44-0.52); IRR was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.67) in the group aged 31-40 years and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69-0.74) in the group aged 18-30 years after their cancer treatment.

It is copiously expressed during human fetal development but is infrequently present in adult tissues. In this experiment, we researched the treatment effect of the secretome that adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) transfected with survivin. Methods: First of all, we generated survivin-overexpressing ASCs transfected with a plasmid comprising a gene encoding survivin. The secreted substances released from survivin-overexpressing ASCs (survivin-secretome) were collected, and were determined their in vitro and in vivo therapeutic potential, especially in the model of liver impairment. Results: In vitro, the survivin-secretome significantly increased cell viability and promoted the expression of proliferation-related markers (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA], phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3), hepatocyte growth factor [HGF], vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) and anti-apoptosis-related markers (myeloid cell leukemia-1 [Mcl-1] and survivin) (P < 0.05). In vivo using 70% hepatectomy mice, the survivin-secretome group exhibited the lowest serum levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P < 0.05). The serum levels of liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) were also the lowest in the survivin-secretome group (P < 0.05). The survivin-secretome group also exhibited the highest liver regeneration on the 7th day after 70% partial hepatectomy (P < 0.05). In the subsequent liver specimen analysis, the specimens of survivin-secretome exhibited the highest expression of p-STAT3, HGF, VEGF, PCNA, and Mcl-1 and the lowest expression of bcl-2-like protein 4 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Taken together, secretome secreted by survivin-overexpressing ASCs could be an effective way to improve liver regeneration and repair for liver injury treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021, the Korean Surgical Society.']","['Kim, Cho-Hee', 'Kim, Ok-Hee', 'Park, Jung Hyun', 'Kim, Say-June']","['Kim CH', 'Kim OH', 'Park JH', 'Kim SJ']","[""Department of Surgery, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Catholic Central Laboratory of Surgery, Institute of Biomedical Industry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Surgery, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Catholic Central Laboratory of Surgery, Institute of Biomedical Industry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Surgery, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Surgery, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Surgery, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Catholic Central Laboratory of Surgery, Institute of Biomedical Industry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211201,Korea (South),Ann Surg Treat Res,Annals of surgical treatment and research,101622895,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adipose-derived stem cell', 'Apoptosis', 'Liver regeneration', 'Secretome', 'Survivin']",2021/12/23 06:00,2021/12/23 06:01,['2021/12/22 06:51'],"['2021/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/22 06:51 [entrez]', '2021/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4174/astr.2021.101.6.322 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Treat Res. 2021 Dec;101(6):322-331. doi: 10.4174/astr.2021.101.6.322.

Downregulation of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), a known breast tumor suppressor, enables otherwise dormant MCF7 human breast cancer cells to become aggressively osteolytic. Hypoxia (low oxygen tensions), which may develop in tumors as a pathological response to the metabolic demands of the proliferating cells and as a physiological state in the bone, downregulates LIFR in breast cancer cells independent of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling. However, the mechanism by which LIFR is repressed in hypoxia is unknown. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors stimulate LIFR by increasing histone acetylation in the proximal promoter and induce a dormancy phenotype in breast cancer cells inoculated into the mammary fat pad. We therefore aimed to determine whether hypoxia alters histone acetylation in the LIFR promoter, and whether HDAC inhibitors effectively stimulate LIFR in breast cancer cells residing in hypoxic microenvironments. Herein, we confirmed that disseminated MCF7 cells became hypoxic in the bone and that hypoxia increased the epigenetic transcriptional repressor H3K9me3 in the distal LIFR promoter while H3K9ac, which promotes transcription, was significantly reduced. Furthermore, HDAC inhibitor treatment rescued hypoxic repression and dramatically increased expression of LIFR, p38beta, and p21, which regulate tumor dormancy. In a second model of LIFR repression, in which parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) suppresses LIFR expression, we found that PTHrP binds to the distal LIFR promoter, and that PTHrP suppression of LIFR protein is similarly reversed by HDAC inhibitor treatment. Together, these data suggest that HDAC inhibitors stimulate LIFR regardless of the way it is repressed by the microenvironment.",['(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier GmbH.'],"['Edwards, Courtney M', 'Clements, Miranda E', 'Vecchi, Lawrence A 3rd', 'Johnson, Jasmine A', 'Johnson, Rachelle W']","['Edwards CM', 'Clements ME', 'Vecchi LA 3rd', 'Johnson JA', 'Johnson RW']","['Graduate Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Graduate Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Graduate Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211201,Netherlands,J Bone Oncol,Journal of bone oncology,101610292,,,,2021/12/23 06:00,2021/12/23 06:01,['2021/12/22 06:50'],"['2021/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/22 06:50 [entrez]', '2021/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jbo.2021.100407 [doi]', 'S2212-1374(21)00062-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Bone Oncol. 2021 Dec 1;31:100407. doi: 10.1016/j.jbo.2021.100407. eCollection 2021 Dec.,31,,100407,,,,PMC8661052,,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cumulative cancer incidence for LFS patients by the age of 70 years is 80-100%, mostly involving adrenocortical carcinoma, brain tumors, bone and soft tissue sarcomas, leukemia and female breast cancer from the age of 20 years. Dominant negative TP53 variant is correlated with an increased tumorigenesis risk in LFS. Sporadic TP53 mutations are related to almost half of global cancers since p53 in addition to p73 protein represent essential players in anticancer cellular protection. Epidemiological aspects concerning skin cancers, especially malignant melanoma (MM), in LFS are less clear. A low level of statistical evidence demonstrates LFS cases with pediatric MM, multiple MM, spitzoid MM, atypical presentations, mucosal and uveal MM. Retrospective cohorts indicate a higher cumulative risk than the general population by the age of 70 years for MM and basal cell carcinoma. Non-syndromic and syndromic TP53 mutations are a major pathway of metastasis, including MM. In LHS, an important level of awareness involves skin cancers despite not being a part of the typical malignancy-containing picture. Additional data are crucially needed. However, at least one dermatologic control is a step in the multidisciplinary panel of surveillance of these patients; but in cases with benign and pre-malign pigmentations, serial dermatoscopy and full body photography are recommended for early melanoma detection in order to improve the prognosis and to reduce the overall malignancy burden.","['Copyright (c) 2020, Spandidos Publications.']","['Sandru, Florica', 'Dumitrascu, Mihai Cristian', 'Petca, Aida', 'Carsote, Mara', 'Petca, Razvan-Cosmin', 'Ghemigian, Adina']","['Sandru F', 'Dumitrascu MC', 'Petca A', 'Carsote M', 'Petca RC', 'Ghemigian A']","[""Department of Dermatology, 'Carol Davila' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 050474 Bucharest, Romania."", ""Department of Dermatology, 'Elias' Emergency Hospital, 011461 Bucharest, Romania."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 'Carol Davila' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 050474 Bucharest, Romania."", 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Emergency Hospital, 050098 Bucharest, Romania.', ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 'Carol Davila' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 050474 Bucharest, Romania."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 'Elias' Emergency Hospital, 022461 Bucharest, Romania."", ""Department of Endocrinology, 'Carol Davila' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 050474 Bucharest, Romania."", ""Department of Endocrinology, 'C.

It was previously demonstrated that the adhesion molecule integrin alpha4, referred to hereafter as alpha4, mediates the cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) of B-cell ALL by binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on bone marrow stroma. In addition, it was previously observed that the blockade of alpha4 with natalizumab or inhibition using the small molecule antagonist TBC3486 sensitized relapsed ALL cells to chemotherapy. However, alpha4-targeted therapy is not clinically available for the treatment of leukemia to date. In the present study, the use of a novel non-peptidic small molecule integrin alpha4 antagonist, AVA4746, as a potential new approach to combat drug-resistant B-ALL was explored. An in vitro co-culture = model of primary B-ALL cells and an in vivo xenograft model of patient-derived B-ALL cells were utilized for evaluation of AVA4746. VLA-4 conformation activation, cell adhesion/de-adhesion, endothelial tube formation, in vivo leukemia cell mobilization and survival assays were performed. AVA4746 exhibited high affinity for binding to B-ALL cells, where it also efficiently blocked ligand-binding to VCAM-1. In addition, AVA4746 caused the functional de-adhesion of primary B-ALL cells from VCAM-1. Inhibition of alpha4 using AVA4746 also prevented angiogenesis in vitro and when applied in combination with chemotherapy consisting of Vincristine, Dexamethasone and L-asparaginase, it prolonged the survival of ~33% of the mice in an in vivo xenograft model of B-ALL.

METTL14, an N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification protein, plays several roles in cancer development and is involved in the pathogenesis of various types of cancers. However, the role of METTL14 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pediatric ALL susceptibility remains to be investigated. Methods: A case-control design and multinomial logistic regression were used to develop models to estimate the overall risk for pediatric ALL and three METTL14 gene SNPs (rs298982 G/A, rs298981 A/G and rs1064034 T/A) in 808 cases and 1340 controls, which were genotyped using a TaqMan assay. The associations were estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Furthermore, stratified analysis was performed to explore associations of rs298982 and rs1064034 with pediatric ALL susceptibility in terms of age, sex, immunophenotype, minimal residual disease (MRD), and other clinical characteristics. Results: Among the three analyzed SNPs, rs298982 G/A and rs1064034 T/A exhibited a significant association with decreased childhood ALL risk, while rs298981 A/G exhibited no difference. In stratified analysis, rs298982 GA/AA and rs1064034 TA/AA had a protective effect in children <120 months of age and males, common B ALL, TEL-AML, non gene fusion, normal diploid, and high WBC. However, the rs1064034 TA/AA genotype was associated with an increased risk of mixed immunophenotyping. Compared with the reference haplotype GAT, haplotypes CAA, CGT and CGA were significantly associated with elevated ALL risk, while haplotype GGT was significantly associated decreased ALL risk. Moreover, subjects carrying rs298982 A or rs1064034 A exhibited less minimal MRD after induced chemotherapy. Functional annotations revealed that METTL14 gene SNPs rs298982 G/A and rs1064034 T/A could be potential functional variants. Conclusion: In conclusion, METTL14 gene polymorphisms influence the risk of ALL in southern Chinese children and might be potential biomarkers for pediatric ALL susceptibility and chemotherapeutics.",['(c) 2021 Luo et al.'],"['Luo, Ailing', 'Yang, Lihua', 'Li, Ming', 'Cai, Mansi', 'Huang, Amin', 'Liu, Xiaodan', 'Yang, Xu', 'Yan, Yaping', 'Wang, Xueliang', 'Wu, Xuedong', 'Huang, Ke', 'Huang, Libin', 'Liu, Shanshan', 'Xu, Ling', 'Liu, Xiaoping']","['Luo A', 'Yang L', 'Li M', 'Cai M', 'Huang A', 'Liu X', 'Yang X', 'Yan Y', 'Wang X', 'Wu X', 'Huang K', 'Huang L', 'Liu S', 'Xu L', 'Liu X']","[""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Pediatric Center of Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""The Emergency Department of Zhuzhou Central Hospital, Zhuzhou, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Division of Birth Cohort Study, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Pediatrics Department, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211214,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Chinese children', 'METTL14', 'SNP', 'susceptibility']",2021/12/23 06:00,2021/12/23 06:01,['2021/12/22 06:47'],"['2021/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/22 06:47 [entrez]', '2021/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S335925 [doi]', '335925 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2021 Dec 14;13:9189-9200. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S335925. eCollection 2021.,13,,9189-9200,,,,PMC8684373,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 1635 acute leukemia cases in our center from January 2012 to June 2018. The diagnose of ALAL was based on either EGIL or 2016 WHO criteria, a total of 39 patients were included. Four patients diagnosed as acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) by both classification systems. Among the patients underwent high-throughput sequencing, 89.5% were detected at least one mutation and the median number of gene mutation was 3 (0-8) per sample. The most frequently mutated genes were NRAS (4, 21%), CEBPA (4, 21%), JAK3 (3, 16%), RUNX1 (3, 16%). The mutations detected in mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) enriched in genes related to genomic stability and transcriptional regulation; while AUL cases frequently mutated in genes involved in signaling pathway. The survival analysis strongly suggested that mutation burden may play important roles to predict the clinical outcomes of ALAL. In addition, the patients excluded by WHO criteria had even worse clinical outcome than those included. The association of the genetic complexity of blast cells with the clinical outcomes and rationality of the diagnostic criteria of WHO system need to be evaluated by more large-scale prospective clinical studies.",['(c) 2021.

Transformation of CLL/SLL to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common (2-9%), but T-cell and Hodgkin transformation (HL) (0.4%) occur, although less frequently. CASE REPORT A 68-year-old woman initially diagnosed with CLL/SLL presented to the hospital with fever, weakness, abdominal pain, and vomiting. The physical examination showed hepatosplenomegaly and extensive abdominal lymphadenopathy on radiological imaging. The laboratory work-up revealed pancytopenia and a markedly increased alkaline phosphatase. In the setting of extensive granulomatous hepatitis, the development of aggressive Hodgkin lymphoma Richter transformation with multi-organ involvement within a few months led to the patient's sudden death. Autopsy findings led to the post-mortem diagnosis of Richter's transformation of CLL. CONCLUSIONS Here, we describe a rare case of Hodgkin lymphoma RT from progressive CLL, with transformation occurring at approximately 12 years after initial diagnosis, despite treatment. Our case report underscores the diagnostic challenges and pitfalls associated with the granulomatous presentation masking RT transformation of CLL to Hodgkin lymphoma. The purpose of this report is to raise suspicion for the clinicopathological signs of Richter transformation in the presence of an atypical granulomatous presentation.",,"['Buckley, Tinera', 'Inamdar, Arati', 'Mikhail, Nagyl H', 'Loo, Abraham', 'Cohen, Seth']","['Buckley T', 'Inamdar A', 'Mikhail NH', 'Loo A', 'Cohen S']","['Department of Pathology, RWJBH/Saint Barnabas Medical Center, Livingston, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, RWJBH/Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, RWJBH/Saint Barnabas Medical Center, Livingston, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, RWJBH/Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, RWJBH/Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, RWJBH/Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, RWJBH/Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20211222,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,IM,,,2021/12/23 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/12/22 06:01'],"['2021/12/22 06:01 [entrez]', '2021/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['932904 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.932904 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2021 Dec 22;22:e932904. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.932904.,22,,e932904,,,,,,,,,,,20211223,,"['Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Hepatomegaly', '*Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ponatinib is a new pan-inhibitor of TK active in resistant CML. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ponatinib in patients suffering from CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter, non-randomized, observational, retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ponatinib administered in adult CML patients in any disease phase, including those with a detected ABL T315I mutation, which were resistant or intolerant to previous-generation TKIs. The study comprised 43 patients benefiting from the ponatinib donation program who were treated in 16 Polish centers. RESULTS: For patients who started treatment with ponatinib in chronic phase (CP) (n = 23) and in accelerated phase (AP) (n = 3) the median time on ponatinib was 19.5 months (range: 1.0-35.4), and 31.7 months (range: 31.0-34.1), respectively. All these patients were in CP after 1 month of treatment and at the end of observation - none of them progressed to AP or blastic phase (BP) during the study, meaning that progression-free survival was 100% at the end of observation (35.4 months). The estimated 2-year survival in this group of patients was 84%. For all 43 patients, median survival was not reached (lower quartile 6.3 months), and estimated 2-year survival was 60%. CONCLUSION: Our analysis confirmed ponatinib efficacy in a significant proportion of patients heavily pre-treated with TKIs achieving durable responses in both CP and AP/BP CML groups.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

The discovery of IDH1 mutation in AML together with the frequent co-mutations; NPM1 and FLT3-ITD throughs a new insight into the pathogenesis and outcome of CN-AML. Recently, there has been an increasing number of recurring mutations in other genes for which the forecasting effect is still required. Despite the large number of risk variables established, there are relatively few prognostic indicators that can help in treatment decisions in AML patients. This study aimed at recording the frequency of IDH1 and NPM1 mutations in newly diagnosed AML and, dual clinicopathological significance. IDH1 and NPM1 mutations were analyzed using High-Resolution Melting curve analysis PCR in 78 newly diagnosed AML patients; 30 pediatric and 48 adult AML patients. IDH1 mutation was detected in 6 out of the 48 adult AML cases (12.5%) and all of them had intermediate cytogenetic prognostic stratification. 5/6 mutant IDH1 patients showed NPM1 co-mutation (P-value= 0.008). Mutant IDH1 patients showed significant resistance to induction therapy (P-value <0.001) and even those who achieved complete remission were relapsed later. Within the intermediate cytogenetic group, the IDH1 mutated patients had short overall survival (HR 12.9, 95% CI (3.1- 53.45) and event-free survival (HR 15.7, 95% CI (2.99-82.72) and P-value <0.001).

High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has been proven to have a important role in drug resistance via upregulation of autophagy after chemotherapy treatment in acute leukemia. However, the mechanism how extracellular HMGB1 acts on AL cells and leads to chemoresistance remains elusive. METHOD: CCK8 was used to examine the toxicity of chemotherapeutic drug. Elisa was performed to detect the release of HMGB1. Western blot and mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenoviral particles as well as transmission electron microscopy were used to detect the autophagy flux. Western blot and flow cytometry were applied to evaluate the apoptosis. qPCR and western blot were conducted to detect the expression of drug efflux protein. Lentivirus infection was applied to knock down RAGE. In addition, T-ALL NOD/SCID mice xenograft model was used to observe the effect of inhibiting HMGB1/RAGE axis. RESULTS: We found that extracellular HMGB1 do upregulate autophagy and in the meantime downregulate apoptosis, primarily through interaction with receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Suppression of RAGE by RNA interference alleviated the level of autophagy and enhanced apoptosis. What's more, HMGB1/RAGE induced autophagy was associated with the activation of ERK1/2 and decreased phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), while HMGB1/RAGE limited apoptosis in a Bcl-2-regulated way mediated by P53. On the other hand, we found that HMGB1/RAGE activated the NF-kappaB pathway and promoted the expression of P-glycation protein (P-gp) as well as multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), both are ATP-binding cassette transporters. In vivo experiment, we found that blocking HMGB1/RAGE axis do have a mild pathological condition and a better survival in T-ALL mice. CONCLUSION: HMGB1/RAGE have a important role in drug resistance after chemotherapy treatment, mainly by regulating autophagy and apoptosis as well as promoting the expression of drug efflux protein such as P-gp and MRP. HMGB1/RAGE might be a promising target to cure AL, especially for those met with relapse and refractory.",['(c) 2021.

Precise risk stratification remains crucial for choosing optimal management strategies. Several conventional prognostic scoring systems have been developed and validated in the MDS population. These risk models divide patients into prognostic subgroups based on clinical and cytogenetic characteristics. Lack of dynamicity, variable risk estimate across models, and heterogeneity within intermediate-risk group are the limitations of traditional models like IPSS-R, with questionable relevance of these scoring systems in treated MDS patients. Recent progress in next-generation sequencing techniques has improved understanding of the distribution and prognostic importance of recurrent genetic mutations in MDS. Early studies have suggested that incorporating mutations in risk stratification could supplement IPSS-R in further refining the model's performance in predicting overall survival and risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia and should translate into a molecularly driven prognostication approach in the near future.",,"['Ball, Somedeb', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Sallman, David A']","['Ball S', 'Komrokji RS', 'Sallman DA']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

The mechanism of KSHV-induced oncogenesis remains unclear. By performing a CRISPR-Cas9 screening in a model of KSHV-induced cellular transformation of primary cells, we identified epigenetic regulators that were essential for KSHV-induced cellular transformation. Examination of TCGA data sets of the top 9 genes, including glutamate-rich WD repeat containing 1 (GRWD1), a WD40 family protein upregulated by KSHV, that had positive effects on cell proliferation and survival of KSHV-transformed cells (KMM) but not the matched primary cells (MM), uncovered the predictive values of their expressions for patient survival in numerous types of cancer. We revealed global epigenetic remodeling including H3K4me3 epigenetic active mark in KMM cells compared to MM cells. Knockdown of GRWD1 inhibited cell proliferation, cellular transformation, and tumor formation and caused downregulation of global H3K4me3 mark in KMM cells. GRWD1 interacted with WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5), the core protein of H3K4 methyltransferase complex, and several H3K4me3 methyltransferases, including myeloid leukemia 2 (MLL2). Knockdown of WDR5 and MLL2 phenocopied GRWD1 knockdown, caused global reduction of H3K4me3 mark, and altered the expression of similar sets of genes. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses further identified common and distinct cellular genes and pathways that were regulated by GRWD1, WDR5, and MLL2. These results indicate that KSHV hijacks the GRWD1-WDR5-MLL2 epigenetic complex to regulate H3K4me3 methylation of specific genes, which is essential for KSHV-induced cellular transformation. Our work has identified an epigenetic complex as a novel therapeutic target for KSHV-induced cancers. IMPORTANCE By performing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we have identified cellular epigenetic regulators that are essential for KSHV-induced cellular transformation. Among them, GRWD1 regulates epigenetic active mark H3K4me3 by interacting with WDR5 and MLL2 and recruiting them to chromatin loci of specific genes in KSHV-transformed cells. Hence, KSHV hijacks the GRWD1-WDR5-MLL2 complex to remodel cellular epigenome and induce cellular transformation. Since the dysregulation of GRWD1 is associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancer, GRWD1 might also be a critical driver in other viral or nonviral cancers.",,"['Wei, Shan', 'Lu, Songjian', 'Liang, Lifan', 'Wang, Xian', 'Li, Wan', 'Li, Tingting', 'Chen, Luping', 'Ju, Enguo', 'Zhang, Xinquan', 'Lai, Zhao', 'Huang, Yufei', 'Lu, Xinghua', 'Gao, Shou-Jiang']","['Wei S', 'Lu S', 'Liang L', 'Wang X', 'Li W', 'Li T', 'Chen L', 'Ju E', 'Zhang X', 'Lai Z', 'Huang Y', 'Lu X', 'Gao SJ']","['Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute and Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA."", 'Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Cancer Virology Program, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211221,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['GRWD1', 'H3 lysine 4 trimethylation', 'H3K4me3', 'KS', 'KSHV', ""Kaposi's sarcoma"", ""Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus"", 'MLL2', 'WD repeat domain 5', 'WDR5', 'epigenetic regulators', 'glutamate-rich WD repeat containing 1', 'myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 2']",2021/12/23 06:00,2021/12/23 06:00,['2021/12/22 01:00'],"['2021/12/22 01:00 [entrez]', '2021/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1128/mbio.03431-21 [doi]'],ppublish,mBio. 2021 Dec 21;12(6):e0343121. doi: 10.1128/mbio.03431-21.

RNA-seq is a powerful next-generation sequencing technology with the ability to simultaneously identify cryptic gene rearrangements, sequence mutations and gene expression profiles in a single assay. We examined the feasibility and utility of incorporating RNA-seq into a prospective multi-center phase 3 clinical trial for children with newly-diagnosed ALL. Patients enrolled on the DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 16-001 who consented to optional studies and had available material underwent RNA-seq. RNA-seq was performed in 173 ALL patients. RNA-seq identified at least one alteration in 157 (91%) patients. Fusion detection was 100% concordant with results obtained from conventional cytogenetic analyses. An additional 56 gene fusions were identified by RNA-seq, many of which confer prognostic or therapeutic significance. Gene expression profiling enabled further molecular classification into the following B-ALL subgroups: High hyperdiploid (n=36), ETV6-RUNX1/-like (n=31), TCF3-PBX1 (n=7), KMT2A-rearranged (n=5), iAMP21 (n=1), hypodiploid (n=1), BCR-ABL1/-like (n=16), DUX4-rearranged (n=11), PAX5 alterations (n=11), PAX5 P80R (n=1), ZNF384-rearranged (n=4), NUTM1-rearranged (n=1), MEF2D-rearranged (n=1) and Others (n=10). RNA-seq identified 141 nonsynonymous mutations in 93 (54%) patients; the most frequent were RAS-MAPK pathway mutations. Among 79 patients with both low-density array and RNA-seq data for the Ph-like gene signature prediction, results were concordant in 74 (94%) patients.

This phase 2 study investigated the activity and safety of durvalumab, a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, combined with azacitidine for patients aged >/=65 years with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including analyses to identify biomarkers of treatment response. Patients were randomized to first-line therapy with azacitidine 75 mg/m2 on days 1-7 with (Arm A, n= 64) or without (Arm B, n=65) durvalumab 1500 mg on day 1 every 4 weeks. Overall response rate (complete response [CR] + CR with incomplete blood recovery [CRi]) was similar in both arms (Arm A, 31.3%; Arm B, 35.4%), as were overall survival (A, 13.0 months; B, 14.4 months) and duration of response (A, 24.6 weeks; B, 51.7 weeks; P=0.0765). No new safety signals emerged with combination treatment. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were constipation (Arm A, 57.8%; Arm B, 53.2%) and thrombocytopenia (A, 42.2%; B, 45.2%). DNA methylation, mutational status, and PD-L1 expression were not associated with response to treatment.

34932836,NLM,MEDLINE,20220111,1469-493X (Electronic) 1361-6137 (Linking),2021 Dec 21,Transfusion thresholds for guiding red blood cell transfusion.,10.1002/14651858.CD002042.pub5 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 96%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I(2) = 30%; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high-quality evidence)). High-quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone-marrow disorders. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30-day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a hematopoietic stem cells disorder treated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors but often cause recurrence of the leukaemia after cessation of therapy, hence require alternative treatment. This study determines the anti-cancer effect of leaf, root and bulb methanolic and aqueous extracts of B. natalensis and C. comosum in chronic human myelogenous leukaemia (K562) cell line by MTT, Hoechst bis-benzimide nuclear and annexin V stain assays. The root methanolic extract of B. natalensis and C. comosum showed a high cytotoxicity of 8.6% and 16.7% respectively on the K562 cell line at 1,000 mug/ml concentration. Morphological loss of cell membrane integrity causing degradation of the cell and fragmentation were observed in the root methanolic extract of both plants. A high apoptosis (p < 0.0001) was induced in the K562 cells by both leaf and root extracts of the C. comosum compared to the B. natalensis. This study shows both plants possess apoptotic effect against in vitro myelogenous leukaemia which contributes to the overall anti-cancer properties of B. natalensis and C. comosum to justify future therapeutic applications against chronic myelogenous leukaemia blood cancer.",,"['Padayachee, B', 'Odun-Ayo, F', 'Reddy, L']","['Padayachee B', 'Odun-Ayo F', 'Reddy L']","['Durban University of Technology - DUT, Department of Biotechnology and Food Technology, Steve Biko Campus, Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.', 'Cape Peninsula University of Technology - CPUT, Department of Biotechnology and Consumer Sciences, District Six Campus, Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa.', 'Cape Peninsula University of Technology - CPUT, Department of Biotechnology and Consumer Sciences, District Six Campus, Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211220,Brazil,Braz J Biol,Brazilian journal of biology = Revista brasleira de biologia,101129542,IM,,,2021/12/22 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/12/21 17:25'],"['2021/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/21 17:25 [entrez]', '2021/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1519-69842024000100154 [pii]', '10.1590/1519-6984.251336 [doi]']",epublish,Braz J Biol. 2021 Dec 20;84:e251336. doi: 10.1590/1519-6984.251336. eCollection 2021.,84,,e251336,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0019-9609', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4939-4509']",,,,,,,,,20211223,,"['Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', '*Xanthorrhoeaceae']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the front-line setting, novel-agent-based approaches, including continuous Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor-based therapy and time-limited venetoclax with obinutuzumab, have demonstrated survival benefit over chemoimmunotherapy. While novel-agent-based front-line approaches are appropriate for most patients, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) remains a consideration for a selected population of young patients with immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (IGHV)-mutated disease because of the possibility of a prolonged remission following FCR. As front-line novel-agent-based approaches have not been compared directly, decision making regarding which novel-agent-based approach to use in the front-line setting is often based on comorbidities and shared decision making. In the relapsed/refractory setting, BTK inhibitors, venetoclax-based therapy, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors have demonstrated survival benefit when compared with chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Data to support various treatment sequences are limited, which highlights the need for prospective data to examine the optimal treatment sequence. Finally, we examine therapies with combinations of novel agents, and novel agents in development, including covalent and noncovalent BTK inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitors, immunotherapies, and cellular therapies. With effective approved options and new agents in development, the role of chemoimmunotherapy in the management of CLL has diminished.","['(c) 2021.

We determined the pattern of hyperglycemia and associated factors in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving glucocorticoids and pegaspargase during induction. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients treated between 2010 and 2020 at a single institution. Pretreatment data, glucose values, and insulin regimens were abstracted from the record. Hyperglycemia was defined as two or more random glucose measurements >/=200 mg/dl. Analyses of demographic and clinical factors were conducted with logistic regression. RESULTS: Two hundred thirteen patients, median age 6 years (range 1.0-18.9 years), 47% female, were included. The prevalence of hyperglycemia was 23% (n = 48). Mean glucose levels peaked 3 days following administration of pegaspargase. In multivariable analysis, age >/=10 years (odds ratio [OR] 6.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.9-13.4), female sex (OR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2-6.2), and family history of diabetes (OR 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4-7.3) were predictive of hyperglycemia. Age >/=10 years (OR 19.4, 95% CI: 5.5-68.4), family history of diabetes (OR 8.2, 95% CI: 2.7-25.3), and higher body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-2.9) were associated with insulin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Onset of hyperglycemia in children receiving induction chemotherapy for ALL is temporally linked to administration of pegaspargase. Older age, female sex, and family history of diabetes are predictive of hyperglycemia during induction; older age, family history of diabetes, and higher BMI are associated with insulin treatment.

Reported differences in survival for children from families with different socioeconomic positions seem to arise when starting maintenance therapy. This could reflect reduced physician's compliance or family adherence to maintenance therapy. METHODS: This nationwide cohort study with extensive monitoring of systemic methotrexate (MTX)/6-mercaptopurine (6MP) dosing and metabolite levels, retrospectively investigated 173 Danish children treated according to The Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol from 2008 to 2016. RESULTS: Significantly lower prescribed doses of MTX and 6MP were seen in the children in families with short parental education (short vs. medium vs. higher education: mMTX: 13.8, 16.2, and 18.6 mg/m(2) /week; p < .01; m6MP: 47.4, 64.9, and 66.1 mg/m(2) /day; p = .03) or parents unemployed/not in workforce (unemployed/not in workforce vs. mixed vs. at work: mMTX: 15.0, 19.9, and 17.2 mg/m(2) /week; p < .01; m6MP: 54.8, 72.0, and 65.1 mg/m(2) /day; p < .01). When assessing family adherence by analyzing MTX and 6MP metabolite levels, including per prescribed dose of MTX and 6MP, we found no significant differences by levels of parental education, affiliation to work market, or income (p > .05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that inferior physician compliance to protocol recommendations on drug dosage rather than families' adherence to therapy may contribute to the association between socioeconomic position and cure rates in childhood ALL, although precise mechanisms remain to be explored.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Pedersen, Line Hjollund', 'Ostergaard, Anna', 'Bank, Victoria', 'Nersting, Jacob', 'Tuckuviene, Ruta', 'Wehner, Peder Skov', 'Albertsen, Birgitte Klug', 'Degn, Matilda', 'Als-Nielsen, Bodil Elise Thorhauge', 'Larsen, Hanne Baekgaard', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Dalton, Susanne Oksbjerg']","['Pedersen LH', 'Ostergaard A', 'Bank V', 'Nersting J', 'Tuckuviene R', 'Wehner PS', 'Albertsen BK', 'Degn M', 'Als-Nielsen BET', 'Larsen HB', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Dalton SO']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Survivorship and Inequality in Cancer, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hans Christian Andersen Children's Hospital, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark."", 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Survivorship and Inequality in Cancer, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology & Palliative Care, Zealand University Hospital, Naestved, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211221,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['adherence', 'childhood leukemia', 'compliance', 'maintenance therapy', 'socioeconomic position']",2021/12/22 06:00,2021/12/22 06:00,['2021/12/21 08:49'],"['2021/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/21 08:49 [entrez]', '2021/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.29508 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec 21:e29508. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29508.,,,e29508,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7305-098X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5149-5803', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9144-7972', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3902-3694', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3093-3525', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7152-3106', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0829-4993']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that tBID can also mediate mitochondrial permeabilization by itself, resulting in release of cytochrome c and mitochondrial DNA, caspase activation and apoptosis even in absence of BAX and BAK. This previously unrecognized activity of tBID depends on helix 6, homologous to the pore-forming regions of BAX and BAK, and can be blocked by pro-survival BCL-2 proteins. Importantly, tBID-mediated mitochondrial permeabilization independent of BAX and BAK is physiologically relevant for SMAC release in the immune response against Shigella infection.

The patients were from 39 to 91 years of age (mean: 53 y). In 2 cases, the breast primary and ovarian metastasis were diagnosed synchronously, and in 5, the breast primary was only discovered after the metastatic carcinoma in the ovary was found. In the majority of cases (79%), both ovaries were involved; the mean ovarian tumor size was 5.9 cm. The ovarian tumors demonstrated a range of architectural patterns including macronodular (71%), diffuse/solid growth (87%), single-cell infiltration (87%), cords (74%), and small nests/clusters (50%). Nine cases demonstrated focal signet ring cell morphology. The associated stromal reaction ranged from none to marked, with almost half of cases demonstrating a marked stromal response, largely prominent sclerosis. A variety of neoplasms, most typically sex cord-stromal tumors, lymphoma/leukemia, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor, may enter the differential. In addition to the obvious help afforded in most cases by the clinical history, a combination of judicious sampling, particularly to unearth the delicate cords or single-cell growth of lobular carcinoma, appropriate consideration of the cytologic features of the neoplastic cells, and immunohistochemistry can resolve the diverse issues in differential diagnosis that may arise.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, treatment can never follow an exact recipe. Opinions differ as to the best approach; sometimes more than one treatment approach results in identical outcomes, or treatments differ only by the manner in which they fail. Furthermore, the haematologist is faced with constraints relating to the local economic environment. Patients too are not the same the world over. Early presentation is commoner in the developed world, as is the patient's understanding of the disease process. This in turn has an impact on the way patients are managed, the rigorousness of patient adhesion to the treatment schedule and the outcome. Here we take a look at the precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in an adolescent in a range of different settings from low- to high income countries with widely differing challenges for diagnosis, therpy and follow-up. For these reasons, given the same starting conditions, patients will be treated differently according to the institute and the country they are in. Experts from around the world have been tasked to describe their management plan and rationale for a specific disease presentation. Here they explore the management of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre-B ALL) in five different institutions worldwide with a focus on those with more or less strained economies. We end with a conclusion from an expert in the field comparing and contrasting these different management styles and considering their merits and limitations.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) is generally more sensitive and specific than morphology, but data to guide its use versus CC are limited. METHODS: This study identified 92 patients who had MFC performed on their initial CSF specimen and received at least 4 cycles of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine (hyperCVAD) as their initial treatment. RESULTS: Eighteen (20%) were CSF+ by MFC at the baseline, and only 6 of these patients were positive by CC. In contrast, 0 of 51 patients who were negative by MFC and had CC available were positive by CC. Despite the receipt of significantly more intra-CSF chemotherapy (P < .001), the cumulative incidence of CNS relapse by MFC was 22% among CSF+ patients versus 5% among those who were CSF- (P = .044). No such association was observed between CNS relapse and CC results (P = .42). None of the 74 CSF- patients became CSF+ during their initial treatment despite being tested a median of 5 times (range, 2-10). CSF positivity by MFC was the factor most strongly associated with CNS relapse in a series of univariate Cox models (hazard ratio, 3.7; P = .067). The initial CSF status by MFC had no significant impact on overall or event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: MFC of CSF is superior to CC of CSF in identifying adults at high risk for CNS relapse after treatment with hyperCVAD.

Emerging evidence suggests that WTIP is a candidate tumor suppressor. However, the molecular mechanisms of WTIP in leukemogenesis have not been explored. Here, we report that WTIP expression is significantly reduced both in AML cell lines and clinical specimens compared with normal controls, and low levels of WTIP correlate with decreased overall survival in AML patients. Overexpression of WTIP inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies reveal that the apoptotic function of WTIP is mediated by upregulation and nuclear translocation of FOXO3a, a member of Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors involved in tumor suppression. We further demonstrate that WTIP interacts with FOXO3a and transcriptionally activates FOXO3a. Upon transcriptional activation of FOXO3a, its downstream target PUMA is increased, leading to activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that WTIP is a tumor suppressor and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in AML.",['(c) 2021.

Effective drug for preventing and treating EV71 infection is unavailable currently. EV71 3C mediated the cleavage of many proteins and played an important role in viral inhibiting host innate immunity. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, the primary organizer of PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), can be induced by interferon and is involved in antiviral activity. PML inhibits EV71 replication, and EV71 infection reduces PML expression, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. METHODS: The cleavage of PMLIII and IV was confirmed by co-transfection of EV71 3C protease and PML. The detailed cleavage sites were evaluated further by constructing the Q to A mutant of PML. PML knockout cells were infected with EV71 to identify the effect of cleavage on EV71 replication. Immunofluorescence analysis to examine the interference of EV71 3C on the formation of PML-NBs. RESULTS: EV71 3C directly cleaved PMLIII and IV. Furthermore, 3C cleaved PMLIV at the sites of Q430-A431 and Q444-S445 through its protease activity. Overexpression of PMLIV Q430A/Q444A variant exhibited stronger antiviral potential than the wild type. PMLIV Q430A/Q444A formed normal nuclear bodies that were not affected by 3C, suggesting that 3C may impair PML-NBs production via PMLIV cleavage and counter its antiviral activities. PML, especially PMLIV, which sequesters viral proteins in PML-NBs and inhibits viral production, is a novel target of EV71 3C cleavage. CONCLUSIONS: EV71 3C cleaves PMLIV at Q430-A431 and Q444-S445. Cleavage reduces the antiviral function of PML and decomposes the formation of PML-NBs, which is conducive to virus replication.",['(c) 2021.

Many studies have demonstrated that chemo-radiotherapy for cancer patients and exposure to certain chemicals may increase the risk of secondary MDS, which is characterized by specific chromosomal abnormalities and genomic alterations. Since next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been widely used for the diagnosis of cancer patients, advanced analysis of the sequencing data may provide supplementary information for secondary MDS. CASE PRESENTATION: A male patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bone metastases has presented distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of the left hilar, mediastinal lymph node metastases, and multiple bone metastases. This patient has undergone long-term exposures to certain chemicals. Moreover, the deletion of chromosome 7 and 5q is detected in his peripheral blood sequencing, indicating secondary MDS, subsequently confirmed by bone marrow examination. CONCLUSION: In this case, an NSCLC patient was diagnosed with secondary MDS via NGS analysis, indicating that the NGS analysis may serve as supplementary for diagnosis of secondary MDS and provide useful information of therapeutic regimens for subsequent-line treatment of EGFR-mutated lung cancer.

Despite aggressive antibacterial treatments, this complication usually imposes high morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Management of bacterial neutropenic enterocolitis are well known; however, management of fungal neutropenic enterocolitis may be more challenging and needs to be investigated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment may be life-saving, especially in patients at risk of mucormycosis-associated neutropenic enterocolitis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two mucormycosis-associated neutropenic enterocolitis cases in pediatric leukemic patients receiving salvage chemotherapy for disease relapse. Both patients' clinical signs and symptoms differ from classical bacterial neutropenic enterocolitis. They were empirically treated as bacterial neutropenic enterocolitis with anti-gram-negative combination therapy. Despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment, no clinical improvement was achieved, and both of them were complicated with severe abdominal pain necessitating surgical intervention. Mucormycosis is diagnosed by immunohistopathologic examination in multiple intraoperative intestinal tissue biopsies. Both patients died despite antifungal treatment with liposomal amphotericin-B and surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: Mucormycosis-associated neutropenic enterocolitis is one of the most unfavorable and untreatable side effects of salvage chemotherapy in leukemic children with disease relapse.

MDS can be a debilitating condition, and management options in patients with MDS aim to improve cytopenias, delay disease progression, and enhance quality of life. High serum ferritin levels, a source of iron for reactive oxygen species production, correlate with a higher risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia, and iron overload is compounded by blood transfusions given to improve anemia. 6-shogaol is a natural phenolic compound formed when ginger is exposed to heat and/or acidic conditions, and it has been shown to possess anti-tumor activity against leukemia cell lines and antioxidant effects.

Patients with CLL may present cutaneous lesions that can be classified as either ""specific"" or ""non-specific."" In CLL patients, specific skin eruptions arise from leukemic cell infiltration, recognized histopathologically in tissue sample biopsy. Non-specific lesions encompass the majority of eruptions in CLL patients and may present as petechiae, purpura, urticaria, exfoliative dermatitis, paraneoplastic pemphigus, vasculitis, or eosinophilic dermatosis. Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy (EDHM) is a rare cutaneous manifestation that presents as an eruption in various locations and is characterized as papular, pruritic, and sometimes vesicular or vesiculobullous.

E. chrysanthemiL-asparaginase was first developed in the early 1970s at Porton Down and is currently manufactured by Porton Biopharma Ltd. One of the early purification steps during E. chrysanthemiL-asparaginase manufacture, involves use of batch cation exchange carboxymethyl resin, and alternatives to this older technology are currently under investigation using mass spectrometry to understand the impact of resin changes on the impurity profile. In this study, a novel SWATH library was developed for E. chrysanthemi proteome and used to evaluate this potential process change on product yield and host cell protein (HCP) profile and clearance. An ELISA assay is currently used as a quality control release test for quantifying HCPs at the Drug Substance (DS) stage, but these early extract samples are too crude for interference-free analysis by ELISA. Given that ELISA assay could not be used in the assessment of new resin options, SWATH LC-MS/MS analysis proved to be pivotal in selecting a resin for further scale-up and implementation. The data quantified that L-asparaginase from the new process step was 2.28-fold higher in concentration than in legacy-process samples. The new step, using a modern ion exchanger, was at least equivalent and in some cases outperformed the legacy resin step in terms of HCP clearance for 78.2% of total HCPs (528 of 675 total proteins).",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Studies suggest that metabolic disorder has a relationship with the toxicity of benzene. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a key rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. However, the upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms of PKM2 in benzene-induced hematotoxicity and the therapeutic effects of targeting PKM2 in vivo are unclear. This study aims to provide insights into the new mechanism of benzene-induced hematotoxicity and reveal the therapeutic significance of targeting PKM2. Herein, we demonstrated that PKM2-dependent glycolysis contributes to benzene-induced hematotoxicity by regulating inflammation reaction. Mechanistically, acetylated proteomics revealed that 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ) induced acetylation of PKM2 at position K66, and this modification contributed to the increase of PKM2 expression and can be inhibited by inhibition of acetyltransferase GCN5. Meanwhile, the elevated PKM2 was shown to prompt the activation of nuclear phosphorylated Stat3 (p-Stat3) and IL17A. Clinically, pharmacological inhibition of PKM2 alleviated the blood toxicity induced by benzene, which was mainly characterized by an increase in routine blood parameters and improvement of hematopoietic imbalance. Besides, elevated PKM2 is a promising biomarker in people occupationally exposed to benzene. Overall, we identified PKM2/p-Stat3/IL-17A axis participates in the hematotoxicity of benzene, and targeting PKM2 has certain therapeutic implications in hematologic diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to analyze the association between PET-CT variables and the response to radiotherapy in patients with myeloid sarcoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in myeloid sarcoma patients who received radiotherapy and PET-CT before and after radiotherapy. The response to radiotherapy was evaluated based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer PET response criteria, and binary regression analysis was performed to assess the factors predicting reductions in the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). RESULTS: Twenty-seven sites in 12 patients were included in the study. Complete metabolic responses were seen in 24 patients after radiotherapy, a partial metabolic response in one, and progressive metabolic disease in two patients. The prescribed dose of more than 3000 cGy10 was significantly greater in the treatment control group (P = 0.024). In binary logistic regression analysis predicting reductions in the SUVmax of more than 70% after radiotherapy, the pretreatment SUVmax (>/= 7.5) and further chemotherapy after radiotherapy showed significant differences in univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: Good metabolic responses (complete or partial) to radiotherapy were achieved in 92.6% of the myeloid sarcoma patients. Radiation doses < 3000 cGy10 and increased SUVmax were related to treatment failure and high SUVmax before radiotherapy was a factor influencing SUVmax reduction.

In these methods, the selection of quantitative features that describe cytological characteristics plays a key role. They are expected to add objectivity and consistency among observers to the geometric, color, or texture variables that pathologists usually interpret from visual inspection. In a recent paper in The Journal of Pathology, El Hussein et al. proposed an algorithmic procedure to assist pathologists in the diagnostic evaluation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression using whole-slide image analysis of tissue samples. The core of the procedure was a set of quantitative descriptors (biomarkers) calculated from the segmentation of cell nuclei, which was performed using a convolutional neural network. These biomarkers were based on clinical practice and easily calculated with reproducible tools. They were used as input to a machine learning algorithm that provided classification in one of the stages of CLL progression. Works like this can contribute to the integration into the workflow of clinical laboratories of automated diagnostic systems based on the morphological analysis of histological slides and blood smears.

The acute leukemia (AL) chemotherapy population includes patients receiving intensive chemotherapy but do not all go on to have an allo HCT. The impact of EID on outcomes including mortality in the AL chemotherapy population is unknown. METHODS: Microbiota composition from weekly stool samples was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Patients were analyzed in 2 cohorts: AL chemotherapy cohort and allo HCT cohort. Alpha-diversity and richness were calculated. Kaplan Meier Analysis was used to analyze mortality. RESULTS: 929 stool samples were collected from 139 patients. Both allo HCT and AL cohorts had a decline in alpha-diversity and richness over the course of treatment that tends not to return to baseline months later. EID was observed in at least one sample in 36% of allo HCT patients and 49% of AL patients. Patients with observed EID had lower alpha-diversity over time. Similar to the HCT cohort, AL patients with EID had reduced overall survival. We identified 4 other genera that were commonly found in >/=30% relative abundance within the microbiota, but none were associated with mortality. In fact, in allo HCT, Bacteroides abundance >/=30% was associated with improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: EID is associated with increased all-cause mortality in HCT and AL cohorts.

Leucettines, a family of 2-aminoimidazolin-4-ones derived from the marine sponge alkaloid Leucettamine B, have been developed as pharmacological inhibitors of DYRKs (dual specificity, tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinases) and CLKs (cdc2-like kinases). We report here on the synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of 68 Leucettines. Leucettines were tested on 11 purified kinases and in 5 cellular assays: (1) CLK1 pre-mRNA splicing, (2) Threonine-212-Tau phosphorylation, (3) glutamate-induced cell death, (4) autophagy and (5) antagonism of ligand-activated cannabinoid receptor CB1. The Leucettine SAR observed for DYRK1A is essentially identical for CLK1, CLK4, DYRK1B, and DYRK2. DYRK3 and CLK3 are less sensitive to Leucettines. In contrast, the cellular SAR highlights correlations between inhibition of specific kinase targets and some but not all cellular effects.

Interestingly, myeloma cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) and folate receptor expression levels are higher in chemotherapy-resistant patients than in pretreatment patients. In this study, a multifunctional folic acid (FA)-targeting core-shell structure is presented for simultaneous delivery of shMCL-1 and paclitaxel (PTX). The transfection efficiency of shMCL-1 with the FA-targeting delivery system is higher than with a nontargeting delivery system in Skov3 and A2780T cells. The FA-targeting system significantly inhibits cell growth, blocks cell cycles, and promotes apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro. The mechanisms involved in inhibiting growth are related to Bcl-2/Bax and cdc2/Cyclin B1 pathways. An analysis of RNA sequencing suggests that shMCL-1 reverses chemoresistance through regulating genes such as regulator of chromosome condensation 2 (RCC2). The synergetic effect of shMCL-1 and PTX effectively inhibits tumor growth in both PTX-resistant and normal cancer models by inducing tumor apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation, and limiting tumor angiogenesis. The study results indicate that a FA-targeting delivery system combining shMCL-1 with PTX can simultaneously target tumor sites and restore the sensitivity of chemotherapy-resistant cancer to PTX. These findings have important implications for patients with normal or PTX-resistant cancer.",['(c) 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.'],"['Nie, Wen', 'Wang, Bilan', 'Mi, Xue', 'Chen, Jing', 'Yu, Ting', 'Miao, Junming', 'Lin, Yunzhu', 'Yang, Tingting', 'Ran, Mengni', 'Hong, Zehuo', 'Liu, Xiaoxiao', 'Liang, Xiao', 'Qian, Zhiyong', 'Gao, Xiang']","['Nie W', 'Wang B', 'Mi X', 'Chen J', 'Yu T', 'Miao J', 'Lin Y', 'Yang T', 'Ran M', 'Hong Z', 'Liu X', 'Liang X', 'Qian Z', 'Gao X']","['Department of Neurosurgery and Institute of Neurosurgery, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, West China Medical School, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu, 610041, P.

We previously reported that RIPK3 activity independent of its kinase domain induces caspase-mediated p65/RelA cleavage, resulting in N-terminal 1-361 and C-terminal 362-549 fragments. We show here that a noncleavable p65/RelA D361E mutant expressed in DA1-3b leukemia cells decreases mouse survival times and that coexpression of p65/RelA fragments increases the tumorigenicity of B16F1 melanoma cells. This aggressiveness in vivo did not correlate with NF-kappaB activity measured in vitro. The fragments and p65/RelA D361E mutant induced different expression profiles in DA1-3b and B16F1 cells. Stemness markers were affected: p65/RelA D361E increased ALDH activity in DA1-3b cells, and fragment expression increased melanoma sphere formation in B16/F1 cells. p65/RelA fragments and the D361E noncleavable mutant decreased oxidative or glycolytic cell metabolism, with differences observed between models. Thus, p65/RelA cleavage initiated by kinase-independent RIPK3 activity in cancer cells is not neutral and induces pleiotropic effects in vitro and in vivo that may vary across tumor types.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, the role of AMPK-mTORC1 pathway on connecting AML cell energy metabolism reprogramming and chemoresistance induced by the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) is not defined. Here, with a co-culture system that simulates the interaction between BMM and AML cells, it is shown that stromal contact led to a decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy accompanied by an increase of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity and mitochondrial ATP synthesis in AML cells. The increased OXPHOS activity and excessive ATP production promoted chemoresistance of AML cells through inhibiting AMPK activity and in turn activating mTORC1 activity. In an in vivo AML mouse model, depletion of AMPK activity with genetic targeting promoted AML progression and reduced their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Collectively, AML cells' acquired increased OXPHOS activity as well as AMPK inhibition could be therapeutically exploited in an effort to overcome BMM-mediated chemoresistance.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, cardiotoxicity is the most critical side effect that requires dose limitation. It is thought to occur at first exposure, but the clinical presentation may occur years later. In this study, we aimed to determine the time of initial damage and cardiotoxicity that develops in children with ALL. METHODS: In this prospective study, 13 patients with newly diagnosed intermediate-risk precursor B cell ALL treated with the ALL-IC BFM 2009 protocol were included. Conventional echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), and speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) were performed in all the patients before chemotherapy, after completing the induction phase, and at the end of the reinduction phase. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 7.8+/-4.6 (3.1-16.3) years. Myocardial velocity during systole (Sm) determined by TDI at the interventricular septum significantly decreased during the induction phase. Despite a decrease in STE parameters, a statistically significant reduction was determined in the global longitudinal strain rate at both left and right ventricles at the end of the induction. Nevertheless, a statistically significant increase was observed among the conventional echocardiographic findings in the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter at the end of the reinduction. CONCLUSION: During the treatment of ALL, subclinical anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity develops in the early stages of treatment. The findings detected by TDI and STE could be missed by conventional echocardiography. We recommend evaluating patients with these newly developed techniques to detect subclinical cardiotoxicity at an early stage and starting appropriate therapy on time.",,"['Arman Bilir, Ozlem', 'Cetin, Ibrahim Ilker', 'Kacar, Dilek', 'Aker, Can Baris', 'Ozbek, Namik Yasar', 'Yarali, Nese']","['Arman Bilir O', 'Cetin II', 'Kacar D', 'Aker CB', 'Ozbek NY', 'Yarali N']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ankara City Hospital; Ankara-Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Ankara City Hospital; Ankara-Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ankara City Hospital; Ankara-Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ankara City Hospital; Ankara-Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ankara City Hospital; Ankara-Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ankara City Hospital; Ankara-Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211220,Turkey,Anatol J Cardiol,Anatolian journal of cardiology,101652981,IM,,,2021/12/21 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2021/12/20 08:48'],"['2021/12/20 08:48 [entrez]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5152/AnatolJCardiol.2021.926 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Anatol J Cardiol. 2021 Dec 20. doi: 10.5152/AnatolJCardiol.2021.926.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2019, our institution adjusted internal guidelines to de-escalate EAT after 7 days of intravenous anti-pseudomonal therapy in patients with signs of clinical recovery from febrile neutropenia and no evidence of infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, observational, cohort study. Eligible patients were adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received induction chemotherapy and developed febrile neutropenia without documented infection. Patients were separated based on EAT duration: </= 9 days and > 9 days. Empiric antimicrobial therapy was defined as the initiation of an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam. The primary outcome was the difference in number of EAT-free days. Secondary outcomes included fever recurrence, ICU admissions, fever duration, infections post de-escalation, and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). RESULTS: Forty-four encounters met inclusion. The EAT </= 9 days group had 7 more EAT-free days compared to the EAT > 9 days group (p < 0.001). No between-group differences were identified in terms of fever after EAT discontinuation (p = 0.335), ICU admission (p = 0.498), or CDI (p = 0.498). The EAT > 9 days group experienced longer initial fever (p < 0.001) and received addition of resistant Gram-positive coverage (p = 0.014). More patients receiving EAT > 9 days had a diagnosis of AML (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Shorter EAT duration did not lead to worse outcomes in patients with AML or ALL who received induction chemotherapy and developed febrile neutropenia without a documented infection source.",,"['Ly, Whitney J', 'Brown, Erin E', 'Pedretti, Zachary', 'Auten, Jessica', 'Wilson, William S']","['Ly WJ', 'Brown EE', 'Pedretti Z', 'Auten J', 'Wilson WS']","['Department of Pharmacy, 537791University of North Carolina Hospitals, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, 537791University of North Carolina Hospitals, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, 537791University of North Carolina Hospitals, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, 537791University of North Carolina Hospitals, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, 537791University of North Carolina Hospitals, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211220,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'antibiotic de-escalation', 'empiric antibiotics', 'febrile neutropenia', 'neutropenic fever']",2021/12/21 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2021/12/20 08:43'],"['2021/12/20 08:43 [entrez]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211067776 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Dec 20:10781552211067776. doi: 10.1177/10781552211067776.,,,10781552211067776,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7323-8130'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progression of early progenitors to antibody-expressing cells in the bone marrow is orchestrated by the temporal regulation of different gene programs at discrete developmental stages. A major question concerns how B cells control the accessibility of these genes to transcription factors. Research has implicated nucleosome remodeling ATPases as mediators of chromatin accessibility. Here, we describe studies of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 4 (CHD4; also known as Mi-2beta) in early B cell development. CHD4 comprises multiple domains that function in nucleosome mobilization and histone binding. CHD4 is a key component of Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase, or NuRD (Mi-2) complexes, which assemble with other proteins that mediate transcriptional repression. We review data demonstrating that CHD4 is necessary for B lineage identity: early B lineage progression, proliferation in response to interleukin-7, responses to DNA damage, and cell survival in vivo. CHD4-NuRD is also required for the Ig heavy-chain repertoire by promoting utilization of distal variable (VH ) gene segments in V(D)J recombination. In conclusion, the regulation of chromatin accessibility by CHD4 is essential for production of antibodies by B cells, which in turn mediate humoral immune responses to pathogens and disease.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A transcription factor T-bet is upregulated to dampen M functions via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, followed by enhanced Tim-3 expression in chronic HCV infection. However, the molecular mechanisms that control the expression in M are yet unknown. miR-155 has been implicated as a key regulator controlling diverse biological processes through posttranscriptional repression, but the influences of miR-155 on these regulators and effectors still need to be studied. Methods: Forty HCV-infected patients and 40 healthy subjects (HS) were recruited, THP-1 cells (human acute monocyte leukemia cell line) were cultured with HCV-infected Huh 7.5 cells. The expression levels of miR-155 and JNK1/JNK2/JNK3 were measured by real-time RT-PCR. IL-10/IL-12 was detected by flow cytometry. THP-1 cells were transfected with mimics-155 and negative control, SOCS1, p-STAT1, p65, p-smad, p-p38, and p-JNK were measured by Western blot. TNF-alpha levels were measured by ELISA. Student's t-test was used in statistics. Results: The study showed that miR-155 was upregulated in CD14(+) M in HCV-infected patients compared to healthy subjects (P<0.05). Moreover, the upregulation of miR-155 in CD14(+) M from HCV-infected patients induced TNF-alpha production and JNK gene expression, which, in turn, led to T-bet upregulation. Also, miR-155 upregulation in CD14(+) M of HCV-infected patients increased the IL-12 and decreased the IL-10 production. Conclusions: The obtained results indicated that miR-155 upregulation in M during HCV infection enhances the activation of TNF-alpha and JNK pathways, promotes the expression of transcription factor T-bet, and triggers pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Together, these data reveal new information regarding the mechanisms of chronic HCV infection.",['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

The myeloablative conditioning regimen has two aims: (1) to eradicate leukaemic cells, and (2) to prevent rejection of the graft through suppression of the recipient's immune system. Radiotherapy has the advantage of achieving an adequate dose effect in sanctuary sites and in areas with poor blood supply. However, radiotherapy is subject to radiobiological trade-offs between ALL cell destruction, immune and haematopoietic stem cell survival, and various adverse effects in normal tissue. To diminish toxicity, a shift from single-fraction to fractionated TBI has taken place. However, HSCT and TBI are still associated with multiple late sequelae, leaving room for improvement. This review discusses the past developments of TBI and considerations for dose, fractionation and dose-rate, as well as issues regarding TBI setup performance, limitations and possibilities for improvement. TBI is typically delivered using conventional irradiation techniques and centres have locally developed heterogeneous treatment methods and ways to achieve reduced doses in several organs. There are, however, limitations in options to shield organs at risk without compromising the anti-leukaemic and immunosuppressive effects of conventional TBI. Technological improvements in radiotherapy planning and delivery with highly conformal TBI or total marrow irradiation (TMI), and total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) have opened the way to investigate the potential reduction of radiotherapy-related toxicities without jeopardising efficacy. The demonstration of the superiority of TBI compared with chemotherapy-only conditioning regimens for event-free and overall survival in the randomised For Omitting Radiation Under Majority age (FORUM) trial in children with high-risk ALL makes exploration of the optimal use of TBI delivery mandatory. Standardisation and comprehensive reporting of conventional TBI techniques as well as cooperation between radiotherapy centres may help to increase the ratio between treatment outcomes and toxicity, and future studies must determine potential added benefit of innovative conformal techniques to ultimately improve quality of life for paediatric ALL patients receiving TBI-conditioned HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Hoeben, Wong, Fog, Losert, Filippi, Bentzen, Balduzzi and', 'Specht.']","['Hoeben, Bianca A W', 'Wong, Jeffrey Y C', 'Fog, Lotte S', 'Losert, Christoph', 'Filippi, Andrea R', 'Bentzen, Soren M', 'Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Specht, Lena']","['Hoeben BAW', 'Wong JYC', 'Fog LS', 'Losert C', 'Filippi AR', 'Bentzen SM', 'Balduzzi A', 'Specht L']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center and Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Alfred Health Radiation Oncology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo and University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Clinica Paediatrica Universita degli Studi di Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211203,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)', 'haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)', 'paediatric', 'total body irradiation (TBI)', 'total lymph node irradiation (TLI)', 'total marrow and lymphatic irradiation', 'total marrow irradiation (TMI)']",2021/12/21 06:00,2021/12/21 06:01,['2021/12/20 06:17'],"['2021/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/20 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.774348 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Dec 3;9:774348. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.774348. eCollection 2021.,9,,774348,,,,PMC8678472,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design of rational studies for the use of selinexor in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as immunotherapies, requires a fundamental understanding of the effects of selinexor on the immune system. One important emerging area of immunotherapy are natural killer (NK) cell based therapeutics. NK cell function is tightly regulated by a balance of signals derived from multiple activating and inhibitory receptors. Thus in cancer, up-regulation of stress ligands recognised by activating receptors or down-regulation of HLA class I recognised by inhibitory receptors can result in an anti-cancer NK cell response. Changes in XPO1 function therefore have the potential to affect NK cell function through shifting this balance. We therefore sought to investigate how selinexor may affect NK cell function. Selinexor pre-treatment of lymphoma cells significantly increased NK cell mediated cytotoxicity against SU-DHL-4, JeKo-1 and Ramos cells, concurrent with increased CD107a and IFNgamma expression on NK cells. In addition, selinexor enhanced ADCC against lymphoma cells coated with the anti-CD20 antibodies rituximab and obinutuzumab. In probing the likely mechanism, we identified that XPO1 inhibition significantly reduced the surface expression of HLA-E on lymphoma cell lines and on primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. HLA-E binds the inhibitory receptor NKG2A and in accordance with this, selinexor selectively increased activation of NKG2A+ NK cells. Our data reveals that selinexor, in addition to its direct cytotoxic activity, also activates an anti-cancer immune response via disruption of the inhibitory NKG2A:HLA-E axis.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Fisher, Walker, Doyle, Johnson, Forconi, Cragg, Landesman,', 'Khakoo and Blunt.']","['Fisher, Jack G', 'Walker, Christopher J', 'Doyle, Amber Dp', 'Johnson, Peter Wm', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Cragg, Mark S', 'Landesman, Yosef', 'Khakoo, Salim I', 'Blunt, Matthew D']","['Fisher JG', 'Walker CJ', 'Doyle AD', 'Johnson PW', 'Forconi F', 'Cragg MS', 'Landesman Y', 'Khakoo SI', 'Blunt MD']","['School of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Research & Translational Development, Karyopharm Therapeutics, Newton, MA, United States.', 'School of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Research & Translational Development, Karyopharm Therapeutics, Newton, MA, United States.', 'School of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'School of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211201,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia)', 'HLA-E', 'NK cells', 'NKG2A', 'XPO1', 'lymphoma', 'natural killer cells', 'selinexor']",2021/12/21 06:00,2021/12/21 06:01,['2021/12/20 06:17'],"['2021/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/20 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.785635 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Dec 1;11:785635. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.785635. eCollection 2021.,11,,785635,,,,PMC8672299,,"['CW and YL are employees and stockholders of Karyopharm Therapeutics.

Myc proteins are transcription factors responsible for transcribing pro-proliferative genes and c-Myc is often overexpressed in cancers. The chromatin regulator BRD4 is required for expression of c-Myc in hematologic malignancies including B-ALL. Previously, combination of BRD4 and PI3K inhibition with SF2523 was shown to successfully decrease Myc expression. However, the underlying mechanism and effect of dual inhibition of PI3Kdelta/BRD4 in B-ALL remains unknown. To study this, we utilized SF2535, a novel small molecule dual inhibitor which can specifically target the PI3Kdelta isoform and BRD4. We treated primary B-ALL cells with various concentrations of SF2535 and studied its effect on specific pharmacological on-target mechanisms such as apoptosis, cell cycle, cell proliferation, and adhesion molecules expression usingin vitro and in vivo models. SF2535 significantly downregulates both c-Myc mRNA and protein expression through inhibition of BRD4 at the c-Myc promoter site and decreases p-AKT expression through inhibition of the PI3Kdelta/AKT pathway. SF2535 induced apoptosis in B-ALL by downregulation of BCL-2 and increased cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP. Moreover, SF2535 induced cell cycle arrest and decreased cell counts in B-ALL. Interestingly, SF2535 decreased the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of integrin alpha4, alpha5, alpha6, and beta1 while increasing MFI of CXCR4, indicating that SF2535 may work through inside-out signaling of integrins. Taken together, our data provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of targeting PI3Kdelta/BRD4 in refractory or relapsed B-ALL using SF2535.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Ruan, Kim, Ogana, Wan,

Imaging findings on chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scans are also non-specific, often showing diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities. Because DAH is an under-recognized diagnosis, physicians should maintain a degree of clinical suspicion for DAH in patients with unexplained airspace opacities and no signs of an infectious etiology. This is especially important in higher-risk populations such as patients with hematological malignancies, who have a propensity for thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy compounded by the use of anticoagulants. Patients with hematological malignancies, namely acute myeloid leukemia (AML), are also at risk for drug-induced DAH due to the use of cytotoxic medications like cytarabine. Here, we present the case of a 48-year-old male with a past medical history of AML and myeloid sarcoma who developed shortness of breath after receiving cytarabine chemotherapy.

RESULTS: Eighty-one patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and had ophthalmic examinations. Forty-three (53.1%) patients were males, and 38 (46.9%) patients were females. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed in 55 (67.9%) patients, while acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) was diagnosed only in 26 (32.1%). Ophthalmic manifestations were observed in 23 patients with a prevalence of 28.4%. AML patients had more manifestations with a rate of 38.5%. ALL had a rate of 23.6% (p=0.1). Retinal hemorrhage was the most commonly seen manifestation in six patients. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic manifestations are not uncommon in acute leukemia patients. Low hemoglobin and RBC could give an idea about the type of ophthalmic manifestation, not the presence or absence. It is highly recommended to examine acute leukemia patients routinely prior, during, and after the treatment to prevent serious ocular damage and monitor the course of the disease.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Bukhari et al.']","['Bukhari, Ziad M', 'Alzahrani, Abdulmalek', 'Alqarni, Mohammed S', 'Alajmi, Rakan S', 'Alzahrani, Ali', 'Almarzouki, Hashim', 'Alqahtani, Abdullah S']","['Bukhari ZM', 'Alzahrani A', 'Alqarni MS', 'Alajmi RS', 'Alzahrani A', 'Almarzouki H', 'Alqahtani AS']","['Medicine, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Medicine, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Medicine, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Ophthalmology, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Ophthalmology, King Abdullah Medical Complex, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah, SAU.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211108,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'hematological parameters', 'ophthalmic manifestations', 'retinal hemorrhage']",2021/12/21 06:00,2021/12/21 06:01,['2021/12/20 06:14'],"['2021/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/20 06:14 [entrez]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.19384 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Nov 8;13(11):e19384. doi: 10.7759/cureus.19384. eCollection 2021 Nov.,13,11,e19384,,,,PMC8655321,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When it is diagnosed remote from term, treatment in the form of daunorubicin plus cytarabine induction with consolidative cytarabine is typically undertaken after the first trimester. There is little data to guide fetal monitoring, in particular, whether and how often middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA PSV) should be measured to screen for fetal anemia. Cytarabine may be particularly myelosuppressive to the fetus, but information pertaining to the management of this complication is also lacking in published literature. To our knowledge, we present the first case of presumed severe fetal anemia related to in utero exposure to chemotherapy that was managed conservatively with close sonographic monitoring, including serial measurement of MCA PSV. This case suggests that in the absence of hydrops fetalis or other signs of fetal decompensation, expectant management with ultrasound twice weekly, including MCA PSV, is appropriate. Ultrasounds may be decreased to weekly when MCA PSV does not suggest fetal anemia. Screening for fetal anemia can provide helpful information to guide the timing of chemotherapy administration and delivery. Key Points Chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia can cause fetal anemia.Fetal MCA PSV can be used to safely and effectively screen for fetal anemia.Observation of fetal anemia due to chemotherapy is reasonable, in the absence of hydrops.Monitoring of fetal MCA PSV can help guide timing of chemotherapy and delivery.","['The Author(s).

In mouse mast cells, it has been shown that tryptase, in addition to its canonical location in secretory granules, can be found in the nuclear compartment where it can impact on core histones. Here we asked whether tryptase can execute core histone processing in human mast cell leukemia cells, and whether tryptase thereby can affect the epigenetic modification of core histones. Our findings reveal that triggering of cell death in HMC-1 mast cell leukemia cells is associated with extensive cleavage of core histone 3 (H3) and more restricted cleavage of H2B. Tryptase inhibition caused a complete blockade of such processing. Our data also show that HMC-1 cell death was associated with a major reduction of several epigenetic histone marks, including H3 lysine-4-mono-methylation (H3K4me1), H3K9me2, H3 serine-10-phosphorylation (H3S10p) and H2B lysine-16-acetylation (H2BK16ac), and that tryptase inhibition reverses the effect of cell death on these epigenetic marks. Further, we show that tryptase is present in the nucleus of both viable and dying mast cell leukemia cells. In line with a role for tryptase in regulating nuclear events, tryptase inhibition caused increased proliferation of the mast cell leukemia cells. Altogether, the present study emphasizes a novel principle for how epigenetic modification of core histones is regulated, and provides novel insight into the biological function of human mast cell tryptase.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Alanazi, Rabelo Melo and Pejler.']","['Alanazi, Sultan', 'Rabelo Melo, Fabio', 'Pejler, Gunnar']","['Alanazi S', 'Rabelo Melo F', 'Pejler G']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211202,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'epigenetics', 'histones', 'mast cells', 'tryptase']",2021/12/21 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2021/12/20 06:07'],"['2021/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/20 06:07 [entrez]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.804408 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Dec 2;12:804408. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.804408. eCollection 2021.,12,,804408,,,,PMC8674432,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cardiovascular protective, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, neuroprotective, anti-viral, anti-acute myeloid leukemia and hepatoprotective effects have been at the center of attention. From a toxicological perspective Ophiopogon japonicus seems to be safe. Some problems with the quality of the pharmacological evidence stand out including the application of excessive dose level and methodological problems in the design. Additionally, a reasonable link between local/traditional uses and pharmacological assessment is often vague or not reflected in the text.

Endothelial dysfunction contributes to the development of various diseases such as acute lung injury, and endothelial inflammation is a vital part of endothelial dysfunction. Dauricine is an extract isolated from Menispermum dauricum DC, a traditional Chinese medical plant that can be used for pharyngitis. In this work, we found that IL-1beta-induced overexpression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin was inhibited by dauricine in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Correspondingly, adhesion of human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) to HUVECs was decreased by dauricine. Further studies showed that dauricine inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway in HUVECs stimulated with IL-1beta. In vivo, dauricine protected mice from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. In lung tissues, the activation of NF-kappaB pathway and the expression of its downstream genes (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin) were decreased by dauricine, consistent with what was found in vitro. In summary, we concluded that dauricine could alleviate endothelial inflammation by suppressing NF-kappaB pathway, which might serve as an effective candidate for diseases related with endothelial inflammation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Hu, Chen, An, Wang, Liang and Huang.']","['Hu, Ji', 'Chen, Ru', 'An, Jie', 'Wang, Yilong', 'Liang, Minglu', 'Huang, Kai']","['Hu J', 'Chen R', 'An J', 'Wang Y', 'Liang M', 'Huang K']","['Department of Cardiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Clinic Center of Human Gene Research, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Clinic Center of Human Gene Research, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Clinic Center of Human Gene Research, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Handan First Hospital, Handan, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Clinic Center of Human Gene Research, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Clinic Center of Human Gene Research, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Clinic Center of Human Gene Research, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211201,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['NF-kappaB pathway', 'acute lung injury', 'dauricine', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'inflammation']",2021/12/21 06:00,2021/12/21 06:01,['2021/12/20 06:04'],"['2021/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/20 06:04 [entrez]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.758962 [doi]', '758962 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Dec 1;12:758962. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.758962. eCollection 2021.,12,,758962,,,,PMC8672219,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: Novel galloyl-substituted compounds bearing 2-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazol-5-yl, 5-substituted-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl, and carboxamide groups were synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity. Additionally, galloyl hydrazide (2) was evaluated by performing cytotoxicity, membrane integrity, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays in HepG2/C3A cells. METHOD: General procedure was used for the synthesis of galloyl-substituted (3-9, 11) and characterized by their spectroscopic data (1H and 13C NMR). The antiproliferative activity of all novel galloyl derivatives was evaluated against nine human tumors and one nontumoral cell line. Three response parameters (GI50, TGI, and LC50) were calculated. The cytotoxicity test was performed for the resazurin assay. The membrane integrity, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays were performed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The substitution of the methoxy group of the galloyl ring system for a carboxamide group (3, 4, 5, and 6) produced compounds with moderate antitumoral activity, particularly 6, against six human cancer cell lines, K-562, PC-3, NCI-ADR/RES, OVCAR, 786-0 and NCI-H460, with GI50 values </= 9.45 microg/mL. Triazole derivatives 7 and 8 exhibited higher antitumoral activity toward OVCAR, MCF-7 and leukemia K-562 cell lines, exhibiting GI50 values less than 10 microg/mL. Compound 11 displayed significant activity against PC-3 (GI50 = 4.31 microg/mL), OVCAR (GI50 = 8.84 microg/mL) and K-562 (GI50 = 8.80 microg/mL) cell lines. Galloyl hydrazide (2) had cytotoxic activity in HepG2/C3A cells (IC50 = 153.7 microg/mL). In membrane permeability, cell count, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays, as determined using the IC50 of compound (2) in HepG2/C3A cells, increased membrane permeability, decreased cell count, altered cell cycle, and initial apoptosis was observed compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Thus, our results showed for the first time the synthesis, antiproliferative activity, and cytotoxicity of galloyl-substituted compounds. Galloyl-substitution does not have a very strong synergistic effect in the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation compared with galloyl hydrazide (2). Compound 2 demonstrated promising activity in HepG2/C3A hepatocarcinoma cells.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Dos Santos, Rafael Claudino', 'de Freitas, Raquel Oliveira Nascimento', 'Foglio, Mary Ann', 'de Carvalho, Joao Ernesto', 'Ruiz, Ana Lucia Tasca Goes', 'Pessatto, Lucas Roberto', 'Oliveira, Rodrigo Juliano', 'Baranoski, Adrivanio', 'Biazi, Bruna Isabela', 'Mantovani, Mario Sergio', 'Kassuya, Candida Aparecida Leite', 'de Oliveira Junior, Pedro Cruz', 'Formagio, Anelise Samara Nazari']","['Dos Santos RC', 'de Freitas RON', 'Foglio MA', 'de Carvalho JE', 'Ruiz ALTG', 'Pessatto LR', 'Oliveira RJ', 'Baranoski A', 'Biazi BI', 'Mantovani MS', 'Kassuya CAL', 'de Oliveira Junior PC', 'Formagio ASN']","['Faculty of Health Science, Federal University of Grande Dourados - UFGD, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil.', 'Industrial chemistry course, State University of Mato Grosso do Sul - UEMS, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, State University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil dBiological Science Center, State University of Londrina - UEL, Londrina, Parana State, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, State University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil dBiological Science Center, State University of Londrina - UEL, Londrina, Parana State, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, State University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil dBiological Science Center, State University of Londrina - UEL, Londrina, Parana State, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Genetics and Molecular Biology, State University of Londrina - UEL, Londrina, Parana State, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul - UFMS, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Genetics and Molecular Biology, State University of Londrina - UEL, Londrina, Parana State, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Genetics and Molecular Biology, State University of Londrina - UEL, Londrina, Parana State, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Genetics and Molecular Biology, State University of Londrina - UEL, Londrina, Parana State, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Health Science, Federal University of Grande Dourados - UFGD, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Federal University of Grande Dourados - UFGD, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Health Science, Federal University of Grande Dourados - UFGD, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211217,Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Antitumoral activity', 'Galloyl', 'Hepatocarcinoma', 'Hydrazide', 'Oxadiazole', 'Triazole']",2021/12/21 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2021/12/20 05:30'],"['2021/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/20 05:30 [entrez]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['CPB-EPUB-119497 [pii]', '10.2174/1389201023666211217150837 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2021 Dec 17. pii: CPB-EPUB-119497. doi: 10.2174/1389201023666211217150837.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides leukemia related risk factors, also risk factors that are present in the general population might contribute to hemorrhagic complications in leukemia patients. Of those, cardiovascular risk factors leading to chronic vascular damage could modulate the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage in these patients, as during their disease and treatment acute endothelial damage occurs due to factors like thrombocytopenia and inflammation. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to explore if cardiovascular risk factors can predict intracranial hemorrhage in acute leukemia patients. METHODS: In a case control study nested in a cohort of acute leukemia patients, including 17 cases with intracranial hemorrhage and 55 matched control patients without intracranial hemorrhage, data on cardiovascular risk factors was collected for all patients. Analyses were performed via conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Pre-existing hypertension and ischemic heart disease in the medical history were associated with intracranial hemorrhage, with an incidence rate ratio of 12.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 109.2) and 12.1 (95% CI 1.3 to110.7), respectively. CONCLUSION: Both pre-existing hypertension and ischemic heart disease seem to be strong predictors of an increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage in leukemia patients.",['This article is protected by copyright.

It has been used in the middle east as a medicinal food and traditional medicine for thousands of years. Pomegranate peel (PP) constitutes about 50% of the total fruit, however, it has been previously regarded as a waste. Recent research points to PP as a rich source of phenolics (e.g., ellagitannins, flavonoids, and anthocyanins), polysaccharides, in addition to its biotransformed metabolites viz. urolithins making it a valuable waste with promising pharmacological actions. Compared to the pulp and the juice, PP exhibited stronger antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Besides, it inhibited inflammation in several conditions, including colitis, arthritis, hepatitis, contact dermatitis, and lung inflammation. Moreover, it displayed anti-osteoporosis, anti-hyperglycemic, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, vasculoprotective, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory effects. Additionally, it was effective as a prebiotic and in obesity control, besides it promoted wound healing. Furthermore, PP demonstrated anticancer effects against different cancer types, for example, colon, liver, thyroid, uterine, breast, bladder, prostate, leukemia, and osteosarcoma. Despite PP safety, it may interfere with the metabolism of other drugs because it inhibits cytochromes (CYP) changing their bioavailability, effectiveness, and toxicity. PP biowaste valorization not only avoids against its environmental and economic burden but can also provide a promising platform to produce novel or improved nutraceuticals. This study provides a comprehensive overview of PP biological activities with the reported action mechanisms related to its phytochemicals and further biotransformed metabolites inside the body. Future research prospects to unravel the merits of such waste and optimize its use are discussed. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Pomegranate is widely distributed throughout the world. Although its peel was previously considered a waste, recent research regards it as a rich source of bioactive compounds with promising biological activities. Its recycling not only overcomes the bio-waste problems, but also provides a source of valuable compounds with several health benefits. In recent years, PP has been demonstrated to exhibit excellent pharmacological bioactivities, for example, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiosteoporosis, antihyperlipidemic, and anticancer activities. Its health-promoting power is mostly attributed to the phenolic and polysaccharide content, in addition to its amazing biotransformed metabolites. The underlying action mechanisms of such pharmacological activities are discussed and related to its chemical content. This review presents the latest research progress on the role of PP in the prevention and treatment of various chronic diseases, and its protective health effects for future research to be used in nutraceuticals.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Fahmy, Heba A', 'Farag, Mohamed A']","['Fahmy HA', 'Farag MA']","['Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Modern University for Technology & Information, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Chemistry, School of Sciences and Engineering, The American University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211219,United States,J Food Biochem,Journal of food biochemistry,7706045,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Punica granatum', 'anticancer', 'antimicrobial', 'antioxidant', 'biological activities', 'pomegranate peel']",2021/12/20 06:00,2021/12/20 06:00,['2021/12/19 21:10'],"['2021/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/20 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/19 21:10 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jfbc.14024 [doi]'],ppublish,J Food Biochem. 2022 Jan;46(1):e14024. doi: 10.1111/jfbc.14024.

Despite advances in the development of more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors, some mechanisms particularly in terms of CML leukemic stem cell (CML LSC) lead to intrinsic or acquired therapy resistance, relapse, and disease progression. In fact, the maintenance CML LSCs in patients who are resistance to TKI therapy indicates the role of CML LSCs in resistance to therapy through survival mechanisms that are not completely dependent on BCR-ABL activity. Targeting therapeutic approaches aim to eradicate CML LSCs through characterization and targeting genetic alteration and molecular pathways involving in CML LSC survival in a favorable leukemic microenvironment and resistance to apoptosis, with the hope of providing a functional cure. In other words, it is possible to develop the combination therapy of TKs with drugs targeting genes or molecules more specifically, which is required for survival mechanisms of CML LSCs, while sparing normal HSCs for clinical benefits along with TKIs.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: Differentially expressed miRNAs related to ALL were screened by bioinformatics analysis, and the localization of target miRNA was searched by its expression. qRT-PCR was adopted to confirm the expression of miRNA-181b-5p. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were applied to evaluate EVs internalization. MTT assay was employed to verify the proliferation of ALL cells. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Transwell assay was applied to evaluate migration and invasion abilities. RESULTS: High expression of miRNA-181b-5p was proved in ALL cell lines, and miRNA-181b-5p enriched in the exosomes and vesicles of blood cells. In the meantime, it was found that EVs carrying miRNA-181b-5p could be internalized by ALL cells and thus the expression of miRNA-181b-5p was up-regulated. Cell function assays showed that the proliferation, migration, invasion abilities of ALL cell lines were promoted in miRNA-181b-5p mimic group or the group co-culturing ALL-derived EVs and BALL-1 cell lines. The percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase was reduced and cell apoptosis was also inhibited. CONCLUSION: miRNA-181b-5p carried by EVs in peripheral blood of ALL patients can enter ALL cells and thus promote the malignancy of ALL cells.",['(c) 2021.

In this study, we analyzed the outcome and prognostic factors of relapsed AML patients who had previously received first-line therapy at our institution. Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of 50 patients who had been diagnosed with AML from April 2009 to December 2018, and then showed first relapse. Thirty-two of the patients (64%) had previously received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first complete remission (CR). Results: Forty-five of the patients (90%) received intensive chemotherapy upon diagnosis of relapse, and 76% (34/45) of these patients achieved a second CR. Estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) for these 45 patients was 44.9+/-7.6%. Time from diagnosis to relapse, extramedullary involvement (EMI) at diagnosis, core binding factor AML, and complex karyotype were significant prognostic factors; in multivariate study, both time from diagnosis to relapse and EMI at diagnosis proved significant. There was no difference in 5-year disease-free survival between patients previously treated with chemotherapy only and those who received HSCT in first CR (52.4+/-14.9% vs. 52.6+/-11.5%). Of the 19 patients who achieved second CR after previous allogeneic HSCT in first CR and subsequent relapse, 11 were treated with chemotherapy only, and 7 survive disease-free. Conclusion: Intensive therapy allowed for long-term survival in 40-50% of patients, and 50% of patients who achieved second CR, regardless of prior treatment modalities in first CR. Intensive treatment may allow for salvage of a significant portion of patients with relapsed pediatric AML.",,"['Lee, Jae Wook', 'Yoo, Jae Won', 'Kim, Seongkoo', 'Jang, Pil-Sang', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin']","['Lee JW', 'Yoo JW', 'Kim S', 'Jang PS', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211217,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Children', 'Extramedullary involvement', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Relapse']",2021/12/20 06:00,2021/12/20 06:00,['2021/12/19 18:13'],"['2021/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/19 18:13 [entrez]', '2021/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['crt.2021.1011 [pii]', '10.4143/crt.2021.1011 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Dec 17. pii: crt.2021.1011. doi: 10.4143/crt.2021.1011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the incorporation of aromatic groups to ligands may allow an enhanced lipophilicity that can influence the cellular uptake and accumulation of the metallodrugs, thus increasing their activity. Herein, we have reported the synthesis and characterization of four Pt(II) complexes [PtCl2(L)], where L = 2-(1-pyrazolyl)-2-thiazoline (PzTn), 2-(1-pyrazolyl)-1,3-thiazine (PzTz), 2-(3,5-diphenyl-1-pyrazolyl)-2-thiazoline (DPhPzTn) or 2-(3,5-diphenyl-1-pyrazolyl)-1,3-thiazine (DPhPzTz). The study was aimed at analysing their potential anticarcinogenic ability in epithelial cervix carcinoma HeLa, human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and human histiocytic lymphoma U-937 tumour cell lines as well as checking whether the structural factors of the organic ligand may influence their biological activity. Our findings showed that PtDPhPzTn and PtDPhPzTz were far more effective in terms of cytotoxicity than their less lipophilic counterparts (PtPzTn and PtPzTz), especially in cells derived from solid cervical tumours, thereby suggesting that modulating the lipophilicity of the ligands can help improve the cytotoxic effect of the metal complexes.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

To understand the underlying resistance mechanisms in response to imatinib (IMA) and adriamycin (ADR), the parental K562 cells were treated with low doses of IMA or ADR for two months to generate derivative cells with mild, intermediate and severe resistance to the drugs as defined by their increasing resistance index (RI). PulseDIA-based quantitative proteomics was then employed to reveal the proteome changes in these resistant cells. In total, 7082 proteotypic proteins from 98,232 peptides were identified and quantified from the dataset using four DIA software tools including OpenSWATH, Spectronaut, DIA-NN, and EncyclopeDIA. Sirtuin Signaling Pathway was found to be significantly enriched in both ADR- and IMA-resistant K562 cells. In particular, IDH2 was identified as a potential drug target correlated with the drug resistance phenotype, and its inhibition by the antagonist AGI-6780 reversed the acquired resistance in K562 cells to either ADR or IMA. Together, our study has implicated IDH2 as a potential target that can be therapeutically leveraged to alleviate the drug resistance in K562 cells when treated with IMA and ADR.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

To study the direct effects of JAK2-V617F on bone marrow cells in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, we performed joint single-cell RNA sequencing and JAK2 genotyping on CD34(+)-enriched cells from eight patients with newly diagnosed essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of Skp2 in NB4 cell line was depleted to explore its effect on proliferation and differentiation both in vitro and in vivo assays. Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR analysis were performed to explore Skp2-regulated downstream target genes. Luciferase and co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that PML-RARalpha inhibited the transactivation of JunB by interacting with the PU.1 protein. The western blot analysis confirmed that Skp2 could maintain the stability of PML-RARalpha. KEY FINDINGS: We report that the progression of APL and the attenuation of APL sensitivity to ATRA are positively associated with Skp2. Elevated Skp2 expression promotes APL progression by decreasing the expression of lncRNA HOTAIRM1 and inactivation of GSK3beta, causing autophagy inhibition followed by the suppression of PML-RARalpha ubiquitylation and degradation, which represses JunB transcriptional activation through PU.1/PML-RARalpha transcriptional complex to block cell differentiation. Coupled with ATRA or GSK3beta inhibitor treatment, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Skp2 strikingly induces JunB expression by accelerating the degradation of PML-RARalpha, which contributes to the eradication of APL. Additionally, the expressions of Skp2 and JunB are negatively correlated in mice subcutaneous leukemia xenograft tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, this study uncovers the roles of Skp2 in PML-RARalpha stabilization and in APL oncogenic functions. We reveal a novel mechanism of PML-RARalpha degradation and JunB regulation that constitute an important signaling network of Skp2-GSK3beta-PML/RARalpha-JunB.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Unlike in acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of AML, the outcomes in most other AMLs remain poor. This is mainly attributed to the acquired drug resistance and lack of targeted therapy. Different studies across laboratories suggest that the cellular mechanisms to impart therapy resistance are often very dynamic and should be identified in a context-specific manner. Our review highlights the progress made so far in identifying the different cellular mechanisms of mutation-independent therapy resistance in AML.

The chemotherapeutic agents that are in clinical practice possess a broad range of severe adverse effects towards vital organs which emphasizes the importance of the discovery of new therapeutic agents or repurposing of existing drugs for the treatment of human cancers. Pyrimethamine is an antiparasitic drug used for the treatment of malaria and toxoplasmosis with a well-documented excellent safety profile. In the last 5 years, numerous efforts have been made to explore the anticancer potential of pyrimethamine in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models and to repurpose it as an anticancer agent. The studies have demonstrated that pyrimethamine inhibits oncogenic proteins such as STAT3, NF-kappaB, DX2, MAPK, DHFR, thymidine phosphorylase, telomerase, and many more in a different types of cancer models. Moreover, pyrimethamine has been reported to work in synergy with other anticancer agents, such as temozolomide, to induce apoptosis of tumor cells. Recently, the results of phase-1/2 clinical trials demonstrated that pyrimethamine administration reduces the expression of STAT3 signature genes in tumor tissues of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with a good therapeutic response. In the present article, we have reviewed most of the published articles related to the antitumor effects of pyrimethamine in malignancies of breast, liver, lung, skin, ovary, prostate, pituitary, and leukemia in in vitro and in vivo settings. We have also discussed the pharmacokinetic profile and results of clinical trials obtained after pyrimethamine treatment. From these studies, we believe that pyrimethamine has the potential to be repurposed as an anticancer drug.",['(c) 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.'],"['Ramchandani, Shanaya', 'Mohan, Chakrabhavi Dhananjaya', 'Mistry, Jenaifer Rustom', 'Su, Qi', 'Naz, Irum', 'Rangappa, Kanchugarakoppal S', 'Ahn, Kwang Seok']","['Ramchandani S', 'Mohan CD', 'Mistry JR', 'Su Q', 'Naz I', 'Rangappa KS', 'Ahn KS']","['Department of Pharmacology and Biochemistry, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Studies in Molecular Biology, University of Mysore, Mysore, India.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Qaid-i-Azam, University of Islamabad & Institute of Biochemistry, Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, The Islamia University, Bahawalpur, Pakistan.', 'Institution of Excellence, Vijnana Bhavan, University of Mysore, Mysore, India.', 'Department of Science in Korean Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211218,England,IUBMB Life,IUBMB life,100888706,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['MAPK', 'STAT3', 'apoptosis', 'cancer', 'drug repurposing', 'pyrimethamine']",2021/12/19 06:00,2021/12/19 06:00,['2021/12/18 08:38'],"['2021/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/18 08:38 [entrez]']",['10.1002/iub.2590 [doi]'],aheadofprint,IUBMB Life. 2021 Dec 18. doi: 10.1002/iub.2590.,,,,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2882-0612'],['NRF-2021R1I1A2060024/National Research Foundation of Korea'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although survival rates have improved, response to these treatments is highly heterogeneous. Variations in response rates may be due to different causes such as, treatment adherence, mutations in the BCR-ABL1 gene, clonal evolution and amplification of the BCR-ABL1 gene, but innate immune response is also considered to play a very important role and, specifically, NK cell activity through their receptors and ligands, could be determinant. The aim of this retrospective study was to explore the role of different activating and inhibiting KIR genes as well as the activating NKG2D receptor, present in NK cells, and also their respective ligands, HLA-A, -B, -C, -G, -F, MICA and MICB, in the progression of 190 patients with CML and treated at two hospitals from Barcelona between 2000 and 2019. Early molecular response (EMR), major molecular response (MMR) or MR3.0 and deep molecular response (DMR) or MR4.0 were correlated. As control samples, healthy donors from the Barcelona Blood Bank were analyzed. The presence of KIR2DL2/KIR2DS2 was associated with the achievement of EMR, MR3.0 and MR4.0. Carriers of the higher expression NKG2D variant and MICA*009:01 were also likely to achieve molecular response (MR). The most remarkable difference between CML patients and controls was a higher frequency of the lower expression NKG2D variant in CML patients. In summary, our results showed that activating NK receptor phenotypes might help to achieve MR and DMR in CML patients treated with TKIs although confirmatory studies are necessary.

However, the mechanisms of the oncogenic mechanism of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 remain unclear. In this study, we found that RUNX1-RUNX1T1 triggers the heterochromatic silencing of UBXN8 by recognizing the RUNX1-binding sites and recruiting chromatin-remodeling enzymes to the UBXN8 promoter region. Decitabine, a specific inhibitor of DNA methylation, upregulated the expression of UBXN8 in RUNX1-RUNX1T1(+) AML cell lines. Overexpression of UBXN8 inhibited the proliferation and colony-forming ability of and promoted cell cycle arrest in t(8;21) AML cell lines. Enhancing UBXN8 levels can significantly inhibit tumor proliferation and promote the differentiation of RUNX1-RUNX1T1(+) cells in vivo. In conclusion, our results indicated that epigenetic silencing of UBXN8 via methylation of its promoter region mediated by the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion protein contributes to the leukemogenesis of t(8;21) AML and that UBXN8 targeting may be a potential therapeutic strategy for t(8;21) AML.",['(c) 2021.

Liver cancer, primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is highly lethal with limited treatment options. LIFR is frequently downregulated in HCC. Here, by studying hepatocyte-specific and inducible Lifr-knockout mice, we show that loss of Lifr promotes liver tumorigenesis and confers resistance to drug-induced ferroptosis. Mechanistically, loss of LIFR activates NF-kappaB signaling through SHP1, leading to upregulation of the iron-sequestering cytokine LCN2, which depletes iron and renders insensitivity to ferroptosis inducers. Notably, an LCN2-neutralizing antibody enhances the ferroptosis-inducing and anticancer effects of sorafenib on HCC patient-derived xenograft tumors with low LIFR expression and high LCN2 expression. Thus, anti-LCN2 therapy is a promising way to improve liver cancer treatment by targeting ferroptosis.",['(c) 2021.

J. Batista et al., Cell Stem Cell 15, 707-719 (2014); Y. Wang et al., Nat. Cell Biol. 16, 191-198 (2014); and S. Geula et al., Science 347, 1002-1006 (2015)]. If the mRNAs of these two TF groups become stabilized, it remains unclear how the pluripotency or lineage commitment decision is implemented. We performed noninvasive quantification of Nanog and Oct4 TF protein levels in reporter ESCs to define cell-state dynamics at single-cell resolution. Long-term single-cell tracking shows that immediate m(6)A depletion by Mettl3 knock-down in serum/leukemia inhibitory factor supports both pluripotency maintenance and its departure. This is mediated by differential and opposing signaling pathways. Increased FGF5 mRNA stability activates pErk, leading to Nanog down-regulation. FGF5-mediated coactivation of pAkt reenforces Nanog expression. In formative stem cells poised toward differentiation, m(6)A depletion activates both pErk and pAkt, increasing the propensity for mesendodermal lineage induction. Stable m(6)A depletion by Mettl3 knock-out also promotes pErk activation. Higher pErk counteracts the pluripotency exit delay exhibited by stably m(6)A-depleted cells upon differentiation. At single-cell resolution, we illustrate that decreasing m(6)A abundances activates pErk and pAkt-signaling, regulating pluripotency departure.",['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Screening the expression of hundreds of TFs in the developing mouse cortex identified 38 TFs that are expressed in gradients in the ventricular zone (VZ). We tested whether their cortical expression was altered in mutant mice with known patterning defects (Emx2, Nr2f1, and Pax6), which enabled us to define a cortical regionalization TF network (CRTFN). To identify genomic programming underlying this network, we performed TF ChIP-seq and chromatin-looping conformation to identify enhancer-gene interactions. To map enhancers involved in regional patterning of cortical progenitors, we performed assays for epigenomic marks and DNA accessibility in VZ cells purified from wild-type and patterning mutant mice.

METHODS: This prospective observational research included a total of 12 cases of patients with CNS B-ALL from March 2017 to February 2020. ssCART-19 infusions (5x10(6) cells/kg) were given to patients for 3 consecutive days. After infusion, the temperature of all patients was detected constantly and the CRS was carefully monitored within 1 month after treatment. The serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, CRP and IL-17A were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) within 10 days after infusion. RESULTS: All 12 CNS B-ALL patients showed CRS with 100% incidence rate, with 3 cases (25.00%) of CRS stage I and 9 cases (75.00%) with CRS stage II. No CRS stage III~V was observed. The overall response rate was 91.67% (11/12), with 10 patients (83.33%) showed CR and 1 case (8.33%) of PR. In 9 patients with CRS stage II, the temperature increased persistently, ranging from 4 days to 14 days after infusion, and decreased gradually after 14 days of nursing treatment. The hyperthermia condition started from 1 day after infusion and returned to baseline at the following 2-10 days of nursing treatment. The levels of the inflammatory factors increased markedly after ssCAR-T19s infusion for 2-3 days compared to the baseline, and gradually returned to the baseline after treatment. After 10 days of infusion, all inflammatory factors returned to normal levels. CONCLUSION: ssCART-19s infusion induced short-term slight CRS with increased temperature and inflammatory factors, and no severe CRS was observed.","['(c) 2021 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']","['Mao, Yanqin', 'Xu, Xiang']","['Mao Y', 'Xu X']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China xiang_0723xu@21cn.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CNS B-ALL', 'Cytokine release syndrome', 'nursing', 'ssCART-19s']",2021/12/19 06:00,2021/12/19 06:00,['2021/12/18 05:34'],"['2021/12/18 05:34 [entrez]', '2021/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['51/6/790 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2021 Nov;51(6):790-794.,51,6,790-794,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Longer follow-up evaluation is needed to determine their added value in a field where approved strategies already provide high long-term survival rates. They will also be challenged by another immunotherapy with bispecific antibodies.

However, safety profile and complex logistics require high expertise centers and tight collaborations between addressing and treating centers. Current research is exploring the possibility to move to first line ALL with high-risk features and/or first high-risk relapse. More efficient CAR T-cells products, are still lacking to counteract the escape mechanisms already described. Moreover, to define the bridge-to-CAR time for each patient remains a challenge to obtain optimal disease burden allowing expansion and persistence of CAR T-cells.

This strategy was developed some thirty years ago, after extensive work established the key role of the immune system against cancer. The first-engineered T-cell with chimeric molecule was designed in 1993 by Israeli immunologist Zelig Eshhar. Since then, several modifications took place, including the addition of co-stimulatory domain, to further improve CAR-T cell anti-tumor potency. The first clinical application of CAR-T cell was done in Rotterdam in 2005 for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and simultaneously at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for metastatic ovarian cancer. These pioneered studies failed to demonstrate a therapeutic benefit, but warning emerged concerning their safety of use. The real clinical success came with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, used since 2009 by Steven Rosenberg at the NCI in a patient with refractory follicular lymphoma and in 2011 by Carl June and David Porter from the University of Pennsylvania in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. From that time, large centers in North America have embarked in several early phase and pivotal trials that have demonstrated unprecedent response rate in heavily pretreated chemo refractory patient with B-cell malignancies. Theses clinical success have led to the approval of three anti-CD19 CAR-T cells products for the management of B-cell malignancies in the United States and in Europe as of December 2020.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Societe Francaise du Cancer.

To date, only blinatumomab have reached market agreements in lymphoid malignancies with constructs targeting CD3exCD19.

CAR T-cell activity in non notcontral nervous system (CNS) extramedullary disease (EMD) has not been well-characterized. We systematically evaluated CAR T-cell kinetics, associated toxicities, and efficacy in B-ALL non-CNS EMD. We conducted a retrospective review of B-ALL patients with non-CNS EMD who were screened for/enrolled on one of three CAR trials at our institution (CD19, CD22, CD19/22). Non-CNS EMD was identified by histology or radiographic imaging at extramedullary sites excluding the cerebrospinal fluid and CNS parenchyma. Of approximately 180 patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL screened across multiple early phase trials over an 8-year period, 38 (21.1%) presented with isolated non-CNS EMD (n=5) or combined medullary/non-CNS EMD (n=33) on FDG PET-CT imaging. A subset receiving CAR T-cells (18 infusions) obtained FDG PET-CT scans pre- and post-infusion to monitor response. At best response, 72.2% (13 of 18) of patients demonstrated a medullary MRD-negative complete remission and complete (CR, n=7) or partial (PR, n=6) non-CNS EMD response. Non-CNS EMD responses to CAR T-cells were delayed (n=3) and residual non-CNS EMD was substantial; rarely, discrepant responses (marrow without EMD response) were observed (n=2). Unique CAR-associated toxicities at non-CNS EMD sites were seen in select patients. CAR T-cells are active in B-ALL non-CNS EMD. Still, non-CNS EMD response to CAR T-cells may be delayed and sub-optimal, particularly with multifocal disease.

Acquired resistance to Venetoclax via specific variants in BCL-2 is a major problem for the successful treatment of cancer patients. Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations combined with machine learning were used to define the average structure of variants in aqueous solution to predict changes in drug and ligand binding in BCL-2 variants. The variant structures all show shifts in residue positions that occlude the binding groove, and these are the primary contributors to drug resistance. Correspondingly, we established a method that can predict the severity of a variant as measured by the inhibitory constant (Ki) of Venetoclax by measuring the structure deviations to the binding cleft. In addition, we also applied machine learning to the phi and psi angles of the amino acid backbone to the ensemble of conformations that demonstrated a generalizable method for drug resistant predictions of BCL-2 proteins that elucidates changes where detailed understanding of the structure-function relationship is less clear.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Ruxolitinib gained US FDA approval for treatment of intermediate/high-risk PMF in November 2011. We evaluated differences in survival and second primary malignancy (SPM) incidence among US PMF patients in the years before and after ruxolitinib approval. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study utilizing the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-18 database for PMF patients. We divided patients into five-year cohorts pre- (2007-2011) and post-ruxolitinib (2012-2016) approval and compared relative survival rates (RSRs) to the standard population and standardized incidence rates (SIRs) of SPMs between cohorts. RESULTS: We included 2020 patients diagnosed with PMF from 2007-2016 in this study. There was no difference in the four-year RSRs between cohorts (54 % vs. 57 %, p = 0.776). More patients developed SPMs in the post-ruxolitinib cohort (8% vs. 6%, p = 0.041). The majority of SPMs were hematologic with higher incidence of AML transformation in the post-ruxolitinib cohort (SIR 125.29 vs. 70.55). CONCLUSIONS: PMF prognosis remains poor in the years following ruxolitinib's approval. SPM incidence including AML transformation is higher in the years after approval. Further studies are needed to determine the true impact of ruxolitnib on population outcomes.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with the traditional anti-tumor methods, CAR-T cell therapy has the advantages of higher specificity, stronger lethality and longer-lasting efficacy. Although CAR-T cells have made significant progress in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, diverse difficulties remain in the treatment of solid tumors, including immune escape due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, preventing entry or limiting the persistence of CAR-T cells by physical or cytokine barriers and along with other immunosuppressive molecule and cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Otherwise, the intracellular signaling of CAR also impact on CAR-T cells persistence. Appropriate modification of intracellular costimulatory molecular signal in the structure of CAR or coexpression of CAR and cytokines can provide a way to enhance CAR-T cells activity. Additionally, CAR-T cells dysfunction due to T cell exhaustion is associated with multi-factors, especially transcription factors, such as c-Jun, NR4A. Engineering CAR-T cells to coexpress or knockout transcription factors in favor of TCM memory CAR-T cells differentiation was proved to prolonged the survival of CAR-T cells. Finally, combination of CAR-T cells with oncolytic viruses, nanoparticles or immune checkpoint inhibitors provides an effective measure to improve CAR-T cells function. Here, we discuss all of these advances and challenges and review promising strategies for treating solid tumors. In particular, we also highlight that CAR-T cells have enormous potential to be used in combination with other immunotherapies.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

However, a lack of specific, potent and non-toxic TRPV2 activators and inhibitors complicate further studies to clarify the role of TRPV2. We here present valdecoxib as a novel inhibitor of heterologously expressed rat TRPV2 channels in HEK293 cells and native TRPV2 channels, endogenously expressed in the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell line. Fluorometric assays reveal an IC50 of 9 muM and 11 muM for TRPV2 in HEK293 and RBL-2H3 cells, respectively. Closely related TRPV1, TRPV3 or TRPV4 channels are not blocked by valdecoxib. The inhibition is reversible and direct as confirmed by whole-cell and excised inside-out electrophysiological recordings. Other cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors do not affect TRPV2 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combined application of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and probenecid at concentrations, which, on their own, elicit only small TRPV2 currents, act in a highly synergistic manner when applied simultaneously.

Using in vivo models, we showed that ncTregs can avert the formation of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), in part by reducing conventional T cell proliferation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and tissue damage. This reduction in GVHD occurred without disruption of graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effects. RNA sequencing revealed that a number of effector, cell adhesion, and migration molecules were upregulated in Itk(-/-) ncTregs. Furthermore, disrupting the SLP76: ITK interaction using a specific peptide inhibitor led to enhanced Treg development in both mouse and primary human cells. This peptide inhibitor also significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine production in primary GVHD patient samples and mouse T cells without causing cell death or apoptosis. We provide evidence that specifically targeting Itk signaling could be a therapeutic strategy to treat autoimmune disorders.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We surveyed North American pediatric oncologists (n = 119) to evaluate perceived risk of and surveillance practices for potential toxicities associated with prolonged TKI exposure in children and adolescents/young adults (AYAs) with CML. Survey domains included general and specific risk perceptions and surveillance practices for asymptomatic patients on chronic TKI therapy. We analyzed data descriptively and explored relationships between risk perceptions and surveillance. Risk perceptions varied among oncologists but were similar across six categories (thyroid, cardiac, vascular, metabolic, fertility, psychologic), with less than one-third rating each risk as moderate or high in pediatric and AYA patients. More oncologists perceived moderate or high risk of growth abnormalities in children (62% pediatric, 14% AYA) and financial toxicity in all patients (60% pediatric, 64% AYA). A greater proportion of oncologists with moderate or high perceived risk of thyroid abnormalities reported testing thyroid function compared to those with lower perceived risk; patterns for metabolic risk/lipid tests and cardiac risk/tests were similar. In summary, we found that pediatric oncologists had variable risk perceptions and surveillance practices for potential toxicities associated with prolonged TKI exposure. Standardizing surveillance would help quantify risks and refine recommendations.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/08880018.2021.2017085 .",,"['Smith, Stephanie M', 'Zhang, Shiqi', 'Sundaram, Vandana', 'Roth, Michael', 'Andolina, Jeffrey R', 'Schapira, Lidia', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Chaudhury, Sonali']","['Smith SM', 'Zhang S', 'Sundaram V', 'Roth M', 'Andolina JR', 'Schapira L', 'Sakamoto KM', 'Kolb EA', 'Hijiya N', 'Chaudhury S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Stem Cell Transplant and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Quantitative Sciences Unit, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Quantitative Sciences Unit, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Golisano Children's Hospital, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, USA."", 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Stanford Cancer Institute and Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Stem Cell Transplant and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Nemours Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Wilmington, Delaware, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplant, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211217,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'late effects', 'long-term effects', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2021/12/18 06:00,2021/12/18 06:00,['2021/12/17 12:17'],"['2021/12/17 12:17 [entrez]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/08880018.2021.2017085 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Dec 17:1-15. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2021.2017085.,,,1-15,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3369-7516', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1431-6543']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We enrolled young adults who had been treated during their childhood or adolescence for hematological or solid cancer at our Pediatric Oncology Unit, and performed pulmonary function tests (PFT) and clinical evaluation. PFT included spirometry and Diffusing Capacity of Lung for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO). Results: We included 121 survivors, mean age 23 years at follow-up, median 15 years from diagnosis. The most common diagnoses were hematological malignancies, mainly acute lymphoblastic leukemia, whereas 31% of the patients were treated for nonhematological cancer, mainly neuroblastoma. Treatments consisted of chemotherapy alone or in combination with radiotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Most of the patients denied respiratory symptoms throughout the years. In the whole group only eight patients (6%) had abnormal PFT, consisting mainly in a restrictive pattern and reduced DLCO. PFT abnormalities were of mild degree in most of the cases. Overall, the mean values of forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and DLCO were normal, but lower in females, in those who received radiotherapy and in those treated for lymphoma. Conclusion: In a group of young adults, surviving the most common childhood malignancies, we found a preserved lung function after a median follow-up of 15 years. The constantly increasing survival in childhood cancer is now associated with a trend toward an improvement in long-term respiratory outcomes.",,"['Spicuzza, Lucia', 'Cannata, Emanuela', 'Angileri, Lisa', 'Giuffrida, Marialuisa', 'Russo, Giovanna', 'Di Cataldo, Andrea', 'Crimi, Nunzio']","['Spicuzza L', 'Cannata E', 'Angileri L', 'Giuffrida M', 'Russo G', 'Di Cataldo A', 'Crimi N']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Sperimentale, UO Pneumologia, Azienda Policlinico-S.Marco, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Sperimentale, UO Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Azienda Policlinico-S.Marco, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Sperimentale, UO Pneumologia, Azienda Policlinico-S.Marco, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Sperimentale, UO Pneumologia, Azienda Policlinico-S.Marco, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Sperimentale, UO Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Azienda Policlinico-S.Marco, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Sperimentale, UO Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Azienda Policlinico-S.Marco, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Clinica e Sperimentale, UO Pneumologia, Azienda Policlinico-S.Marco, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211216,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['DLCO', 'acute leukemia', 'adolescents', 'cancer', 'chemotherapy', 'childhood', 'lung function', 'survivors']",2021/12/18 06:00,2021/12/18 06:00,['2021/12/17 12:15'],"['2021/12/17 12:15 [entrez]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jayao.2021.0171 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2021 Dec 16. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2021.0171.,,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8246-8357'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several such clones have been identified in various species of marine bivalve molluscs, including mussels, clams and cockles. These parasitic cell lineages cause a leukaemia-like disease called disseminated neoplasia, and are presumed to pass between hosts by ingestion of water-borne cancer cells during filter feeding. Although occasional cases of transmissible cancer had previously been identified in mussels of the genus Mytilus in Europe, the number of distinct clones affecting these animals, and their prevalence, was unknown. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Hammel et al. (2021, 30) present findings from a large-scale screen for transmissible cancer across 5907 European Mytilus mussels. Using a genotyping approach, Hammel et al. searched for signal of genetic chimerism, which can arise due to infection by transmissible cancer cells. The screen detected a previously identified globally distributed mussel transmissible cancer at very low prevalence, and found no evidence of additional contagious clones. A parallel histological screen additionally revealed low prevalence of a nontransmissible form of disseminated neoplasia. By quantifying the burden of disseminated neoplasia in European mussel populations, this study provides strong foundations for future work investigating the origins, evolution and impacts of transmissible cancers in mussels.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Baez-Ortega, Adrian', 'Murchison, Elizabeth P']","['Baez-Ortega A', 'Murchison EP']","['Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Transmissible Cancer Group, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],['News'],20211217,England,Mol Ecol,Molecular ecology,9214478,IM,,,2021/12/18 06:00,2021/12/18 06:00,['2021/12/17 07:22'],"['2021/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/17 07:22 [entrez]']",['10.1111/mec.16330 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Mol Ecol. 2021 Dec 17. doi: 10.1111/mec.16330.,,,,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7462-8907'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that the heterozygous Arhgap21 knockout mouse model (Arhgap21(+/-)) presents several alterations in the hematopoietic compartment, including increased frequency of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) with impaired adhesion in vitro, increased mobilization to peripheral blood, and decreased engraftment after bone marrow transplantation. Although these HSPC functions strongly depend on their interactions with the components of the bone marrow (BM) niche, the role of ARHGAP21 in the marrow microenvironment has not yet been explored. In this study, we investigated the composition and function of the BM microenvironment in Arhgap21(+/-) mice. The BM of Arhgap21(+/-) mice presented a significant increase in the frequency of phenotypic osteoblastic lineage cells, with no differences in the frequencies of multipotent stromal cells or endothelial cells when compared to the BM of wild type mice. Arhgap21(+/-) BM cells had increased capacity of generating osteogenic colony-forming units (CFU-OB) in vitro and higher levels of osteocalcin were detected in the Arhgap21(+/-) BM supernatant. Increased expression of Col1a1, Ocn and decreased expression of Trap1 were observed after osteogenic differentiation of Arhgap21(+/-) BM cells. In addition, Arhgap21(+/-) mice recipients of normal BM cells showed decreased leucocyte numbers during transplantation recovery.

However, the clinical utility of TJLB in this group of patients has not been thoroughly investigated. The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of TJLB in patients with hematological diseases complicated by liver dysfunction. Methods We analyzed the data of patients who developed liver disorders during treatment for hematological diseases at our hospital and required tissue diagnosis via TJLB. The clinical features of patients were analyzed. Results Twenty-seven patients (mean age, 60.07 years; 12 men, 15 women) requiring tissue diagnoses via TJLB after developing liver disorders while undergoing treatment for hematological diseases were enrolled. One patient with autoimmune hemolytic anemia was diagnosed with drug-induced liver injury; two patients with amyloidosis had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; one patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia had a drug-induced liver injury; one patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia had liver infiltration caused by an underlying disease; three patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura had autoimmune hepatitis; four patients with malignant lymphoma had liver infiltration by the underlying disease, and one patient with multiple myeloma had liver disorder caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation. Moreover, one patient had hepatitis B reactivation, another had hepatitis E, and six patients had a drug-induced liver injury. The treatment regimen was altered in cases of liver infiltration caused by the underlying disease, and the drug was changed for patients with drug-induced liver injury. Conclusion The etiology of liver disorders in patients with hematological diseases varies widely. Therefore, histological diagnosis using TJLB is useful to determine an appropriate therapeutic strategy for underlying hematological diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Ishikawa et al.']","['Ishikawa, Toru', 'Kodama, Erina', 'Kobayashi, Takamasa', 'Azumi, Motoi', 'Nozawa, Yujiro', 'Iwanaga, Akito', 'Sano, Tomoe', 'Honma, Terasu']","['Ishikawa T', 'Kodama E', 'Kobayashi T', 'Azumi M', 'Nozawa Y', 'Iwanaga A', 'Sano T', 'Honma T']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Niigata Hospital, Niigata, JPN.', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Niigata Hospital, Niigata, JPN.', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Niigata Hospital, Niigata, JPN.', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Niigata Hospital, Niigata, JPN.', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Niigata Hospital, Niigata, JPN.', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Niigata Hospital, Niigata, JPN.', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Niigata Hospital, Niigata, JPN.', 'Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Niigata Hospital, Niigata, JPN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211114,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['coagulation disorders', 'hematology', 'liver disease', 'pancytopenia', 'transjugular liver biopsy']",2021/12/18 06:00,2021/12/18 06:01,['2021/12/17 06:57'],"['2021/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/17 06:57 [entrez]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.19555 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Nov 14;13(11):e19555. doi: 10.7759/cureus.19555. eCollection 2021 Nov.,13,11,e19555,,,,PMC8669626,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cysteine depletion was reported to inhibit tumor growth and induce pancreatic cancer cell ferroptosis. Nevertheless, the effect of cysteine depletion in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains to be explored. In this work, we showed that cysteine depletion can induce K562/G01 but not K562 cell death in the form of ferroptosis. However, the glutathione (GSH)/glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) pathways of the two CML cell lines were both blocked after cysteine depletion. This unexpected outcome guided us to perform RNA-Seq to screen the key genes that affect the sensitivity of CML cells to cysteine depletion. Excitingly, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), which related to cell redox metabolism, was significantly upregulated in K562/G01 cells after cysteine depletion. We further inferred that the upregulation is negatively feedback by the enzyme activity decrease of TXNRD1. Then, we triggered the ferroptosis by applying TXNRD1 shRNA and TXNRD1 inhibitor auranofin in K562 cells after cysteine depletion. In summary, we have reason to believe that TXNRD1 is a key regulator involved in the ferroptosis of CML cells induced by cysteine depletion in vitro.

The bioactivity of isolated medicinal compounds from this genus justifies the increased interest in recent times for species of Plectranthus, placing them in the spotlight for natural product drug development. Aim of the study: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review on the biological activities of Plectranthus ecklonii Benth. As such, the aim of this review was three-fold: 1) to summarize the chemical compounds isolated from P. ecklonii; 2) to collate the biological activities and mechanisms of action of these compounds from in vitro studies; and 3) to evaluate the documented uses and potential applications of this species, in order to postulate on the direction of pharmaceutical uses of this species. Materials and methods: An extensive database retrieval was performed using the electronic databases Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect. The search criteria consisted of the keywords ""Plectranthus ecklonii"", ""Plectranthus ecklonii + review"", ""Plectranthus ecklonii + diterpenes"" or ""Plectranthus ecklonii + abietanes"", ""ecklonii + parviflorone D"", searched individually and as combinations. Eligibility criteria were set out and titles in English, Portuguese and Spanish were reviewed, with all references included dating from 1970 to 2021. A total of 169 papers were selected and included. Chemical structures were drawn using ChemDraw 20.0, CID numbers were searched in PubChem and the PRISMA diagram was created using PowerPoint 2012. Results: To date, a total of 28 compounds have been isolated from P. ecklonii, including diterpenes, triterpenes, flavonoids, and hydroxycinnamic acids. Most focused on the antimicrobial action of its constituents, although compounds have demonstrated other bioactivities, namely antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumor. The most recent studies emphasize the diterpenoids, particularly parviflorone D, with the help of nanotechnology. Conclusions: The widespread ethnobotanical and traditional uses of P. ecklonii can be scientifically justified by a range of biological activities, demonstrated by isolated secondary metabolites. These bioactivities showcase the potential of this species in the development of economically important active pharmaceutical ingredients, particularly in anticancer therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Antao, Bangay, Dominguez-Martin, Diaz-Lanza and Rijo.']","['Antao, Ana Ribeirinha', 'Bangay, Gabrielle', 'Dominguez-Martin, Eva Maria', 'Diaz-Lanza, Ana Maria', 'Rijo, Patricia']","['Antao AR', 'Bangay G', 'Dominguez-Martin EM', 'Diaz-Lanza AM', 'Rijo P']","['CBIOS -Research Center for Biosciences and Health Technologies, Universidade Lusofona de Humanidades e Tecnologias, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'CBIOS -Research Center for Biosciences and Health Technologies, Universidade Lusofona de Humanidades e Tecnologias, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'University of Alcala de Henares, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Pharmacology Area (Pharmacognosy Laboratory), New Antitumor Compounds: Toxic Action on Leukemia Cells Research Group, Campus University, Alcala de Henares, Spain.', 'CBIOS -Research Center for Biosciences and Health Technologies, Universidade Lusofona de Humanidades e Tecnologias, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'University of Alcala de Henares, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Pharmacology Area (Pharmacognosy Laboratory), New Antitumor Compounds: Toxic Action on Leukemia Cells Research Group, Campus University, Alcala de Henares, Spain.', 'University of Alcala de Henares, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Pharmacology Area (Pharmacognosy Laboratory), New Antitumor Compounds: Toxic Action on Leukemia Cells Research Group, Campus University, Alcala de Henares, Spain.', 'CBIOS -Research Center for Biosciences and Health Technologies, Universidade Lusofona de Humanidades e Tecnologias, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Investigacao do Medicamento (iMed.ULisboa), Faculdade de Farmacia, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211130,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['Plectranthus ecklonii', 'bioactivity', 'pharmacology', 'phytochemistry', 'plectranthus']",2021/12/18 06:00,2021/12/18 06:01,['2021/12/17 06:52'],"['2021/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/17 06:52 [entrez]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.768268 [doi]', '768268 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Nov 30;12:768268. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.768268. eCollection 2021.,12,,768268,,,,PMC8670309,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such endocannabinoid is N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide, AEA), which is metabolized by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). In humans, there is a loss of function single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the FAAH gene (C385A, rs324420), that leads to increases in the levels of AEA. Using a mouse model with this SNP, we investigated how this SNP affects inflammation in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. We administered 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) intracolonically, to adult male FAAH SNP mice and examined colonic macroscopic tissue damage and myeloperoxidase activity, as well as levels of plasma and amygdalar cytokines and chemokines 3 days after administration, at the peak of colitis. We found that mice possessing the loss of function alleles (AC and AA), displayed no differences in colonic damage or myeloperoxidase activity compared to mice with wild type alleles (CC). In contrast, in plasma, colitis-induced increases in interleukin (IL)-2, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were reduced in animals with an A allele. A similar pattern was observed in the amygdala for granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and MCP-1. In the amygdala, the mutant A allele led to lower levels of IL-1alpha, IL-9, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta, and MIP-2 independent of colitis-providing additional understanding of how FAAH may serve as a regulator of inflammatory responses in the brain. Together, these data provide insights into how FAAH regulates inflammatory processes in disease.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Vecchiarelli, Aukema, Hume, Chiang, Morena, Keenan, Nastase,', 'Lee, Pittman,

R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures formed by an RNA-DNA hybrid with a displaced non-template DNA strand. We developed RNA-DNA Proximity Proteomics to map the R-loop proximal proteome of human cells using quantitative mass spectrometry. We implicate different cellular proteins in R-loop regulation and identify a role of the tumor suppressor DDX41 in opposing R-loop and double strand DNA break accumulation in promoters. DDX41 is enriched in promoter regions in vivo, and can unwind RNA-DNA hybrids in vitro. R-loop accumulation upon loss of DDX41 is accompanied with replication stress, an increase in the formation of double strand DNA breaks and transcriptome changes associated with the inflammatory response. Germline loss-of-function mutations in DDX41 lead to predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia in adulthood. We propose that R-loop accumulation and genomic instability-associated inflammatory response may contribute to the development of familial AML with mutated DDX41.",['(c) 2021.

Interestingly, many cancer survival pathways are susceptible to disturbances in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and may therefore be disrupted by exogenous ROS. Here, we explore whether trident cold atmospheric plasma (Tri-CAP), a gas discharge with exceptionally low-level ROS, could inhibit multiple cancer survival pathways together in a murine cell line model of therapy-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We show that Tri-CAP simultaneously disrupts three cancer survival pathways of redox deregulation, glycolysis, and proliferative AKT/mTOR/HIF-1alpha signaling in this cancer model. Significantly, Tri-CAP blockade induces a very high rate of apoptotic death in CML cell lines and in primary CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from CML patients, both harboring the therapy-resistant T315I mutation. In contrast, nonmalignant controls are minimally affected by Tri-CAP, suggesting it selectively targets resistant cancer cells. We further demonstrate that Tri-CAP elicits similar lethality in human melanoma, breast cancer, and CML cells with disparate, resistant mechanisms and that it both reduces tumor formation in two mouse models and improves survival of tumor-bearing mice. For use in patients, administration of Tri-CAP may be extracorporeal for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy, transdermal, or through its activated solution for infusion therapy.

The available karyotyping and fluorescent in situ hybridization provide limited information on molecular abnormalities for diagnosis/prognosis of MDS. Next generation DNA sequencing (NGS), providing deep insights into molecular mechanisms being involved in pathophysiology, was employed to study MDS in Pakistani cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: It was a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out at National institute of blood diseases and bone marrow transplant from 2016 to 2019. Total of 22 cases of MDS were included. Complete blood counts, bone marrow assessment and cytogenetic analysis was done. Patients were classified according to revised WHO classification 2016 and IPSS score was applied for risk stratification. Baseline blood samples were subjected to analysis by NGS using a panel of 54 genes associated with myeloid malignancies. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 48.5 +/- 9.19 years. The most common presenting complaint was weakness 10(45.45%). Cytogenetics analysis revealed abnormal karyotype in 10 (45.45%) patients. On NGS, 54 non-silent rare frequency somatic mutational events in 29 genes were observed (average of 3.82 (SD +/- 2.08) mutations per patient), including mutations previously not observed in MDS or AML. Notably, two genes of cohesin complex, RAD21 and STAG2, and two tumor suppressor genes, CDKN2A and TP53, contained highest number of recurrent non-silent somatic mutations in the MDS. Strikingly, a missense somatic mutation p.M272Rof Rad21 was observed in 13 cases. Overall, non-silent somatic mutations in these four genes were observed in 21 of the 22 cases. The filtration with PharmGKB database highlighted a non-synonymous genetic variant rs1042522 [G > C] located in the TP53. Genotype GG and GC of this variant are associated with decreased response to cisplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. These two genotypes were found in 13 cases. CONCLUSION: Sequencing studies suggest that numerous genetic variants are involved in the initiation of MDS and in the development of AML. In countries like Pakistan where financial reservation of patients makes the use of such analysis even more difficult when the availability of advanced techniques is already a prevailing issue, our study could be an initiating effort in adding important information to the local data. Further studies and large sample size are needed in future to enlighten molecular profiling and ultimately would be helpful to compare and contrast the molecular characteristics of Asian versus global population.",['(c) 2021.

Traditional positron emission tomography-based (PET) prognostication takes place after salvage and before autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), and while useful, for many patients this information comes too late and at the expense of unnecessary toxicity. In this edition of Leukemia & Lymphoma, two groups present their findings on the use of early quantitative PET markers and the correlation with outcomes in patients embarking on second line salvage chemotherapy.

However the clinical courses of cases with isolated del(13q) are quite heterogeneous. In our study, we investigated copy number variations (CNVs), loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and the size of del(13q) in 30 CLL patients with isolated del(13q). We used CGH+SNP microarrays in order to understand the cause of this clinical heterogeneity. We detected del(13q) in 28/30 CLL cases. The size of the deletion varied from 0.34 to 28.81 Mb, and there was no clinical effect of the deletion size. We found new prognostic markers, especially the gain of 16p13.3. These markers have statistically significant associations with short time to first treatment and advanced disease stage. Detecting both CNVs and LOH at the same time is an advantageous feature of aCGH+SNP. However, it is very challenging for the array analysis to detect mosaic anomalies. Therefore, it is very important to confirm the results by FISH. In our study, we detected approximately 9% mosaic del(13q) by microarray. In addition, the gain of 16p13.3 may affect the disease prognosis in CLL. However, additional studies with more patients are needed to confirm these results.","['(c) 2021 S.

We conducted a single center phase II study evaluating the feasibility of 4 cycles of blinatumomab administered every 3 months during the first year after HCT in an effort to mitigate relapse in high-risk ALL patients. Twenty-one of 23 enrolled patients received at least one cycle of blinatumomab and were included in the analysis. The median time from HCT to the first cycle of blinatumomab was 78 days (range, 44-105). Twelve patients (57%) completed all 4 treatment cycles. Neutropenia was the only grade 4 adverse event (19%). Rates of cytokine release (5% G1) and neurotoxicity (5% G2) were minimal. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD grades 2-4 and 3-4 were 33% and 5%, respectively; two cases of mild (10%) and one case of moderate (5%) chronic GVHD were noted. With a median follow-up of 14.3 months, the 1-year overall survival, progression-free survival, and non-relapse mortality rates were 85%, 71%, and 0%, respectively. In a matched-analysis with a contemporary cohort of 57 patients, we found no significant difference between groups regarding blinatumomab's efficacy. Correlative studies of baseline and post-treatment samples identified patients with specific T-cell profiles as ""responders"" or ""non-responders"" to therapy. Responders had higher proportions of effector memory CD8 T-cell subsets. Non-responders were T-cell deficient and expressed more inhibitory checkpoint molecules, including TIM3. We found that blinatumomab post-allogeneic HCT is feasible, and its benefit is dependent on the immune milieu at time of treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Gaballa, Mahmoud R', 'Banerjee, Pinaki Prosad', 'Milton, Denai R', 'Jiang, Xianli', 'Ganesh, Christina', 'Khazal, Sajad J', 'Nandivada, Vandana', 'Islam, Sanjida', 'Kaplan, Mecit', 'Daher, May', 'Basar, Rafet', 'Alousi, Amin', 'Mehta, Rohtesh S', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'Khouri, Issa F', 'Oran, Betul', 'Marin, David', 'Popat, Uday R', 'Olson, Amanda L', 'Tewari, Priti', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Chen, Ken', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Kebriaei, Partow']","['Gaballa MR', 'Banerjee PP', 'Milton DR', 'Jiang X', 'Ganesh C', 'Khazal SJ', 'Nandivada V', 'Islam S', 'Kaplan M', 'Daher M', 'Basar R', 'Alousi A', 'Mehta RS', 'Alatrash G', 'Khouri IF', 'Oran B', 'Marin D', 'Popat UR', 'Olson AL', 'Tewari P', 'Jain N', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Ravandi F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Chen K', 'Champlin RE', 'Shpall EJ', 'Rezvani K', 'Kebriaei P']","['Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'MD Anderson, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'MD Anderson, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'MD Anderson, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'MDACC, Houston, United States.', 'The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States.', 'M.D. Anderson Cancer Ctr.

Although intensive chemotherapy greatly improved the survival rate, it is often accompanied by severe and lifelong side effects as a result of weak ALL selectivity. The intensive and poorly selective chemotherapy is also detrimental to patients' immune system. There is an urgent need to develop more selective and less toxic chemotherapy for ALL. Here, we report daratumumab-polymersome-vincristine (DP-VCR) as a CD38-directed nanotherapy for ALL. DP-VCR showed selective uptake in CD38-positive 697 and Nalm-6-Luc ALL cells and potent anti-ALL activity with an IC50 as low as 0.06 nM VCR, which was 13.7-fold more potent than free VCR. In contrast, no toxicity to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was detected for DP-VCR even at 108.3 nM VCR. The apoptotic assays confirmed a high selectivity of DP-VCR to CD38-positive ALL cells. DP-VCR exhibited superior treatment of both 697 and Nalm-6-Luc orthotopic ALL models to all controls, as revealed by significant survival benefit and marked reduction of leukemia burden in bone marrow, blood, spleen, and liver.

Recent findings have indicated that aberrant expression of immune checkpoint proteins may be associated with disease relapse and progression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). TOX, a transcription factor in the HMG-box protein superfamily, was found to be a potential target for immunotherapy not only in solid tumors but also in hematological malignancies. However, little is known about TOX expression and co-expression with immune checkpoint proteins or the exhausted phenotype in the T cell subsets in AML. Thus, in this study, we analyzed TOX expression and co-expression with PD-1, Tim-3, and CD244 in T cells. METHODS: TOX expression and co-expression with PD-1, Tim-3, and CD244 in CD3+, CD4+, regulatory T (Treg), and CD8+ T cells were analyzed by multi-color fluorescent flow cytometry in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples from patients with de novo AML and AML in complete remission (CR) and healthy individuals (HIs). RESULTS: A significantly increased percentage of TOX+CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells was found in PB from patients with de novo AML in comparison with HIs. Double-positive TOX+CD244+, TOX+PD-1+, and TOX+Tim-3+ T cells markedly increased in the CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell populations in de novo AML patients compared with HIs, and similar trends were demonstrated for TOX+Tim-3+CD3+/CD4+/CD8+ T cells in de novo AML compared with AML-CR patients. In addition, the number of TOX+, TOX+PD-1+, and TOX+Tim-3+Treg cells significantly increased in de novo AML patients compared with HIs, and TOX+PD-1+Treg cells were higher in de novo AML compared with AML-CR patients. Moreover, TOX positively correlated with Tim-3 expression in CD8+ and Treg cells, and a positive correlation between the expression of TOX+ CD4+ and CD244+CD4+ T cells was found. Furthermore, an increased percentage of TOX+Tim-3+ T cells in BM was also found in de novo AML patients compared with HIs. CONCLUSIONS: Increased TOX concurrent with PD-1, Tim-3, and CD244 in T cells may contribute to T cell exhaustion and impair their function in AML.

A project of the French African Pediatric Oncology Group (GFAOP).,10.1002/pbc.29464 [doi],"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The establishment of an international hospital-based register (HBR) for the French African Pediatric Oncology Group (GFAOP) was a necessary step in the group's clinical research program. With help from the Sanofi Espoir Foundation's ""My Child Matters"" program, the GFAOP resolved to develop an international HBR network to collect quality data on children attending the Pediatric Oncology Units (POUs). METHODS: All children entering POUs from January 2016 to December 2018 were registered using an online questionnaire. Data collection included information on diagnosis, disease stage, demographics, socioeconomic status, and outcome. An intensive training program was developed to improve both data quality and quantity. RESULTS: Among the 3348 children registered, 3230 had a suspected cancer, 681 were not confirmed. A diagnosis was confirmed on radiological, clinical, or histological examination for 2549 children including Burkitt lymphoma (516: 20%)-the most frequent diagnosis, Wilms' tumor (459: 18%), retinoblastoma (357: 14%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (345: 13%). Of these, 2187 children were treated. Early deaths, abandonment, economic difficulties, and lack of equipment were some of the reasons offered to explain the numbers of undiagnosed and untreated children. Vital status is known for 1994 children: 1187 died and 807 were alive, 551 of these with a follow-up > 12 months. CONCLUSION: This work has provided reliable data on children attending the POUs, especially clarifying reasons and occasions for care rupture. The data will help to identify material, human resources, and staff training needs, to evaluate progress, and to encourage consideration of pediatric cancer in national cancer plans.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Recently, an activating mutation in the DNA binding domain of IRF4 (IRF4(K59R) ), was found as a recurrent somatic mutation in ATLL patients. However, it remains unknown how this mutation gives rise to the observed oncogenic effect. To understand the mode of IRF4(K59R) mediated gain of function in ATLL pathogenesis, we have determined the structural and affinity basis of IRF4(K59R) /DNA homodimer complex using X-ray crystallography and surface plasmon resonance. Our study shows that arginine substitution (R59) results in the reorientation of the side chain, enabling the guanidium group to interact with the phosphate backbone of the DNA helix. This markedly contrasts with the IRF4(WT) wherein the K59 interacts exclusively with DNA bases. Further, the arginine mutation causes enhanced DNA bending, enabling the IRF4(K59R) to interact more robustly with known DNA targets, as evidenced by increased binding affinity of the protein-DNA complex. Together, we demonstrate how key structural features underpin the basis for this activating mutation, thereby providing a molecular rationale for IRF4(K59R) -mediated ATLL development.

Recently, we reported that regional DNA hypermethylation in HTLV-1-infected T-cells reflects the disease status of ATL and the anti-ATL effects of DNA demethylating agents, including azacitidine (AZA), decitabine (DAC) and a new DAC prodrug, OR-2100 (OR21), which we developed. Here, to better understand the mechanisms underlying drug resistance, we generated AZA-, DAC- and OR21-resistant (AZA-R, DAC-R and OR21-R, respectively) cells from the ATL cell line TL-Om1 and the HTLV-1-infected cell line MT-2 via long-term drug exposure. The efficacy of OR21 was almost the same as that of DAC, indicating that the pharmacodynamics of OR21 were due to release of DAC from OR21. Resistant cells did not show cellular responses observed in parental cells induced by treatment with drugs, including growth suppression, depletion of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 and DNA hypomethylation. We also found that reduced expression of deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) correlated with lower susceptibility to DAC/OR21 and that reduced expression of uridine cytidine kinase2 (UCK2) correlated with reduced susceptibility to AZA. DCK and UCK2 catalyze phosphorylation of DAC and AZA, respectively; reconstitution of expression reversed the resistant phenotypes. A large homozygous deletion in DCK and a homozygous splice donor site mutation in UCK2 were identified in DAC-R TL-Om1 and AZA-R TL-Om1, respectively. Both genomic mutations might lead to loss of protein expression. Thus, inactivation of UCK2 and DCK might be a putative cause of phenotypes that are resistant to AZA and DAC/OR21, respectively.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

This rearrangement leads to the fusion of BCR and ABL1 genes giving rise to a chimeric protein with constitutive kinase activity. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is used as a first-line treatment for CML, though ~40% of CML patients do not respond. Here, using structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and 3D reconstruction, we studied the 3D organization patterns of the ABL1 and BCR genes, and their chromosome territories (CTs) CT9 and CT22, in CD34+ cells from CML patients that responded or not to TKI. We found that TKI resistance in CML is associated with high levels of structural disruption of CT9 and CT22 in CD34+ cells, increased CT volumes (especially for CT22), intermingling between CT9 and CT22, and an open-chromatin epigenetic mark in CT22. Altogether our results suggest that large-scale disruption of CT9 and CT22 correlates with the clinical response of CML patients, which could be translated into a potential prognostic marker of response to treatment in this disease and provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying resistance to TKI in CML.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The current study aimed to identify the role of circRNA 0040823 (circ_0040823) in AML. METHODS: Microarray datasets were analyzed to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in AML patients. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers and AML patients for the measurement of circ_0040823 and miR-516b levels. The overexpression or knockdown of a target gene in AML cells was achieved by the transfection with lentiviral vectors or small interfering RNAs. BALB/c nude mice were inoculated with AML cells and monitored for tumor growth. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down assay were used to determine the binding relationship between circRNA and miRNA. RESULTS: circ_0040823 was significantly downregulated in AML patients and leukemia cells. Overexpression of circ_0040823 inhibited AML cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Upregulation of circ_0040823 also repressed the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo. circ_0040823 acted as a miR-516b sponge and regulated key cellular events in leukemia cells via downregulating miR-516b. Moreover, tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was a downstream target of miR-516b. The inhibition of miR-516b impaired the proliferation capacity of leukemia cells and induced apoptosis, while PTEN deficiency attenuated these effects. CONCLUSION: This study showed that circ_0040823 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of AML cells by sponging miR-516b, thereby diminishing the regulatory effect of miR-516b on PTEN. These findings identified circ_0040823/miR-516b/PTEN as a new therapeutic target for AML.",['This article is protected by copyright.

Our study evaluates survival outcomes of children (0-17 years) and AYAs (18-39 years) diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the Netherlands between 1990 and 2015 (N = 2058) utilizing the population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry, which includes information on therapy and site of primary treatment. Five- and 10-year relative (disease-specific) survival were estimated for all patients, children and AYAs. Multivariable analyses were performed using generalized linear models (excess mortality) and logistic regression (early mortality). AYAs with AML had a substantially lower 5- and 10-year relative survival than children (5-year: 43% vs 58%; 10-year: 37% vs 51%). The gap in 5-year relative survival was largest (nearly 20 percent-points) in 2010 to 2015, despite survival improvements over time across all ages. The multivariable-adjusted excess risk of dying was 60% higher in AYAs (95% CI: 37%-86%). Early mortality (death within 30 days of diagnosis) declined over time, and did not differ between children and AYAs. In conclusion, AYAs diagnosed with AML in the Netherlands had a worse prognosis than pediatric patients. The survival gap seemed most pronounced in recent years, suggesting that improvements in care resulting in better outcome for children have not led to equal benefits for AYAs.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

MCL1 has been recognized as a target molecule for cancer treatment. While various agents have emerged as potential MCL1 blockers, the present study presented acriflavine (ACF) as a novel MCL1 inhibitor in triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC). Further evaluation of its treatment potential on lung adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) was also investigated. The anticancer effect of ACF on TNBC cells was demonstrated when MDAMB231 and HS578T cells were treated with ACF. ACF significantly induced typical intrinsic apoptosis in TNBCs in a dose and timedependent manner via MCL1 downregulation. MCL1 downregulation by ACF treatment was revealed at each phase of protein expression. Initially, transcriptional regulation via reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR was validated. Then, posttranslational regulation was explained by utilizing an inhibitor against protein biosynthesis and proteasome. Lastly, immunoprecipitation of ubiquitinated MCL1 confirmed the posttranslational downregulation of MCL1. In addition, the synergistic treatment efficacy of ACF with the wellknown MCL1 inhibitor ABT263 against the TNBC cells was explored [combination index (CI)<1]. Conjointly, the anticancer effect of ACF was assessed in GBM (U87, U251 and U343), and lung cancer (A549 and NCIH69) cell lines as well, using immunoblotting, cytotoxicity assay and FACS. The effect of the combination treatment using ACF and ABT263 was estimated in GBM (U87, U343 and U251), and nonsmall cell lung cancer (A549) cells likewise.

Conventional treatments for TALL fail to prevent or cure the disease, with a highrisk of recurrence after the first remission. Thus, medical options are in demand to develop novel therapies for patients suffering with TALL. Niclosamide, a traditional oral antihelminthic drug, has been reported to be a potential anticancer agent that regulates intracellular signaling pathways. Few studies have yet investigated the effects of niclosamide on the development of TALL. Here, the present study aimed to investigate the antileukemia effects of niclosamide on TALL. We first hypothesized that the suppressive effects of niclosamide on the tumor growth of TALL are exerted by regulating autophagy and apoptosis. Following niclosamide treatment, TALL cell viability was evaluated using MTT assay, and apoptosis with Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. In TALL cells treated with niclosamide, changes in apoptosis and autophagyrelated proteins were analyzed by western blotting. In addition, in an in vivo model, TALL xenograft mice were used to study the antileukemia effects of niclosamide. The results showed that niclosamide significantly reduced the viability of Jurkat and CCRFCEM TALL cells in both a dose and timedependent manner. Niclosamide significantly activated the early and late phases of apoptosis in Jurkat (at 2 microM) and CCRFCEM cells (at 1 microM). Furthermore, niclosamide upregulated protein expression of cleaved caspase3 and LC3B, while downregulated those of Bcl2 and p62, in a dosedependent manner in both Jurkat and CCRFCEM cells. The in vivo results showed that niclosamide treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth and the disease progression in TALL xenograft mice by activating cleaved caspase3 and LC3B. We conclude that niclosamide plays an antileukemia role, and that it represents a novel approach for the treatment of TALL.",,"['Huang, Fang-Liang', 'Yu, Sheng-Jie', 'Liao, En-Chih', 'Li, Long-Yuan', 'Shen, Pei-Wen', 'Li, Chia-Ling']","['Huang FL', 'Yu SJ', 'Liao EC', 'Li LY', 'Shen PW', 'Li CL']","[""Children's Medical Center, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung 40705, Taiwan, R.O.C."", 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung 813414, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, MacKay Medical College, New Taipei City 25245, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung 813414, Taiwan, R.O.C.', ""Children's Medical Center, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung 40705, Taiwan, R.O.C.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211216,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'niclosamide', 'xenograft']",2021/12/17 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2021/12/16 06:40'],"['2021/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/16 06:40 [entrez]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/or.2021.8241 [doi]', '30 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2022 Feb;47(2). pii: 30. doi: 10.3892/or.2021.8241.

The therapeutic guideline varied between different methods. As the main therapeutic guideline is chemotherapy, recent studies had shown utilization of natural products in combination with conventional medication, elevate the efficiency of chemotherapeutic methods. Kombucha is a traditional beverage obtained from the fermentation of green tea as a rich source of flavonoid medicinal plant. This study aimed to evaluate the natural potential of combination therapy of this natural product with doxorubicin as a chemotherapeutic agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed as in vitro evaluation of biological activity of kombucha on HCT-116 cell line (human colon cancer cell line). The cytotoxic effect of different kombucha beverages (fermented green tea) in comparison with green tea extract was evaluated by dimethylthiazolyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In the next step, anticancer activity of doxorubicin as a general guideline chemotherapeutic agent in combination with kombucha was evaluated by cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assay flow cytometry. Apoptotic genes expression pattern was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The experiments were designed in three independent replications and statistically analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: The results show that kombucha compared with the green tea extract caused more (1.2 fold) early apoptosis induction and G0/G1 phase arrest. Moreover, kombucha increased the expression levels of p21, p53, and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein genes (2, 2.5, and 1.5 fold, respectively) while it decreased Bcl-2 gene expression level (5-8 fold) compared with doxorubicin alone. Combination of kombucha with doxorubicin shows 2-fold increased G0/G1 phase compared with the doxorubicin treatment. CONCLUSION: This result indicated that kombucha caused boosted anticancer activity of doxorubicin agent. These findings suggest that kombucha may be has an assistor and useful role in colorectal cancer treatment align with chemotherapy.",['Copyright: (c) 2021 Journal of Education and Health Promotion.'],"['Rasouli, Latifeh', 'Aryaeian, Naheed', 'Gorjian, Mehran', 'Nourbakhsh, Mitra', 'Amiri, Fatemehsadat']","['Rasouli L', 'Aryaeian N', 'Gorjian M', 'Nourbakhsh M', 'Amiri F']","['Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, International Campus, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, School of Sciences, Payame-Noor University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, School of Sciences, Payame-Noor University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211029,India,J Educ Health Promot,Journal of education and health promotion,101593794,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'colorectal cancer', 'doxorubicin', 'kombucha.']",2021/12/17 06:00,2021/12/17 06:01,['2021/12/16 06:36'],"['2020/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/16 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jehp.jehp_1456_20 [doi]', 'JEHP-10-376 [pii]']",epublish,J Educ Health Promot. 2021 Oct 29;10:376. doi: 10.4103/jehp.jehp_1456_20. eCollection 2021.,10,,376,,,,PMC8641728,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinct from canonical white, brown, and beige adipocytes, BMAs derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells possess unique characteristics and functions. Recent single-cell sequencing studies have revealed the differentiation pathway, and seminal works support the tenet that BMAs are critical regulators in hematopoiesis, osteogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis. In this review, we discuss the origin and differentiation of BMAs, as well as the roles of BMAs in hematopoiesis, osteogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, and immune regulation. Overall, BMAs represent a novel target for bone marrow-related diseases, including osteoporosis and leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Zhang, Wang, Chen and Su.']","['Wang, Lipeng', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Wang, Sicheng', 'Chen, Xiao', 'Su, Jiacan']","['Wang L', 'Zhang H', 'Wang S', 'Chen X', 'Su J']","['Institute of Translational Medicine, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics Trauma, Shanghai Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Shanghai Zhongye Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics Trauma, Shanghai Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics Trauma, Shanghai Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211129,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow adipocytes', 'bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells', 'hematopoiesis', 'immune regulation', 'osteoclastogenesis', 'osteogenesis']",2021/12/17 06:00,2021/12/17 06:01,['2021/12/16 06:35'],"['2021/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/16 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fcell.2021.770705 [doi]', '770705 [pii]']",epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Nov 29;9:770705. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.770705. eCollection 2021.,9,,770705,,,,PMC8667222,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various conditions can lead to neurological symptoms in CLL patients and distinguishing between clinically significant CLL involvement of the CNS and other aetiologies can be challenging. The authors report the case of a 90-year-old woman with a previous diagnosis of low-risk CLL who presented to the emergency room with altered mental status. After the most frequent causes were ruled out and considering the underlying disease, CNS infiltration by clonal B-cells was hypothesised and later confirmed. Treatment was initiated, but the patient died soon afterwards.

Despite a good safety profile, medications in this category have an increased incidence of specific adverse events such as pulmonary hypertension, pleural effusion, and cardiovascular/peripheral arterial events. However, renal complications are rarely reported and observed. We herein report a case of a 46-year-old patient with CML who developed nephrotic syndrome upon switching from imatinib to dasatinib therapy, with the resolution of symptoms upon treatment discontinuation and switching to nilotinib. Limited cases were reported in the literature. It is thought that the inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway is the main mechanism leading to proteinuria. Dasatinib-induced nephrotic syndrome should be looked for as it can be resolved by either reducing the dose or stopping it altogether and switching to another TKI.","['Copyright (c) 2021, ElShaer et al.']","['ElShaer, Ahmed', 'Almasry, Mazen', 'Alawar, Maher', 'Masoud, Hassan', 'El Kinge, Abdul Rahman']","['ElShaer A', 'Almasry M', 'Alawar M', 'Masoud H', 'El Kinge AR']","['Internal Medicine, Alfaisal University College of Medicine, Riyadh, SAU.', 'Internal Medicine, Alfaisal University College of Medicine, Riyadh, SAU.', 'Nephrology, Specialized Medical Center, Riyadh, SAU.', 'Pathology, Specialized Medical Center, Riyadh, SAU.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology, NMC Royal Hospital, Sharjah, ARE.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20211210,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['adverse event', 'case report', 'proteinuria', 'renal disease', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/12/17 06:00,2021/12/17 06:01,['2021/12/16 06:34'],"['2021/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/16 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.20330 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Dec 10;13(12):e20330. doi: 10.7759/cureus.20330. eCollection 2021 Dec.,13,12,e20330,,,,PMC8665416,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The data of 193 acute leukemia patients who were performed Allo-SCT from matched-related donors were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thrombocyte engraftment duration was statistically shorter (12 days) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who received TBI-based conditioning when compared to ALL patients who received non-TBI-based conditioning (14 days; p=0.037). On the other hand, no statistically significant difference was observed between acute leukemia patients who received TBI or non-TBI-based conditioning regarding neutrophil engraftment duration. CONCLUSION: We found that TBI had a favorable impact on thrombocyte engraftment (TE) rather than neutrophil engraftment (NE) in Allo-SCT in patients with acute leukemia. TBI might have an impact on the engraftment of thrombocytes as per than neutrophils may be attributed to immune mechanisms and microenvironment in the patient's bone marrow (BM).","['Copyright (c) 2021, Uncu Ulu et al.']","['Uncu Ulu, Bahar', 'Yigenoglu, Tugce Nur', 'Sahin, Derya', 'Basci, Semih', 'Iskender, Dicle', 'Adas, Yasemin', 'Atasever Akkas, Ebru', 'Hacibekiroglu, Tuba', 'Kizil Cakar, Merih', 'Dal, Mehmet Sinan', 'Altuntas, Fevzi']","['Uncu Ulu B', 'Yigenoglu TN', 'Sahin D', 'Basci S', 'Iskender D', 'Adas Y', 'Atasever Akkas E', 'Hacibekiroglu T', 'Kizil Cakar M', 'Dal MS', 'Altuntas F']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, TUR.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, TUR.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, TUR.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, TUR.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, TUR.', 'Radiation Oncology, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, TUR.', 'Radiation Oncology, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, TUR.', 'Hematology, Sakarya University Hospital, Sakarya, TUR.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, TUR.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, TUR.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, TUR.', 'Department of Hematology, Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University, School of Medicine, Ankara, TUR.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211111,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'neutrophil engraftment', 'thrombocyte engraftment', 'total body irradiation']",2021/12/17 06:00,2021/12/17 06:01,['2021/12/16 06:34'],"['2021/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/16 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.19462 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Nov 11;13(11):e19462. doi: 10.7759/cureus.19462. eCollection 2021 Nov.,13,11,e19462,,,,PMC8665628,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report two cases of CML presenting with isolated visual symptoms. CASE SERIES: The first case is a 21-year-old healthy gentleman who presented with left eye painless loss of vision for a one-week duration. Visual acuity was 6/60 in the left eye and 6/6 in the right eye. There were scattered retinal haemorrhages in both eyes and a sub-macular bleed over the left eye. The full blood count revealed a high white cell count of 134.6 x 10(9)/L. Peripheral blood smear showed hyper-leucocytosis with absolute eosinophilia and basophilia and the presence of blasts suggestive of CML thus chemotherapy was commenced. The second case is a 28-year-old in haematological, molecular, and cytogenic remission from CML for the past two years, presented with left eye painless vision loss for five days duration. Vision in the left eye was counting fingers. There was a large subretinal mass involving the left optic disc. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit showed an elliptical orbital mass at the left globe posteriorly with diffuse thickening of the optic nerve. The patient was diagnosed as CML relapsed to the left optic nerve. He underwent intrathecal chemotherapy and orbital irradiation. CONCLUSION: Both these cases are unique since the manifestation of CML was with only ocular features at the time of presentation as per in the first case during the initial diagnosis and in the second case during relapse. This highlights that it is evident that the knowledge of ocular involvement in leukaemia is crucial since the eye is the only organ where leukemic infiltration to nerves and blood vessels can be observed directly. Recognizing fundus changes in leukaemia allows earlier diagnosis and prompt treatment. These case reports highlight the importance of recognizing early fundus changes, which should allow earlier diagnosis and treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Maniam et al.']","['Maniam, Anita', 'Zuhaimy, Hanis', 'Vendargon, Francesca Martina M', 'Othman, Othmaliza']","['Maniam A', 'Zuhaimy H', 'Vendargon FMM', 'Othman O']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, MYS.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru, MYS.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru, MYS.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru, MYS.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, MYS.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20211110,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml)', 'irradiation', 'orbital mass', 'retinal haemorrhage']",2021/12/17 06:00,2021/12/17 06:01,['2021/12/16 06:34'],"['2021/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/16 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.19450 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Nov 10;13(11):e19450. doi: 10.7759/cureus.19450. eCollection 2021 Nov.,13,11,e19450,,,,PMC8664615,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Btk and related kinases (like Tec) are expressed in non-leukemic hematopoietic cells and can be targeted by ibrutinib. In platelets, ibrutinib therapy is associated with bleeding complications mostly due to off-target effects. But the ability of platelets to respond to bacteria in CLL, and the potential impact of ibrutinib on platelet innate immune functions remain unknown. FcgammaRIIA is a tyrosine kinase-dependent receptor critical for platelet activation in response to IgG-coated pathogens. Crosslinking of this receptor with monoclonal antibodies causes downstream activation of Btk and Tec in platelets, however, this has not been investigated in response to bacteria. We asked whether ibrutinib impacts on FcgammaRIIA-mediated activation of platelets derived from CLL patients and healthy donors after exposure to Staphylococcus aureus Newman and Escherichia coli RS218. Platelet aggregation, alpha-granule secretion and integrin alphaIIbbeta3-dependent scavenging of bacteria were detected in CLL platelets but impaired in platelets from ibrutinib-treated patients and in healthy donor-derived platelets exposed to ibrutinib in vitro. While levels of surface FcgammaRIIA remained unaffected, CLL platelets had reduced expression of integrin alphaIIbbeta3 and GPVI compared to controls regardless of therapy. In respect of intracellular signaling, bacteria induced Btk and Tec phosphorylation in both CLL and control platelets that was inhibited by ibrutinib. To address if Btk is essential for platelet activation in response to bacteria, platelets derived from X-linked agammaglobulinemia patients (lacking functional Btk) were exposed to S. aureus Newman and E. coli RS218, and FcgammaRIIA-dependent aggregation was observed. Our data suggest that ibrutinib impairment of FcgammaRIIA-mediated platelet activation by bacteria results from a combination of Btk and Tec inhibition, although off-target effects on additional kinases cannot be discarded. This is potentially relevant to control infection-risk in CLL patients and, thus, future studies should carefully evaluate the effects of CLL therapies, including Btk inhibitors with higher specificity for Btk, on platelet-mediated immune functions.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Naylor-Adamson, Chacko, Booth, Caserta, Jarvis, Khan, Hart,', 'Rivero, Allsup and Arman.']","['Naylor-Adamson, Leigh', 'Chacko, Anisha R', 'Booth, Zoe', 'Caserta, Stefano', 'Jarvis, Jenna', 'Khan, Sujoy', 'Hart, Simon P', 'Rivero, Francisco', 'Allsup, David J', 'Arman, Monica']","['Naylor-Adamson L', 'Chacko AR', 'Booth Z', 'Caserta S', 'Jarvis J', 'Khan S', 'Hart SP', 'Rivero F', 'Allsup DJ', 'Arman M']","['Centre for Atherothrombosis and Metabolic Disease, Hull York Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Atherothrombosis and Metabolic Disease, Hull York Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Atherothrombosis and Metabolic Disease, Hull York Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Immunology & Allergy, Queens Centre, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Cottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Respiratory Research Group, Hull York Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Atherothrombosis and Metabolic Disease, Hull York Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Atherothrombosis and Metabolic Disease, Hull York Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Queens Centre for Oncology and Haematology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Cottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Atherothrombosis and Metabolic Disease, Hull York Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211129,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"[""Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor"", 'Escherichia coli', 'FcgammaRIIA', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'ibrutinib', 'platelet']",2021/12/17 06:00,2021/12/17 06:00,['2021/12/16 06:31'],"['2021/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/16 06:31 [entrez]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.766272 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Nov 29;12:766272. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.766272. eCollection 2021.,12,,766272,,,,PMC8667317,,"['DA has received honoraria for speaking from Gilead Pharmaceuticals, funding for', 'conference attendance from Bayer and CSL Behring and research funding from Roche.', 'The remaining authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of', 'any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to systematically analyse the outcomes of patients with haematological malignancies who received vaccination and to identify specific groups with differences in outcomes. The primary end point was antibody response after full vaccination (two doses of mRNA or one dose of vector-based vaccines). We identified 49 studies comprising 11086 individuals. Overall risk of bias was low. The pooled response for haematological malignancies was 64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59-69; I(2)=93%) vs 96% (95% CI, 92-97; I(2)=44%) for solid cancer and 98% (95% CI, 96-99; I(2)=55%) for healthy controls (P<0.001). Outcome was different across haematological malignancies (P<0.001). The pooled response was 50% (95% CI, 43-57; I(2)=84%) for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 76% (95% CI, 67-83; I(2)=92%) for multiple myeloma, 83% (95% CI, 69-91; I(2)=85%) for myeloproliferative neoplasms, 91% (95% CI, 82-96; I(2)=12%) for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 58% (95% CI, 44-70; I(2)=84%) for aggressive and 61% (95% CI, 48-72; I(2)=85%) for indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The pooled response for allogeneic and autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation was 82% and 83%, respectively. Being in remission and prior COVID-19 showed significantly higher responses. Low pooled response was identified for active treatment (35%), anti-CD20 therapy </=1 year (15%), Bruton kinase inhibition (23%), venetoclax (26%), ruxolitinib (42%), and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (42%).

Interactions between clones can affect tumour evolution and hence disease progression and treatment outcome. Intra-tumoural pairs of mutations that are overrepresented in a co-occurring or clonally exclusive fashion over a cohort of patient samples may be suggestive of a synergistic effect between the different clones carrying these mutations. We therefore developed a novel statistical testing framework, called GeneAccord, to identify such gene pairs that are altered in distinct subclones of the same tumour. We analysed our framework for calibration and power. By comparing its performance to baseline methods, we demonstrate that to control type I errors, it is essential to account for the evolutionary dependencies among clones. In applying GeneAccord to the single-cell sequencing of a cohort of 123 acute myeloid leukaemia patients, we find 1 clonally co-occurring and 8 clonally exclusive gene pairs.

Machine learning (ML) represents the application of computational inference from advanced statistical methods that can be applied to increasing amount of data available for study in pediatric oncology. The goal of this systematic review was to systematically characterize the state of ML in pediatric oncology and highlight advances and opportunities in the field. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the Embase, Scopus, and MEDLINE databases for applications of ML in pediatric oncology. Query results from all three databases were aggregated and duplicate studies were removed. RESULTS: A total of 42 unique articles that examined the applications of ML in pediatric oncology met inclusion criteria for review. We identified 20 studies of CNS tumors, 13 of solid tumors, and nine of leukemia. ML tasks included classification, prediction of treatment response, and dose optimization with a variety of methods being used including neural network, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, naive Bayes, and support vector machines. Strengths of the identified studies included matching or outperforming physician comparators via automated analysis and predicting therapeutic response. Common limitations included significant heterogeneity in reporting standards, clinical applicability, small sample sizes, and missing external validation cohorts. CONCLUSION: We identified areas where ML can enhance clinical care in ways that may not otherwise be achievable. Although ML promises enormous potential in improving diagnostics, decision making, and monitoring for children with cancer, the field remains in early stages and future work will be aided by standards and guidelines to ensure rigorous methodologic design and maximizing clinical utility.",,"['Ramesh, Siddhi', 'Chokkara, Sukarn', 'Shen, Timothy', 'Major, Ajay', 'Volchenboum, Samuel L', 'Mayampurath, Anoop', 'Applebaum, Mark A']","['Ramesh S', 'Chokkara S', 'Shen T', 'Major A', 'Volchenboum SL', 'Mayampurath A', 'Applebaum MA']","['Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JCO Clin Cancer Inform,JCO clinical cancer informatics,101708809,IM,,,2021/12/16 06:00,2021/12/16 06:00,['2021/12/15 17:14'],"['2021/12/15 17:14 [entrez]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/CCI.21.00102 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Clin Cancer Inform. 2021 Dec;5:1208-1219. doi: 10.1200/CCI.21.00102.,5,,1208-1219,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1543-2239', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2442-0101', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7261-1335', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9863-851X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3010-6960', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9766-8477']",['K08 CA226237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Samuel L.

Herein, we explored the outcomes of patients treated with venetoclax and azacitidine who achieved composite complete remission (CRc; complete remission + complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) and MRD < 10(-3) in the VIALE-A trial. METHODS: The patients included in this report were treated with venetoclax and azacitidine. Bone marrow aspirate samples for multiparametric flow cytometry assessments were collected for central analysis at baseline, end of cycle 1, and every three cycles thereafter. MRD-negative response was defined as < 1 residual blast per 1,000 leukocytes (< 10(-3) or 0.1%) with an estimated analytic sensitivity of 0.0037%-0.0027%. CRc, duration of remission (DoR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. A multivariate Cox regression analysis identified prognostic factors associated with OS. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four of one hundred ninety (86%) patients with CRc were evaluable for MRD. MRD < 10(-3) was achieved by 67 of 164 (41%), and 97 of 164 (59%) had MRD >/= 10(-3). The median DoR, EFS, and OS were not reached in patients with CRc and MRD < 10(-3), and the 12-month estimates for DoR, EFS, and OS in this group were 81.2%, 83.2%, and 94.0%. Among patients with CRc and MRD >/= 10(-3), the median DoR, EFS, and OS were 9.7, 10.6, and 18.7 months. Multivariate analysis showed that CRc with MRD < 10(-3) was a strong predictor of OS (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.285; 95% CI, 0.159 to 0.510; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients who achieved CRc and MRD < 10(-3) with venetoclax and azacitidine had longer DoR, EFS, and OS, than responding patients with MRD >/= 10(-3).",,"['Pratz, Keith W', 'Jonas, Brian A', 'Pullarkat, Vinod', 'Recher, Christian', 'Schuh, Andre C', 'Thirman, Michael J', 'Garcia, Jacqueline S', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Vorobyev, Vladimir', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola S', 'Yeh, Su-Peng', 'Jang, Jun Ho', 'Ozcan, Muhit', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhito', 'Illes, Arpad', 'Zhou, Ying', 'Dail, Monique', 'Chyla, Brenda', 'Potluri, Jalaja', 'Dohner, Hartmut']","['Pratz KW', 'Jonas BA', 'Pullarkat V', 'Recher C', 'Schuh AC', 'Thirman MJ', 'Garcia JS', 'DiNardo CD', 'Vorobyev V', 'Fracchiolla NS', 'Yeh SP', 'Jang JH', 'Ozcan M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Illes A', 'Zhou Y', 'Dail M', 'Chyla B', 'Potluri J', 'Dohner H']","['Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Universite de Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematology, S.

All three diseases have the risk of transforming into acute leukemia. Oxidative stress and some genetic mutations increase the risk of leukemic transformation. The median age in patients with ET, PV, and MF is around 64 years, and it is expected to exceed 65 in the coming years. Since oxidative stress increases with age, we aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress parameters in older patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. METHODS: The study included a total of 160 patients (57 patients with Essential Thrombocytosis, 52 patients with Primary Myelofibrosis, and 51 patients with Polycythemia Vera) and 56 healthy controls, aged 65 and over. Ischemia Modified Albumin (IMA) and thiol parameters (native thiol, total thiol, and disulfide) were studied from serum samples taken at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 69 (65 - 85) years. Patients had higher levels of IMA and lower levels of thiol compared to the control group (p < 0.001). When evaluated according to disease subgroups, it was observed that the highest IMA levels and the lowest thiol levels were in patients with PM (p < 0.001). Higher IMA levels and lower native thiol levels were found in patients with the ASXL1 mutation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Serum IMA and thiol levels are also significantly changed in older patients with BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasia. Changes in these markers are independent of age. Disease-associated mutations such as ASXL1 can also affect the serum levels of these markers.",,"['Koyuncu, Mahmut B', 'Cavusoglu, Cagatay', 'Basir, Hakan', 'Ilgan, Mustafa', 'Ucar, Mehmet A', 'Akdeniz, Aydan', 'Tombak, Anil', 'Tiftik, Eyup N', 'Temel, Gulhan O', 'Neselioglu, Salim', 'Erel, Ozcan']","['Koyuncu MB', 'Cavusoglu C', 'Basir H', 'Ilgan M', 'Ucar MA', 'Akdeniz A', 'Tombak A', 'Tiftik EN', 'Temel GO', 'Neselioglu S', 'Erel O']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,IM,,,2021/12/16 06:00,2021/12/18 06:00,['2021/12/15 14:45'],"['2021/12/15 14:45 [entrez]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2021.210324 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2021 Dec 1;67(12). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2021.210324.,67,12,,,,,,,,,,,,20211217,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)']","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Disulfides', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Middle Aged', '*Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/genetics', 'Serum Albumin', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though ATO could effectively induce remissions of leukaemia cells, the drug resistance was observed occasionally. To further dissect the mechanism of ATO resistance, we selected the ATO-resistant SH-SY5Y cells and found that Bcl-2 controlled the sensitivity of ATO in SH-SY5Y cells. We report that necroptosis, autophagy, NF-KB and MAPK signalling pathway are not involved in ATO-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the ATO-resistant cells showed distinct mitochondrial morphology compared with that of ATO-sensitive cells. Intriguingly, nude mice-bearing ATO-sensitive cells derived xenograft tumours are more sensitive to ATO treatment compared with that of ATO-resistant cells. These data demonstrate that cancer cells can acquire the ATO-resistance ability by increasing the Bcl-2 expression.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Aqueous extract of this species has not been investigated on the liquid malignancies and solid tumors with a high incidence of treatment refractoriness and poor survival outcomes such as glioblastoma and leukemia. Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic efficiency of I. graveolens aqueous extracts on human glioblastoma multiforme and chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines in comparison to non-cancerous primary rat cerebral cortex and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. METHODS: The cells were treated with the extracts of I. graveolens (125-1000 mug/mL) for 48 h, the cellular viability was identified using 3'-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, and lactate dehydrogenase release was measured to determine the cytotoxic potential. Total oxidant status and apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1 assays were used to determine the oxidative status of cells and DNA damage, respectively. RESULTS: I. graveolens showed selective cytotoxicity toward human glioblastoma multiforme and chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines and exhibited a higher antiproliferative effect against cancer cells in comparison to non-cancerous cells. Moreover, it significantly reduced the apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1 levels on both cancer cell lines as compared with their control cells without changing the levels of an oxidative stress marker.

Second, the rise of a chronic lymphoid leukemia clone in COVID-19 was not mentioned by the authors. Third, achieving a complete remission in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients with follicular lymphoma in partial remission after bendamustine-based therapy is not specific to this lymphoma subtype.

HTLV-1 alters cellular differentiation, activation, and survival; however, it is unknown whether and how these changes contribute to the malignant transformation of infected cells. In this study, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing and T cell receptor-sequencing to investigate the differentiation and HTLV-1-mediated transformation of T cells. We analyzed 87,742 PBMCs from 12 infected and 3 uninfected individuals. Using multiple independent bioinformatics methods, we demonstrated the seamless transition of naive T cells into activated T cells, whereby HTLV-1-infected cells in an activated state further transformed into ATL cells, which are characterized as clonally expanded, highly activated T cells. Notably, the greater the activation state of ATL cells, the more they acquire Treg signatures. Intriguingly, the expression of HLA class II genes in HTLV-1-infected cells was uniquely induced by the viral protein Tax and further upregulated in ATL cells. Functional assays revealed that HTLV-1-infected cells upregulated HLA class II molecules and acted as tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells to induce anergy of antigen-specific T cells.

Despite great progress in the treatment of patients with chronic CML, advanced CML patients are still unable to obtain effective and safe drugs. Momordica cochinchinensis seed is the dried ripe seed of Momordica cochinchinensis, which is a kind of fruit and consumed for dietary as well as medicinal uses. This study aimed to investigate the anticancer activity of Momordica cochinchinensis seed extract (MCSE) in CML cells. CML cells (KBM5 and KBM5-T315I) were treated with MCSE and analyzed for growth, apoptosis, and signal transduction. Nude mouse xenograft model was used to evaluate the antitumor activity of MCSE In Vivo. MCSE significantly reduced the cell viability of CML cells, triggered G0/G1 phase arrest in KBM5 cells and S phase arrest in KBM5-T315I cells. Concurrently, MCSE caused the activation of caspase-3, -8, -9, PARP and the degradation of Mcl-1, ultimately triggering endogenous and exogenous cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, MCSE downregulated Bcr-Abl levels and its downstream signaling pathways. Additionally, MCSE inhibited the growth of CML cells in nude mouse xenografts. Taken together, this study demonstrated the anticancer mechanism of MCSE, namely blocking Bcr-Abl and downregulating Mcl-1, and finally induced apoptosis of CML cells.",,"['Ai, Zhengdong', 'Ma, Chong', 'Wan, Ruiming', 'Yin, Jingyi', 'Li, Guiming', 'Li, Yan', 'Chen, Li']","['Ai Z', 'Ma C', 'Wan R', 'Yin J', 'Li G', 'Li Y', 'Chen L']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China.', ""Department of Geriatrics, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China.', ""Department of Geriatrics, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China."", 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211215,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,IM,,,2021/12/16 06:00,2021/12/16 06:00,['2021/12/15 08:44'],"['2021/12/15 08:44 [entrez]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2021.2014904 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Nutr Cancer. 2021 Dec 15:1-13. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2021.2014904.,,,1-13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that MSC-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) are able to induce the repair of tissue damage and regulate the immune system. However, their role in cancer development is still unclear. Reports have suggested that whether MSC-EVs have an inhibitory or promoting effect on cancer is dependent on the type of cancer. In this study, the role of MSC-EVs in the regulation of leukemic cell growth in vitro was investigated. The EVs were collected from conditioned media of MSCs by ultrafiltration using a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) filter. The isolated MSC-EVs were comprised of microvesicles and exosomes, as examined by the size of vesicles and exosomal proteins, CD81 and flotillin-1. Cell proliferation, cell cycle status, apoptosis, and gene expression were examined in the leukemic cell lines NB4 and K562 after treatment with MSC-EVs. Suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis was observed. Gene expression analysis revealed differential expression of apoptotic-related genes in NB4 and K562. MSC-EVs increased the expression of BID and BAX and decreased expression of BCL2, indicating the induction of intrinsic apoptosis in NB4. In contrast, MSC-EVs increased the expression of the death receptor gene TRAILR2 and cell cycle regulator genes P21 and CCNE2 in K562. In conclusion, MSC-EVs partially induce leukemic cell apoptosis, and thus may have potential for the development of supportive therapies for leukemia.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Of the remaining 70% of non-hotspot mutants, many are partial loss-of-function (partial-LOF) mutants with residual transcriptional activity. The therapeutic consequences of a partial-LOF have remained largely elusive. Using a p53 mutation engineered to reduce DNA binding, we demonstrate that partial-LOF is sufficient to enhance oncogene-driven tumorigenesis in mouse models of lung and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia. Interestingly, mouse and human tumors with partial-LOF mutations showed mutant p53 protein accumulation similar as known for hotspot mutants. Different from the chemotherapy resistance caused by p53-loss, the partial-LOF mutant sensitized to an apoptotic chemotherapy response and led to a survival benefit. Mechanistically, the pro-apoptotic transcriptional activity of mouse and human partial-LOF mutants was rescued at high mutant protein levels, suggesting that accumulation of partial-LOF mutants enables the observed apoptotic chemotherapy response. p53 non-hotspot mutants with partial-LOF, therefore, represent tumorigenic p53 mutations that need to be distinguished from other mutations because of their beneficial impact on survival in a therapy context.",['(c) 2021.

In the last decade, internationally approved AML treatment guidelines, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are widely used in Kazakhstan. The categorization of acute myeloid leukemia was done according to the French-American British classification. The prognosis of patients at the time of diagnosis was determined by cytogenetic tests following the guidelines of the European LeukemiaNet. The overall survival and event-free survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and hazard ratios were defined with Cox regression. In total, 398 patients with AML were treated in the National Research Oncology Center between 2010 and 2020. The mean age was 38.3 years. We found a correlation between ethnicity, cytogenetic group, white blood cell count, and treatment approaches with overall and event-free survival. There was a significantly longer OS in a cytogenetic group with a good prognosis compared with intermediate and poor prognosis. The median survival time in the group with a good prognosis was 43 months, 23 months in the intermediate group (p = 0.7), and 12 months in the poor prognosis group (p = 0.016). There was a significantly longer OS for the group of patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 52 months versus 10 months in the group who received chemotherapy only, p-value < 0.0001. Prognostic factors, such as cytogenetic group, initial WBC count, and treatment approaches are significantly associated with patient survival.

Whether acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-related IL7R gain-of-function mutations can trigger leukemogenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that lymphoid-restricted mutant IL7R, expressed at physiological levels in conditional knock-in mice, establishes a pre-leukemic stage in which B-cell precursors display self-renewal ability, initiating leukemia resembling PAX5 P80R or Ph-like human B-ALL. Full transformation associates with transcriptional upregulation of oncogenes such as Myc or Bcl2, downregulation of tumor suppressors such as Ikzf1 or Arid2, and major IL-7R signaling upregulation (involving JAK/STAT5 and PI3K/mTOR), required for leukemia cell viability. Accordingly, maximal signaling drives full penetrance and early leukemia onset in homozygous IL7R mutant animals. Notably, we identify 2 transcriptional subgroups in mouse and human Ph-like ALL, and show that dactolisib and sphingosine-kinase inhibitors are potential treatment avenues for IL-7R-related cases. Our model, a resource to explore the pathophysiology and therapeutic vulnerabilities of B-ALL, demonstrates that IL7R can initiate this malignancy.",['(c) 2021.

To systematically study the consequences of distinct metabolic perturbations, we assemble a comprehensive metabolic drug library (CeMM Library of Metabolic Drugs; CLIMET) covering 243 compounds. We, next, characterize it phenotypically in a diverse panel of myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary patient cells. Analysis of the drug response profiles reveals that 77 drugs affect cell viability, with the top effective compounds targeting nucleic acid synthesis, oxidative stress, and the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Clustering of individual drug response profiles stratifies the cell lines into five functional groups, which link to specific molecular and metabolic features. Mechanistic characterization of selective responses to the PI3K inhibitor pictilisib, the fatty acid synthase inhibitor GSK2194069, and the SLC16A1 inhibitor AZD3965, bring forth biomarkers of drug response.

Methods We estimated the ERC for benzene and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), by fitting linear and spline-based Bayesian meta-regression models that included summary risk estimates from non-AML and non-human studies as prior information. Our complete dataset included six human AML studies, three human leukemia studies, ten human biomarker studies, and four experimental animal studies. Results A linear meta-regression model with intercept best predicted AML risks after cross-validation, both for the full dataset and AML studies only. Risk estimates in the low exposure range (<40 ppm yrs) from this model were comparable, but more precise, when the ERC was derived using all available data than when using AML data only. Allowing for between-study heterogeneity, RRs and 95% prediction intervals [95%PI] at 5 ppm years were 1.58 [1.01, 3.22]) and 1.44 [0.85, 3.42], respectively. Conclusions Integrating the available epidemiological, biomarker, and animal data resulted in more precise risk estimates for benzene exposure and AML, although the large between-study heterogeneity hampers interpretation of these results. The harmonization steps required to fit the Bayesian meta-regression model involve a range of assumptions that need to be critically evaluated, as they seem crucial for successful implementation. Impact By describing a framework for data-integration and explicitly describing the necessary data harmonization steps, we hope to enable risk assessors to better understand the advantages and assumptions underlying a data integration approach.","['Copyright (c)2021, American Association for Cancer Research.']","['Scholten, Bernice', 'Portengen, Lutzen', 'Pronk, Anjoeka', 'Stierum, Rob', 'Downward, George S', 'Vlaanderen, Jelle', 'Vermeulen, Roel']","['Scholten B', 'Portengen L', 'Pronk A', 'Stierum R', 'Downward GS', 'Vlaanderen J', 'Vermeulen R']","['RAPID, Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research bernice.schaddelee@tno.nl.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University.', 'RAPID, Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research.', 'RAPID, Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211214,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,,,2021/12/16 06:00,2021/12/16 06:00,['2021/12/15 06:34'],"['2021/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/15 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-21-0287 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0287 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2021 Dec 14. pii: 1055-9965.EPI-21-0287. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0287.,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1537-1843', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4082-8163']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, a BCL10 homologue was identified from Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (designed as CgBCL10). The full length cDNA of CgBCL10 was of 897 bp with an open reading frame of 522 bp encoding a polypeptide of 174 amino acids containing a classical CARD domain. The deduced amino acid sequence of CgBCL10 shared low similarity with the previously identified BCL10s from other species. In the phylogenetic tree, CgBCL10 was firstly clustered with CvBCL10 from Crassostrea virginica and then assigned into the branch of invertebrate BCL10s. The mRNA transcripts of CgBCL10 were highly expressed in gonad, gill, adductor muscle, and haemocytes. After Vibrio splendidus stimulation, the mRNA expression level of CgBCL10 in haemocytes increased significantly (p < 0.01) at 24, 72 and 96 h. In CgBCL10-RNAi oysters, the phosphorylation level of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB/Rel and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in haemocytes were inhibited, and the mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines including CgIL17-1, CgIL17-2, CgIL17-3, CgIL17-6 and CgTNF all decreased significantly (p < 0.01) at 12 h after V. splendidus stimulation. These results suggested that CgBCL10 regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines by activating MAPK kinase, and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB/Rel and AP-1 to defense pathogen.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Mutations in BCR-ABL1 are well studied but fail to explain 20-40% of resistant cases, suggesting the activation of alternative, BCR-ABL1-independent pathways. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Gamma (PTPRG), a tumor suppressor, was found to be well expressed in CML patients responsive to TKIs and remained at low level in resistant patients. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic variants in PTPRG that could potentially modulate TKIs response in CML patients. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples collected from two CML cohorts (Qatar and Italy) and targeted exome sequencing was performed. Among 31 CML patients, six were TKI-responders and 25 were TKI-non-responsive. Sequencing identified ten variants, seven were annotated and three were novel SNPs (c.1602_1603insC, c.85+14412delC, and c.2289-129delA). Among them, five variants were identified in 15 resistant cases. Of these, one novel exon variant (c.1602_1603insC), c.841-29C>T (rs199917960) and c.1378-224A>G (rs2063204) were found to be significantly different between the resistant cases compared to responders. Our findings suggest that PTPRG variants may act as an indirect resistance mechanism of BCR-ABL1 to affect TKI treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Long-term survival depends on reaching a second chronic phase, followed by allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). We investigated whether the novel combination of the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor ponatinib with fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and idarubicin (FLAG-IDA) could improve response and optimise allogeneic HSCT outcomes in patients with blast-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia. The aim was to identify a dose of ponatinib, which combined with FLAG-IDA, showed clinically meaningful activity and tolerability. METHODS: MATCHPOINT was a seamless, phase 1/2, multicentre trial done in eight UK Trials Acceleration Programme-funded centres. Eligible participants were adults (aged >/=16 years) with Philadelphia chromosome-positive or BCR-ABL1-positive blast-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia, suitable for intensive chemotherapy. Participants received up to two cycles of ponatinib with FLAG-IDA. Experimental doses of oral ponatinib (given from day 1 to day 28 of FLAG-IDA) were between 15 mg alternate days and 45 mg once daily and the starting dose was 30 mg once daily. Intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) for 5 days), cytarabine (2 g/m(2) for 5 days), and idarubicin (8 mg/m(2) for 3 days), and subcutaneous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (if used), were delivered according to local protocols. We used an innovative EffTox design to investigate the activity and tolerability of ponatinib-FLAG-IDA; the primary endpoints were the optimal ponatinib dose meeting prespecified thresholds of activity (inducement of second chronic phase defined as either haematological or minor cytogenetic response) and tolerability (dose-limiting toxicties). Analyses were planned on an intention-to-treat basis. MATCHPOINT was registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, ISRCTN98986889, and has completed recruitment; the final results are presented. FINDINGS: Between March 19, 2015, and April 26, 2018, 17 patients (12 men, five women) were recruited, 16 of whom were evaluable for the coprimary outcomes. Median follow-up was 41 months (IQR 36-48). The EffTox model simultaneously considered clinical responses and dose-limiting toxicities, and determined the optimal ponatinib dose as 30 mg daily, combined with FLAG-IDA. 11 (69%) of 16 patients were in the second chronic phase after one cycle of treatment. Four (25%) patients had a dose-limiting toxicity (comprising cardiomyopathy and grade 4 increased alanine aminotransferase, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, grade 3 increased amylase, and grade 4 increased alanine aminotransferase), fulfilling the criteria for clinically relevant activity and toxicity. 12 (71%) of 17 patients proceeded to allogeneic HSCT. The most common grade 3-4 non-haematological adverse events were lung infection (n=4 [24%]), fever (n=3 [18%]), and hypocalcaemia (n=3 [18%]). There were 12 serious adverse events in 11 (65%) patients. Three (18%) patients died due to treatment-related events (due to cardiomyopathy, pulmonary haemorrhage, and bone marrow aplasia). INTERPRETATION: Ponatinib-FLAG-IDA can induce second chronic phase in patients with blast-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia, representing an active salvage therapy to bridge to allogeneic HSCT. The number of treatment-related deaths is not in excess of what would be expected in this very high-risk group of patients receiving intensive chemotherapy. The efficient EffTox method is a model for investigating novel therapies in ultra-orphan cancers. FUNDING: Blood Cancer UK and Incyte.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a member of the DNA damage repair complex, has a strong antitumor effect in solid tumors. However, the role of PARP in AML remains unclear. We found that high levels of PARP1 and PARP2 were positively related to chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis in patients with AML. Doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant AML cells highly expressed PAPR1 and PARP2. Knockdown of PARP1 and PARP2, or pharmaceutical inhibition of PARP by the PARP inhibitor (PARPi) BGB-290, significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of DOX in AML cells due to increased DNA damage. PLGA-loading BGB-290 was properly self-assembled into stable BGB-290@PLGA nanoparticles (NPs), which is uniform particle size and good stability. BGB-290@PLGA is easily uptake by AML cell lines and stays for a long time. Combined with DOX, BGB-290@PLGA can significantly improve the chemosensitivity of AML cell lines. Furthermore, BGB-290 and DOX combination treatment dramatically repressed the onset of leukemia and prolonged the survival of THP-1 xenografted mice. Overall, this study demonstrated that PARPi with traditional chemotherapy could be an efficient therapeutic strategy for AML.",,"['Xu, Xi', 'Wang, Jian', 'Tong, Tong', 'Lin, Shao-Fen', 'Liu, Congmin', 'Zhou, Dunhua']","['Xu X', 'Wang J', 'Tong T', 'Lin SF', 'Liu C', 'Zhou D']","['RNA Biomedical Institute, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510120, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510120, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Sensing Technology and Biomedical Instrument of Guangdong Province, School of Biomedical Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510006, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510120, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Qingdao Municipal Hospital, Qingdao, 260000, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510120, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Biomed Nanotechnol,Journal of biomedical nanotechnology,101230869,IM,,,2021/12/16 06:00,2021/12/17 06:00,['2021/12/15 05:51'],"['2021/12/15 05:51 [entrez]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1166/jbn.2021.3182 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Nanotechnol. 2021 Nov 1;17(11):2165-2175. doi: 10.1166/jbn.2021.3182.,17,11,2165-2175,,,,,,,,,,,20211216,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorenes)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '8375F9S90C (pamiparib)']","['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fluorenes/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCLL is driven by the constitutive activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) as a result of chromosome translocations with poor outcome. Mouse models have been developed which faithfully recapitulate the human disease and have been used to characterize the molecular genetic events that are associated with development and progression of the disease. METHODS: CRISPR/Cas9 approaches were used to generate SCLL cells null for Interleukin receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and interferon gamma (IFNG) which were introduced into syngeneic hosts through tail vein injection. Development of the disease and changes in immune cell composition and activity were monitored using flow cytometry. Bead-based immunoassays were used to compare the cytokine and chemokine profiles of control and knock out (KO) cells. Antibody mediated, targeted depletion of T cell and MDSCs were performed to evaluate their role in antitumor immune responses. RESULTS: In SCLL, FGFR1 activation silences miR-146b-5p through DNMT1-mediated promoter methylation, which derepresses the downstream target IRAK1. IRAK1 KO SCLL cells were xenografted into immunocompetent syngeneic mice where the typical rapid progression of disease was lost and the mice remained disease free. IRAK1 in this system has no effect on cell cycle progression or apoptosis and robust growth of the KO cells in immunodeficient mice suggested an effect on immune surveillance. Depletion of T-cells in immunocompetent mice restored leukemogenesis of the KO cells, and tumor killing assays confirmed the role of T cells in tumor clearance. Analysis of the immune cell profile in mice transplanted with the IRAK1 expressing mock control (MC) cells shows that there is an increase in levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) with a concomitant decrease in CD4+/CD8+ T-cell levels. MDSC suppression assays and depletion experiments showed that these MDSCs were responsible for suppression of the T cell mediated leukemia cell elimination. Immuno-profiling of a panel of secreted cytokines and chemokines showed that activation of IFN-gamma is specifically impaired in the KO cells. In vitro and in vivo expression assays and engraftment with interferon gamma receptor-1 (IFNGR1) null mice and IFNG KO SCLL cells, showed the leukemia cells produced IFN-gamma directly participating in the induction of MDSCs to establish immune evasion. Inhibition of IRAK1 using pacritinib suppresses leukemogenesis with impaired induction of MDSCs and attenuated suppression of CD4+/CD8+ T-cells. CONCLUSIONS: IRAK1 orchestrates a previously unknown FGFR1-directed immune escape mechanism in SCLL, through induction of MDSCs via regulation of IFN-gamma signaling from leukemia cells, and targeting IRAK1 may provide a means of suppressing tumor growth in this syndrome by restoring immune surveillance.",['(c) 2021.

Ferroptosis is a recently discovered programmed cell death strongly correlated with cancers. Nevertheless, few related studies have reported its significance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: Herein, we collected clinical data of 80 Ph-neg B-ALL patients diagnosed in our center and performed RNA-seq with their initial bone marrow fluid samples. Throughout unsupervised machine learning K-means clustering with 24 ferroptosis related genes (FRGs), the clustered patients were parted into three variant risk groups and were performed with bioinformatics analysis. RESULTS: As a result, we discovered significant heterogeneity of both immune microenvironment and genomic variance. Furthermore, the immune check point inhibitors response and potential implementation of Sorafenib in Ph-neg B-ALL was also analyzed in our cohort.

Although intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) may harbour IDH1/2 mutations, the contribution of TET2 to carcinogenesis remains unknown. In the present study, the expression and promoter methylation of TET2 were investigated in iCCA. The expression of TET2 was assessed in 52 cases of iCCA (small-duct type, n = 33; large-duct type, n = 19) by quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and a sequencing-based methylation assay, and its relationships with clinicopathological features and alterations in cancer-related genes (e.g., KRAS and IDH1) were investigated. In contrast to non-neoplastic bile ducts, which were negative for TET2 on IHC, 42 cases (81%) of iCCA showed the nuclear overexpression of TET2. Based on IHC scores (area x intensity), these cases were classified as TET2-high (n = 25) and TET2-low (n = 27). The histological type, tumour size, lymph node metastasis and frequency of mutations in cancer-related genes did not significantly differ between the two groups. Overall and recurrence-free survival were significantly worse in patients with TET2-high iCCA than in those with TET2-low iCCA. A multivariate analysis identified the high expression of TET2 as an independent prognostic factor (HR = 2.94; p = 0.007). The degree of methylation at two promoter CpG sites was significantly less in TET2-high iCCA than in TET2-low iCCA or non-cancer tissue. In conclusion, in contrast to other IDH-related neoplasms, TET2 overexpression is common in iCCA of both subtypes, and its high expression, potentially induced by promoter hypomethylation, is an independent poor prognostic factor.",['(c) 2021.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study and analyzed data of 8,230 adult allo-HSCT recipients and 32,920 healthy individuals matched for age, sex, and the index date in a 1:4 ratio, using a nationwide database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service. Thereafter, we established four sub-studies to investigate the relative risks of metabolic disease development following allo-HSCT: hypertension (cohort A study), diabetes (cohort B study), dyslipidemia (cohort C study), and CVA (cohort D study). RESULTS: The 10-year cumulative incidence of metabolic disease in each experimental cohort was significantly higher than that in the control cohort (overall p-value <0.001 for all): cohort A study, 17.6% vs. 11.8%; cohort B study, 23.5% vs. 14.4%; cohort C study for dyslipidemia, 44.5% vs. 32.1%; and cohort D study for CVA, 4.2% vs. 3.2%. In comparison to the incidence of metabolic diseases in the general population, allo-HSCT recipients presented adjusted hazard ratios of 1.58 for hypertension, 2.06 for diabetes, 1.62 for dyslipidemia, and 1.45 for CVA. CONCLUSIONS: Recipients of allo-HSCT need to be rigorously monitored for the development of metabolic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and CVA, based on an enhanced lifelong healthcare policy including a robust screening program compared to the general population.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Recent analyses demonstrated that HIV-1, but not Moloney murine leukaemia (MuLV) or avain myeloblastosis (AMV) virus RTs has higher fidelity in low Mg(2+). In the current report, lacZalpha-based alpha-complementation assays were used to measure the fidelity of several RTs including HIV-1 (subtype B and A/E), several drug-resistant HIV-1 derivatives, HIV-2, and prototype foamy virus (PFV), all which showed higher fidelity using physiological Mg(2+), while MuLV and AMV RTs demonstrated equivalent fidelity in low and high Mg(2+). In 0.5 mM Mg(2+), all RTs demonstrated approximately equal fidelity, except for PFV which showed higher fidelity. A Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach that used barcoding to determine mutation profiles was used to examine the types of mutations made by HIV-1 RT (type B) in low (0.5 mM) and high (6 mM) Mg(2+) on a lacZalpha template. Unlike alpha-complementation assays which are dependent on LacZalpha activity, the NGS assay scores mutations at all positions and of every type. Consistent with alpha-complementation assays, a ~four-fold increase in mutations was observed in high Mg(2+). These findings help explain why HIV-1 RT displays lower fidelity in vitro (with high Mg(2+) concentrations) than other RTs (e.g. MuLV and AMV), yet cellular fidelity for these viruses is comparable. Establishing in vitro conditions that accurately represent RT's activity in cells is pivotal to determining the contribution of RT and other factors to the mutation profile observed with HIV-1.",,"['Wang, Ruofan', 'Belew, Ashton T', 'Achuthan, Vasudevan', 'El Sayed, Najib', 'DeStefano, Jeffrey J']","['Wang R', 'Belew AT', 'Achuthan V', 'El Sayed N', 'DeStefano JJ']","['Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, Bioscience Research Building, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.', 'Present address: Vigene Biosciences, Rockville Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, Bioscience Research Building, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, Bioscience Research Building, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.', 'Present address: CRISPR Therapeutics, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, Bioscience Research Building, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.', 'Maryland Pathogen Research Institute, College Park, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, Bioscience Research Building, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.', 'Maryland Pathogen Research Institute, College Park, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*fidelity', '*magnesium', '*mutation rate', '*retrovirus', '*reverse transcriptase']",2021/12/15 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/12/14 12:15'],"['2021/12/14 12:15 [entrez]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/jgv.0.001708 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2021 Dec;102(12). doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.001708.,102,12,,,,['R01 AI150480/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,20211222,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']","['DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Viral/genetics', 'Magnesium/analysis/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Rate', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/classification/enzymology/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators in immune systems. In this study, we established a prognostic model using an immune-related lncRNA (IRL) signature to predict AML patients' overall survival (OS) through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, univariate Cox regression, and multivariate Cox regression analyses further illustrated the reliability of our prognostic model. An IRL signature-based nomogram consisting of other clinical features efficiently predicted the OS of AML patients. The incorporation of the IRL signature improved the ELN2017 risk stratification system's prognostic accuracy. In addition, we found that monocytes and metabolism-related pathways may play a role in AML progression.

In this study, a new series of 12 arylidene hydrazone phenanthrotriazine derivatives were designed, synthesized, and tested in-vitro for antiproliferative activity against three cancer cell lines including colorectal cancer (HT-29), breast cancer (MCF-7) and leukemia (MOLT-4) cells and also against Vero normal cells. The effect of derivatives on cell cycle and apoptosis induction were studied by flow cytometric propidium iodide/RNase assay and Hoechst 33258 staining, respectively, while docking analysis was used to investigate the interactions of synthesized derivatives with the c-Met receptor kinase domain. Some compounds showed considerable antiproliferative activity against tested cancer cells. The most potent derivative was 9k bearing pyrrole moiety with IC50 values of 14.3, 4.7 and 1.7 microM against HT-29, MCF-7 and MOLT-4 cells, respectively, while it showed negligible activity against Vero normal cells (IC50: 95.4 microM). Derivatives bearing 2-nitrophenyl (9g), 4-cyanophenyl (9j), pyrrole (9k), and thiophene (9l) moieties induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and also apoptosis at higher doses in MCF-7 cells. Docking study showed that the phenanthrotriazine backbone form H-bond interactions with Asn1209, while phenyl moieties of the pendants generate different hydrophobic interactions with the Asp1164 and Asp1231 residues of c-Met.

This study aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in dog and cat samples with the clinical presentation for respiratory or gastrointestinal disease in Brazil. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty-five samples were collected from 12 states of Brazil that originated from the gastrointestinal, upper respiratory tract, and other sites, including some pools of samples from before the onset of the pandemic including blood and/or urine samples. They were tested for RT-PCR detection of respiratory or gastrointestinal pathogens through Respiratory or Diarrhea RT-PCR Panels in the TECSA (Tecnologia em Saninade Animal - Animal Health Technology) Veterinary Medicine Laboratory. This work was conducted in compliance with ethical standards. Results: Seven different microorganisms that can cause respiratory and/or gastrointestinal clinical signs were detected in cats (Feline Coronavirus [FCoV], Feline Parvovirus, Feline Leukemia Virus, Feline Calicivirus, Mycoplasma felis, Campylobacter spp., and Cryptosporidium spp.) and three in dogs (canine distemper virus, Cryptosporidium spp., and Babesia spp.). Conclusion: Although the samples corresponded to the beginning of coronavirus disease-19 spread in Brazil and clinically correlated with the expected viral replication sites, none of the animals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; reassuringly, four cats tested positive or FCoV none of them were positive for SARS-CoV2. The epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in pets is considered a one health issue, important for monitoring the disease evolution, spread and minimizing the animal-human health impacts, and directing Public Health Policies.","['Copyright: (c) Carvalho, et al.']","['de Carvalho, Otavio Valerio', 'Ristow, Luiz Eduardo', 'Rodrigues, Davi Dos Santos', 'Farias, Claudia Kathariny da Silva', 'Maia, Rita de Cassia Carvalho']","['de Carvalho OV', 'Ristow LE', 'Rodrigues DDS', 'Farias CKDS', 'Maia RCC']","['TECSA Laboratories, Av. do Contorno, 6226 - Funcionarios, Belo Horizonte - MG, 30110-042, Brazil.', 'TECSA Laboratories, Av. do Contorno, 6226 - Funcionarios, Belo Horizonte - MG, 30110-042, Brazil.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, LAVIAN, Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, Dom Manoel de Medeiros Street, S/N, Recife-PE, 52171-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, LAVIAN, Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, Dom Manoel de Medeiros Street, S/N, Recife-PE, 52171-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, LAVIAN, Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, Dom Manoel de Medeiros Street, S/N, Recife-PE, 52171-900, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211028,India,Vet World,Veterinary world,101504872,,['NOTNLM'],"['companion animals', 'coronavirus disease-19', 'vigilance', 'virus']",2021/12/15 06:00,2021/12/15 06:01,['2021/12/14 08:22'],"['2021/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/14 08:22 [entrez]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.14202/vetworld.2021.2803-2808 [doi]', 'Vetworld-14-2803 [pii]']",ppublish,Vet World. 2021 Oct;14(10):2803-2808. doi: 10.14202/vetworld.2021.2803-2808.

In vitro studies implicated Grb2-associated binder 2 (GAB2) as FLT3-ITD effector. Utilizing a Flt3-ITD knock-in, Dnmt3a haploinsufficient mouse model, we demonstrate that Gab2 is essential for the development of Flt3-ITD driven AML in vivo, as Gab2 deficient mice displayed prolonged survival, presented with attenuated liver and spleen pathology and reduced blast counts. Furthermore, leukemic bone marrow from Gab2 deficient mice exhibited reduced colony-forming unit capacity and increased FLT3 inhibitor sensitivity. Using transcriptomics, we identify the genes encoding for Axl and the Ret co-receptor Gfra2 as targets of the Flt3-ITD/Gab2/Stat5 axis. We propose a pathomechanism in which Gab2 increases signaling of these receptors by inducing their expression and by serving as downstream effector.

Using a cohort of 2,829 patients, we identify features of clonality associated with clinical features and drug sensitivities. High variant allele frequency for 7 mutations (including NRAS and TET2) associate with dismal prognosis; elevated GATA2 variant allele frequency correlates with better outcomes. Clinical features such as white blood cell count and blast percentage correlate with the subclonal abundance of mutations such as TP53 and IDH1. Furthermore, patients with cohesin mutations occurring before NPM1, or transcription factor mutations occurring before splicing factor mutations, show shorter survival. Surprisingly, a branched pattern of clonal evolution is associated with superior clinical outcomes. Finally, several mutations (including NRAS and IDH1) predict drug sensitivity based on their subclonal abundance. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of assessing clonal heterogeneity with implications for prognosis and actionable biomarkers for therapy.",['(c) 2021.

Most NUP98 FOs harbor an intrinsically disordered region from NUP98 that is prone to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro. A predominant class of NUP98 FOs, including NUP98-HOXA9 (NHA9), retains a DNA-binding homeodomain, whereas others harbor other types of DNA- or chromatin-binding domains. NUP98 FOs have long been known to form puncta, but long-standing questions are how nuclear puncta form, and how they drive leukemogenesis. Here we studied NHA9 condensates and show that homotypic interactions and different types of heterotypic interactions are required to form nuclear puncta, which are associated with aberrant transcriptional activity and transformation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We also show that three additional leukemia-associated NUP98 FOs (NUP98-PRRX1, NUP98-KDM5A, NUP98-LNP1) form nuclear puncta and transform hematopoietic cells.

We found that AML cells exhibit an unusually rapid accumulation of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 on nascent DNA. In cell lines, primary cells and xenograft mouse models, inhibition of the H3K27 histone methyltransferase EZH2 to de-condense the H3K27me3-marked chromatin of AML cells enhanced chromatin accessibility and chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, apoptosis, and leukemia suppression. These effects were further promoted when chromatin de-condensation of AML cells was induced upon S-phase entry after release from a transient G1 arrest mediated by CDK4/6 inhibition. In the p53-null KG-1 and THP-1 AML cell lines, EZH2 inhibitor and doxorubicin co-treatment induced transcriptional reprogramming that was, in part, dependent on de-repression of H3K27me3-marked gene promoters and led to increased expression of cell death-promoting and growth-inhibitory genes. In conclusion, decondensing H3K27me3-marked chromatin by EZH2 inhibition represents a promising approach to improve the efficacy of DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents in AML patients. This strategy might allow for a lowering of chemotherapy doses with a consequent reduction of treatment-related side effects in elderly AML patients or those with significant comorbidities.","['Copyright (c)2021, American Association for Cancer Research.']","['Porazzi, Patrizia', 'Petruk, Svetlana', 'Pagliaroli, Luca', 'De Dominici, Marco', 'Deming, David', 'Puccetti, Matthew V', 'Kushinsky, Saul', 'Kumar, Gaurav', 'Minieri, Valentina', 'Barbieri, Elisa', 'Deliard, Sandra', 'Grande, Alexis', 'Trizzino, Marco', 'Gardini, Alessandro', 'Canaani, Eli', 'Palmisiano, Neil', 'Porcu, Pierluigi', 'Ertel, Adam', 'Fortina, Paolo M', 'Eischen, Christine M', 'Mazo, Alexander', 'Calabretta, Bruno']","['Porazzi P', 'Petruk S', 'Pagliaroli L', 'De Dominici M', 'Deming D', 'Puccetti MV', 'Kushinsky S', 'Kumar G', 'Minieri V', 'Barbieri E', 'Deliard S', 'Grande A', 'Trizzino M', 'Gardini A', 'Canaani E', 'Palmisiano N', 'Porcu P', 'Ertel A', 'Fortina PM', 'Eischen CM', 'Mazo A', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Kimmel Cancer Center,, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center,, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'SOM-BioChem&Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Kimmel Cancer Center,, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Gene Expression and Regulation Program, The Wistar Institute.', 'Gene Expression and Regulation Program, The Wistar Institute.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Kimmel Cancer Center,, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Gene Expression and Regulation Program, The Wistar Institute.', 'The Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science.', 'Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Medical Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Kimmel Cancer Center,, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University bruno.calabretta@jefferson.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211213,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,,2021/12/15 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/12/14 06:50'],"['2021/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/14 06:50 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-21-1297 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-1297 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Res. 2021 Dec 13. pii: 0008-5472.CAN-21-1297. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-1297.,,,,,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1372-7482', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5539-4789', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7835-259X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7455-1559', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5898-2081']","['R01 CA257251/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL127895/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA236736/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) therapy is the only curative option for MF patients. However, AHSCT is strictly limited due to the high rates of morbidity and mortality. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor Ruxolitinib is the first-line treatment for intermediate-II or high-risk MF patients with splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms, but most MF patients develop resistance or intolerance to Ruxolitinib. Therefore, MF treatment is a challenge for the medical community.

Here, we describe the expression dynamics of immune factors during the first year on imatinib therapy. Gene expression was evaluated in 132 peripheral blood samples from 79 CML patients, including 34 who were serially followed. An aliquot of the stored sample used to monitor BCR-ABL1 levels was retro-transcribed to cDNA and gene expression was quantified by real-time PCR. An elevated expression of ARG1 was observed at diagnosis, while TBET, CIITA, IL10 and TGFB1 were significantly decreased. Once on therapy, each gene displayed a particular behaviour. ARG1 normalized to control levels at 3 months only in optimal molecular responders and was identified as the major contributor to the difference among patients. TBET reached normal levels after 12 months in optimal responders and non-responders, regardless the Th1-response previously associated, and CIITA continued downregulated. IL10 and TGFB1 achieved normal levels early at 3 months in both groups, afterwards IL10 was sustained while TGFB1 was slightly increased after 1 year in responders. Our findings are in agreement with an immune re-activation after imatinib initiation; however, some immune mediators may require a longer exposition.

However, a portion of them still become refractory to the therapy mainly through acquiring mutations in the BCR-ABL1 gene, necessitating a novel strategy to treat tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant Ph(+) ALL cases. In this report, we show evidence that RUNX1 transcription factor stringently controls the expression of BCR-ABL1, which can strategically be targeted by our novel RUNX inhibitor, Chb-M'. Through a series of in vitro experiments, we identified that RUNX1 binds to the promoter of BCR and directly transactivates BCR-ABL1 expression in Ph(+) ALL cell lines. These cells showed significantly reduced expression of BCR-ABL1 with suppressed proliferation upon RUNX1 knockdown. Moreover, treatment with Chb-M' consistently downregulated the expression of BCR-ABL1 in these cells and this drug was highly effective even in an imatinib-resistant Ph(+) ALL cell line. In good agreement with these findings, forced expression of BCR-ABL1 in these cells conferred relative resistance to Chb-M'. In addition, in vivo experiments with the Ph(+) ALL patient-derived xenograft cells showed similar results. In summary, targeting RUNX1 therapeutically in Ph(+) ALL cells may lead to overcoming TKI resistance through the transcriptional regulation of BCR-ABL1. Chb-M' could be a novel drug for patients with TKI-resistant refractory Ph(+) ALL.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The World Health Organization classification divides the disease into prognostically distinct variants of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). Although this classification remains valid, recent developments in the field and the advent of new diagnostic and prognostic parameters created a need to update and refine definitions and diagnostic criteria in MC neoplasms. In addition, MC activation syndromes (MCAS) and genetic features predisposing to SM and MCAS have been identified. To discuss these developments and refinements in the classification, we organized a Working Conference comprised of experts from Europe and the United States in August 2020. This article reports on outcomes from this conference. Of particular note, we propose adjustments in the classification of CM and SM, refinements in diagnostic criteria of SM variants, including smoldering SM and BM mastocytosis (BMM), and updated criteria for MCAS and other conditions involving MC. CD30 expression in MC now qualifies as a minor SM criterion, and BMM is now defined by SM criteria, absence of skin lesions and absence of B- and C-findings. A basal serum tryptase level exceeding 20 ng/mL remains a minor SM criterion, with recognition that hereditary alpha-tryptasemia and various myeloid neoplasms may also cause elevations in tryptase. Our updated proposal will support diagnostic evaluations and prognostication in daily practice and the conduct of clinical trials in MC disorders.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

However, many of the same surface marker proteins are also expressed in normal cells. Growing evidence suggests that the molecular signatures of the tumor microenvironment (TME) are related to the biological state of a diseased cell. Exploiting the unique molecular signature of the TME, we have designed a molecular sensing agent consisting of a molecular switch that can sense the elevated concentration of a small molecule in the TME and promote precise recognition of a malignant cell. We accomplished this by designing and developing a bispecific aptamer that takes advantage of a high concentration of adenosine 5'-triphosphate in the TME. Thus, we report a prototype of a bispecific aptamer molecule, which serves as a dual detection platform and recognizes tumor cells only when a given metabolite concentration is elevated in the TME. This system overcomes hurdles in detecting tumor cells solely based on the elevated expression of cell surface markers, providing a universal platform for tumor targeting and sensing.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Although sulfur is known for its wide range of biological activities, its potentiality in two-dimensional forms as an antitumor agent is hitherto unexplored. To address the current deficient knowledge on nano-sulfur as an antitumor agent, we report the synthesis of nano-sulfur sheets/particles and their cytotoxic, apoptotic activity against human carcinoma cell lines. In vitro cytotoxic effects of biogenic nanosheets (SNP-B) and chemogenic nanoparticles (SNP-C) were assessed against human lung carcinoma (A549), human epidermoid carcinoma (A431), human promyelocytic leukaemia (HL60) and human lung fibroblast (IMR90) cell lines. Cell cycle analysis, apoptotic study, and caspase-3 expression studies were carried out to understand the mechanism of cytotoxic activity of nano-sulfur. The MTT assay indicated a dose-dependent decrease in viability of all the cell lines treated with nano-sulfur, with SNP-B being more toxic compared to SNP-C. The apoptotic study and cell cycle analysis indicated cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis-induced cell death. The caspase-3 expression study indicated that nano-sulfur induces apoptosis by the activation of caspase through the mitochondrial pathway. Apart from this, a lower cytotoxicity was observed in IMR90 cell lines treated with SNP-B , indicating a higher specificity of synthesized nanosheets towards cancer cells. Taken all together, this work highlights the potentiality of sulfur nanosheets in inducing cytotoxicity and apoptotic activity, and the impact of morphology as a critical determinant on the cytotoxic response on various cell lines.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Herein, we found Au@Ce NPs, assembled by Au NPs and Ce NPs, exhibited high-performance of SOD mimetic enzyme activity even upon the oxidation of H2O2. Ce NPs supported by nano-Au can acquire the electrons from Au NPs through the enhanced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), maintaining the stability of Ce(3+)/Ce(4+) and SOD-like activity. Meanwhile, Au@Ce NPs retained the peroxidase function and catalase function. As a result, Au@Ce NPs effectively scavenged O2*- and the derived ROS in AML cells, which are the important signaling source that drives AML cell proliferation and accelerates cell cycle progression. When HL-60 cells were treated by Au@Ce NPs, the removal of endogenous ROS signal significantly arrested cell cycle at G1 phase and suppressed the cell proliferation by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling and the Akt/Cyclin D1 cell cycle signaling. Importantly, this treatment strategy showed therapeutic effect for subcutaneous transplantation of AML model as well as a satisfactory result in diminishing the leukocyte infiltration of liver and spleen particularly. Thus, assembled Au@Ce NPs show the high-performance SOD-like activity, promising the potential in treating AML and regulating abnormal ROS in other diseases safely and efficiently.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Sun, Yuxiang', 'Liu, Xin', 'Wang, Lei', 'Xu, Li', 'Liu, Kunliang', 'Xu, Lei', 'Shi, Fangfang', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Gu, Ning', 'Xiong, Fei']","['Sun Y', 'Liu X', 'Wang L', 'Xu L', 'Liu K', 'Xu L', 'Shi F', 'Zhang Y', 'Gu N', 'Xiong F']","['State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering & Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano-Science and Technology, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering & Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano-Science and Technology, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, PR China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, PR China.', 'Department of Research and Development, Jinan Guoke Medical Technology Development Co., Ltd., Address: No. 1, Gangxing 3rd Road, High-tech Industrial Development Zone, Jinan City, Shandong Province, 250013, PR China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering & Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano-Science and Technology, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering & Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano-Science and Technology, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering & Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano-Science and Technology, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210818,China,Bioact Mater,Bioactive materials,101685294,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Au nanoparticles', 'CeO2 nanoparticles', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Superoxide dismutase']",2021/12/14 06:00,2021/12/14 06:01,['2021/12/13 18:14'],"['2021/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/13 18:14 [entrez]', '2021/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.08.012 [doi]', 'S2452-199X(21)00389-3 [pii]']",epublish,Bioact Mater. 2021 Aug 18;10:117-130. doi: 10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.08.012. eCollection 2022 Apr.,10,,117-130,,,,PMC8637344,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 presents tropism for CD4(+) T cells and induces deregulation of the cytokine profile. IDH is a severe, chronic superinfected eczema generally associated with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus beta haemolyticus infection that responds partially to antibiotic therapy but prompt recurrence develops upon treatment withdrawal. IDH could be a risk factor for progression toward both HAM/TSP and ATLL and, similarly to other diseases associated with HTLV-1, it is sub-diagnosed particularly in non-endemic areas. Here, we present a case of IDH in a young boy living in Buenos Aires with symptoms since 2010, at the age of 5. HTLV-1 infection was suspected and confirmed in 2016. The patient exhibited chronic dermatosis with exudative eruption involving mainly the scalp, retroauricular regions, neck and abdomen.

Improvements in supportive care and transplant techniques have led to increasing numbers of long-term survivors worldwide. However, conditioning regimens as well as transplant-related complications are associated with severe sequelae, impacting patients' quality of life. It is widely recognised that paediatric HSCT survivors must have timely access to life-long care and surveillance in order to prevent, ameliorate and manage all possible adverse late effects of HSCT. This is fundamentally important because it can both prevent ill health and optimise the quality and experience of survival following HSCT. Furthermore, it reduces the impact of preventable chronic illness on already under-resourced health services. In addition to late effects, survivors of paediatric ALL also have to deal with unique challenges associated with transition to adult services. In this review, we: (1) provide an overview of the potential late effects following HSCT for ALL in childhood and adolescence; (2) focus on the unique challenges of transition from paediatric care to adult services; and (3) provide a framework for long-term surveillance and medical care for survivors of paediatric ALL who have undergone HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Diesch-Furlanetto, Gabriel, Zajac-Spychala, Cattoni, Hoeben', 'and Balduzzi.']","['Diesch-Furlanetto, Tamara', 'Gabriel, Melissa', 'Zajac-Spychala, Olga', 'Cattoni, Alessandro', 'Hoeben, Bianca A W', 'Balduzzi, Adriana']","['Diesch-Furlanetto T', 'Gabriel M', 'Zajac-Spychala O', 'Cattoni A', 'Hoeben BAW', 'Balduzzi A']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, University Children's Hospital Basel (UKB), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", ""Cancer Centre for Children, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Clinica Pediatrica, University degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione Monza e Brianza per il Bambino e la sua Mamma (MBBM), San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Clinica Pediatrica, University degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione Monza e Brianza per il Bambino e la sua Mamma (MBBM), San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211124,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'adolescence', 'haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'late effects', 'long-term survivors', 'paediatric', 'quality of life']",2021/12/14 06:00,2021/12/14 06:01,['2021/12/13 18:08'],"['2021/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/13 18:08 [entrez]', '2021/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.773895 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Nov 24;9:773895. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.773895. eCollection 2021.,9,,773895,,,,PMC8652149,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

RAS gain-of-function mutations are one of the leading causes in human oncogenesis, accounting for approximately 19% of the global cancer burden. As a well-recognized target in malignancy, RAS has been intensively studied in the past decades. Despite the sustained efforts, many failures occurred in the earlier exploration and resulted in an 'undruggable' feature of RAS proteins. Phosphorylation at several residues has been recently determined as regulators for wild-type and mutated RAS proteins. Therefore, the development of RAS inhibitors directly targeting the RAS mutants or towards upstream regulatory kinases supplies a novel direction for tackling the anti-RAS difficulties. A better understanding of RAS phosphorylation can contribute to future therapeutic strategies. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the current advances in RAS phosphorylation and provided mechanistic insights into the signaling transduction of associated pathways. Importantly, the preclinical and clinical success in developing anti-RAS drugs targeting the upstream kinases and potential directions of harnessing allostery to target RAS phosphorylation sites were also discussed.","['(c) 2021 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica,', 'Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

A combination chemotherapy regimen of doxorubicin (DOX) and cyclophosphamide (CPS) is employed in treatment of several cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer. It is not well understood whether a combination therapy of DOX and CPS can induce hepatotoxicity. We therefore sought to determine whether co-administration of DOX and CPS at their clinically relevant doses and frequency results in hepatotoxicity. Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice received one intraperitoneal injection of saline or DOX-2mg /kg and CPS-50mg/kg once a week for 4 weeks. After the treatment period, liver histology and various serum biomarkers of hepatotoxicity were assessed. Results: Co-treatment of DOX and CPS did not alter the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, albumin, globulin, or total protein. Similarly, co-administration of DOX and CPS did not result in a noticeable change in liver histology. However, it was notable that the concomitant treatment with DOX and CPS resulted in a significant increase in serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Elevated serum AST levels were also associated with increased serum creatinine kinase (CK) levels, suggesting that the elevated serum AST levels are likely due to muscle injury following the co-administration of DOX and CPS. Conclusion: Taken together, our results, for the first time, suggest that co-administration of DOX and CPS, at their clinically relevant doses and frequency does not induce a significant hepatotoxicity in the mice.",,"['Pondugula, Satyanarayana R', 'Salamat, Julia M', 'Abbott, Kodye L', 'Flannery, Patrick C', 'Majrashi, Mohammed', 'Almaghrabi, Mohammed', 'Govindarajulu, Manoj', 'Ramesh, Sindhu', 'Sandey, Maninder', 'Onteru, Suneel K', 'Huang, Chen-Che J', 'Iwaki, Yoshimi', 'Gill, Kristina', 'Narayanan, Natasha', 'McElroy, Edwin', 'Desai, Darshini', 'Nadar, Rishi', 'Moore, Timothy', 'Dhanasekaran, Muralikrishnan']","['Pondugula SR', 'Salamat JM', 'Abbott KL', 'Flannery PC', 'Majrashi M', 'Almaghrabi M', 'Govindarajulu M', 'Ramesh S', 'Sandey M', 'Onteru SK', 'Huang CJ', 'Iwaki Y', 'Gill K', 'Narayanan N', 'McElroy E', 'Desai D', 'Nadar R', 'Moore T', 'Dhanasekaran M']","['Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, AL 36849, USA.', 'Animal Biochemistry Division, National Dairy Research Institute, ICAR-NDRI, Karnal, Haryana 132001, India.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Science, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210507,China,Liver Res,Liver research,101705555,,['NOTNLM'],"['cyclophosphamide', 'doxorubicin', 'hepatotoxicity', 'liver injury', 'muscle injury']",2021/12/14 06:00,2021/12/14 06:01,['2021/12/13 18:03'],"['2021/12/13 18:03 [entrez]', '2021/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1016/j.livres.2021.04.002 [doi]'],ppublish,Liver Res. 2021 Dec;5(4):239-242. doi: 10.1016/j.livres.2021.04.002.

Its structure includes two SH2 domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2), and a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain. Under basal conditions, SHP2 is auto-inhibited, with the N-SH2 domain blocking the PTP active site. Activation involves a rearrangement of the domains that makes the catalytic site accessible, coupled to the association between the SH2 domains and cognate proteins containing phosphotyrosines. Several aspects of this transition are debated and competing mechanistic models have been proposed. A crystallographic structure of SHP2 in an active state has been reported (PDB code 6crf), but several lines of evidence suggests that it is not fully representative of the conformations populated in solution. To clarify the structural rearrangements involved in SHP2 activation, enhanced sampling simulations of the autoinhibited and active states have been performed, for wild type SHP2 and its pathogenic E76K variant. Our results demonstrate that the crystallographic conformation of the active state is unstable in solution, and multiple interdomain arrangements are populated, thus allowing association to bisphosphorylated sequences. Contrary to a recent proposal, activation is coupled to the conformational changes of the N-SH2 binding site, which is significantly more accessible in the active sate, rather than to the structure of the central beta-sheet of the domain. In this coupling, a previously undescribed role for the N-SH2 BG loop emerged.",['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],"['Calligari, Paolo', 'Santucci, Valerio', 'Stella, Lorenzo', 'Bocchinfuso, Gianfranco']","['Calligari P', 'Santucci V', 'Stella L', 'Bocchinfuso G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Chimiche, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Chimiche, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Chimiche, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Chimiche, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211103,Netherlands,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,101585369,,['NOTNLM'],"['BTLA, B and T lymphocyte attenuator', 'CTLA-4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4', 'FRET, Forster resonance energy transfer', 'Inter-domain dynamics', 'JMML, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', 'MD, molecular dynamics', 'NS, Noonan syndrome', 'NSML, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines', 'PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1', 'PDB, protein data bank', 'PMF, potential of mean force', 'PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase', 'Protein flexibility', 'REMD, replica exchange molecular dynamics', 'RMSD, root mean square deviation', 'RMSF, root mean square fluctuation', 'RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase', 'Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations', 'SASA, solvent accessible surface area', 'SAXS, small angle X-ray scattering', 'SH2, Src homology 2', 'SHP2 regulatory mechanism', 'SHP2, Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2', 'SIRPalpha, signal regulatory protein alpha', 'pY, phosphorylated tyrosine']",2021/12/14 06:00,2021/12/14 06:01,['2021/12/13 18:00'],"['2021/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/13 18:00 [entrez]', '2021/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.041 [doi]', 'S2001-0370(21)00463-3 [pii]']",epublish,Comput Struct Biotechnol J. 2021 Nov 3;19:6125-6139. doi: 10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.041. eCollection 2021.,19,,6125-6139,,,,PMC8632847,,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We collected real-world data about patients treated with VEN + HMAs in the context of a pharmacovigilance project focused on the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of drugs used for unapproved indication in Italian hospitals. From March to December 2020, 24 patients started treatment with VEN combined with HMAs. 21 patients have been assessed for response. Eleven (52%) patients reached complete remission (CR), and three patients (14%) CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh), with a median duration of response of 4.5 months (range 0.5-12.5). 19 patients experienced at least 1 adverse drug reaction (ADR), mostly serious, including 3 deaths (9% of ADRs; 12.5% of patients) in febrile neutropenia. Hematological toxicities and infections (cytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, sepsis), were the most reported ADRs (84.4%). In general, neutropenic fever occurred more frequently in patients treated with decitabine (7 out of 9, 78%) compared to azacitidine (5 out of 15, 33%; p = 0.03), whereas response assessment did not differ based on used HMA (p = 0.1).

ATRA induces neutrophil differentiation and its associated side effects. The differentiation syndrome is the most characterized ATRA-induced adverse effect. Sweet's syndrome, also known as neutrophilic dermatosis, is another form of ATRA-associated disease characterized by neutrophil infiltrating erythema that develops with fever. This is a case of a 34-year-old Japanese man diagnosed with APL. At the onset, the patient did not have skin involvement of APL cells. He was treated with ATRA and induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine. Scrotal skin rash occurred at day 14, which developed into scrotal ulceration up to day 28 even after eliminating APL cells in his peripheral blood. Sweet's syndrome is a pathological diagnosis of scrotal skin ulceration representing neutrophil infiltration. The infiltrating neutrophils showed PML-RARalpha rearrangement. The patient was diagnosed with ATRA-associated Sweet's syndrome with skin ulcer. His cutaneous lesion did not respond to intravenous prednisolone therapy; thereby, ATRA was discontinued. After the cessation of ATRA, the skin lesion improved in the next week. We confirmed he achieved a complete response after induction chemotherapy.

Data were accessed using the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), which collects various population-level health information. In the Ontario Cancer Registry, 2887 CLL patients receiving treatment and diagnosed between 2010-2017 were identified. Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) chemoimmunotherapy was most frequently used as a first line, but use declined since ibrutinib and obinutuzumab combinations were funded in 2015. In patients treated with frontline FCR, survival at year one was 89% pre-2015 and 96% post-2015; at year four, survival was 73% and 87%, respectively. Survival in patients treated with frontline chlorambucil was 76% pre-2015 and 75% post-2015 in year 1, and 45% and 56% in year 3.

The most important differential diagnosis is mantle cell lymphoma, both in its classical and leukemic, non-nodal forms, given its prognostic and therapeutic implications. Other small B-cell neoplasms that frequently involve the spleen and occasionally express CD5 include the splenic marginal zone lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia and, rarely, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. The frequency of CD5 positivity depends in part on the sensitivity of the detection methods employed. Usually, a combination of morphological, immunophenotypic and molecular findings allows for a precise sub-classification of CD5-positive, low-grade B-cell lymphomas of the spleen. Some of these tumors may display a mixture of small and larger B cells, raising the possibility of more aggressive lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Approximately 5-10% of DLBCL are CD5-positive and some may manifest as primary splenic lesions. When available, the morphology of DLBCL in the splenic tissue is distinctive and a leukemic picture is very rare.

Treatment includes home-based oral chemotherapies (OCs) (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine and dexamethasone) taken for 2 to 3 years. The management of OC can be challenging for children and their parents. However, the multifaceted experience of families with children taking OC for ALL is largely undescribed. We report the experience with these OCs from the parents' perspective. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the parents of children with ALL aged < 15 years, followed in a specialized university-affiliated center. The interviews were fully transcribed and thematically analyzed. Thirteen of the seventeen eligible parents (76.5%) participated in the study. The parents' motivation to follow the recommendations provided by the multidisciplinary care team regarding OC was very high. The quantity and the quality of the information received were judged adequate, and the parents reported feeling knowledgeable enough to take charge of the OC at home. Adapting to the consequences of OC on family daily life was collectively identified as the biggest challenge. This includes developing and maintaining a strict daily routine, adapting to the child's neurobehavioral changes during dexamethasone days and adapting family social life. Our findings have several implications for enhancing the support offered to families with home-based OC for ALL. Supportive interventions should consider the family as a whole and their needs should be regularly monitored. Specific attention should be paid to the development and maintenance of a routine, to the parental burden, and to the emotional impact, especially regarding dexamethasone.",,"['Camire-Bernier, Etienne', 'Nidelet, Erwan', 'Baghdadli, Amel', 'Demers, Gabriel', 'Boulanger, Marie-Christine', 'Brisson, Marie-Claude', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Lauzier, Sophie', 'Laverdiere, Isabelle']","['Camire-Bernier E', 'Nidelet E', 'Baghdadli A', 'Demers G', 'Boulanger MC', 'Brisson MC', 'Michon B', 'Lauzier S', 'Laverdiere I']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Population Health and Optimal Health Practices Axis, CHU de Quebec Research Center-Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1S 4L8, Canada.', 'School of Psychology, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Reproduction, Mother and Youth Health Axis, CHU de Quebec Research Center-Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Population Health and Optimal Health Practices Axis, CHU de Quebec Research Center-Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1S 4L8, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Oncology Axis, CHU de Quebec Research Center-Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211101,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'antineoplastic agents', 'cancer', 'child', 'medication adherence', 'qualitative research']",2021/12/14 06:00,2021/12/14 06:00,['2021/12/13 17:36'],"['2021/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/13 17:36 [entrez]', '2021/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['curroncol28060372 [pii]', '10.3390/curroncol28060372 [doi]']",epublish,Curr Oncol. 2021 Nov 1;28(6):4377-4391. doi: 10.3390/curroncol28060372.,28,6,4377-4391,,,"['3412/Fondation du CHU de Quebec', 'FQ122109/Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Sante, Research scholar (to S.L.)', 'FQ122099/Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Sante, Clinical research scholar (to I.L.)', '2020 Concours ""Optimisation de l\'usage""/Reseau Quebecois de Recherche sur les', 'Medicaments']",PMC8628767,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study explored the effect of electroacupuncture on the endometrial receptivity of COH rats. Female rats were randomly divided into normal treatment (Normal), model treatment (Model), low-frequency electroacupuncture treatment (LF-EA) and high-frequency electroacupuncture treatment (HF-EA). Rats in the Model, LF-EA, and HF-EA treatment groups were injected with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) to establish a model of COH rats. Compared with the Normal, the endometrial thickness, the number of pinopodes and amount of blastocyst implantation in the Model group were significantly reduced. Among them, the endometrial thickness and the amount of blastocyst implantation in the Model group were substantially decreased than those in the HF-EA group. High-frequency electroacupuncture treatment could markedly reduce the protein expression levels of E-cadherin, beta-catenin and claudin-1 (CLDN1). During HF-EA treatment, the LIF/STAT3 signaling pathway of COH rats was enhanced.

In this study, we used mate pair sequencing (MPseq) technology to characterize two novel ATM rearrangements in one patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and one patient with T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). Both patients showed chromosome 11q22 aberrations encompassing ATM by conventional karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization: isolated t(11;13)(q22;q14) in CLL and a complex karyotype with apparent 11q deletion and unbalanced der(14)t(11;14)(q22;p11.2) in T-PLL. MPseq identified ATM-LINC00371 fusion in CLL and ATM-USP28 in T-PLL, both of which led to ATM inactivation, confirmed by loss of immunohistochemical protein expression.

Acute myeloid leukemia developed in a woman approximately 5.5 years after she had received LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease as part of the initial cohort (Group A) of the HGB-206 study. An analysis of peripheral-blood samples revealed that blast cells contained a BB305 lentiviral vector insertion site. The results of an investigation of causality indicated that the leukemia was unlikely to be related to vector insertion, given the location of the insertion site, the very low transgene expression in blast cells, and the lack of an effect on expression of surrounding genes. Several somatic mutations predisposing to acute myeloid leukemia were present after diagnosis, which suggests that patients with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for hematologic malignant conditions after transplantation, most likely because of a combination of risks associated with underlying sickle cell disease, transplantation procedure, and inadequate disease control after treatment.

Driver genetic events often occur in multipotent progenitor cells in myeloid neoplasms, suggesting that multilineage output may be more common than appreciated. This phenomenon is not well studied in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and non-CML myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). METHODS: We systematically evaluated phenotypic lineage infidelity by reviewing bone marrow pathology and flow cytometry (FC) studies of 1262 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of MDS and/or non-CML MPN. We assessed B- and T-cells in these patients by FC. When abnormal B-lymphoblast (ABLB) populations were detected, we additionally evaluated immature B-cells using a high sensitivity FC assay for B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL). RESULTS: We identified 9 patients (7 MDS, 7/713, 1%; 2 non-CML MPN, 2/312, 0.6%; 0 in MDS/MPN) with low-level ABLB populations (0.012%-3.6% of WBCs in marrow) with abnormal immunophenotypes. Genetic studies on flow sorted cell populations confirmed that some ABLB populations were clonally related to myeloid blasts (4/6, 67%). On follow-up, ABLB populations in 8/9 patients remained stable or disappeared. Only 1 case progressed to B-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that phenotypically detectable abnormal immature B lineage output occurs in MDS and non-CML MPN, albeit rarely. While presence of ABLB does not necessarily reflect blast crisis, the underlying disease biology of our findings may ultimately be relevant to patient management and warrants further investigation.",['(c) 2021 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Chan, Alexander', 'Kumar, Priyadarshini', 'Gao, Qi', 'Baik, Jeeyeon', 'Sigler, Allison', 'Londono, Dory', 'Liu, Ying', 'Arcila, Maria E', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Roshal, Mikhail', 'Xiao, Wenbin']","['Chan A', 'Kumar P', 'Gao Q', 'Baik J', 'Sigler A', 'Londono D', 'Liu Y', 'Arcila ME', 'Dogan A', 'Zhang Y', 'Roshal M', 'Xiao W']","['Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20211213,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

In severe HI (Child-Pugh Class C), acalabrutinib exposure (AUC and maximum concentration [Cmax ]) increased approximately 5.0-fold and 3.6-fold, respectively. Results were consistent across total and unbound exposures. Severe HI did not impact total/unbound metabolite (ACP-5862) exposures; metabolite to parent ratio decreased to 0.6 - 0.8 (versus 3.1 - 3.6 in healthy subjects). In summary, single oral dose of 50 mg acalabrutinib was safe and well tolerated in subjects with mild, moderate and severe HI and in healthy control subjects. In subjects with severe HI, mean acalabrutinib exposure increased by up to 5-fold and should be avoided. Acalabrutinib does not require dose adjustment in patients with mild or moderate HI.

Furthermore, we investigated the impact of HTLV-1 infection on incidences of serious infections requiring hospitalisation (SIH) and malignancies. METHODS: A total of 150 sex- and age-matched HTLV-1-negative and 50 HTLV-1-positive RA patients were enrolled from the HTLV-1 RA Miyazaki Cohort Study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from this cohort database. The incidence rate (IR) for SIH and malignancies from 2015 to 2020 was analysed. RESULTS: The median age and female ratio in the study population were 70 years old and 80%, respectively. Although no differences were found in inflammatory marker values between the two groups, the patient global assessment and Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were higher in HTLV-1-positive RA patients. In HTLV-1-negative RA patients, the IR for SIH was 6.37/100 person-years (PY) and 1.32/100 PY for malignancies. In HTLV-1-positive RA patients, SIH occurred in 11.1/100 PY and malignancies in 2.46/100 PY. The crude IR ratio comparing SIH between two groups was 1.74 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.84), which was a significant increase. CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-1-positive RA patients may worsen RA symptoms. HTLV-1 may be a risk factor for SIH.","['(c) Japan College of Rheumatology 2021. Published by Oxford University Press. All', 'rights reserved.

Identification of cytogenetic aberrations is essential for classification and risk stratification of AML, with many demonstrating unique associations with various clinicopathologic features. One such abnormality is MYC amplification, a rare occurrence identified in less than 1% of AML patients. MYC is most commonly amplified in the form of double minutes, but may also occur via ring and marker chromosomes or homogeneously staining regions. Amplification of MYC often involves various chromosomal aberrations, including trisomies 4 and 6 and aneusomy of the sex chromosomes. In many cases, the presence of MYC amplicons is also associated with other negative prognostic factors, including complex karyotype and advanced age. Although MYC has been extensively investigated as a therapeutic target in various cancers, there are few studies examining the clinical significance of MYC amplification in AML.

Natural Killer (NK) cells can elicit an antileukemic response via a repertoire of activating receptors that bind AML surface ligands. NK-cell adoptive transfer is safe but thus far has shown limited anti-AML efficacy. Here, we aimed to overcome this limitation by engineering NK cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to boost their anti-AML activity and interleukin (IL)-15 to enhance their persistence. METHODS: We characterized in detail NK-cell populations expressing a panel of AML (CD123)-specific CARs and/or IL-15 in vitro and in AML xenograft models. RESULTS: CARs with 2B4.zeta or 4-1BB.zeta signaling domains demonstrated greater cell surface expression and endowed NK cells with improved anti-AML activity in vitro. Initial in vivo testing revealed that only 2B4.zeta Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-NK cells had improved anti-AML activity in comparison to untransduced (UTD) and 4-1BB.zeta CAR-NK cells. However, the benefit was transient due to limited CAR-NK-cell persistence. Transgenic expression of secretory interleukin (sIL)-15 in 2B4.zeta CAR and UTD NK cells improved their effector function in the setting of chronic antigen simulation in vitro. Multiparameter flow analysis after chronic antigen exposure identified the expansion of unique NK-cell subsets. 2B4.zeta/sIL-15 CAR and sIL-15 NK cells maintained an overall activated NK-cell phenotype. This was confirmed by transcriptomic analysis, which revealed a highly proliferative and activated signature in these NK-cell groups. In vivo, 2B4.zeta/sIL-15 CAR-NK cells had potent anti-AML activity in one model, while 2B4.zeta/sIL-15 CAR and sIL-15 NK cells induced lethal toxicity in a second model. CONCLUSION: Transgenic expression of CD123-CARs and sIL-15 enabled NK cells to function in the setting of chronic antigen exposure but was associated with systemic toxicities. Thus, our study provides the impetus to explore inducible and controllable expression systems to provide cytokine signals to AML-specific CAR-NK cells before embarking on early-phase clinical testing.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Clinical history, variation in morphologic appearance, unusual site distribution and concern for progression of underlying hematologic disease all contributed to potential diagnostic challenges. Overlapping marker expression between MCC and hematologic neoplasms created potential diagnostic pitfalls (e.g. CD138, Pax5, TdT, Bcl2, CD56, and CD117). In addition, we newly identify expression of CD5 and LEF-1 in a subset of MCC, including in patients with CLL/SLL. MCC in patients with hematologic malignancy were more common in men (92% versus 59%, p < 0.05) and showed an unusual site predilection to non-sun exposed sites (3/13 on the buttocks) with none presenting on the face or scalp. By contrast, face or scalp lesions were common in MCC without an associated hematologic malignancy (17/41, p < 0.05). Our findings reaffirm the need for skin surveillance in the setting of immune deficiency and for vigilance to identify unusual presentations of MCC in patients with or without hematologic disorders.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

In our previous study, the transcriptomic profiles of carp head kidney exposed to Cd was analyzed by genomics technique, and confirmed that miRNAs are important in the head kidney injury of carp induced by Cd, but the specific biological mechanism was unclear. In order to further explore the effect of Cd on carp head kidney lymphocyte damage, we established a model of Cd exposure in vitro. The results showed that Cd could increase the expression of Bax (Bcl-2 associated X protein), Caspase9 (Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 9) and Caspase3 (Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3), inhibit the expression of Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2), and induce apoptosis of carp head kidney lymphocytes. In our previous study, we screened the differentially expressed miRNA in Cd-treated lymphocytes by high-throughput sequencing, and found that there was a significant difference in the expression of miR-9-5p. The expression trend of miR-9-5p in the vitro model was the same as that of high-throughput sequencing. We screened the differentially expressed gene FKBP5 (FK506-binding protein 51) in lymphocytes treated with Cd. It was confirmed by double luciferase reporter gene analysis that FKBP5 was the target gene of miR-9-5p. We established the overexpression/knockdown model of miR-9-5p in carp head kidney lymphocyte in vitro. The results showed that miR-9-5p could inhibit the expression of FKBP5, increase the phosphorylation level of Akt, inhibit apoptosis and improve the cell survival rate in carp head kidney lymphocytes. Together, Cd could down-regulate the expression of miR-9-5p, target up-regulate the expression of FKBP5, inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt, and promote the apoptosis of carp head kidney lymphocytes through mitochondrial pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

While most approved targeted cancer therapies are tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PTPs have long been stigmatized as undruggable and have only recently gained renewed attention in drug discovery. One PTP target is the Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2). SHP2 is implicated in tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance, primarily because of its role as a signaling nexus of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, acting upstream of the small GTPase Ras. Efforts to develop small molecules that target SHP2 are ongoing, and several SHP2 allosteric inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors. However, while the reported allosteric inhibitors are highly effective against cells expressing WT SHP2, none have significant activity against the most frequent oncogenic SHP2 variants that drive leukemogenesis in several juvenile and acute leukemias. Here, we report the discovery of novel furanylbenzamide molecules as inhibitors of both WT and oncogenic SHP2. Importantly, these inhibitors readily cross cell membranes, bind and inhibit SHP2 under physiological conditions, and effectively decrease the growth of cancer cells, including triple-negative breast cancer cells, acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing either WT or oncogenic SHP2, and patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia cells. These novel compounds are effective chemical probes of active SHP2 and may serve as starting points for therapeutics targeting WT or mutant SHP2 in cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

However, little is known regarding optimal interventions to support the psychosocial needs of AYAs with cancer. OBJECTIVE: The overall objective of this single arm, longitudinal, pilot study was to determine the feasibility of implementing a mindfulness-based music therapy intervention to improve anxiety and stress in AYAs receiving cancer treatment. METHODS: AYAs (15 - 39 years old) who were to receive cancer treatment for >/= eight weeks were recruited from the pediatric, melanoma, sarcoma, breast, lymphoma, and leukemia oncology outpatient centers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The music therapy intervention included four sessions of individual mindfulness-based music therapy in-person or using Zoom over twelve weeks. Prior to-and after the intervention period, participants completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Anxiety 4a and Perceived Stress Scale. Changes in patient-reported outcomes are compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Over approximately 14 months, 37 of 93 eligible AYAs were enrolled to the study (39.8% consent rate). Overall, 27 of 37 (73%) participants (Median age=32; 56.8% Female) completed at least two music therapy sessions and the baseline measures and end of study measures. Participation in the mindfulness-based music therapy sessions resulted in significant pre-to-posttest improvements in perceived stress (median change: -4.0, P=0.013) and non-significant changes in anxiety (median change: -1.9, P=0.20). Satisfaction and acceptability were highly rated. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of a four-session mindfulness-based music therapy intervention to AYAs receiving chemotherapy was feasible and significantly improved perceived stress. These preliminary findings should be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.

Mutations in the FLT3 gene are observed in approximately 30% of the patients. Most of these mutations are internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of a sequence within the protein coding region, an activation mechanism that is almost non-existent with other genes and cancers. As patients each carry their own unique set of mutations, it is challenging to understand how ITDs activate the protein, and ascertain the risk for each individual patient. Available treatment options are limited due to development of drug resistance. Here, recent studies are reviewed that help to better understand the molecular mechanism behind activation of the FLT3 protein due to mutations. It is argued that difference in mutation sequences and especially location might be coupled to prognosis. When it comes to FLT3 inhibitors, key differences between them can be attributed to the mode of inhibition (type-1 and type-2 inhibitors), effective inhibitory coefficient in the blood plasma and off-target binding. Accounting for the position and length of insertions may in the future be used to predict prognosis and rationalise treatment. Development of new inhibitors must take into account the potential for resistance mutations. Inhibitors aimed at multiple specific targets are currently being developed. These, and as well as combination therapies will hopefully lead to longer periods during which targeted FLT3 therapy will remain effective.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is one such cancer. Through the use of flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, low levels of glucose uptake were observed in the OSU-CLL and HG3 CLL cell lines relative to highly glucose-avid Raji cells (Burkitt's lymphoma). Glucose uptake in CLL cells correlated with low expression of the GLUT1 and GLUT3 receptors. In contrast, both CLL cell lines and primary CLL cells, but not healthy B cells, were found to rapidly internalise medium- and long-chain, but not short-chain, fatty acids (FAs). Differential FA uptake was also observed in primary cells taken from patients with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy variable chain usage (IGHV) compared with patients with mutated IGHV. Delipidation of serum in the culture medium slowed the proliferation and significantly reduced the viability of OSU-CLL and HG3 cells, effects that were partially reversed by supplementation with a chemically defined lipid concentrate.

Upon knockdown of IGF2BP2 in PTCSR cells, ERBB2 signaling was inhibited, and the acquired drug resistance was partially reversed. Mechanistically, the luciferase activity assay showed that IGF2BP2 bound to the N6-methyladenosine-binding site in the coding sequence of ERBB2 mRNA, yielding an increased ERBB2 translation efficacy revealed by polysome profiling. Inhibition of ERBB2 and IGF2BP2 by lapatinib robustly rescued the PTCSR cells from acquired dedifferentiation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an ancillary study to a randomized trial on intensive induction chemotherapy in AML patients (ALFA-0702/NCT00932412), where AFP with posaconazole was recommended. IFIs were graded by investigators and by central reviewers according to the revised EORTC definitions. Experts conclusions were compared to the investigators' ones. RESULTS: A total of 677 patients were included. Four AFP strategies were reported: Group-1: no AFP (n = 203, 30%), Group-2: posaconazole (n = 241, 36%), Group-3: posaconazole with other AFP (n = 142, 21%), Group-4: other AFP (n = 91, 13%). Experts graded more IFI than investigators: proven/probable IFI, 9.0% (n = 61) versus 6.2% (n = 42). The cumulative incidence at day60 of probable/proven IFI was 13.9% (Group-1); 7.9% (Group-2); 5.6% (Group-3); and 6.6% (Group-4). IFI onset was 26 (19-31) days after induction in Groups 2-3, versus 16 (9-25) days in Group 1 and 20 (12-24) days in Group 4 (P< .001). After a median follow-up of 27.5 months (0.4-73.4), the mortality rate was 38.3%, with 5.4% attributed to IFI. In multivariate analysis, IFI occurrence was an independent risk of death (HR5.63, 95%-CI 2.62-12.08, P< .001). EORTC recommendations were applied in only 57% of patients. In patients without IFI, the rate of AML complete remission was higher. CONCLUSIONS: In AML patients, AFP delayed the onset of IFI in addition of decreasing their rate. The frequent misidentification of IFI impacts their appropriate management according to recommendations. hematological remission was more frequent in patients without IFI.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.
