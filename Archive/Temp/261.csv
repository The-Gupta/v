Identification of subtypes and their prognostic significance.,531-45,"Bone marrow biopsy specimens taken on initial investigation of 134 patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) were processed into plastic, and sections cut at 3 microns were used for histologic and histomorphometric evaluation. Twenty-four clinical, 10 histologic, and four histomorphometric variables were tested for their prognostic significance. Bone marrow involvement was found in all cases, and on the basis of their morphology, the hairy cells were divided into three types: ovoid (47%), convoluted (37%), and indented (16%); this classification proved to be highly significant in the test statistics, with median survivals for the three groups of 56, 12, and 5 months, respectively. The characteristic nuclear features of the three types also were identified in smears of peripheral blood, in sections of spleen, and by electron microscopy. In addition, significant differences were found when the patients were grouped according to the tumor cell mass (volume %) in the biopsy sections, with median survivals of 55, 21, and 8 months noted for less than 20 vol%, 20-50 vol%, and greater than 50 vol%, respectively. Other factors with prognostic relevance were cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the hairy cells (HC) and a number of clinical variables, including initial values of Hb and ESR, and platelets and monocytes in the peripheral blood. These results confirm that the bone marrow always is involved in HCL and its histology is diagnostic; that HCL may be classified according to the predominant neoplastic cell type; and that the patients may be staged on the basis of the tumor cell burden in the bone marrow biopsy.","['Bartl, R', 'Frisch, B', 'Hill, W', 'Burkhardt, R', 'Sommerfeld, W', 'Sund, M']","['Bartl R', 'Frisch B', 'Hill W', 'Burkhardt R', 'Sommerfeld W', 'Sund M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/pathology']",1983/05/01 00:00,1983/05/01 00:01,['1983/05/01 00:00'],"['1983/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1983 May;79(5):531-45. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/79.5.531.,['10.1093/ajcp/79.5.531 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we took advantage of the clonality of these tumours to investigate the specificity of provirus integration in the tumour DNA. We reasoned that if several independently derived thymic lymphomas would contain the provirus integrated in the same region of cellular DNA, this would be a strong indication that this integration event is a contributing factor in oncogenesis.

The glycoproteins of the two viruses could be distinguished immunologically, by peptide mapping, and by size in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The MCF virus produced gp69, and the ecotropic virus produced gp71, explaining the origin of the heterogeneous glycoprotein (gp69 and gp71) of Rauscher leukemia virus. Amino-terminal sequences of gp69 and gp71 were determined. The MCF sequence was distinct from the ecotropic sequence, but retained partial homology to it.

Expression of kinase-active A-MuLV protein can result in a deleterious effect on transformed fibroblast populations, leading to cell death or selection for nonlethal mutants of the virus. These mutants retain expression of the kinase activity but have lost large portions of the carboxy terminus of the Abelson protein. To more precisely map the sequences involved in this lethal effect, we have isolated a series of site-directed deletions from a DNA clone of the P160 wild-type strain of A-MuLV. In addition, a number of unexpected, spontaneous deletions occurring during transfection of NIH 3T3 cells were isolated. These deletions result in expression of carboxy-terminal truncated forms of the A-MuLV protein ranging from 130,000 to 84,000 in molecular weight. Analysis of the transforming and lethal activities of each mutant recovered in its RNA viral form shows that the transformation-essential and lethal-essential sequences do not overlap.

Portions of the Ga-FeSV provirus, subcloned in the plasmid pBR322, were mutagenized by deletion or frameshift at XhoI restriction sites flanking the nucleotide sequences presumed to encode the GA-FeSV transforming polyprotein (P108(gag-fes)). The biological activity of subgenomic and reconstructed full-genome-length molecules was assayed by transfection and focus induction in NIH 3T3 cells. Both mutant and wild-type molecules containing the intact P108(gag-fes) coding region induced foci of transformed cells at efficiencies between 10(4) and 10(5) focus-forming units per pmol of DNA; a deletion mutant lacking 3'-terminal v-fes sequences was completely nontransforming in parallel assays. Representative subcloned foci of transformed NIH 3T3 cells synthesized P108(gag-fes) with associated in vitro protein kinase activity. Focus-forming viruses could be rescued from transformed subclones induced by full-length proviral DNA, but not from cells transformed by subgenomic DNA lacking a 3' long terminal repeat (LTR). It was concluded that: (i) nucleotide sequences encoding P108(gag-fes) and its associated kinase activity are responsible for transformation, (ii) the GA-FeSV 3' env and LTR sequences are not required for focus induction, and (iii) the 3' LTR is necessary for rescue of infectious FeSV RNA. A chimeric DNA containing the 5' LTR and P108(gag-fes) coding region of GA-FeSV joined to the 3' LTR of Moloney murine sarcoma virus was both transforming and rescuable at high efficiency. Restriction analysis showed that passaged stocks of rescued transforming virus contained Moloney murine sarcoma virus U3 sequences at both proviral DNA termini, consistent with generally accepted models for LTR formation during reverse transcription. Wild-type GA-FeSV and the chimeric virus (here designated as GAHT), each rescued from NIH 3T3 cells with the same amphotropic murine leukemia virus, yielded approximately equal numbers of foci when titrated on CCL 64 mink cells. By contrast, on mouse NIH 3T3 cells, the focus-forming titer of GAHT was 1 to 2 log higher than that of FeSV. The foci induced on NIH 3T3 cells by GAHT appeared earlier and were reproducibly larger than those induced by GA-FeSV. Differences in transforming activity on NIH 3T3 cells were also found using colony formation in agar, showing that the more rapid appearance and larger size of foci formed in liquid media were not due to virus spread. These data suggest that transcriptional control signals within the viral LTR regulate the levels of the transforming gene product in a species-specific manner.","['Even, J', 'Anderson, S J', 'Hampe, A', 'Galibert, F', 'Lowy, D', 'Khoury, G', 'Sherr, C J']","['Even J', 'Anderson SJ', 'Hampe A', 'Galibert F', 'Lowy D', 'Khoury G', 'Sherr CJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Helper Viruses/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology', '*Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Feline/*genetics']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1983 Mar;45(3):1004-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.45.3.1004-1016.1983.,['10.1128/JVI.45.3.1004-1016.1983 [doi]'],,PMC256508,,,,,,

This protein is a major component of avian myeloblastosis virus, accounting for over 7% of total protein, and thus is equimolar with the other internal structural proteins in virions. As described in the accompanying paper (Hunter et al., J. Virol. 45:885-888, 1983), the results of N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis identify the protein as a product of the gag gene. We suggest denoting this protein as p10, according to nomenclature that is already in use for a previously identified but poorly defined low-molecular-weight protein or proteins of avian sarcoma and leukemia viruses. In virions p10 appears to be located between the core and the membrane. Several of its properties may explain why p10 has not been characterized previously. Among these are its abnormal amino acid composition, its solubility under conditions where most proteins are fixed into sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and the variability in its electrophoretic migration in different avian sarcoma viruses.","['Pepinsky, R B', 'Vogt, V M']","['Pepinsky RB', 'Vogt VM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/analysis', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*analysis', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/*analysis', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Molecular Weight', 'Solubility', 'Viral Proteins/*isolation & purification']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1983 Feb;45(2):648-58. doi: 10.1128/JVI.45.2.648-658.1983.,['10.1128/JVI.45.2.648-658.1983 [doi]'],['CA 20081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC256459,,,,,,

These variants included 124-MSV, m1-MSV, and HT1-MSV and also the purportedly independent isolate Gazdar MSV. These four strains have an identical 5' junction between the murine leukemia virus env gene and the v-mos gene. This junction lies within the sixth codon of the chimeric env-mos coding region that encodes the transforming gene product. In contrast, at the 3' junction between the v-mos gene and the murine leukemia virus env gene, the three variants examined here were all different. A small deletion was found in the COOH-terminal portion of the m1-MSV env-mos coding region, indicating that the COOH terminus of this transforming gene product must be different from that of 124-MSV or HT1-MSV. The data presented here are consistent with the thesis that a virus closely related to HT1-MSV was the primordial Moloney MSV, and that all other related strains evolved from it by deletion or rearrangement. The variability observed in the Moloney MSV family is discussed in terms of possible mechanisms for the initial capture of mos sequences by the parental retrovirus and also in comparison with other transforming retrovirus families, such as Abelson murine leukemia virus and Rous sarcoma virus.","['Donoghue, D J', 'Hunter, T']","['Donoghue DJ', 'Hunter T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Codon', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1983 Feb;45(2):607-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.45.2.607-617.1983.,['10.1128/JVI.45.2.607-617.1983 [doi]'],"['CA-14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17096/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC256455,,,"['GENBANK/J00371', 'GENBANK/J00372', 'GENBANK/K03105', 'GENBANK/K03106', 'GENBANK/K03107', 'GENBANK/K03108', 'GENBANK/K03109']",,,

Sankar-Mistry and P. Jolicoeur, J. Virol.35:270-275, 1980). Biological characterization of five of these new primary radiation leukemia viruses (RadLVs) indicated that they had a B-tropic, fibrotropic, and ecotropic host range and were leukemogenic when reinjected into C57BL/Ka newborn mice. The leukemogenic potential of one isolate (G(6)T(2)) was further assessed and shown to be retained after prolonged passaging on fibroblasts in vitro. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the DNA of four of our new RadLV isolates (G(6)T(2), Ti-7, Ti-8, and Ti-9) revealed that G(6)T(2) and Ti-7 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) genomes had identical restriction maps, whereas Ti-8 and Ti-9 genomes were different from each other and from the G(6)T(2) and Ti-7 genomes. The physical maps of these genomes were similar to that of known ecotropic MuLV genomes (including the C57BL/Ka endogenous ecotropic MuLV) within their long terminal repeats, env, the right portion of pol, and the left portion of gag. However, a region covering the end of gag and the beginning of pol was different and showed several similarities with xenotropic MuLV genomes of BALB/c, AKR, and C58 mice previously mapped. Our results suggest that these primary RadLV genomes are recombinants between the parental ecotropic MuLV genome and a nonecotropic (xenotropic) sequence. This nonecotropic gag-pol region might be important in conferring the leukemogenic potential to these isolates. Therefore, these RadLVs appear to form a new class of leukemogenic recombinant MuLVs recovered from leukemic tissues of mice. They appear to be distinct from the recombinant AKR mink cell focus-inducing MuLVs which have a dual-tropic host range and harbor xenotropic env sequences. To further study the leukemogenic potential of these RadLVs, the genome of one of them (G(6)T(2)) was cloned in Charon 21A as an infectious molecule.","['Rassart, E', 'Sankar-Mistry, P', 'Lemay, G', 'DesGroseillers, L', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Rassart E', 'Sankar-Mistry P', 'Lemay G', 'DesGroseillers L', 'Jolicoeur P']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/*microbiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*microbiology', 'Thymoma/*microbiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*microbiology']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1983 Feb;45(2):565-75. doi: 10.1128/JVI.45.2.565-575.1983.,['10.1128/JVI.45.2.565-575.1983 [doi]'],,PMC256450,,,,,,

Only one copy of the U3 tandem direct repeat was conserved in the Gross A virus LTR, and it was rearranged by the insertion of a 36-base-pair sequence and by five point mutations.

The data indicate that, in the absence of infection, such inhibition can be reversed by the addition to cultures of relatively high concentrations of fluids rich in T cell growth factor (TCGF) activity. The ability of these fluids to achieve such reversal of inhibition is both concentration- and time-dependent. Addition of the factor to virus co-incubated cells more than 26 hr after culture initiation does not restore responsiveness. We have also shown that virus co-incubated cultures are deficient with respect to their ability to synthesize detectable levels of TCGF activity in the presence of phytohemagglutinin. In contrast, the use of relatively dilute virus preparations (less than 10 particles per cell) permits partial responsiveness to lectin as well as the synthesis of moderate levels of TCGF. These finding suggest that viral inhibition of lymphocyte mitogenesis is mediated directly or indirectly by interference with the synthesis of functionally active TCGF activity.","['Wainberg, M A', 'Vydelingum, S', 'Margolese, R G']","['Wainberg MA', 'Vydelingum S', 'Margolese RG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Chick Embryo', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Hylobates', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Sarcoma, Avian/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",1983/05/01 00:00,1983/05/01 00:01,['1983/05/01 00:00'],"['1983/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1983 May;130(5):2372-8.,,,,,,,,,

In confirmation of earlier results, the expression of B2 was found to be restricted to a relatively narrow portion of the B cell maturation pathway. Non-B cell-derived lines were uniformly negative. Hybrids derived from the fusion of highly B2-positive and B2-negative or low B2 expressing lines of B cell origin were B2-positive. In contrast, fusion of B2-positive Burkitt lymphoma lines with the primitive human erythroleukemia line K562 resulted in the complete extinction of B2 expression. These findings are in line with the expected behavior of a B cell differentiation marker. EBV conversion of the EBV-negative, B2-negative Ramos lymphoma line by the transforming B95-8 substrain of the virus regularly induced the expression of B2, whereas conversion with the nontransforming P3HR-1 substrain had no such effect, in spite of the continued presence of EBV-DNA and EBNA in both types of EBV-converted sublines. The possibility that B2 induction may reflect the action of the transforming gene(s), present in B95-8 but deleted from the P3HR-1 virus, and the implications of this possibility for the functional mapping of the EBV genome are discussed.","['Klein, G', 'Ehlin-Henriksson, B', 'Schlossman, S F']","['Klein G', 'Ehlin-Henriksson B', 'Schlossman SF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1983 Apr;130(4):1985-9.,,['1 R01 CA 30264-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

There are about 1.6 X 10(5) binding sites per cell surface, exhibiting a KD of about 10(-9) M. Upon warming cells to 37 degrees C there is a rapid increase in uptake to a steady state level of twice that obtained at 0 degree C. This is accounted for by internalization of the ligand as shown by the development of resistance to either acid wash or protease treatment of the ligand-cell association. After a minimum residency time of 4-5 min, undegraded transferrin is released from the cell. Internalization is rapid but is dependent upon cell surface occupancy; at occupancies of 20% or greater the rate coefficient is maximal at about 0.1-0.2 min-1. In the absence of externally added ligand only 50% of the internalized transferrin completes the cycle and is released to the medium with a rate coefficient of 0.05 min-1. The remaining transferrin can be released from the cell only by the addition of ligand, suggesting a tight coupling between cell surface binding, internalization, and release of internalized ligand. There is a loss of cell surface-binding capacity that accompanies transferrin internalization. At low (less than 50%) occupancy this loss is monotonic with the extent of internalization. Even at saturating levels of transferrin, the loss of surface receptors upon internalization never exceeds 60-70% of the initial binding capacity. This suggests that receptors enter the cell with ligand but are replaced so as to maintain a constant, albeit reduced, receptor number on the cell surface. In the absence of ligand, the cell surface receptor number returns at 37 degrees C. Neither sodium azide nor NH4Cl blocks internalization of ligand. However, they both prevent the release of transferrin from the cell thus halting the transferrin cycle. Excess ligand can overcome the block due to NH4Cl but not azide although the cycle is markedly slower. Iron is delivered to these cells by transferrin at 37 degrees C with a rate coefficient of 0.15 to 0.2 min-1. The iron is released from the transferrin and the majority is found in intracellular ferritin. There is a large internal receptor pool comprising 70 to 80% of the total cell receptors and this may be involved in maintaining the steady state iron uptake.","['Klausner, R D', 'Van Renswoude, J', 'Ashwell, G', 'Kempf, C', 'Schechter, A N', 'Dean, A', 'Bridges, K R']","['Klausner RD', 'Van Renswoude J', 'Ashwell G', 'Kempf C', 'Schechter AN', 'Dean A', 'Bridges KR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Azides)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Sodium Azide', 'Time Factors', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1983/04/25 00:00,1983/04/25 00:01,['1983/04/25 00:00'],"['1983/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1983 Apr 25;258(8):4715-24.,['S0021-9258(18)32481-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

Angiosarcomas appeared as localized foci of proliferating cells in the lungs as early as 2 weeks posthatch, and by 6 weeks, the lungs of the infected chickens were frequently filled with tumor cells. Between 3 and 10 weeks of age, 80% of infected chickens died of the angiosarcomas; the 20% which lived 8 weeks or longer had small lung lesions and also developed fibrosarcomas, osteopetrosis, nephroblastoma, and lymphoid leukosis. Chickens with lung tumors were cyanotic, had breathing difficulty, and had packed cell volumes in excess of 50%. Other changes not necessarily correlated with lung tumor mass were stunting, lymphoid organ involution, and profuse diarrhea. Ring-necked pheasant virus has a genome RNA of 8.2 kb. This observation, together with its replication and disease induction after repeated plaque purification, suggests that ring-necked pheasant virus is a replication-competent avian retrovirus.

Eleven antibodies were characterized for their reactivity with a variety of normal and leukemic cells of the myeloid, B- and T-lymphoid and of the erythroid cell lineage. Using several methods, they could be subdivided into five distinct types: I. Four antibodies were specific for the myeloid lineage, predominantly reacting with immature myeloid cells. II. One antibody reacted with mature and immature myeloid cells as well as with T-lymphoid cells. III. Four antibodies reacted with myeloid, erythroid and T-lymphoid cells. IV. One antibody reacted with myeloid as well as with T- and B-lymphoid cells. V. One antibody reacted with all kinds of chicken hematopoietic cells except erythrocytes. The first type of antibodies detected glycoproteins with MWs of 170 and 130 kD. The pattern of antigens precipitated varied with the different monoclonal antibodies of this group.

Three clones were at the pre-B cell stage of maturation prior to A-MuLV infection; two were at the B cell stage, and one appeared to represent a stage prior to rearrangement of the mu heavy chain gene. All six cloned lines could be transformed by Abelson virus. Many of the transformants of the pre-B cell clones underwent kappa light chain gene rearrangement and expression following viral infection. Distinct light chain gene rearrangements were segregated by further subcloning these transformed lines. Abelson virus infection of one cloned cell line believed to represent a stage of maturation prior to the pre-B cell stage produced pre-B cell transformants with a variety of heavy chain gene rearrangements. Thus B lymphoid target cells for Abelson virus are not restricted to a single developmental stage, and some transformed subclones can undergo extensive immunoglobulin gene rearrangements shortly after viral infection.","['Whitlock, C A', 'Ziegler, S F', 'Treiman, L J', 'Stafford, J I', 'Witte, O N']","['Whitlock CA', 'Ziegler SF', 'Treiman LJ', 'Stafford JI', 'Witte ON']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)'],IM,"['*Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell. 1983 Mar;32(3):903-11. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(83)90075-2.,"['0092-8674(83)90075-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(83)90075-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Using a human lymphoblastoid T-cell line (HSB) which reportedly carries a transferrin receptor and which we showed to be TCA-2 positive by serology, it appeared that only a TCA-2 but not a TCA-1 specific alloantiserum had the capacity to precipitate a protein with a molecular weight of 94,000, which comigrated exactly with the Mr 94,000 protein precipitated by the rabbit anti-HSB and rabbit anti-SB antisera, as well as the transferrin receptor which was precipitated by a transferrin-antitransferrin complex. The positive sera and the latter complex were shown to cross-react in a binding assay. Conversely, a monospecific TCA-1 alloantiserum was shown to react with the Mr 94,000 protein of TCA-1-positive leukocyte suspensions. The allelomorphism of the transferrin receptor may be relevant for the eventual regulatory mechanism controlling cell proliferation, which would be essential at least for those cells that are supposed to play an immunological role like the TCA-positive cells which are described as T-cells probably involved in the process of immunosuppression. In addition, we found increasing amounts of autoantibodies with TCA-1 specificity in serum from a healthy individual (referred to as ""donor"" in this paper), whose brother at the same time suffered a chronic myeloid leukemia, probably associated with a retrovirus, and whose blood in contrast was shown to contain cytotoxic anti-TCB, from a diallelic locus expressed on theophylline-insensitive T-cells, and anti-B-cell activity.","['Derks, J P', 'Hofmans, L', 'Bruning, H W', 'van Rood, J J']","['Derks JP', 'Hofmans L', 'Bruning HW', 'van Rood JJ']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', '*Diseases in Twins', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/*analysis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Male', 'Molecular Weight', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transferrin/*analysis', '*Twins', '*Twins, Monozygotic']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Apr;43(4):1914-20.,,,,,,,,,

Clinically this coexpression can help to subclassify leukemias and may be of diagnostic and prognostic significance. In an attempt to study the mechanism underlying this simultaneous expression plasmamembrane subfractionation was undertaken on Nalm-1.

The predominant part of this antigen is still on the intact cells remaining after the shedding procedure.

The plasma membrane was characterized by a high cholesterol to phospholipid molar ratio (0.626), a 2-fold enrichment in sphingomyelin and in phosphatidylserine as compared to the whole cell and by the complete absence of diphosphatidylglycerol. (2) When compared to the phospholipid composition of the mature mouse erythrocyte membrane, the plasma membrane of the Friend cell only differs by a higher phosphatidylcholine and a lower phosphatidylethanolamine content, whereas the levels of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylinositol plus phosphatidylserine are similar. (3) Friend cells were treated with sphingomyelinase C (S. aureus) under non-lytic conditions and subsequently submitted to subcellular fractionation. The results showed that the plasma membrane accounted for 38.5% of the total phospholipid, 64.1% of the total cholesterol and about 4.4% of the total protein content of Friend cells. (4) Sphingomyelin appeared to be asymmetrically distributed in the plasma membrane of Friend cells, with about 85% of this phospholipid being present in the outer monolayer.","['Rawyler, A J', 'Roelofsen, B', 'Op den Kamp, J A', 'Van Deenen, L L']","['Rawyler AJ', 'Roelofsen B', 'Op den Kamp JA', 'Van Deenen LL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Membrane/*analysis', 'Cholesterol/analysis', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/analysis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*ultrastructure', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/*metabolism']",1983/04/21 00:00,1983/04/21 00:01,['1983/04/21 00:00'],"['1983/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1983 Apr 21;730(1):130-8. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(83)90325-5.,"['0005-2736(83)90325-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(83)90325-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Like other transforming viruses, SSV contains sequences derived from its helper virus, simian sarcoma-associated virus (SSAV), and a cell-derived (v-sis) insertion sequence. By comparison with the sequence of Moloney murine leukemia virus, it was possible to precisely localize and define sequences contributed by SSAV during the generation of SSV. Comparative sequence analysis of SSV and SSAV showed that SSAV provides regulatory sequences for initiation and termination of transcription of the SSV transforming gene.

The distribution of tumors pointed out previously as the characteristic of the adult type of leukosis was observed in 27 adult cases, which, except two, were positive for the immunodiffusion test of bovine leukemia virus (BLV). The noticeable development of massive and lumpy tumors in serosa, loose connective tissue, and lymph nodes seemed to suggest a neoplastic accumulation in areas related to the lymphatic way. Splenic involvement and intrasinusoidal leukotic immigration in the liver were present in cases with the leukemic manifestation of peripheral blood. The neoplastic involvement of bone marrow, however, was difficult to find.

The hepatic lesion was characterized by the neoplastic proliferation in the portal triads No BLV antibody could be detected from these cattle, except one adult. As the conclusion of the present study, the tumor of adult type regarded as the pathologic manifestation of enzootic bovine leukosis is defined as malignant lymphoma (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or lymphosarcoma) of undifferentiated-, histiocytic-, or poorly- differentiated lymphocytic- cell type.

The oncogenic potential of the virus is mediated by the gene v-myc, acquired from sequences (c-myc) present in normal uninfected chicken DNA. Sequences closely related to chicken c-myc have been highly conserved throughout evolution, from Drosophila to vertebrates. The hypothesis that c-myc may be involved in neoplastic transformation has been strengthened by the finding that B-cell lymphomas induced in chickens by avian leukosis virus (ALV) are often associated with increased expression of c-myc resulting from integration of the ALV provirus adjacent to the c-myc gene. More recently, it has been demonstrated that the malignant human cell line HL-60, derived from the peripheral blood leukocytes of a patient with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, expresses elevated levels of myc-related mRNA associated with an amplification of the c-myc gene. To explore the relationship of the human cellular myc gene with the corresponding viral oncogene from MC29, and to provide a framework for the analysis of the mechanism and significance of c-myc amplification in human tumours, we have isolated and determined the nucleotide sequence of a genomic clone prepared from a normal human library which contains all domains sharing homology with v-myc.","['Colby, W W', 'Chen, E Y', 'Smith, D H', 'Levinson, A D']","['Colby WW', 'Chen EY', 'Smith DH', 'Levinson AD']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Genes', 'Humans', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein Biosynthesis']",1983/02/24 00:00,1983/02/24 00:01,['1983/02/24 00:00'],"['1983/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1983 Feb 24;301(5902):722-5. doi: 10.1038/301722a0.,['10.1038/301722a0 [doi]'],,,,,['GENBANK/J00120'],,,

Selective solubilization and purity of BLV p12 and FeLV p10 was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The compositions and molecular weights were determined by amino acid analysis. An abundance of lysine and arginine residues along with their size identifies both BLV p12 and FeLV p10 as small basic proteins similar to well-defined type C viral nucleoproteins. NH2-terminal degradation by the semiautomated Edman method provided the sequence of the first 40 amino acids for both proteins. The putative nucleic acid binding site found in several type C viral nucleoproteins was contained within this sequence, with the most homology centered around an eight-amino acid region involving seven identical residues and one substitution. Antisera were developed in rabbits, and specificity and titers were determined by electroblotting and immunoautoradiography. By this technique, an immunological cross-reaction was found between BLV p12 and FeLV p10. The shared antigenic determinant most likely exists in the highly conserved eight-amino acid region. Although this sequence is also highly conserved in the nucleic acid-binding proteins of murine leukemia viruses, the shared antigenic determinant is not found in these or any other type C viruses tested. It is suggested that substitution of arginine (BLV p12/FeLV p10) to lysine (murine leukemia virus p10) is sufficient to elicit a change in antibody specificity.","['Morgan, M A', 'Copeland, T D', 'Oroszlan, S']","['Morgan MA', 'Copeland TD', 'Oroszlan S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Autoradiography', 'Cross Reactions', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*analysis/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*analysis/immunology', 'Retroviridae/*analysis', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1983 Apr;46(1):177-86. doi: 10.1128/JVI.46.1.177-186.1983.,['10.1128/JVI.46.1.177-186.1983 [doi]'],['N01-C0-75380/PHS HHS/United States'],PMC255106,,,,,,

Greater than an eightfold variation was observed in the amount of this DNA, with the largest amounts being found in cells that were resistant to the induction of differentiation by DMSO. This increase in the level of extrachromosomal viral DNA was found to be dependent upon the continued presence of DMSO in the culture medium. The increase was shown not to be due to an immediate stimulatory effect of this agent on the synthesis or maintenance of this DNA, since cell lines sensitive to the differentiation-inducing effects of DMSO were shown to undergo a transient reduction in the amount of extrachromosomal viral DNA after the addition of DMSO to the culture medium. In addition to the 6.3-kilobase-pair linear form found in the cytoplasm, in some preparations two hybridizing bands were observed that migrated in agarose gels in the position expected of covalently closed circular species of viral DNA. Restriction enzyme mapping of the cytoplasmic linear form indicated a close relationship of this DNA to two polycythemic strains of spleen focus-forming virus that have been molecularly cloned by other workers. No obvious change in the number or arrangement of chromosomal viral sequences could be detected after treating cells with DMSO.

Using such antisera, we have been able to characterize the erbB gene product as a 68,000 molecular weight protein.

In both cases the type of leukemia induced is independent of the subgroup of the helper virus used. E26-transformed erythroid and myeloid cells can each be propagated selectively from explanted leukemic cells with media supplemented with factors that promote the growth either of normal chicken erythroid precursors or of myeloid progenitor cells. E26 also induces the outgrowth of transformed cells from bone marrow cells infected in vitro. These cells are also either erythroid or myeloid, depending on the culture conditions employed. Most of the erythroid cells transformed by E26 are erythroblast-like, but a significant number are more mature, including erythrocyte-like cells as well as some cells that appear to be aberrant in differentiation. Both erythroid and myeloid E26-transformed cells produce infectious virus and express P135 E26, the putative (gag-myb-x) transforming protein of the virus.

This suggests that plasma or urine cGMP could be used as an additional parameter to monitor the patient's response to treatment.","['Peracchi, M', 'Lombardi, L', 'Maiolo, A T', 'Bamonti-Catena, F', 'Toschi, V', 'Chiorboli, O', 'Mozzana, R', 'Polli, E E']","['Peracchi M', 'Lombardi L', 'Maiolo AT', 'Bamonti-Catena F', 'Toschi V', 'Chiorboli O', 'Mozzana R', 'Polli EE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Nucleotides, Cyclic)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Hypochromic/metabolism', 'Cholelithiasis/metabolism', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cyclic GMP/blood/urine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleotides, Cyclic/*metabolism', 'Peptic Ulcer/metabolism']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1983 Mar;61(3):429-34.,['S0006-4971(20)85654-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

Among systemic diseases, the two main causes are coagulation disorders and hemoglobinopathies. Coagulation disorders may be either acquired (leukemia, thrombopenia, and hypoprothrombinemia induced by anticoagulant drugs with hemarthrosis being one of the major complications) or inherited (hemophilia which is not considered here, von Willebrand disease, and congenital thrombopathies). Hemoglobinopathies, particularly sickle-cell disease, are responsible for hemarthrosis in a few patients. Among local or regional disorders of the bones or joints, tumors such as hemangioma or synovial sarcoma are uncommon causes. Hemarthrosis is the main feature of pigmented villonodular synovitis. Hemarthrosis may occur in degenerative and metabolic diseases: while it is extremely rare in arthritis, it is frequently encountered in articular chondrocalcinosis which is the first diagnosis to consider when hemarthrosis occurs in an elderly patient. The search for an etiology, which is often difficult, should include a review of prior illnesses, a study of coagulation, and local clinical, radiological and biological investigations, with a study of the synovial fluid; in some instances, arthroscopy, synovial biopsy and even surgical exploration are required. Management includes rest, analgesics, antiinflammatory drugs and, above all, arthrocentesis which is essential for the prevention of articular damage and functional sequellae. Specific therapy is dependent on the etiology. In recurrent hemarthrosis, isotopic synoviorthesis may ensure lasting resolution of the effusion.","['Faux, N', 'Manigand, G']","['Faux N', 'Manigand G']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Sem Hop,La semaine des hopitaux : organe fonde par l'Association d'enseignement medical des hopitaux de Paris,9410059,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/complications', 'Cartilage Diseases/complications', 'Hemarthrosis/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Joint Diseases/complications', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Synovial Membrane']",1982/11/11 00:00,1982/11/11 00:01,['1982/11/11 00:00'],"['1982/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sem Hop. 1982 Nov 11;58(41):2367-73.,,,,"Hemarthroses spontanees de l'adolescent et de l'adulte, en dehors de l'hemophilie.",90,,,,

Data on 525 patients who received allogeneic marrow transplants during a 10-year period were reviewed.

Cytomegaloviral pneumonia (85 cases) and idiopathic pneumonia (63 cases) occurred most commonly. The incidence of pneumonia was higher among older patients, among patients who received transplants because of hematologic malignancy, and among patients with aplastic anemia who received total-body irradiation or procarbazine plus antithymocyte globulin for conditioning before transplantation. The development of cytomegaloviral pneumonia was unrelated to the serologic characteristics of either the patient or the donor before transplantation, and an increase in the titer of antibody to cytomegalovirus did not significantly improve the chances for survival. Mortality from all forms of pneumonia was high.

DBA/2J mice homozygous for the reverse mutation to wild type at the dilute locus (d+2J) lack ecotropic virus-specific sequences, suggesting that the dilute mutation was caused by virus integration. In the experiments described here, we analyzed the ecotropic MuLV DNA content of mice that collectively carry 10 different alleles at the agouti coat color locus (of chromosome 2) to determine whether any of these alleles also are associated with ecotropic virus sequences. Of the 10 alleles analyzed, one allele, lethal yellow (Ay), which is carried congeneically and heterozygously on C57BL/6J, 129/Sv, and LT/Sv mice, was closely associated with an ecotropic MuLV provirus. The close association of this provirus with the Ay allele suggests that this mutation also may be caused by virus integration.

As part of our initial study designed to analyze gene(s) specifically activated by HTLV infection, we have isolated a recombinant DNA clone by differential screening of a cDNA library made from mRNA of a human T-cell lymphoma cell line producing HTLV. This cDNA identifies a single-copy gene in all human DNAs and a single mRNA species of 2.3 kilobases expressed at several hundred copies per cell in five HTLV-positive neoplastic T-cell lines. In addition, cord blood T lymphocytes infected with HTLV, but not the uninfected counterparts, express high levels of mRNA from this gene. A survey of different human hematopoietic cell types showed that this gene is expressed at low or undetectable levels (less than 10 copies) in human T, B, myeloid, or erythroid cell lines; in moderate amounts in lymphoid precursor (immature) cell lines; and in high amounts in lectin-activated mature T-cells, comparable to those of HTLV-infected T-cell lines.

The resistant hybrid mice showed markedly higher resistance to the L1210 sublines than to the L1210 parent lymphoma cells. Experiments with F1 mice between DBA/2 (H-2d) and certain congeneic intra-H-2 recombinant strains showed that the H-2b/d heterozygosity at the H-2K+l-A regions and additional non-H-2 genetic factor(s) confer the resistance to the F1 mice. The resistance was abolished by treating host animals with injections of silica, an antimacrophage agent, or rabbit anti-mouse thymocyte serum.

No xenotropic or recombinant viruses were isolated by cocultivation techniques. RFV is N-tropic, and RFM/Un cells possess the Fv-1n allele, as indicated by restriction of B-tropic virus and susceptibility to Gross strain N-tropic virus. However, RFM cells are highly resistant to RFV and other endogenous N-tropic viruses. This resistance is expressed by two-hit titration kinetics and by inhibition of viral linear duplex DNA formation. This is similar to the effects of the Fv-1 locus, but preliminary work has shown no apparent genetic linkage between the two restrictions. The relative strength of the restriction, the presence of a single class of ecotropic virus, and the absence of recombinant viruses suggest that in RFM mice virus is expressed only in cells in which it is induced and not by cell-to-cell transmission.","['Tennant, R W', 'Otten, J A', 'Wang, T W', 'Liou, R S', 'Brown, A', 'Yang, W K']","['Tennant RW', 'Otten JA', 'Wang TW', 'Liou RS', 'Brown A', 'Yang WK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/microbiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', '*Genes', 'Idoxuridine/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', '*Virus Activation']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1983 Jan;45(1):47-54. doi: 10.1128/JVI.45.1.47-54.1983.,['10.1128/JVI.45.1.47-54.1983 [doi]'],['YO1 CP 60500/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC256385,,,,,,

We determined the nucleotide sequence of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) and the 3' end of env, and we compared the sequences to corresponding sequences of the genome of Akv virus, the putative ecotropic parent of MCF 247. By analogy with Moloney leukemia virus, we identified the amino terminus of Prp15E, the C-terminal proteolytic cleavage product of env and precursor to mature virion p15E. In MCF 247 the presumptive Prp15E is encoded by a 603-nucleotide open reading frame. The majority of this sequence is identical to that of Akv. However, a recombination event near the 3' end of the Prp15E-coding region introduces nonecotropic sequences into MCF 247, and these extend to the 3' end through the U3 portion of the LTR. The U3 regions of Akv and MCF 247 are about 83% homologous. The R and U5 regions of the LTR of MCF 247 and Akv are identical. Large RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotides analyzed previously in numerous ecotropic and MCF viral genomes were located within the Akv and MCF 247 DNA sequences. The resulting precise T1 oligonucleotide maps of the 3' ends of MCF viral genomes reveal that the biologically defined, leukemogenic class I MCFs isolated from thymic neoplasms of inbred mice all share the sequence pattern seen in MCF 247, a representative of this group; they possess recombinant Prp15E genes and derive U3 from their nonecotropic parents.","['Kelly, M', 'Holland, C A', 'Lung, M L', 'Chattopadhyay, S K', 'Lowy, D R', 'Hopkins, N H']","['Kelly M', 'Holland CA', 'Lung ML', 'Chattopadhyay SK', 'Lowy DR', 'Hopkins NH']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1983 Jan;45(1):291-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.45.1.291-298.1983.,['10.1128/JVI.45.1.291-298.1983 [doi]'],"['CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC256411,,,['GENBANK/J02249'],,,

We found that leukemogenic MCF viruses from thymus differed from non-leukemogenic MCFs isolated from nonthymic neoplasms in nucleotide sequences encoding Prp15E and the U3 portion of the long terminal repeat (LTR). The thymic isolates possessed recombinant Prp15E genes, with the 5' to mid portion derived from their ecotropic parents and the extreme 3' portion invariably derived from their nonecotropic parents. These viruses probably derived the entire U3 portion of their LTRs from their nonecotropic parents. The nonthymic MCFs appeared to inherit their entire Prp15E coding region from their nonecotropic parents. We failed to detect consistent differences in gp70-coding sequences between the two groups of MCFs, but this may simply reflect limitations of the data. The studies presented here, in conjunction with studies from a number of labs indicating a role for MCF gp70 in leukemogenesis, indicate that three genetic elements, gp70, p15E, and the U3 portion of the LTR, may all play a role in determining the leukemogenic phenotype of type C viruses of high-leukemic inbred mice.","['Lung, M L', 'Hartley, J W', 'Rowe, W P', 'Hopkins, N H']","['Lung ML', 'Hartley JW', 'Rowe WP', 'Hopkins NH']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.27.3 (Ribonuclease T1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Oligoribonucleotides/analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Ribonuclease T1', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1983 Jan;45(1):275-90. doi: 10.1128/JVI.45.1.275-290.1983.,['10.1128/JVI.45.1.275-290.1983 [doi]'],"['F32-CA06511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA26717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC256410,,,,,,

By measuring the changes in globin synthesis after infection, we have determined whether expression of the viral genome precedes the shutoff of host protein synthesis or whether the inhibitor molecule enters the cells as part of the virion. HSV-2-induced shutoff of host protein synthesis was insensitive to the effects of shortwave (254-nm) UV light and actinomycin D. Both of the treatments inhibited HSV-1-induced host protein shutoff. Likewise, treatment of HSV-1 with the cross-linking agent 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen and longwave (360-nm) UV light prevented HSV-1 from inhibiting cellular protein synthesis. Treatment of HSV-2 with 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen did not affect the ability of the virus to interfere with host protein synthesis, except at the highest doses of longwave UV light. It was determined that the highest longwave UV dosage damaged the HSV-2 virion as well as cross-linking the viral DNA. The results suggest that HSV-2 uses a virion-associated component to inhibit host protein synthesis and that HSV-1 requires the expression of the viral genome to cause cellular protein synthesis shutoff.","['Hill, T M', 'Sinden, R R', 'Sadler, J R']","['Hill TM', 'Sinden RR', 'Sadler JR']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'Y6UY8OV51T (Trioxsalen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Simplexvirus/classification/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Trioxsalen/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1983 Jan;45(1):241-50. doi: 10.1128/JVI.45.1.241-250.1983.,['10.1128/JVI.45.1.241-250.1983 [doi]'],['1-RO1-A1-14592-03/PHS HHS/United States'],PMC256407,,,,,,

The emergence of zoster, therefore, was associated with the appearance of previously undetectable antibodies to VZV-specific proteins.","['Grose, C']",['Grose C'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Child', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Herpes Zoster/complications/*immunology', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*immunology', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Infect Dis. 1983 Jan;147(1):47-56. doi: 10.1093/infdis/147.1.47.,['10.1093/infdis/147.1.47 [doi]'],['AI 14604/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

At higher concentrations, EHNA alone is inhibitory to LMC with an IC50 of 160 microM. This inhibition is reversible upon washout, appears to affect an early stage of the lytic process, and does not appear to involve changes in basal levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate pool sizes, S-adenosylhomocysteine levels, or protein carboxymethylation. EHNA does enhance the cAMP response of cytolytic lymphocytes (CL) to activators of adenylate cyclase such as prostaglandin E1. EHNA inhibits lymphocyte high-affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase at immunosuppressive levels, exhibiting hyperbolic mixed-type inhibition (Ki = 83 microM, alpha = 0.47, beta = 0.18). Whereas inhibition of intralymphocytic ADA is complete at low concentrations (less than 25 microM) of EHNA, inhibition of LMC and intralymphocytic cAMP phosphodiesterase increases linearly with EHNA concentration to at least 200 microM. The presence of 200 microM EHNA during the centrifugation of mixtures of CL and EL4 leukemia target cells leads to increased CL cAMP levels. 2'-Deoxycoformycin, a more potent ADA inhibitor than EHNA, is not inhibitory to LMC and shows none of these cAMP-related effects. These results suggest that CL-target cell contact stimulates adenylate cyclase in the CL and that EHNA inhibits LMC due to its enhancement of this target cell-stimulated elevation of cAMP.","['Duncan, G S', 'Wolberg, G', 'Schmitges, C J', 'Deeprose, R D', 'Zimmerman, T P']","['Duncan GS', 'Wolberg G', 'Schmitges CJ', 'Deeprose RD', 'Zimmerman TP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunopharmacol,Journal of immunopharmacology,7901853,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '59262-86-1 (9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunopharmacol. 1982;4(1-2):79-100. doi: 10.3109/08923978209031077.,['10.3109/08923978209031077 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Subcellular fractionation studies of mature HL-60 cells showed that cytochrome b had a dual distribution within the cell. The lighter peak of activity was associated with the plasma membrane markers, adenylate cyclase and receptors for the N- formal-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (f-Met-Leu-Phe) peptide. The denser components localized with the mitochondria but were distinct from mitochondrial cytochromes because whereas the activity of cytochrome c oxidase fell during HL-60 cell maturation, that of this cytochrome b was markedly increased. Concentrations of myeloperoxidase were unrelated to activity of the oxidase system and decreased as the cell matured. The increase in the concentrations of cytochrome b with cellular maturation parallelled the increase in the stimulated nonmitochondrial respiratory activity of these cells. The turnover of the hexose monophosphate shunt of immature cells was increased by the oxidising agents, methylene blue and tert-butylhydroperoxide, indicating that these immature cells have stimulated nonmitochondrial respiratory activity by maturing HL-60 cells is associated with, and is probably dependent upon, the acquisition by these cells of the cytochrome b(-245) oxidase system.","['Roberts, P J', 'Cross, A R', 'Jones, O T', 'Segal, A W']","['Roberts PJ', 'Cross AR', 'Jones OT', 'Segal AW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Cytochrome b Group)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cytochrome b Group/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*enzymology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1982/12/01 00:00,1982/12/01 00:01,['1982/12/01 00:00'],"['1982/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1982 Dec;95(3):720-6. doi: 10.1083/jcb.95.3.720.,['10.1083/jcb.95.3.720 [doi]'],,PMC2112933,,,,,,

Furthermore, the binding inhibition demonstrated in this system correlates to enhanced clonogenic survival of these cells, indicating that very few atoms of 211At/cell are required for cell death. Data obtained from labelled antibody injected into mice show that the labelled product in serum retains the ability to bind to HL60 cells in vitro, although tissue distributions of the injected activity implies that some of the radiolabel is lost from the protein. Despite this loss of label, preliminary experiments on the localization of labelled antibody to HL60 cells growing s/c in nude mice show that tumor tissue has a higher specific activity than all other tissues, other than blood, after 12 hours.

Only in recent years, however, has the evidence in support of this contention begun to appear convincing, and this has followed from the application of developments in cytogenetic techniques. The advent of methods for revealing specific bands in the human metaphase complement has enabled all the chromosomes and many chromosomal regions to be unambiguously identified, and the recent application of prophase banding methods gives further improvements in resolution. With these techniques, specific constitutional chromosomal deletions or translocations have been discovered in inherited cases of retinoblastoma (del.13q14), Wilms' tumour with aniridia (del.11p13) and renal-cell carcinoma (t(3:8) (p21:q24)), in which each of the chromosomal changes appears to be a dominant factor in inheriting a predisposition to a tissue-specific tumour. A heritability for cancer predisposition is also associated with the inherited chromosomal instability syndromes of Bloom's, Fanconi's anaemia and ataxia telangiectasia, although specific chromosomal changes have not been reported to be associated with the neoplasms in such individuals, except in some cases of lymphoma and leukaemia in ataxia telangiectasia.

Stimulation of tumor cell growth in vitro by spleen cells from immunized animals.,875-83,"We have evaluated the stimulation of target cell growth in vitro by spleen cells from mice which were immunized with polyoma-transformed cells and other tumor and non-tumor antigens. Stimulation was particularly seen under conditions of immunization that were suboptimal for the production of specific cytotoxicity. Significant stimulation of polyoma target cell growth was observed by lymphocytes from mice immunized against 10(5) Py 4198 tumor cells. This stimulation of target cell growth was not confined to polyoma-transformed cells only. Cells transformed by SV40, H-MuSV and non-transformed cells like 3T3 and embryo fibroblasts were also stimulated. Immunization of mice with syngeneic embryo fibroblasts also resulted in stimulation of tumor cell growth by the spleen cells from the immunized mice. However, the growth stimulation was less consistent and did not occur in all target cells tested. The specificity of immunostimulation was further studied with the Moloney sarcoma virus (M-MuSV) system; an antigenically distinct tumor system. Spleen cells from M-MuSV tumor-bearing mice stimulated cell growth in vitro not only against MuSV-transformed cells but also with SV40-transformed and polyoma-transformed cells as targets.

Although possessing the EB virus receptor, CLL cells were generally refractory (vis-a-vis normal adult B cells) to the full effects of the viral infection. All the leukaemic populations tested developed a small proportion of EBNA positive cells within a few days post-infection, but in most instances this disappeared with no subsequent evidence of viral activity. In certain cases, however, the EBNA staining became more intense, involving a larger fraction of the population and persisting for some weeks, but again this was not accompanied by virus-induced immunoglobulin synthesis or transformation. In contrast, the leukaemic cells from a single patient, tested on three separate occasions, regularly responded to EB virus infection with the rapid establishment of an EBNA positive B cell line in which the restricted pattern of surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin expression (gamma lambda) exactly matched that present on the original leukaemic cells.","['Rickinson, A B', 'Finerty, S', 'Epstein, M A']","['Rickinson AB', 'Finerty S', 'Epstein MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Nucleoproteins/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Receptors, Complement/analysis', 'Transfection']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1982 Nov;50(2):347-54.,,,PMC1536694,,,,,,

The RNCl2 derivatives could undergo a reaction that resulted in incorporation of the R moiety into proteins. The probable mechanism was attack of RNCl2 or an intermediate formed in the decomposition of RNCl2 on histidine, tyrosine, and cystine residues and on lysine residues at high pH. Incorporation of radioactivity from labeled amines into stable, high molecular weight derivatives of proteins was measured by acid or acetone precipitation and by gel chromatography and electrophoresis. Whereas formation of RNCl2 was favored at low pH, the subsequent incorporation reaction was favored at high pH. Up to several hours were required for the maximum amount of incorporation, which was less than 10% of the label in RNCl2. For the amines tested, incorporation was in the order histamine greater than 1,2-diaminoethane greater than putrescine greater than taurine greater than lysine greater than glucosamine greater than leucine greater than methylamine. Initiation of the reaction required HOCl, and oxidized forms of bromide, iodide, or thiocyanate did not substitute. Inhibitors of incorporation fell into three classes. First, ammonia or amines competed with the labeled amine for reaction with HOCl, so that larger amounts of HOCl were required. Second, readily oxidized substances such as sulfhydryl or diketo compounds or thioethers (methionine) reduced RNCl2. Third, certain compounds competed with protein as the acceptor for the incorporation reaction. The amount required to block incorporation into protein depended on protein concentration. Among these inhibitors were imidazole compounds (histidine), phenols (tyrosine), and disulfides (glutathione disulfide, GSSG). Low yields of derivatives of histidine, tyrosine, and GSSG were detected by thin-layer chromatography. Acid-precipitable derivatives were obtained by reacting RNCl2 with polyhistidine or polytyrosine, and to a lesser extent with polylysine at high pH, but not with other poly(amino acids). Precipitable derivatives were also obtained by incubating MPO-containing extracts from leukocyte granules with hydrogen peroxide, Cl-, and labeled amines. The extracts were found to have a high content of substances with primary amino groups, which competed for incorporation. The results account for oxidative incorporation of amines into proteins in leukocytes and provide evidence that HOCl and nitrogen-chlorine (N-Cl) derivatives are formed in these cells.

All chemotherapeutic agents, with the exception of bleomycin and L-asparaginase, may induce aplasia, but the degree of hematotoxicity varies according to the drug. With the exception of acute leukemia in which drug-induced aplasia is part of the treatment, aplasia must be prevented through perfect knowledge of the posology and injection schedules for each drug, as well as by adjusting doses to the patient's hematological status. If aplasia develops, intensive hematological care is requisite. The most common cardiac side-effect is toxic cardiomyopathy caused by anthracyclines, which must be diagnosed early by EKG recordings before each injection and repeated ultrasonography or dynamic cardiac scintigraphy. The risk of toxic cardiomyopathy makes it requisite not to exceed the maximal doses set for each drug. Pulmonary side-effects include acute hypersensitivity pneumopathy and chronic diffuse interstitial fibrosis, the latter being more common and mainly caused by bleomycin. The risk of chronic fibrosis demands that patients be closely monitored and that the total dose be kept under 300 mg. Renal toxicity usually results in acute transient renal failure, as with cisplatinum, and requires a thorough biological study before each injection.

This region, designated here as lymphoid rearranging (LyR) DNA, was cloned from plasmacytoma J558 in which it had recombined 5' to a constant (C) region of the alpha heavy (H) chain gene, C alpha, within a switch (S) region, S alpha, involved in the switching of CH genes. Sequence determination established that LyR DNA had recombined within a S alpha recombination unit. LyR DNA does not originate from the H chain locus, and discordance between LyR DNA and CH copy number in certain lines suggests that LyR DNA probably derives from another chromosome. LyR DNA rearrangement is a characteristic of tumors of mature B cells; it was detected in 24 of 28 plasmacytomas and B-cell lymphomas, usually as LyR-S alpha, but not in 11 Abelson retrovirus-induced lymphomas of B-cell precursors nor detectably in normal B cells. In contrast, rearrangement was observed in only 3 of 18 T-cell lymphomas, and none of seven nonlymphoid lines. Most tumor lines (49 of 52), whether lymphoid or not, contained a low level of polyadenylylated LyR transcript(s), but several new RNA species with differences in their 5' regions appeared in B-cell lines in which LyR DNA was rearranged, suggesting that rearrangement may activate a new promoter or mode of splicing. The results suggest that the LyR-S alpha rearrangement represents a translocation to chromosome 12 that alters expression of LyR-encoded genes; hence, it may have participated in lymphoid tumor oncogenesis.","['Adams, J M', 'Gerondakis, S', 'Webb, E', 'Mitchell, J', 'Bernard, O', 'Cory, S']","['Adams JM', 'Gerondakis S', 'Webb E', 'Mitchell J', 'Bernard O', 'Cory S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics/immunology', 'Plasmacytoma/*genetics/immunology', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Nov;79(22):6966-70. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.22.6966.,['10.1073/pnas.79.22.6966 [doi]'],['CA12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC347255,,,"['GENBANK/J00603', 'GENBANK/J00604']",,,

The integrated provirus DNA and cDNA from virion RNA were molecularly cloned and their structures were analyzed. Clone lambda ATM-1 of an integrated provirus DNA in the MT-1 cell line, established from adult T-cell leukemia cells by cocultivation with cord lymphocytes, contained DNA about 13,000 base pairs (bp) long and long terminal repeats (LTR) at both ends of the viral sequence that were about 8,000 bp long. These two LTR sequences were linked to cellular sequences with direct repeats of 7 bp. Each LTR consisted of 754 bp including inverted repeats of 2 bp at the ends and the T-A-T-A-A box, characteristics in common with those of LTRs of other known retroviruses. Adjacent to the 5' LTR there was a sequence identical to the tRNAPro binding site in murine leukemia virus, suggesting that tRNAPro is a primer for reverse transcription of the viral genome. From these structural features, the mechanism of ATLV replication was suggested to be the same as that of other known animal retroviruses. However, the length of the small terminal repeats at the ends of the RNA genome, 228 +/- 1 bases, is much longer than the lengths, up to 80 bases, of those in avian, mouse, or primate retroviruses so far analyzed. These findings suggest that ATLV should be classified in a distinct group of retroviruses with bovine leukemia virus which also makes unusually long strong-stop cDNA.","['Seiki, M', 'Hattori, S', 'Yoshida, M']","['Seiki M', 'Hattori S', 'Yoshida M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/microbiology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Nov;79(22):6899-902. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.22.6899.,['10.1073/pnas.79.22.6899 [doi]'],,PMC347241,,,"['GENBANK/J02028', 'GENBANK/J02030', 'GENBANK/J02031', 'GENBANK/J02032']",,,

This molecularly cloned DNA retains the biological activity of SFFVA, as infectious SFFV can be recovered from the DNA clone by marker rescue using a previously described two-stage cotransfection assay (Linemeyer et al., J.

By utilizing a marker rescue technique, the splenomegaly and anemia characteristic of SFFVA-induced disease have been traced to a DNA fragment of SFFVA containing sequences coding for the env gene product. gp52.

One hundred forty coded sera from 111 patients (Crohn's disease = 36, ulcerative colitis = 28, diarrheal and other controls = 47) were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence for immunoreactivity with the lymphomas and hyperplastic lymph nodes. Coded sections were examined by two observers and scored on a 0 to 3 + scale. Fifty-four percent of the sera from patients with Crohn's disease were reactive with the Crohn's disease induced lymphoma by this assay. Eighty percent of sera from patients with symptomatic Crohn's disease were positive, whereas 22% of sera from patients in remission were positive. Sixty-six percent of sera from patients with symptomatic Crohn's disease reacted against hyperplastic lymph nodes induced by Crohn's disease filtrates. In contrast, only one control serum (from a patient with ulcerative colitis) reacted with the lymphomas or hyperplastic lymph nodes. Lymphomas induced by other means or arising spontaneously did not show immunofluorescence with Crohn's disease or control sera. Electron microscopy revealed C-type viral particles in five lymphomas induced by Crohn's disease filtrates and in one control lymphoma, but not in five hyperplastic lymph nodes and five control lymph nodes. Absorption of Crohn's disease sera with control lymphoma or with murine leukemia virus infected fibroblasts did not diminish immunoreactivity, whereas similar absorption with lymphomas induced by Crohn's disease filtrates abolished the immunofluorescence. These studies indicate that Crohn's disease tissue, when injected into athymic nude mice, induces lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphomas that contain an antigen(s) recognized by Crohn's disease sera.","['Das, K M', 'Valenzuela, I', 'Williams, S E', 'Soeiro, R', 'Kadish, A S', 'Baum, S G']","['Das KM', 'Valenzuela I', 'Williams SE', 'Soeiro R', 'Kadish AS', 'Baum SG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Crohn Disease/*etiology/immunology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hyperplasia', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Inclusion Bodies, Viral', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology/immunology', 'Retroviridae']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 1983 Feb;84(2):364-74.,['S0016508583000207 [pii]'],"['CA-10945/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AM-26403/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Three distinct structural proteins of this virus with molecular weights of 24,000, 19,000, and 15,000 were purified, radiolabeled, and used in radioimmune precipitation assays. Five of the patients, three of the family members (two of them spouses), and 11 of the normals had specific antibodies against at least the proteins with molecular weights of 24,000 and 19,000. High antibody titers against these proteins were often associated with antibodies against the protein with a molecular weight of 15,000. In all cases, antibody titers against this protein were considerably lower than those against the proteins with molecular weights of 24,000 and 19,000. HTLV is highly associated with Caribbean adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma and is also endemic among the normal Caribbean population.

In FV-infected mice, the kinetics of ""primitive"" erythroid burst-forming units (P-BFU-E) is perturbed, and their proliferative rate is enhanced. These results indirectly suggest, but do not prove, that cycling P-BFU-E may serve as FV target. In vitro infection studies showed that normal erythroid colony forming units (CFU-E) and ""mature"" erythroid burst-forming units (M-BFU-E) are targets for FV, while the largely out-of-cycle normal P-BFU-E are not. In an attempt to shed light on these aspects, we have evaluated the expression of viral cytoplasmic RNA sequences in pools of colonies generated by P-BFU-E and granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units (CFU-GM) from spleen and marrow of polycythemic Friend virus (FVP)-infected mice, as measured by liquid hybridization with FVP- or spleen focus-forming polycythemic virus (SFFVp)-specific DNA probes. Moreover, similar assays were performed on RNAs derived from whole spleen or bone marrow from mice treated with FVP or the anemic strain of Friend virus (FVA). Control studies were performed on corresponding colonies and whole tissues from normal animals. FVP- and SFFVp-specific sequences are more abundant in RNA extracted from infected spleen as compared to marrow by a 10-fold factor. On the other hand, FVP and SFFVp-specific sequences are expressed at a comparable level in both P-BFU-E- and CFU-GM-derived colonies from spleen or marrow of FVP-treated mice. Since in vitro spread of FVP infection was excluded by control studies with addition in culture of antibody to the viral glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 70,000 (gp70) these results indicate that P-BFU-E and CFU-GM are infected in vivo by FVP.","['Colletta, G', 'Di Fiore, P P', 'Fusco, A', 'Lettieri, F', 'Covelli, A', 'Peschle, C']","['Colletta G', 'Di Fiore PP', 'Fusco A', 'Lettieri F', 'Covelli A', 'Peschle C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*microbiology', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Spleen/*microbiology']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Feb;43(2):598-603.,,,,,,,,,

RFCNU was shown to be effective in 8% of digestive tumors, in 1 out of 7 pancreatic cancers and in 3 out of 10 hepatic and pulmonary metastases from an undiscovered primary adenocarcinoma. As for RPCNU, it's action resembles that of RFCNU: tumor regression lasting for over three years was obtained in a patient with hepatic metastases from a digestive carcinoma; in another patient a regression rate exceeding 50% was seen in pulmonary metastases from a rectal tumor. One of the significant results of our study is the apparent tissular specificity of responses according to the agent given: CZT is more often efficient on the lymphatic localizations of the studied tumors (4/5 responses); RFCNU and RPCNU often proved active on hepatic metastases (17% responses).

A recombinant viral genome was recently constructed by inserting 72-bp tandem repeats from the Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV) in place of the 72-bp repeats of SV40. Although this genome replicates in monkey kidney cells, its rate of large tumor antigen expression and replication is considerably slower than that of wild-type SV40. In mouse cells, however, equivalent levels of large tumor antigen appear to be expressed from both wild-type and recombinant genomes, suggesting a relationship between the level of enhancer activity and the host cell. To confirm this observation, we have applied a sensitive quantitative assay for gene expression based on the conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms. The gene encoding the enzymatic function chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was inserted into two vectors in which the enhancer sequences from SV40 or MSV were placed adjacent to the early SV40 promoter. The SV40 tandem repeats appear to activate gene expression to significantly higher levels in monkey kidney cells, but the MSV repeats are more active in two lines of mouse cells. These findings suggest that the tandem repeat elements may interact with host-specific molecules and, furthermore, may constitute one of the elements determining the host range of these eukaryotic viruses.","['Laimins, L A', 'Khoury, G', 'Gorman, C', 'Howard, B', 'Gruss, P']","['Laimins LA', 'Khoury G', 'Gorman C', 'Howard B', 'Gruss P']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Operon', 'Plasmids', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Species Specificity', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Nov;79(21):6453-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.21.6453.,['10.1073/pnas.79.21.6453 [doi]'],,PMC347144,,,,,,

Differentiated HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells completely deficient in lactoferrin generate oxidizing radicals at a rate greater than that of human neutrophils, indicating lactoferrin-independent pathways for OH. generation. The further heterogeneity of pathways generating OH. activity in neutrophils is indicated by the cell concentration dependence of the reaction, the variability of H2O2 as a precursor reactant, and the various proportions of oxidizing radical activity to O2-detected in human neutrophils stimulated to a variety of agonists. The ethylene assay for oxidizing radical activity may detect different classes of oxidizing species capable of reacting with the aldehyde substrate.

The state of methylation of M-MuLV proviral DNA was examined by cleaving A9 cell DNA with restriction endonucleases which have the dinucleotide CpG in their cleavage sequences. Analysis with such enzymes, which recognized nine different sites in M-MuLV DNA, indicated that most if not all of the M-MuLV proviruses in A9 cells were completely unmethylated. An individual proviral integration was examined, using as probe adjacent single-copy cellular sequences. These sequences were obtained from a lambda phage recombinant clone containing an M-MuLV provirus from the A9 cells. This individual integration also showed no detectable methylation. In contrast, endogenous MuLV-related sequences present in NIH-3T3 cells before infection were largely methylated. The configuration chromatin containing M-MuLV proviruses was also investigated by digesting A9 nuclei with DNase I, followed by restriction analysis of the remaining DNA. Endogenous MuLV-related DNA was in chromatin relatively resistant to DNase I digestion, whereas the majority of M-MuLV-specific proviruses were in domains of intermediate DNase I sensitivity. Two proviral copies hypersensitive to DNase I digestion were identified.

These leukemia cells contain large amounts of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA and MMTV proteins in a precursor form (Nusse et al., J. Virol. 32:251-258, 1979). We used restriction enzyme analysis and molecular hybridization to identify MMTV proviruses in the DNA of these leukemia cells. GR leukemia cells contained additional integrated MMTV proviruses at various sites in the genome. This amplification of MMTV proviruses in GR leukemia cells is not restricted to one particular endogenous MMTV provirus of strain GR. The number and location of the extra MMTV proviruses present in transplants of GR leukemia cells did not change upon serial transplantation of the leukemia cells. Acquisition of MMTV proviruses was also found in a similar leukemia, L1210 of the DBA/2 mouse strain, but not in three other leukemias, SL2 of DBA/2, BW5147 of AKR, and a spontaneous thymoma of BALB/c. The two main classes of MMTV RNA, 35S and 24S, were present in the cytoplasmic RNA of GR leukemia cells, indicating that the aberrant processing of MMTV precursor proteins is not due to anomolously sized RNAs. We could not detect extra RNAs in GR leukemia cells which would represent read-through transcripts of cellular genes adjacent to the extra MMTV proviruses, initiated by a promoter signal in the right MMTV long terminal repeat sequence. These data suggest that acquisition of MMTV proviruses may coincide with the onset of leukemogenesis in GR male mice.","['Michalides, R', 'Wagenaar, E', 'Hilkens, J', 'Hilgers, J', 'Groner, B', 'Hynes, N E']","['Michalides R', 'Wagenaar E', 'Hilkens J', 'Hilgers J', 'Groner B', 'Hynes NE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Gene Amplification', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*analysis', 'Male', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/analysis']",1982/09/01 00:00,1982/09/01 00:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Sep;43(3):819-29. doi: 10.1128/JVI.43.3.819-829.1982.,['10.1128/JVI.43.3.819-829.1982 [doi]'],,PMC256192,,,,,,

Metaphase chromosomes from AKR MuLV-infected SC-1 mouse cells were incubated with NIH/3T3 cells. After several passages (1 to 3 weeks), infectious virions exhibiting reverse transcriptase activity and the characteristic host range of ecotropic, N-tropic AKR virus appeared in the supernatant fluids of the treated cells. Restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA from transfected cells indicated that AKR proviral DNA was associated with the high molecular weight DNA of the host. These results demonstrate that the AKR MuLV genome can be stably transferred to uninfected recipient cells via isolated metaphase chromosomes. Although AKR virions are not able to infect heterologous cells, chromosome-mediated transfection resulted in the establishment of productive AKR MuLV infection in mink cells. Thus, the use of chromosomes to transfer virus genes can circumvent the natural host restriction barrier. In other experiments, it was shown that normal NIH/3T3 cells were transformed after exposure to metaphase chromosomes isolated from an MuSV-infected, non-producer line.

Both A-X-MuLV and NBX virus were presumably present in a genomically masked form and could be recovered only by co-cultivation of tumour cells with permissive cells. Only about 0.87% and 0.13% of the viruses in the co-culture supernatant represented A-X-MuLV and NBX virus respectively; the majority were M-MuLV. The NBX virus acted more efficiently than the HIX virus (Fischinger et al., 1975) as helper to rescue murine sarcoma virus (MSV) from S+L-cells of hamster, rat and mouse origin, whereas the converse was true for those of cat and human origin. The interference and nuetralization patterns suggested that the NBX virus was an env gene recombinant between A-X-MuLV and M-MuLV. The fact that NBX virus cross-reacted in radioimmunoassays with gp70s of both M-MuLV and Balb: virus-2 provides evidence for the recombinant nature of the NBX gp 70-coding gene which was probably derived from both M-MuLV and a virus similar to Balb: virus-2 or A-X-MuLV. The presence of a unique antigenic determinant on the gp70 of NBX virus is also suggested. Both A-X-MuLV and NBX virus cross-reacted with type-specific p12s of M-MuLV and Balb: virus 2- suggesting that the gag gene coding for p12 of NBX virus was derived from the A-X-MuLV, which was itself a recombinant, its p12-coding gene being derived from both Balb: virus-2-like virus and M-MuLV.

We have investigated the nature of this inhibition by studying mitochondrial respiration in CM-injured leukemia L1210 cells permeabilized with digitonin. CM-induced injury affects the mitochondrial respiratory chain proper. Complex I (NADH-coenzyme Q reductase) and complex II (succinate-coenzyme Q reductase) are markedly inhibited. In addition a minor inhibition of cytochrome oxidase was found. Electron transport from alpha-glycerophosphate through the respiratory chain to oxygen is unaffected and permeabilized CM-injured L1210 cells oxidizing this substrate exhibit acceptor control. However, glycerophosphate shuttle activity was found not to occur within CM-injured or uninjured L1210 cells in culture hence, alpha-glycerophosphate is apparently unavailable for mitochondrial oxidation in the intact cell. It is concluded that the failure of respiration of intact neoplastic cells injured by CM is caused by the nearly complete inhibition of complexes I and II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The time courses of CM-induced electron transport inhibition and arrest of L1210 cell division are examined and the possible relationship between these phenomena is discussed.","['Granger, D L', 'Lehninger, A L']","['Granger DL', 'Lehninger AL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Glycerophosphates)', '0 (Malates)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Succinates)', '817L1N4CKP (malic acid)', '9NTI6P3O4X (alpha-glycerophosphoric acid)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.5.1 (Electron Transport Complex II)', 'EC 1.3.99.1 (Succinate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.99.- (Quinone Reductases)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Electron Transport', 'Electron Transport Complex II', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycerophosphates/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Malates/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinone Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Succinate Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Succinates/metabolism']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1982 Nov;95(2 Pt 1):527-35. doi: 10.1083/jcb.95.2.527.,['10.1083/jcb.95.2.527 [doi]'],['CA25360/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2112953,,,,,,

Inhibition by amino acid analogues and by tunicamycin.,14023-8,"Addition of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides to nascent murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-encoded membrane glycoproteins was inhibited either completely by tunicamycin or specifically at Asn-X-Thr glycosylation sites by incorporation of the threonine analogue beta-hydroxynorvaline. In conditions of partial analogue substitution, a series of subglycosylated components is formed which are related by a constant apparent Mr difference when assayed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The total number of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides is then estimated by dividing the measured apparent Mr of one oligosaccharide into the total apparent Mr difference between the complete glycoprotein and the polypeptide chain that is synthesized in cells incubated with tunicamycin. Correct results were obtained using glycoproteins with known numbers of oligosaccharides. Our analyses indicate that the gp70 membrane envelope glycoproteins of certain ecotropic MuLVs contain seven oligosaccharides, whereas the GIX+ antigen-containing variant gp70 contains one fewer Asn-X-Thr-linked oligosaccharide. The membrane glycoprotein encoded by the gag gene of Friend MuLV contains only one asparagine-linked oligosaccharide. Similarly, the gp55 membrane glycoprotein encoded by Friend erythroleukemia virus contains four asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Pulse-chase and cell surface iodination analyses indicate that MuLV membrane envelope glycoprotein processing by partial proteolysis and transport to the cell surface can be efficiently blocked by structural perturbations caused by incorporation of different amino acid analogues or by loss of oligosaccharides. Our data also suggest that loss of oligosaccharides may expose new antigenic sites in viral membrane glycoproteins and increase their susceptibility to intracellular proteolysis.","['Polonoff, E', 'Machida, C A', 'Kabat, D']","['Polonoff E', 'Machida CA', 'Kabat D']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Glucosamine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligosaccharides/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity', 'Tunicamycin/*pharmacology', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",1982/12/10 00:00,1982/12/10 00:01,['1982/12/10 00:00'],"['1982/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1982/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1982 Dec 10;257(23):14023-8.,['S0021-9258(19)45337-4 [pii]'],['CA 25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Subclones of PD have diverse kappa-gene structures, and some derivatives show evidence of continued joining activity after as many as three subclonings. Analysis of PD sublineages has shown that a rearranged chromosome can undergo secondary kappa-gene rearrangements, producing either a new rearrangement or a deletion of C kappa. Although the PD line actively rearranges its kappa genes, its rearranged heavy-chain genes show little variation, and there is no rearrangement of lambda genes. In PD subclones, DNA fragments representing the reciprocal product of kappa-gene rearrangement are often evident, and they may undergo either further rearrangement or deletion. The implications of multiple rearrangements on a single chromosome and of the maintenance of reciprocal fragments are considered in the context of a model that postulates that the V kappa and J kappa segments are not all organized in the DNA in the same transcriptional direction, leading to inversions rather than deletions during joining.","['Lewis, S', 'Rosenberg, N', 'Alt, F', 'Baltimore, D']","['Lewis S', 'Rosenberg N', 'Alt F', 'Baltimore D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antibody Diversity', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Recombination, Genetic']",1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell. 1982 Oct;30(3):807-16. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(82)90285-9.,"['0092-8674(82)90285-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(82)90285-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

During in vitro differentiation of HL60 (human promyelocytic leukemia line) and U937 (human monocytoid leukemia line), several new cytoskeleton-associated (CSK) proteins are induced. All of these CSK proteins are also present in freshly isolated normal granulocytes and macrophages. One of these differentiation-induced proteins comigrates with vimentin. There are several differentiation-sensitive proteins, i.e., those that are no longer synthesized upon differentiation. The changes in CSK protein synthesis during differentiation of HL60 and U937 cells do not seem to be related to drug treatment per se since exposure to conditioned medium from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes as well as to dimethyl sulfoxide and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate results in the production of many similar proteins. In vitro conditions that do not result in differentiation of HL60 and U937, such as cultivation in serum-free medium, do not induce the CSK proteins that we describe. A notable finding in this study is that all of the qualitative changes in the proteins synthesized during differentiation are detected in the cytoskeletal (Triton-insoluble) fraction, whereas only minor quantitative alterations are observed in the Triton-insoluble extract. The changes in CSK protein components occur in an orderly fashion. Vimentin, an intermediate-filament protein, is synthesized in large amounts prior to changes in cellular morphology and the induction or loss of other CSK proteins.

BLV was diagnosed in 11/15 (73.3%) leucocyte and 4/25 (16.0%) UFF-sediment specimens as compared to BSV in 14/15 (93.3%) and 21/25 (84.0%) of the similar specimens and neither BLV or BSV were found in 26 eggs and 60 embryos collected from 20 of the 25 cows. Detection of BLV antigens by immunofluorescence was hampered by the competitive replication of both BLV and BSV and competitive growth in indicator cells and uterine cells. As BLV has not been observed in cells of UFF sediments, it was probably isolated from leucocytes present in the lumen of uterus or from blood seeping out from inapparent vessel damage during flushing. Isolation of BLV in UFF sediments gives additional evidence to the concept of a transplacental transmission by a not yet elucidated mechanism. The high rate of BSV recovery from cells of UFF sediments indicated that this virus is more wide-spread than previously shown and that it may play a role in causing disorders of the reproductive tract.","['Bouillant, A M', 'Ruckerbauer, G M', 'Eaglesome, M D', 'Samagh, B S', 'Singh, E L', 'Hare, W C', 'Randall, G C']","['Bouillant AM', 'Ruckerbauer GM', 'Eaglesome MD', 'Samagh BS', 'Singh EL', 'Hare WC', 'Randall GC']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Rech Vet,Annales de recherches veterinaires.

B-lymphoblasts and T-lymphoblasts are characterized by high and low levels of plasma membrane 5'-nucleotidase activity, respectively. After radiolabeling of the cellular adenine nucleotide pools with [8-14C]adenine, deoxyglucose-induced purine nucleotide degradation resulted in a 2-2.5 times greater release of cellular radioactivity from the B-lymphoblasts than from the T-lymphoblasts. Specific inhibition of plasma membrane 5'-nucleotidase with 50 microM alpha, beta-methylene adenosine diphosphate (AMPCP) did not decrease purine release during deoxyglucose-induced nucleotide degradation. Similarly, the inhibition of B-lymphoblast membrane 5-nucleotidase did not alter the incorporation of [8-14C]adenine into the nucleotide pool. Therefore, to explain the relatively high release of purine nucleotide degradation products in B-lymphoblasts when compared with T-lymphoblasts, cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase activity was investigated in these cell lines. B-lymphoblasts have seven times more cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase activity for dAMP and two to three times more activity for other purine nucleoside 5'-monophosphates than do T-lymphoblasts at pH 7.4. Membrane and cytoplasmic nucleotidase activities are produced by different enzymes that can be distinguished by differences in pH optima, Michaelis constants for purine substrates, divalent cation requirements, and susceptibilities to AMPCP inhibition. The data suggest that plasma membrane 5'-nucleotidase hydrolyzes extracellular nucleoside 5'-monophosphates only. Cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase most likely regulates the degradation of intracellular nucleoside 5'-monophosphates and may be responsible for the increased purine release observed in B-lymphoblasts.","['Edwards, N L', 'Recker, D', 'Manfredi, J', 'Rembecki, R', 'Fox, I H']","['Edwards NL', 'Recker D', 'Manfredi J', 'Rembecki R', 'Fox IH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0 (Purines)', ""0T2A5439OE (alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine 5'-diphosphate)"", '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (Nucleotidases)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Adenosine Diphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Nucleotidases/*metabolism', 'Purine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Purines/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thymus Gland/enzymology']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1982 Nov;243(5):C270-7. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1982.243.5.C270.,['10.1152/ajpcell.1982.243.5.C270 [doi]'],"['5M01RR42/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-00817-01/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-19674/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

The classification of acute leukemia.,277-81,"Two main forms of acute leukemia have been recognized by the French-American-British (FAB) group: myeloid (AML) and lymphoblastic (ALL). Some types of AML can be diagnosed on well prepared bone marrow films stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa. Poorly differentiated types, myeloblastic (M1) and monoblastic (M5PD), need confirmation by positive cytochemical reactions (Sudan Black B, myeloperoxidase and non-specific esterase). There are 2 sub-types of promyelocytic leukemia: M3 typical, hypergranular and M3 variant, microgranular. The M3 variant has a more acute course, higher WBC and may require cytochemistry to demonstrate promyelocytic differentiation. Electron microscopic cytochemistry can also help in the classification of difficult AML cases; the 'platelet-peroxidase' reaction, for example, is essential for the diagnosis of megakaryoblastic leukemia, a disorder often presenting as 'acute' myelosclerosis. Three morphological types are seen in ALL: L1, predominantly in children, L2, more frequently in adults, and the relatively rare L3 or Burkitt type. Immunological and enzyme markers (ALL and la antigens, terminal transferase, etc.) help define the cell phenotype: (1) non-B, non-T ALL with 3 forms (common, null and pre-B), (2) T-ALL, related to but distinct from T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, and (3) B-ALL, usually with L3 morphology, There is growing evidence that the FAB morphological types correlate with prognosis in ALL independently of other factors. The immunologically defined types also correlate with prognosis but not as an independent variable.","['Catovsky, D']",['Catovsky D'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Child', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia/*classification', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Rosette Formation']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathology. 1982 Jul;14(3):277-81. doi: 10.3109/00313028209061377.,['10.3109/00313028209061377 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Virus induction from mice that contained Rjf-2 alone was observed only in crosses with two other strains that carried ecotropic proviruses, i.e., DBA/2 and C57BL/6, and not in crosses performed with mice that lacked ecotropic proviruses, i.e., 129, SWR, and NFS.

Rjv-1 and Rjv-2 virus induction genes co-segregated with ecotropic proviruses integrated in different cellular DNA sequences. Rjv-2, the less inducible ecotropic provirus in RF mice, is located in cellular DNA sequences very similar to those found adjacent to the ecotropic provirus of BALB/c.

Cholera toxin (1 or 50 nM) induced formyl-peptide receptor expression and adherence, but the cells did not reduce nitroblue tetrazolium, continued to proliferate, and were unchanged morphologically.

In the present study, the expression of transferrin receptor in Concanavalin A stimulated rat lymphocytes or Gross virus transformed lymphoma cells has been examined with respect to the following questions: (1) is expression of receptor activity related to blastogenesis or to the subsequent IL-2 dependent DNA synthetic activity, and (2) is transferrin receptor expression regulated in similar fashion in both normal and malignant lymphoblasts? Scatchard analysis of saturation binding data illustrated that binding site number increased and subsequently decreased during the response while the receptor affinity for transferrin remained constant. These findings were confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of radiolabeled cell surface proteins which specifically interact with transferrin. Examination of nonproliferating normal lymphoblasts (96 hr post Con A stimulation) compared with the same population of cells stimulated to reinitiate DNA Synthesis with a partially purified preparation of Interleukin 2 (IL-2) showed that transferrin receptor expression was tightly linked to the IL-2 dependent stimulation of DNA replication.

The susceptibility of birds was found different according to the genetic lines of the chickens and specially to the B locus blood group. Since the B locus of birds was strongly associated with the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) it was of interest to review the last reports on the influence of the B locus on viral induced tumours. In Marek's Disease due to a DNA virus (Herpes type) the B21 allele expresses the greater resistance compared with other B alleles although non-B factors could be involved as demonstrated with the lymphocyte factor Ly-4. The possible mechanisms of the influence of B locus on the resistance against Marek's Disease are discussed. The tumours induced by RNA viruses (Avian Leucosis Sarcomas) develop or regress following genetic characters closely related to MHC. Differences of resistance exist between B alleles. Complementary genes should be present to fully express the resistance. The relationship between MHC-B locus and resistance to tumors stimulates the actual assays. Since a number of parameters remain still unknown further researches should be done in order to evidence the involved mechanisms of the resistance.,"['Cauchy, L', 'Dambrine, G', 'Coudert, F']","['Cauchy L', 'Dambrine G', 'Coudert F']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology', 'Chickens/genetics/*immunology', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Marek Disease/*immunology', 'Sarcoma, Avian/*immunology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1982;69(2):194-8.,,,,Influence du locus B sur les tumeurs virales aviaires.,,,,,

Leukemic cells were obtained from 54 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 9 with myeloid or nonlymphoblastic leukemia, 3 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 3 with lymphoma. There was a wide variation in the LD50, the concentration of dAdo that caused 50% inhibition of the incorporation of 3H-thymidine into cells in the presence of 20 microM DCF. T-cell leukemia specimens were much more sensitive to dAdo than were specimens of pre-B-ALL and null-ALL. In leukemic cells that had been incubated with 14C-dAdo plus DCF, a good correlation was observed between the LD50 and the ratio of 14C-deoxyATP to ATP (correlation coefficient for the fit to a hyperbola = 0.853). The accumulation of deoxyATP by the leukemic cell specimens was correlated best with the activity of ecto-ATPase, less well with cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase and deoxyadenosine kinase, and poorly with adenosine deaminase and ecto-5'-nucleotidase.

The presence of these enzymes can affect the reliability of techniques used to measure intracellular pools of deoxynucleotides. An optimized extraction procedure and enzymic assay for dNTP species in haematopoietic cells are described which provide sensitivity to measure 0.1-40pmol of dATP, dTTP and dGTP, and 1.0-40pmol of dCTP. The extraction and assay give linear results with (2.5-15)x10(6) nucleated cells and (0.1-1.5)x10(9) red blood cells. Under these conditions, extracts equivalent to ~0.5x10(6) nucleated haematopoietic cells catalyse the phosphorylation of 0-8% of dNDP and dNMP standards to dNTP and incorporate them into deoxynucleotide polymer under circumstances where 100% of an equimolar dNTP standard would be incorporated. By contrast, extracts of 0.4x10(6) HeLa cells totally converted dADP, dTDP and dGDP into dNTP with subsequent polymerization. Conversion of dCDP was somewhat less efficient. The results demonstrate conclusively that the activities of deoxynucleotide interconverting enzymes differ in different types of human cells. They can interfere with assay of nucleotides, but may not do so in many types of cell extracts. In particular, dNTP concentrations can be measured in human haematopoietic cells after extraction with 60% (v/v) methanol and are not artificially elevated by deoxynucleotide interconversions. It is apparent that extraction and assay procedures for measurement of dNTP species should be analysed for each cell type in order to minimize contaminating enzyme activities and ensure accuracy of dNTP quantification.","['Fuller, S A', 'Hutton, J J', 'Meier, J', 'Coleman, M S']","['Fuller SA', 'Hutton JJ', 'Meier J', 'Coleman MS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.4.4 (Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Methanol', 'Methods', 'Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/*metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/*metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic']",1982/07/15 00:00,1982/07/15 00:01,['1982/07/15 00:00'],"['1982/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1982 Jul 15;206(1):131-8. doi: 10.1042/bj2060131.,['10.1042/bj2060131 [doi]'],"['CA00494/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26391/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD12799/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1158558,,,,,,

Depletion of natural killer cells from spleen cells did not appreciably affect IFN production, but depletion of Thy 1.2 antigen-bearing cells greatly reduced IFN-gamma production, indicating that T cells were the main IFN producers.","['Tomida, M', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Hozumi, M', 'Kawade, Y']","['Tomida M', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Hozumi M', 'Kawade Y']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Res,Journal of interferon research,8100396,['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mycoplasma/immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Retroviridae/immunology', 'Spleen/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Interferon Res. 1982;2(2):271-83. doi: 10.1089/jir.1982.2.271.,['10.1089/jir.1982.2.271 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

When neuroblastoma cells containing bound toxin were incubated at 37 degrees C, surface toxin disappeared with a half-life of approximately 2 h and a significant loss was detected by 10 min. When cells were incubated with 125I-choleragen in order to measure toxin degradation, cell-associated radioactivity disappeared with time and a corresponding amount of TCA-soluble label appeared in the culture medium with a half-life of 4-6 h. No degradation was detected until 45 min. Although there was a lag of 15 min before bound choleragen activated adenylate cyclase, the enzyme became maximally activated between 45 and 60 min. Similar results were obtained with Friend erythroleukemia cells. Internalization, degradation, and activation all were blocked when the cells were maintained at 4 degrees C. At 22 degrees C, internalization and activation occurred, albeit at a slower rate, whereas degradation was effectively inhibited. These results indicated that choleragen does not have to be degraded by intact cells in order for it to activate adenylate cyclase.

The individual leukaemic populations, tested on several occasions, gave reproducibly different responses one from another which were not obviously related to differences either of surface immunoglobulin phenotype or of immunoglobulin secretor status in vivo. After infection, four out of six PLL populations showed either transient or a more persistent expression of EBNA, always involving a minority of the cells, with no evidence of any virus-induced transformation up to six weeks. In contrast, two out of six PLL samples as well as the WM sample rapidly gave rise to EBNA-positive cell lines which, on the evidence both of restricted immunoglobulin class expression and of abnormal marker chromosomes, were clearly derived from the leukaemic cells.

The extent of binding of 1504M virus to the spinal cord cells was related to the time of incubation and to the amount of labeled input virus. 1504M virus bound to both glial and neuronal subpopulations of the spinal cord with almost equal efficiency. Binding of 125I-labeled 1504M virus to SWR/J mouse spinal cord cells was competitively inhibited by unlabeled homologous virus, whereas an excess of unlabeled 1504A virus inhibited only 10% of the ecotropic virus binding. Unlabeled 1504M virus almost completely inhibited the low-level binding of 125I-labeled 1504A virus to spinal cord cells. The different extent of binding of 1504M virus to spinal cord cells from different strains of mice (SWR/J, NIH Swiss, BALB/c-Jax, Lake Casitas wild, and CD-1) correlated with the susceptibility to paralysis in these strains of mice after inoculation with 1504M virus. Although the spinal cord cells of BALB/c mice contained a moderate amount of 1504M virus receptor sites, these mice were resistant to virus-induced paralysis because of their Fv-1b genotype. Our results indicate that the receptor sites for wild mouse ecotropic retrovirus are strain and organ specific and suggest that the presence of such receptors in central nervous system tissue may be a prerequisite for a successful virus infection and paralysis induction in Fv-1n mice.","['Mohan, S', 'Pal, B K']","['Mohan S', 'Pal BK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neuroglia/metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism', '*Receptors, Virus', 'Retroviridae/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/metabolism', 'Spinal Cord/*cytology/metabolism', 'Spleen/*cytology/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/metabolism']",1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 1982 Aug;37(2):532-8. doi: 10.1128/iai.37.2.532-538.1982.,['10.1128/iai.37.2.532-538.1982 [doi]'],['NS 17321/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC347567,,,,,,

An antiserum against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of a protein predicted from the v-mos nucleotide sequence specifically recognizes a protein doublet of approximately 37,000 daltons from 35S-methionine-labeled M-MuSV 124-transformed producer cells. By peptide mapping, this protein is almost identical to the 37 kd in vitro translation product from the M-MuSV v-mos gene. Immunoprecipitates from 32P-labeled cells contain a single v-mos-specific phosphoprotein, which has at least six sites of phosphorylation containing phosphoserine. Pulse-chase experiments show that the lower band in the 35S-methionine-labeled doublet is the primary translation product, which is modified, probably by phosphorylation, to yield the upper band. A similar mos protein is immunoprecipitated from HT1-MuSV-transformed cells, but not from uninfected NIH/3T3 cells. These mos proteins are present at very low levels in transformed cell lines. Cells acutely infected with M-MuSV 124, however, transiently contain much higher levels of the mos protein.

Detailed physical and biochemical analysis of fatty acid-substituted EL4 plasma membranes.,230-40,"Murine leukemia EL4 cells were modified by supplementation of culture media with fatty acids for 24 h. A plasma membrane-enriched fraction was prepared from substituted and normal cells. Analyses were performed to determine fatty acyl composition, phospholipid headgroup composition and cholesterol content. The two major membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were isolated by thin-layer chromatography and ESR measurements were done on liposomes prepared from these lipids as well as on the intact plasma membrane preparations. Slight perturbations in overall plasma membrane lipid composition were observed when EL4 cells were supplemented with a single exogenous fatty acid. This may be consistent with the idea that the incorporation of exogenous fatty acid induces compensatory changes in membrane lipid composition. On the other hand, we observed no significant difference in two ESR motional parameters between the unsubstituted control and various fatty acid-substituted plasma membranes. ESR measurements carried out on PE and PC liposomes derived from 17:0- and 18:2c-substituted membranes also failed to detect major differences between these liposomes and those made from normal EL4 phospholipids. In the case of liposomes prepared from 18:2t,-substituted membranes, the order parameter was significantly changed from the normal. However, the change was in opposite directions in PE and PC, perhaps accounting for the fact that no change parameter is seen in intact 18:2t-substituted plasma membrane. Measurements of order parameter (S) in mixed lipid vesicles showed that at up to 50 mol% mixture of a synthetic PC with plasma membrane PC, the value of S was only marginally different from that of the plasma membrane PC vesicles. We interpret these data as an indication that the two ESR parameters used are not sufficiently sensitive to detect changes due to modifications of the acyl chain composition of a complex biological membrane.","['Poon, R', 'Clark, W H']","['Poon R', 'Clark WH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*physiology', 'Culture Media', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Fatty Acids/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Membrane Lipids/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphatidylcholines/biosynthesis', 'Phospholipids/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Temperature']",1982/07/28 00:00,1982/07/28 00:01,['1982/07/28 00:00'],"['1982/07/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/28 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1982 Jul 28;689(2):230-40. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(82)90255-3.,"['0005-2736(82)90255-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(82)90255-3 [doi]']","['AI 00009/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 14747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Cell lines derived from two other patients with CTCL were also studied. These were compared with enzyme activities in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes from 11 normal donors and six samples of human thymocytes. ADA activities were similar in the Sezary cells and peripheral blood T-cells (medians 7 U and 15 U, P = 0.14), and both of these groups demonstrated significantly lower activity than did the thymocytes (median 100 U, P = 0.002). 5'N activity in the Sezary cells was also similar to that of the T-lymphocytes (median 0.022 U and 0.030 U, P greater than 0.05) and both of these groups had significantly greater activity than did the thymocytes (median 0.002 U, P = 0.001). Median PNP activity in the Sezary cell population was also comparable to that measured in normal T-cells. These findings suggest there is a characteristic purine pathway enzyme pattern in Sezary cells that is similar to that seen in normal T-lymphocytes. This pattern is clearly distinguishable from that of thymocytes and from that previously described in lymphoblasts from patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. These results support the concept that Sezary cells are well-differentiated with respect to the T-cell axis.

No differences in the electrophoretical glycoprotein pattern could be detected comparing (nonmalignant) cells from persistent lymphocytosis and tumour cells, suggesting that malignancy is not associated with the gain or loss of a major glycoprotein.

These findings are discussed with regard to disturbed growth regulation of leukosis tumour cells.","['Bohmer, F D', 'Samtleben, R', 'Schon, R']","['Bohmer FD', 'Samtleben R', 'Schon R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Acta Biol Med Ger,Acta biologica et medica Germanica,0370276,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycoproteins/*blood', 'Leukemia/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Lymph Nodes/*analysis', 'Lymphocytes/*analysis/ultrastructure', 'Membrane Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Biol Med Ger. 1982;41(2-3):145-60.,,,,,,,,,

Attached to JH3 in the cloned DNA, in inverted sequence, is the DNA from JH1 to the JH2 recognition sequence. The inverted segment is attached at its other end to the 5' recognition sequence of a diversity segment (D). To form this structure, three joining events must have occurred on the same chromosome. One of these events could have been a normal D-JH joining but the others must have been irregular events including ones that result in inversions. One of the joining events left fused recognition elements from JH2 and a D whose sequence shows that, during joining, reciprocal joinings of the recognition elements must occur to fuse the heptameric elements back to back. Because joined D and JH undergo deletion of terminal coding sequence during recombination but the joined heptameric recognition sequences do not contain the deleted sequence, joining must be a nonreciprocal event. Also, extra nucleotides are inserted between D and JH as part of the joining process; it is suggested that this added sequence is a product of the activity of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase at the D/JH (and probably the VH/D) joints and that it represents a new element of heavy chain gene structure, the N region.","['Alt, F W', 'Baltimore, D']","['Alt FW', 'Baltimore D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes/*analysis', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Fetus', '*Genes', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Liver', 'Mice']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Jul;79(13):4118-22. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.13.4118.,['10.1073/pnas.79.13.4118 [doi]'],['CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC346588,,,"['GENBANK/J00495', 'GENBANK/J00496']",,,

The aligned coding sequences were 77% homologous and terminated at equivalent opal codons. The humos open reading frame initiated at an ATG found internally in the mumos coding sequence. The polypeptides predicted from the DNA sequence to be encoded by humos and mumos also were found to be extensively homologous, and 253 of 337 amino acids were shared between the two polypeptides. The first five NH2-terminal and last two COOH-terminal amino acids of the humos gene product were in common with those of mumos. In addition, near the middle of the polypeptide chains, four regions ranging from 19 to 26 consecutive amino acids were conserved.

Results show that viremic-tolerant hens classed as congenitally infected consistently shed virus into albumen of their eggs and progeny and 18% died from tumors. In contrast, hens classified as contact infected had a transient viremia; most of them developed antibody to ALV, and only 10% shed virus into albumen and progeny. No mortality from tumors occurred in this group of chickens during the 48-week experimental period, and egg production was significantly higher than in the group classified as congenitally infected. In addition, progeny chickens hatched from the contact-infected group maintained a low rate (2.9 to 3.8%) of ALV infection for the next two generations without further selection.

The present study tested the hypothesis that perinatal exposure to benzo(a)pyrene (BP) produces alterations in microsomal mixed-function oxidase (MFO) activity that modify the response to postnatal challenge with a PAH in such a way as to render the offspring to be more susceptible to tumorigenesis, and to determine whether the gestational age at which BP exposure occurred was a determinant of the proposed alterations. Swiss mice were treated with BP on day 3, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 18 of gestation. Subgroups from each gestational-age treatment group and appropriate controls were studied for enzyme activity or were challenged with 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) when three months old. Female offspring of BP-treated mice had significantly elevated hepatic microsomal aminopyrine demethylase activity; cytochrome P-450 concentrations were significantly lower in male offspring. The most striking finding was the increased susceptibility to tumorigenesis of female offspring. Latency for local tumors was decreased by two weeks; tumors were more frequent and grew more rapidly. Significantly more female offspring had both local and pulmonary lesions, and the total number of pulmonary adenomas was also significantly higher. Further studies are required to determine if the developmental alterations in hepatic (MFO) activity resulting from perinatal exposure to PAH relate in a causative way to the enhanced susceptibility of female offspring to tumorigenesis.","['Soyka, L F']",['Soyka LF'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Pharmacol (New York),"Pediatric pharmacology (New York, N.Y.)",8400778,"['0 (Benzopyrenes)', '3417WMA06D (Benzo(a)pyrene)', '56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Benzopyrenes/*toxicity', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Liver/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Methylcholanthrene/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Reproduction/drug effects']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Pharmacol (New York). 1980;1(1):85-96.,,['R01 19647/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

DNA-DNA hybridization, utilizing the Southern blotting technique and a plasmid-derived DNA probe representing the v-mos sequence, gave no evidence for rearrangements of the c-mos sequence in the DNAs obtained from these diverse cell types. Parallel studies employing the restriction enzyme isoschizomers HpaII and MspI indicated that in all of these cell types the c-mos sequences were heavily methylated. In addition, analysis of cellular RNAs by blot hybridization with the v-mos probe failed to detect evidence of transcription of the c-mos sequences in any of these cell types.

Progressively growing tumor formation was observed in 5 of 18 normal diploid B-lymphoblast lines from normal peripheral blood and in one of three diploid B-lymphoblast lines from leukemic donors established after infection with primate type C viruses (gibbon ape leukemia virus or simian sarcoma virus). In contrast, none of eight spontaneously transformed B-lymphoblast lines with normal diploid karyotypes formed progressively growing tumors, although one formed a tumor that remained the same size (0.5 cm) for several months. Progressive tumor formation occurred in four of seven previously established cell lines of different cell types that had abnormal karyotypes. Of the normal diploid B-lymphoblast cultures exposed to type C viruses, 12 were tested for the presence of viral RNA and structural proteins (p12, p30, gp70), and this information was correlated with tumorigenicity. Four of the six cultures expressing viral RNA or proteins were tumorigenic, whereas only one of six cultures that did not express virus information was positive. The results of this study suggest that expression of type C viral RNA and proteins by human B-lymphoblasts increases their tumorigenicity in nude mice.

In leukemic animals, complex mixtures of ecotropic and mink-tropic viruses were expressed. Unique but similar polytropic virus-like genomes were present in each tumor isolate. In preleukemic mice, viral isolates from the thymus that were grown on NIH3T3 fibroblasts contained genomes with non-Akv polytropic virus-related oligonucleotides. This phenomenon was not evident in fingerprints of viruses from the spleen and bone marrow of the same animals. Remarkably, the non-Akv oligonucleotides located in the 3' portion of the P15E gene, the U3 noncoding region, and the 5' part of the gp70 gene were often expressed independently. Our results suggest the following. (i) Recombinant viruses can be detected in the thymuses of young preleukemic AKR mice and increase in relative abundance with age. (ii) During in vivo generation of the recombinant leukemogenic viruses, the selection of polytropic virus-related sequences in the 3' part of p15E and the U3 region and the 5' portion of gp70 occurs independently. (iii) Independent biological properties encoded in the gp70 and p15E regions of env of the recombinant viruses may mediate viral selection or leukemogenicity.

A large number of fragments (about 30) were present at a relatively low concentration, indicating that each derived from a sequence present once in the mouse genome. A smaller number of fragments (one to five) were present at a much higher concentration and must have resulted from sequences present multiple times in the mouse genome. These results indicated that the endogenous MuLV sequences represent a family of dispersed repetitive sequences. Hybridization of these same digested mouse DNAs to nucleic acid probes representing different portions of the MuLV genome allowed construction of a map of the sites where restriction endonucleases cleave the endogenous MuLV sequences. Several independent recombinant DNA clones of endogenous MuLV sequences have been isolated from C3H mice (Roblin et al., J. Virol. 43:113-126, 1982). Analysis of these sequences shows that they have the structure of MuLV proviruses. The sites at which restriction endonucleases cleave within these proviruses appeared to be similar or identical to the sites at which these nucleases cleaved within the MuLV sequences of NIH/Swiss mice. This identity was confirmed by parallel electrophoresis. We conclude that the apparently complex pattern of endogenous MuLV sequences of NIH/Swiss mice consists largely of only two kinds of provirus, each repeated multiple times at dispersed sites in the mouse genome.","['Steffen, D L', 'Mural, R', 'Cowing, D', 'Mielcarz, J', 'Young, J', 'Roblin, R']","['Steffen DL', 'Mural R', 'Cowing D', 'Mielcarz J', 'Young J', 'Roblin R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA, Viral', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice/genetics/*microbiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Jul;43(1):127-35. doi: 10.1128/JVI.43.1.127-135.1982.,['10.1128/JVI.43.1.127-135.1982 [doi]'],"['CO-NO1-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-12708/PHS HHS/United States']",PMC256103,,,,,,

These viruses induce sarcomas and erythroleukemias in susceptible animals. An in vitro colony assay that detects transformation of lymphoid cells by Abelson-murine leukemia virus was used to demonstrate that BALB- and Harvey-MSV transform a novel hematopoietic cell both in culture and in vivo. Bone marrow colony formation was sarcoma virus dependent, followed single-hit kinetics, and required the presence of mercaptoethanol in the agar medium. BALB- and Harvey-MSV-induced colonies could be established in culture as continuous cell lines that demonstrated unrestricted self-renewal capacity and leukemogenicity in vivo. The cells had a blast cell morphology and lacked detectable markers of mature cells within the myeloid or erythroid series. They also lacked detectable immunoglobulin mu chain or Thy-1 antigen, markers normally associated with committed cells of the B and T lymphoid lineages, respectively. However, the transformants contained very high levels of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), an enzyme believed to be specific to early stages within the lymphoid differentiation pathway. This phenotype distinguishes these BALB- and Harvey-MSV transformants from any previously reported hematopoietic targets of transforming retroviruses, including the pre-B lymphoid cell transformed by Abelson-MuLV under identical assay conditions. These newly identified lymphoid progenitor cell transformants may provide an important means of studying early stages of lymphoid ontogeny and the possible role of TdT in lymphoid development.","['Pierce, J H', 'Aaronson, S A']","['Pierce JH', 'Aaronson SA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*microbiology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*physiology']",1982/09/01 00:00,1982/09/01 00:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1982 Sep 1;156(3):873-87. doi: 10.1084/jem.156.3.873.,['10.1084/jem.156.3.873 [doi]'],,PMC2186795,,,,,,

This differentiation is potentiated by agents known to increase intracellular cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) levels. The present study shows that these cells can be primed for differentiation by treatment for approximately one day with RA followed by exposure to a cAMP-inducing agent. The reverse sequence was ineffective. Thus, HL-60 could be primed by incubation for less than 20 hr with 10 nM RA to respond by differentiation to the addition of 10 nM prostaglandin E2 or 1 nM cholera toxin, whereas 10 nM RA alone was almost inactive. RA-primed HL-60 also responded with differentiation to a concentration of T-lymphocyte-derived differentiation-inducing factor which alone was inactive. U-937 primed by incubation for 24 hr with 100 nM RA responded to cAMP-inducing agents and differentiation-inducing factor, which alone were inactive on this cell line. Priming of these cell lines does not depend on the normal rate of protein synthesis, as it occurs even better in the presence of a concentration of cycloheximide that inhibits growth completely, suggesting that a decrease in synthesis of some protein(s) favors RA-induced differentiation. Cycloheximide alone produced some priming of HL-60 but not of U-937. HL-60, but not U-937, primed with RA responded to adenosine triphosphate and other nucleoside triphosphates, consistent with the notion that modulation of the RA effect may be mediated through protein kinase activity at the plasma membrane. The finding that myeloid cell lines, like HL-60 and U-937, blocked at a late stage of maturation can be primed by RA to respond to cAMP-inducing agents and differentiation-inducing factor may improve our understanding of the arrest in maturation typical of some forms of leukemia.","['Olsson, I L', 'Breitman, T R', 'Gallo, R C']","['Olsson IL', 'Breitman TR', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cholera Toxin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*physiopathology', 'Prostaglandins E/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Oct;42(10):3928-33.,,,,,,,,,

This report examines the effects of endogenous purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, nucleosides, and several analogs of these compounds on the activity of PRPP synthetase from different types of normal and leukemic white blood cells (i.e. normal lymphocytes, normal granulocytes, phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes, and acute and chronic leukemic cells). Our results show that the effect varied with each individual compound, and the magnitude of the effect was dependent on the source of the enzyme. Since it appears possible to differentially affect PRPP synthetase activity from the different types of leukemic cells, this enzyme may be a potential target site in the chemotherapy of leukemia.","['Danks, M K', 'Scholar, E M']","['Danks MK', 'Scholar EM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.6.1 (Ribose-Phosphate Pyrophosphokinase)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Phosphotransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Purines/*physiology', 'Pyrimidines/*physiology', 'Ribose-Phosphate Pyrophosphokinase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1982 May 1;31(9):1687-91. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(82)90669-4.,"['0006-2952(82)90669-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(82)90669-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

After inoculation at one day of age, the chickens lacking either ev gene expression had a lower frequency of virus isolations and higher frequency and titer of neutralizing antibodies than those expressing ev genes. This relationship was not seen in groups inoculated with chick syncytial virus (CSV), a reticuloendotheliosis-associated virus with no relationship to endogenous virus, but the ev2+ birds tended to yield more CSV isolations than the ev2- birds. We suggest that chickens expressing ev genes may be immunologically tolerant to antigens common to exogenous and endogenous viruses.

E26 causes predominantly erythroblastosis in chicken and in quail, whereas AMV induces a myeloid leukemia. However, upon cultivation in vitro for >1 month, a majority of surviving hemopoietic cells of E26-infected animals bear myeloid markers similar to those of AMV-transformed cells. We have analyzed the genetic structure and gene products of E26 virus for a comparison with those of AMV. An E26/helper virus complex was found to contain two RNA species: a 5.7-kilobase (kb) RNA that hybridizes with cloned AMV-specific proviral DNA and hence is probably the E26 genome; and an 8.5-kb RNA that is unrelated to AMV and represents helper virus RNA. Thus, E26 RNA is smaller than 7.5-kb AMV RNA. Hybridization of size-selected poly(A)-terminating E26 RNA fragments with AMV-specific DNA indicated that the shared specific sequences are located in the 5' half of the E26 genome as opposed to a 3' location in AMV RNA. In nonproducer cells transformed in vitro by E26, a gag-related nonstructural 135,000-dalton protein (p135) was found. No gag(Pr76) or gag-pol (Pr180) precursors of essential virion proteins, which are present in AMV nonproducer cells, were observed. p135 was also found in cultured E26 virus producing cells of several leukemic chickens, and its intracellular concentration relative to that of the essential virion proteins encoded by the helper virus correlates with the ratio of E26 to helper RNA in virions released by these cells. p135 is phosphorylated but not glycosylated; antigenically it is not related to the pol or env gene products. It appears to be coded for by a partial gag gene and by E26-specific RNA sequences, presumably including those shared with AMV. Hence, AMV and E26 appear to use different strategies for the expression of related onc sequences: AMV is thought to encode a transforming protein via a subgenomic mRNA, whereas E26 codes for a gag-related polyprotein via genomic RNA. It is speculated that differences in the oncogenic properties of E26 and AMV are due to differences in their genetic structures and gene products.","['Bister, K', 'Nunn, M', 'Moscovici, C', 'Perbal, B', 'Baluda, M', 'Duesberg, P H']","['Bister K', 'Nunn M', 'Moscovici C', 'Perbal B', 'Baluda M', 'Duesberg PH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/*genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chickens', '*Genes, Viral', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Jun;79(12):3677-81. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.12.3677.,['10.1073/pnas.79.12.3677 [doi]'],"['CA 10697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC346489,,,,,,

Infectious virus appears in all mice carrying the Mov-9 locus but is not activated in animals carrying the Mov-7 locus. Consequently, only Mov-9 mice develop viremia and subsequent leukemia. The endogenous M-MuLV provirus with flanking mouse sequences corresponding to the Mov-7 and Mov-9 loci was molecularly cloned. Detailed restriction maps obtained from the cloned DNAs revealed no detectable differences in the proviral genomes. The flanking mouse sequences, however, were different, confirming that the Mov-7 and Mov-9 loci represent different integration sites of M-MuLV. Both clones induced XC plaques in a transfection assay. The specific infectivity of the clones, however, was different. A total of 10(-5) XC plaques per genome equivalent were induced by the Mov-9 clone, whereas only 10(-9) XC plaques per genome equivalent were induced by the Mov-7 clone. Moreover, NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the Mov-9 clone produced NB-tropic M-MuLV, whereas cells transfected with the Mov-7 clone did not produce infectious virus. The results suggest that M-MuLV integrated at the Mov-7 locus carries a mutation which prevents synthesis of infectious virus but permits XC plaque induction by partial genome expression or synthesis of noninfectious particles. Thus, the pattern of virus expression in Mov-7 and Mov-9 mice correlates with the biological properties of the respective clones. Genomic DNA from Mov-9 mice was not infectious in the transfection assay (specific infectivity < 10(-7) PFU per genome equivalent). As the only difference between the genomic and the cloned Mov-9 DNA appears to be the presence of 5-methylcytosine in CpG sequences, our results suggest that removal of methyl groups by molecular cloning in procaryotes permits genome expression in transfected eucaryotic cells. Our results support the hypothesis that DNA methylation is relevant not only in genome expression in the animal but also in expression of genes transfected into eucaryotic cells.","['Chumakov, I', 'Stuhlmann, H', 'Harbers, K', 'Jaenisch, R']","['Chumakov I', 'Stuhlmann H', 'Harbers K', 'Jaenisch R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/growth & development', 'Mutation', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Virus Activation']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Jun;42(3):1088-98. doi: 10.1128/JVI.42.3.1088-1098.1982.,['10.1128/JVI.42.3.1088-1098.1982 [doi]'],,PMC256946,,,,,,

Low leukemic strains analyzed so far contained only one complete copy of the Akv proviral DNA. The site of integration varied among strains, although genetically related strains often carried the Akv proviral gene in the same chromosomal site. The different substrains of the AKR mouse displayed the presence of variable numbers (two to six) of Akv genomes. In all substrains one Akv genome was present in an identical chromosomal site; this locus probably comprised the progenitor genome. Closely related substrains had several Akv proviral DNAs integrated in common sites. The accumulation of Akv genomes in the germ line of the AKR/FuRdA strain is likely the result of independent integration events, since backcross studies with the Akv-negative 129 strain showed random segregation of all six proviral loci. The AKR/Cnb strain carried a recombinant provirus in the germ line. This provirus resembled in structure the AKR mink cell focus-forming viruses, which are generated by somatic recombination during leukemogenesis. Therefore, the germ-line amplification of Akv proviral DNAs occurs most likely through infection of embryonic cells by circulating virus.","['Quint, W', 'van der Putten, H', 'Janssen, F', 'Berns, A']","['Quint W', 'van der Putten H', 'Janssen F', 'Berns A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics/microbiology', 'Recombination, Genetic']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Mar;41(3):901-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.41.3.901-908.1982.,['10.1128/JVI.41.3.901-908.1982 [doi]'],,PMC256826,,,,,,

In this study, we analyzed the genetic structure and transforming sequence of UR2 by oligonucleotide fingerprinting. The sizes of the genomic RNAs of UR2 and its associated helper virus, UR2AV, were determined to be 24S and 35S, respectively, by sucrose gradient sedimentation. The molecular weight of the 24S UR2 genomic RNA was estimated to be 1.1 x 10(6), corresponding to 3,300 nucleotides, by gel electrophoresis under the native and denatured conditions. RNase T1 oligonucleotide mapping indicated that UR2 RNA contains seven unique oligonucleotides in the middle of the genome and shares eight 5'- and six 3'-terminal oligonucleotides with UR2AV RNA. From these data, we estimated that UR2 RNA contains a unique sequence of about 12 kilobases in the middle of the genome, and contains 1.4 and 0.7 kilobases of sequences shared with UR2AV RNA at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. Partial sequence analysis of the UR2-specific oligonucleotides by RNase A digestion revealed that there are no homologous counterparts to these oligonucleotides in the RNAs of other avian sarcoma and acute leukemia viruses studied to date. UR2-transformed non-virus-producing cells contain a single 24S viral RNA which is most likely the message coding for the transforming protein of UR2.

Although interspecies antigenic determinants present on reverse transcriptase and gag proteins are shared among all mammalian type C viruses, no nucleic acid homology between BaEV and other type C viruses (except RD-114) has been found in conventional liquid hybridization experiments. In this study, we used restriction fragments of cloned BaEV DNA immobilized on nitrocellulose to test for relatedness with [(32)P]cDNA's of various type C and type D viruses. We detected the following distant relationships previously found only through immunological and protein sequencing techniques: (i) eight type C viral cDNA's (the endogenous virus of rhesus monkeys, feline leukemia virus, simian sarcoma virus, gibbon ape leukemia virus, Rauscher murine leukemia virus, BALB-2, NZB, and RD-114) and two type D viral cDNA's (Mason-Pfizer monkey virus and squirrel monkey retrovirus) were able to hybridize with cloned BaEV DNA; (ii) the eight type C probes hybridized to restriction fragments spanning most of the BaEV genome, but only RD-114 hybridized to fragments within the 1.9 kilobases at the 3' end of the genome; (iii) the two type D probes hybridized primarily to fragments within the 1.9 kilobases at the 3' terminus and weakly or not at all elsewhere; and (iv) [(32)P]cDNA's of several other oncornaviruses (mouse mammary tumor virus, equine infectious anemia virus, bovine leukemia virus, and reticuloendotheliosis virus) exhibited no homology with BaEV DNA. DNA sequence analysis has allowed us to orient the BaEV restriction map with the genetic map at both ends of the genome. Homologies between retroviral cDNA's and BaEV clone restriction fragments could thus be related to specific BaEV genes. Whereas type C cDNA's hybridized to fragments from gag, pol, and the pol-env junction, squirrel monkey retrovirus cDNA hybridized only to a fragment coding for the p15E portion of env. Mason-Pfizer monkey virus cDNA also hybridized within the p15E region, but exhibited homology to the 3' half of gp70 as well. These results are discussed relative to previously reported antigenic relatedness of retroviral proteins. The data suggest that BaEV represents an important link in oncornavirus evolution.","['Cohen, M', 'Rice, N', 'Stephens, R', ""O'Connell, C""]","['Cohen M', 'Rice N', 'Stephens R', ""O'Connell C""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', '*Genes, Viral', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phylogeny', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Species Specificity']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Mar;41(3):801-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.41.3.801-812.1982.,['10.1128/JVI.41.3.801-812.1982 [doi]'],['N01-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC256817,,,,,,

These mutants, which were originally isolated from the quail producer line Q10 and were designated 10A, 10C, and 10H, have lost most of the ability to transform hematopoietic cells in vitro and to induce tumors in vivo, but they still transform cultured fibroblasts with the same efficiency as wild-type (wt) MC29. Electrophoretic analyses showed that the mutant genomic RNAs were smaller than the 5.7-kilobase genome of wt MC29; the genomes of mutants 10A, 10C, and 10H were about 5.5, 5.3, and 5.1 kilobases long, respectively. Analyses of the transformation-specific sequences of these mutant RNAs by a combination of T(1) oligonucleotide fingerprinting and hybridization with cDNA from the transformation-specific sequences myc of wt MC29 or competition hybridization including wt MC29 RNA revealed that deletions of myc-specific sequences had occurred. The deletions in all three mutants overlapped, since they all had lost one particular myc-specific oligonucleotide. In agreement with the size of the genomic RNAs, mutants 10C and 10H had lost two additional myc oligonucleotides, and mutant 10A contained a modified myc oligonucleotide. The locations of the deletions were deduced from comparisons with previously established oligonucleotide maps of several members of the MC29 subgroup of acute leukemia viruses and by hybridization of wt and mutant RNAs to molecularly cloned subgenomic fragments of wt MC29 proviral DNA, representing the 5' and 3' domains of the myc sequence. We found that the deleted sequences represented overlapping internal segments of the myc sequence and that the borders of myc with the partial complements of the virion genes gag and env appeared to be conserved in mutant and wt MC29 RNAs. The correlation between the altered transforming potential for hematopoietic cells and the partial deletion of myc in the mutant RNAs provided direct genetic evidence for the involvement of myc in oncogenesis. However, the unaffected efficiency of these mutants in fibroblast transformation suggested that the deleted sequences are not essential for the fibroblast-transforming potential of the onc gene of MC29.","['Bister, K', 'Ramsay, G M', 'Hayman, M J']","['Bister K', 'Ramsay GM', 'Hayman MJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mutation', 'Quail', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Mar;41(3):754-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.41.3.754-766.1982.,['10.1128/JVI.41.3.754-766.1982 [doi]'],['CA-11426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC256813,,,,,,

Strains that carry dominant (+) alleles at both Inc-l and Inb-l show higher titers of MuLV earlier in life than strains that carry only Inc-l or Inb-l. The presence of dominant alleles at both loci results in the appearance of predominantly N-tropic virus early in life. These results demonstrate that the principal determinants of spontaneous virus expression in these low leukemic strains of mice are the In loci or genes linked to them. A further inference that can be drawn from these studies is that the appearance of B-tropic virus is by no means a random process but rather results from predictable patterns of MuLV expression and alteration.","['McCubrey, J', 'Risser, R']","['McCubrey J', 'Risser R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,,IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phenotype', 'Species Specificity', 'Spleen/growth & development']",1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1982 Aug 1;156(2):337-49. doi: 10.1084/jem.156.2.337.,['10.1084/jem.156.2.337 [doi]'],"['CA-07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2186749,,,,,,

When cells were incubated with a combination of alpha-galactosidase and neuraminidase and then induced, they showed an increased rate of differentiation as measured by the formation of benzidine-positive cells. These enzymes used singly, or beta-galactosidase treatment alone, or in combination with neuraminidase, did not change the rate of differentiation. Cell-surface labeling and electrophoretic separation of the glycoconjugates revealed that two regions of approximate molecular weights of 195,000 and 185,000 were neuraminidase-sensitive and one other of molecular weight of about 75,000 was sensitive to alpha-galactosidase. Both untreated and the combined alpha-galactosidase, neuraminidase-modified cells exhibited the same rate of uptake of carbon-14 DMSO, ruling out the possibility that the observed increased rate of differentiation was due to faster penetration of DMSO into enzyme-treated cells. On the other hand, the decrease in the rate of uptake of rubidium-86, an analogue of K+, by treated-induced cells was significantly enhanced over that observed with untreated-induced cells, suggesting that alpha-galactosidase plus neuraminidase modification of the cell surface was affecting at least one of the early events occurring in the Friend erythroleukemic cell differentiation program.","['Suyama, K', 'Goldstein, J']","['Suyama K', 'Goldstein J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Galactosidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.22 (alpha-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Galactosidases/*pharmacology', 'Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neuraminidase/*pharmacology', 'Rubidium/metabolism', 'alpha-Galactosidase/*pharmacology', 'beta-Galactosidase/*pharmacology']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1982 Jun;111(3):320-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041110315.,['10.1002/jcp.1041110315 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The enzyme from reticulocyte lysates shows optimal activity of 50-150 mM KCl and requires the presence of Mg2+. Whilst the enzyme is inactivated after passage of reticulocyte lysates through Sephadex columns in the absence of ATP, it retains full activity provided ATP is included in the column buffer. The activity of the partially purified nuclease was unaffected by the addition of reticulocyte RNase inhibitor, which, in contrast, effectively inhibited other endogenous endonucleases. The ppp(A2'p)nA-dependent Rnase co-purified with a ppp(A2'p)nA-binding protein and with a protein which could be specifically covalently labelled with an oxidised radioactive analogue of ppp(A2'p)nA. This covalent labelling could be carried out either with the partially purified RNase or in crude extracts from rabbit reticulocytes, mouse Krebs and Ehrlich ascites tumour cells and human lymphoblastoid (Daudi) or HeLa cells. In each case the affinity labelled protein migrated to a position corresponding to a apparent molecular weight of about 85 000 on electrophoresis on dodecylsulphate/polyacrylamide gels. In all cases labelling could be prevented by the addition of an excess of unlabelled ppp(A2'p)nA but not, for example, by a similar excess of the biologically inactive dimer ppp(A2'p)'A.

Data from back-crosses of the F1 hybrid to each parent and from BALB/c x B6 recombinant inbred strains indicate that the phenotype of enhanced MuLV production results from interaction of two unlinked loci, dominant (+/+) alleles of which are carried by either parent. Genetic tests with BALB/c x B6 recombinant inbred strains confirm this two-locus model. The loci are designated Inc-1 and Inb-1 to signify their phenotypic detection by induction and the BALB/c or B6 strain of origin, respectively. Examination of hybrids of BALB/c and of B6 with other strains indicates that strains related in pedigree to BALB/c carry Inc-1, whereas those related to B6 carry Inb-1.

Developing erythroid cells from the rat and mouse foetal liver at various stages of gestation were studied. In addition Friend leukaemic cells grown in culture were examined. The transferrin receptor level of Friend cells was similar to that of erythroid cells from the mouse foetal liver. During erythroid cell development the transferrin receptor level increased from about 300,000 per cell at the early normoblast stage to reach a maximum of about 8000,000 per cell on intermediate normoblasts. Further maturation of intermediate normoblasts was accompanied by a decline in the number of transferrin receptors, reaching a level of 105,000 in the circulating reticulocyte. The rate of iron uptake from transferrin during erythroid cell development was found to correlate closely with the number of transferrin receptors. In each of the immature erythroid cell populations studied the rate of iron uptake was about 36 iron atoms per receptor per hour. These results indicate that the level of transferrin receptors may be the major factor which determines the rate of iron uptake during erythroid cell development.","['Iacopetta, B J', 'Morgan, E H', 'Yeoh, G C']","['Iacopetta BJ', 'Morgan EH', 'Yeoh GC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Erythroblasts/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Reticulocytes/*metabolism', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1982/05/07 00:00,1982/05/07 00:01,['1982/05/07 00:00'],"['1982/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1982 May 7;687(2):204-10. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(82)90547-8.,"['0005-2736(82)90547-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(82)90547-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Accumulation of dATP was accompanied by depletion of total soluble adenine ribonucleotides without change in the adenylate energy charge, by the route ATP --> AMP --> IMP --> inosine --> hypoxanthine; conversion of IMP to AMP and de novo purine synthesis were inhibited in these cells. ATP degradation did not occur in a mutant of CEM that was incapable of phosphorylating deoxyadenosine, or in a B cell line with very limited ability to accumulate dATP. We found that dATP and ATP were both able to stimulate markedly the deamination of AMP by lymphoblast AMP deaminase; dAMP was a poor substrate for this enzyme (K(m) = 2.4 mM, vs. 0.4 mM for AMP). Similarly, dATP as well as ATP caused marked activation of IMP dephosphorylation by a lymphoblast cytoplasmic nucleotidase. Inhibition of intracellular AMP deaminase with coformycin prevented degradation of adenine ribonucleotides without affecting dATP accumulation. We propose that ATP-dependent phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine generates ADP and AMP. Simultaneously, dATP accumulation stimulates deamination of AMP, but not dAMP, and the dephosphorylation of IMP to inosine. Coupling of AMP degradation to ATP utilization in deoxyadenosine phosphorylation maintains the adenylate energy charge despite net depletion of cellular ATP.","['Bagnara, A S', 'Hershfield, M S']","['Bagnara AS', 'Hershfield MS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (Nucleotidases)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Adenine Nucleotides/*metabolism', '*Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nucleotidases/metabolism', 'Pentostatin', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Apr;79(8):2673-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.8.2673.,['10.1073/pnas.79.8.2673 [doi]'],"['AM 00434/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 20902/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC346263,,,,,,

Deduction of the encoded amino acid sequence showed that a single open reading frame encodes a 638-amino acid precursor to gp70 and p15E. In addition, there is a typical leader sequence preceding the amino terminus of gp70. The locations of potential glycosylation sites and other structural features indicate that the entire gp70 molecule and most of p15E are located on the outer side of the membrane. Internal cleavage of the env precursor to generate gp70 and p15E occurs immediately adjacent to several basic amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of gp70. This cleavage generates a region of 42 uncharged, relatively hydrophobic amino acids at the amino terminus of p15E, which is located in a position analogous to the hydrophobic membrane fusion sequence of influenza virus hemagglutinin. The mature polypeptides are predicted to associate with the membrane via a region of 30 uncharged, mostly hydrophobic amino acids located near the carboxyl terminus of p15E. Distal to this membrane association region is a sequence of 35 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the env precursor, which is predicted to be located on the inner side of the membrane. By analogy to Moloney murine leukemia virus, a proteolytic cleavage in this region removes the terminal 19 amino acids, thus generating the carboxyl terminus of p15E. This leaves 15 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of p15E on the inner side of the membrane in a position to interact with virion cores during budding. The precise location and order of the large RNase T(1)-resistant oligonucleotides in the env region were determined and compared with those from several leukemogenic viruses of AKR origin.

These traits are not characteristic of the progenitor strains (C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ) or of 11 other BXH recombinant inbred strains. Since B-tropic virus expression may be causally related to the high incidence of lymphoma in this strain, we have analyzed the ecotropic MuLV DNA content of both normal and lymphomatous tissues of BXH-2 mice. Southern analysis and hybridization with an ecotropic MuLV DNA-specific probe showed that DNA of normal BXH-2 tissues contained both parental N-tropic MuLV proviruses but lacked endogenous B-tropic MuLV DNA sequences. In addition, none of 116 F1 hybrid mice derived from male BXH-2 mice spontaneously produced ecotropic MuLV early in life. These results suggest that the B-tropic virus is horizontally transmitted in BXH-2 mice. Southern analysis of DNA from tumor tissues of 12 BXH-2 mice showed that amplification of ecotropic-specific DNA sequences had occurred in lymphomatous tissues of 3 mice and suggested that these tumors were monoclonal.

Small quantities of neutralizing factor which exist in free dispersion in serum were also detected by mixing the p greater than 1.21 g/ml density fraction of mouse serum with human chylomicrons; antiviral activity was subsequently found associated with the human lipoproteins.

OK10 defective viral particles contain an 8-kilobases (kb)-long genomic RNA, lack any detectable reverse transcriptase activity, and are not infectious. We studied the genetic content of OK10 RNA extracted from both virions and infected cells. As shown by RNA-cDNA hybridizations in stringent conditions, about 77% (6.4 kb) of the OK10 8.0kb RNA was related to avian leukosis viruses in the three structural genes gag, pol, and env, as well as in the c region. The remainder of the OK10 genome-encoding capacity (</=1.6 kb) was homologous to the MC29-specific transforming sequence myc(m) and therefore has been named myc(o). EcoRI restriction analysis of the OK10 integrated proviral DNA with different probes indicated the presence of only one provirus in the OK10 QB5 clone, which agreed with the gene order: 5'-gag-Deltapol-myc(o)-Deltaenv-c- 3'. Heteroduplex molecules formed between the viral OK10 8.0-kb RNA and the 6.8-kb SacI DNA fragment of the Prague A strain of Rous sarcoma virus confirmed that structure and indicated that the myc(o) sequence formed a continuous RNA stretch of 1.4 to 1.6 kb long between Deltapol and Deltaenv. We also examined the myc(o)-containing mRNA's transcribed in OK10-transformed cells. OK10-transformed quail fibroblasts (OK10 QB5) transcribed two mRNA species of 8.0 and 3.6 kb containing the myc(o) sequence. The genetic content of the 3.6-kb species made it a possible maturation product of the genome size 8-kb species by splicing out the gag and pol sequences. In OK10-transformed bone marrow cells (OK10 BM), a stable bone marrow-derived cell line producing OK10, the myc(o) sequence was found in four RNA species of 11.0, 8.0, 7.0, and 3.6 kb. Again, the genetic content of these mRNA's indicated that (i) the 3.6-kb species could be spliced out of the 8.0-kb-genome size mRNA and (ii) the 11.0-kb-long mRNA could represent a read-through of the OK10 provirus, the corresponding maturation product being, then, a 7.0-kb mRNA. The 7.0- and 3.6- kb mRNA's both contained the myc(o) sequence, but no sequences related to the gag or pol gene. In conclusion, whereas the myc sequences have been generally thought to be expressed through a gag-onc fusion protein, as for MC29 and CMII viruses, our experiments indicate that they could also be expressed as a non-gag-related product made from a subgenomic mRNA in the OK10-transformed cells.","['Saule, S', 'Sergeant, A', 'Torpier, G', 'Raes, M B', 'Pfeifer, S', 'Stehelin, D']","['Saule S', 'Sergeant A', 'Torpier G', 'Raes MB', 'Pfeifer S', 'Stehelin D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics', 'Fibroblasts/microbiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Quail', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Apr;42(1):71-82. doi: 10.1128/JVI.42.1.71-82.1982.,['10.1128/JVI.42.1.71-82.1982 [doi]'],,PMC256046,,,,,,

This virus is highly related to the three other members of the reticuloendotheliosis virus group, including spleen necrosis virus, but it is apparently unrelated to the avian leukosis-sarcoma virus family. Previous studies have shown that it consists of a replication-competent helper virus (designated REV-A) and a defective component (designated REV) that is responsible for transformation. In this study we used restriction endonuclease mapping and heteroduplex analysis to characterize the proviral DNAs of REV-A and REV. Both producer and nonproducer transformed chicken spleen cells were used as sources of REV proviral DNA; this genome was mapped in detail, and fragments of it were cloned in lambdagtWES.lambdaB. The infected canine thymus line Cf2Th(REV-A) was used as a source of REV-A proviral DNA. The restriction maps and heteroduplexes of the REV and REV-A genomes showed that (proceeding from 5' to 3') (i) REV contains a large fraction of the REV-A gag gene (assuming a gene order of gag-pol-env and gene sizes similar to those of other type C viruses), for the two genomes are very similar over a distance of 2.1 kilobases beginning at their 5' termini; (ii) most or all of REV-A pol is deleted in REV; (iii) REV contains a 1.1 kilobase segment derived from the 3' end of REV-A pol or the 5' end of env or both; (iv) this env region in REV is followed by a 1.9-kilobase segment which is unrelated to REV-A; and (v) the helper-unrelated segment of REV extends essentially all of the way to the beginning of the 3' long terminal repeat. Therefore, like avian myeloblastosis virus but unlike the other avian acute leukemia viruses and most mammalian and avian sarcoma viruses, REV appears to be an env gene recombinant. We also found that the REV-specific segment is derived from avian DNA, for a cloned REV fragment was able to hybridize with the DNA from an uninfected chicken. Therefore, like the other acute transforming viruses, REV appears to be the product of recombination between a replication-competent virus and host DNA. Two other defective genomes in virus-producing chicken cells were also cloned and characterized. One was very similar to REV in its presumptive gag and env segments, but instead of a host-derived insertion it contained additional env sequences. The second was similar (but not identical) to the first in its gag and env regions and appeared to contain an additional 1-kilobase inversion of REV-A sequences.","['Rice, N R', 'Hiebsch, R R', 'Gonda, M A', 'Bose, H R Jr', 'Gilden, R V']","['Rice NR', 'Hiebsch RR', 'Gonda MA', 'Bose HR Jr', 'Gilden RV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteriophage lambda/genetics', 'Chickens/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Reticuloendotheliosis virus/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1982/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Apr;42(1):237-52. doi: 10.1128/JVI.42.1.237-252.1982.,['10.1128/JVI.42.1.237-252.1982 [doi]'],"['CA26169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA27003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC256065,,,,,,

This suggests that p55 is encoded by the FBJ-MSV genome, whereas p39, which was not detected among the in vitro translation products, may not be virus encoded. Another difference between p55 and p39 is that p55 is phosphorylated, with most of the phosphate on a serine residue(s), whereas p39 is phosphorylated to a much lesser extent, if at all.

The 3'- and 5'-specific probes each hybridized to fragments from both ends of proviral DNA, indicating that, in common with those of other retroviruses, these proviruses contain a large terminal redundancy at both ends, each of which consists of sequences derived from both the 3' and 5' regions of the viral RNA. The proviral sequences are organized 3',5'-unique-3',5'. Four restriction enzymes (KpnI, SmaI, PstI, and SstI) recognized sites within the large terminal redundancies, and these sites were conserved within all the isolates tested.

In contrast, the restriction sites within the unique portion of the provirus were not strongly conserved within this group of viruses, even though they were related along most of their genomes. Whereas the 5' 60 to 70% of the RNA of these viruses was more closely related by liquid hybridization experiments than was the 3' 30 to 40%, restriction sites within this region were not preferentially conserved, suggesting that small sequence differences or point mutations or both exist throughout the entire unique portion of the genome among these viruses.","['Trainor, C D', 'Wong-Staal, F', 'Reitz, M S Jr']","['Trainor CD', 'Wong-Staal F', 'Reitz MS Jr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Hylobates/microbiology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sarcoma Virus, Woolly Monkey/*genetics']",1982/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Jan;41(1):298-308. doi: 10.1128/JVI.41.1.298-308.1982.,['10.1128/JVI.41.1.298-308.1982 [doi]'],,PMC256751,,,,,,

The efficiency of the process was extremely low, yielding approximately one transformant per microgram of DNA under conditions which give 10(4) transfectants per microgram of other DNAs (e.g., Moloney sarcoma virus proviral DNA). The DNA was able to induce foci, even though the 3' end of the genome was not present. The transforming gene was thus localized to the 5' portion of the genome. The transformed cells all produced viral RNA and the virus-specific P90 protein. Transmissible virus could be rescued from these cells at very low frequencies by superinfection with helper virus; the rescued A-MuLV virus had variable 3' ends apparently derived by recombination with the helper. Dimerization of the permuted A-MuLV cloned genome to reconstruct a complete provirus did not improve transformation efficiency. Virus could be rescued from these transformants, however, at a high efficiency. Cotransfection of the permuted A-MuLV DNA with proviral M-MuLV DNA yielded a significant increase in the efficiency of transformation and cotransfection of dimeric A-MuLV and proviral M-MuLV resulted in a high-efficiency transformation yielding several thousand more transformants per microgram than A-MuLV DNA alone. We propose that helper virus efficiently rescues A-MuLV from transiently transfected cells which would not otherwise have grown into foci. We hypothesize that multiple copies of A-MuLV DNA introduced into cells by transfection are toxic to cells.

After cloning, DDD mouse cells segregated two types of cells, typical N-type cells and cells lacking in Fv-1 restriction. As both types of cells so far tested retained glucose-6-phosphatase-1 coded by a locus closely linked to Fv-1 and genetic cross experiments indicated the presence of a gene(s) modifying the Fv-1 phenotype, variation in Fv-1 restriction could presumably be brought about by genetic changes in a gene(s) other than Fv-1 itself. N-type and dually permissive cell clones were similarly established from the inbred G mouse. Compositions of polypeptides labeled with [35S]methionine in the N-type and dually permissive cells of DDD and G mouse origins were compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The polypeptide maps of these cells were similar except for a few spots. Among these dissimilar spots, a spot of about 20,000 daltons with a pI of about 5.5 was always present in N-type cells, whereas it was absent in dually permissive cells.

Passive immunization with a CMV immune plasma has been found to be effective for the prevention of interstitial pneumonia after marrow transplantation. Because of the limited availability of high-titered CMV plasma, we studied the kinetics of CMV antibody in bone marrow transplant patients receiving immune globulin intravenous, 5%, in 10% maltose (IGIV). Several lots of IGIV had CMV radioimmunoassay (RIA) antibody titers (1:30,000) comparable to the CMV antibody titers in the CMV immune plasma. A single infusion of 20 cc/kg of IGIV produced a mean peak CMV RIA antibody titer of 1:9,500. This titer fell to 1:1,000 after seven days. These antibody titers were approximately two-to three-fold lower than the CMV RIA antibody titers achieved after a 10 cc/kg dose of the CMV immune plasma. Administration of IGIV at doses lower than 20 cc/kg produced correspondingly lesser increases in the CMV antibody titers of recipients. At all doses, IGIV was well tolerated and caused no significant biochemical abnormalities. Some patients experienced mild elevation of their serum glucose levels and asymptomatic glycosuria. We are presently evaluating the efficacy of IGIV (20 cc/kg given once every week) for the modification of CMV infection and prevention of interstitial pneumonia after bone marrow transplantation in a randomized, controlled study.

The transferrin receptor appears to be a transmembrane molecule and is phosphorylated, the phosphate group being predominantly on serine residues. The cell surface form of the molecular possesses both complex and high mannose oligosaccharide chains, which do not appear to have a direct role in antibody (OKT9) binding. The molecule can be cleaved into a Mr = 70,000 fragment from the cell surface, suggesting that the major part of the receptor is exposed to the extracellular environment. The released Mr = 70,000 fragments are not disulfide-linked and possess the antibody (OKT9)- and transferrin-binding sites.

Considering that most calves born to BLV-infected cows are negative for BLV at birth and remain negative for the first several months of life, the eradication program was based on the identification and isolation of the BLV-free calves born to infected cows. Twenty-five calves raised on colostrum and milk from their infected dams were classified as BLV-free on the basis of negative results in the RIA at 6 to 8 and 9 to 11 months of age. These animals were maintained in either complete (10 calves) or partial (15 calves) isolation from infected cattle and were examined at regular intervals for BLV and BLV antibodies. With the exception of 1 calf in the group raised in partial isolation, the animals have remained free of BLV up to the time of the last evaluation, when they were 32 to 35 months old. At these ages, more than 90% of the nonisolated cattle in the herd are BLV-positive. The data also show that this eradication trial would have failed if, in the initial procedure used to classify the calves as BLV-free, the agar gel immunodiffusion test instead of the RIA had been used. Inasmuch as the 25 calves in this study were fed colostrum and milk from their dams, the fact that only 1 of the calves became infected during the 26 to 29 months of observation provides further evidence that milk-borne transmission of BLV is infrequent and perhaps inconsequential.","['Ferrer, J F']",['Ferrer JF'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Colostrum/immunology', 'Female', 'Immunodiffusion/veterinary', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/prevention & control/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Male', 'Radioimmunoassay/*veterinary', 'Retroviridae/*immunology']",1982/04/15 00:00,1982/04/15 00:01,['1982/04/15 00:00'],"['1982/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 1982 Apr 15;180(8):890-3.,,['3PO1-CA-14193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

These results imply that manipulation of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels in L1210 cells may result in alteration of sensitivity to chemotherapy and alterations in tumor growth. In the present study, we have shown that in vivo treatment of L1210 cells with theophylline results in changes in intracellular cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity levels as well as in an apparent redistribution of both the nuclear and cytoplasmic isozymes. Biochemical events in the tumor cells immediately after administration of theophylline in vivo or a cyclic AMP analog (8-parachlorophenylthio cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate in vitro were independent of the presence of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. The changes apparently involve signal transduction via the adenylate cyclase system and manifest as: (a) increased sensitivity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase to activation by cyclic AMP after treatment of L1210 cells with theophylline; (b) decrease in endogenous nuclear protein phosphorylation sites; and (c) protein kinase isozyme redistribution between nuclear and extranuclear compartments, i.e., a relative increase of the type I isozyme activity in the nuclear and of the type II isozyme activity in the 900 x g supernatant fractions after treatment of the mice with theophylline. The relative activity increases are accompanied by a relative decrease of type II activity from the nucleus and type I isozyme activity from the 900 x g extranuclear supernatant fraction. These events appear temporally related to changes in nuclear RNA metabolism as evidenced by altered kinetics of RNA precursor uptake and incorporation into tumor cell RNA after treatment. These results imply that the cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylative modification of intracellular proteins may play a regulatory role in tumor cell growth and in theophylline-mediated tumor regression.","['Mednieks, M I', 'Jungmann, R A', 'DeWys, W D']","['Mednieks MI', 'Jungmann RA', 'DeWys WD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Jul;42(7):2742-7.,,"['CA 15145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

To investigate this, the electron spin resonance spectra of lipid droplets isolated from the cytoplasm of L1210 leukemia cells were compared with spectra obtained from the intact cell. Mice bearing the L1210 leukemia were fed diets containing either 16% sunflower oil or 16% coconut oil in order to modify the fatty acid composition of the tumor. A microsome-rich fraction prepared from L1210 cells grown in animals fed the sunflower oil-rich diet contained more polyenoic fatty acids (52 versus 29%), while microsomes from L1210 cells grown in animals fed the coconut oil-rich diets contained more monoenoic fatty acids (37 versus 12%). The order parameter calculated for lipid droplets labeled with the 5-nitroxystearic acid spin probe was only about one-half that of intact cells, whereas it was similar to that obtained for pure triolein droplets suspended in buffer. Order parameters of the inner hyperfine splittings calculated from the spectra of cells grown in the sunflower oil-fed animals [0.543 +/- 0.001 (S.E.)] were lower than those from the cells grown in animals fed the coconut oil diets (0.555 +/- 0.002) (p less than 0.005). In contrast, the order parameters of the lipid droplets isolated from the cells grown in animals fed sunflower oil (0.303 +/- 0.029) or coconut oil (0.295 +/- 0.021) were not significantly different, indicating that motion of a spin label probe in the highly fluid cytoplasmic lipid droplets is not affected by these types of modifications in cellular fatty acid composition. Therefore, the electron spin resonance changes that are observed in the intact cells cannot be due to localization of the probe in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. These results support the conclusion that the electron spin resonance changes observed with the 5-nitroxystearic acid spin probe are due to changes in membrane fluidity produced by the modification in cellular lipid composition.","['Simon, I', 'Burns, C P', 'Spector, A A']","['Simon I', 'Burns CP', 'Spector AA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Oils)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cocos', 'Cytoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Dietary Fats/*administration & dosage', '*Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Lipids/*analysis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Oils']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Jul;42(7):2715-21.,,"['CA 00324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 14781/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

The effect of TPA was not inhibited by removal of extracellular Ca2+ or pre-treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. This enhancement by TPA seems to involve a different pathway than enhancement of response to the same hormones after treatment with the anti-tubulin alkaloids colchicine or vinblastine, since a myeloid leukemic cell mutant clone that was non-responsive to the anti-tubulin alkaloids responded to TPA. Furthermore, combined treatment of colchicine-sensitive cells with TPA and colchicine showed an additive stimulating effect. The enhancement of cell response to hormones by TPA was found in myeloid leukemic cell clones that either were or were not induced to differentiate after treatment with TPA. This suggests that enhancement of the effect of these and possibly other hormones by TPA may be an initial step of TPA action, but that this enhancement is not sufficient to induce the wide repertoire of TPA effects including induction of differentiation.","['Simantov, R', 'Sachs, L']","['Simantov R', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '0 (Terpenes)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Alprostadil', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', '*Diterpenes', 'Isoproterenol/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins E/*pharmacology', '*Terpenes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1982/04/29 00:00,1982/04/29 00:01,['1982/04/29 00:00'],"['1982/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1982 Apr 29;720(2):120-5. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(82)90002-7.,"['0167-4889(82)90002-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(82)90002-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

This process, morphologically diagnosed as an immunoblastic lymphoma of B cells using standard histopathologic criteria, was found to be distinctly polyclonal with regard to immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype when analyzed for both surface and cytoplasmic Ig. Further studies demonstrated that this clinicopathologically malignant, dualtropic MuLV-induced, polyclonal immunoblastic lymphoma of B cells in C57BL/6 mice was normal diploid and unable to be successfully transplanted to nonimmunosuppressed syngeneic recipients. Although all serum heavy and light chain components were found to be progressively elevated as the tumor load increased, the polyclonal increase in serum immunoglobulins was most pronounced for mu heavy and kappa light chains (ie, mu greater than gamma 2A greater than alpha greater than gamma 2B greater than gamma 1; kappa greater than lamba). The dissociation of clinicopathologic and biologic criteria for malignancy in the presently described dualtropic (RadLV) MuLV-induced B-cell lesion is sharply contrasted with the thymotropic (RadLV), MuLV-induced T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in C57BL/6 mice. This process is also a clinicopathologically malignant lesion but, when one uses biologic criteria, is found to be distinctly monoclonal, aneuploid, and easily transplanted to nonimmunosuppressed syngeneic recipients. The close clinicopathologic and biologic similarities of the dualtropic MuLV-induced animal model to corresponding human B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases are stressed.","['Pattengale, P K', 'Taylor, C R', 'Twomey, P', 'Hill, S', 'Jonasson, J', 'Beardsley, T', 'Haas, M']","['Pattengale PK', 'Taylor CR', 'Twomey P', 'Hill S', 'Jonasson J', 'Beardsley T', 'Haas M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Line', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/analysis', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Thymus Neoplasms/etiology/*pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1982 Jun;107(3):362-77.,,"['CA19449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1916233,,,,,,

Cats of two ages were exposed to the virus. One group was infected when eight weeks old in the expectation that most of the cats would become persistently viraemic, and the second group when 16 weeks old, so that some would show signs of a transient infection and then recover. The periods following infection when virus was detectable in the blood and in the oropharynx were determined for each group. Three methods for detecting viraemia were compared: virus isolation, immunofluorescence on blood smears and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was good overall agreement among the three tests in detecting virus-positive cats. Virus was found sooner after infection by virus isolation than by the other methods, and virus appeared in the blood slightly sooner in cats which developed persistent viraemia than in transiently viraemic cats. Infectious FeLV was isolated from the oropharynx of all of the persistently viraemic cats, in most cases simultaneously with virus in the plasma. Virus was also isolated from the mouth of most transiently viraemic cats. Under field conditions such transient excretion of virus lasting only a few days would rarely be detected in a single sampling. This might explain how FeLV is maintained in free range urban cats in the absence of a large number of cats with persistent active FeLV infection. For routine diagnosis, immunofluorescence would appear to offer the best chance of differentiating transient and persistent infections by FeLV.","['Jarrett, O', 'Golder, M C', 'Stewart, M F']","['Jarrett O', 'Golder MC', 'Stewart MF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Vet Rec,The Veterinary record,0031164,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/microbiology', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cat Diseases/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Cats', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*diagnosis/microbiology']",1982/03/06 00:00,1982/03/06 00:01,['1982/03/06 00:00'],"['1982/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Rec. 1982 Mar 6;110(10):225-8. doi: 10.1136/vr.110.10.225.,['10.1136/vr.110.10.225 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Three cellular DNA clones were found and compared with each other and with the viral genome by physical mapping with restriction endonucleases and by heteroduplex analysis. These experiments indicated that the three cellular clones overlap and represent a single cellular locus. The RNA genome of MC29 and normal cell DNA share a homologous region of 1.6 kilobases which is interrupted in the cellular DNA by 1.0 kilobase of sequences not present in the viral genome. Hybridization of the cloned cellular DNA to viral RNA and analysis of the protected viral RNA by fingerprinting techniques indicated that there is extensive sequence homology between the helper virus-unrelated mcv sequences of the viral RNA and the cellular DNA, with only minor base differences. The cellular mcv locus, however, lacks all helper virus-related sequences of MC29, including those of the partial viral gag gene which, together with mcv, encodes the probable transforming protein of MC29.

The 8.2-kilobase pair SM-FeSV provirus is longer than those of other feline sarcoma viruses and contains a transforming gene (v-fms) flanked by sequences derived from feline leukemia virus. The order of genes with respect to viral RNA is 5'-gag-fms-env-3', in which the entire feline leukemia virus env gene and an almost complete gag sequence are represented. Transfection of NIH/3T3 cells with cloned SM-FeSV proviral DNA induced foci of morphologically transformed cells which expressed SM-FeSV gene products and contained rescuable sarcoma viral genomes. Cells transformed by viral infection or after transfection with cloned proviral DNA expressed the polyprotein (P170gag-fms) characteristic of the SM-FeSV strain. Two proteolytic cleavage products (P120fms and pp55gag) were also found in immunoprecipitates from metabolically labeled, transformed cells. An additional polypeptide, detected at comparatively low levels in SM-FeSV transformants, was indistinguishable in size and antigenicity from the envelope precursor (gPr85env) of feline leukemia virus. The complexity of the v-fms gene (3.1 +/- 0.3 kilobase pairs) is approximately twofold greater than the viral oncogene sequences (v-fes) of Snyder-Theilen and Gardner-Arnstein FeSV. By heteroduplex, restriction enzyme, and nucleic acid hybridization analyses, v-fms and v-fes sequences showed no detectable homology to one another. Radiolabeled DNA fragments representing portions of the two viral oncogenes hybridized to different EcoRI and HindIII fragments of normal cat cellular DNA. Cellular sequences related to v-fms (designated c-fms) were much more complex than c-fes and were distributed segmentally over more than 40 kilobase pairs in cat DNA. Comparative structural studies of the molecularly cloned proviruses of Synder-Theilen, Gardner-Arnstein, and SM-FeSV showed that a region of the feline-leukemia virus genome derived from the pol-env junction is represented adjacent to v-onc sequences in each FeSV strain and may have provided sequences preferred for recombination with cellular genes.","['Donner, L', 'Fedele, L A', 'Garon, C F', 'Anderson, S J', 'Sherr, C J']","['Donner L', 'Fedele LA', 'Garon CF', 'Anderson SJ', 'Sherr CJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mink', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Feline/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Feb;41(2):489-500. doi: 10.1128/JVI.41.2.489-500.1982.,['10.1128/JVI.41.2.489-500.1982 [doi]'],,PMC256777,,,,,,

One cloned MuLV DNA fragment (designated MCF 1) contained sequences extending 6.8 kilobases from an EcoRI restriction site in the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) to an EcoRI site located in the envelope (env) region and was indistinguishable by restriction endonuclease mapping for 5.1 kilobases (except for the EcoRI site in the LTR) from the 5' end of AKR ecotropic proviral DNA. The DNA segment extending from 5.1 to 6.8 kilobases contained several restriction sites that were not present in the AKR ecotropic provirus. A 0.5-kilobase DNA segment located at the 3' end of MCF 1 DNA contained sequences which hybridized to a xenotropic env-specific DNA probe but not to labeled ecotropic env-specific DNA. This dual character of MCF 1 proviral DNA was also confirmed by analyzing heteroduplex molecules by electron microscopy. The second cloned proviral DNA (designated MCF 2) was a 6.9-kilobase EcoRI DNA fragment which contained LTR sequences at each end and a 2.0-kilobase deletion encompassing most of the env region. The MCF 2 proviral DNA proved to be a useful reagent for detecting LTRs electron microscopically due to the presence of nonoverlapping, terminally located LTR sequences which effected its circularization with DNAs containing homologous LTR sequences.

Numerous type-C virus particles with occasional budding forms were observed in all cell lines. Expression of XC-detectable, N-tropic, ecotropic virus was observed in every cell line, whereas the presence of xenotropic and mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) viruses could be detected only in TER cells derived from preleukemic and leukemic mice. Expression of xenotropic virus in various cells of newborn and young AKR mice could readily be induced by IUdR treatment, whereas MCF virus was never detected in these cells, with the exception of the A2T cell line after more than 20 passages, in which MCF virus with dual-tropic infectivity emerged in addition to ecotropic and xenotropic viruses. These spontaneous and induced MCF viruses were purified, and their virological properties were characterized. The cloned MCF viruses (MCFs AT1, AT2, AT3, and AT4-IU) showed dual tropism and produced cytopathic effect-like foci in mink lung cells. Preinfection with either ecotropic or xenotropic virus interfered with the infectivity of MCF viruses. Spontaneous leukemogenesis in AKR mice was accelerated by the inoculation of MCF viruses. These findings indicate that TER cells could serve as the host cells for the genetic recombination of the endogenous MuLV; the recombinant MuLV, MCF virus, appears to be most closely associated with leukemogenesis in AKR mice.","['Yanagihara, K', 'Hamada, K', 'Seyama, T', 'Imamura, N', 'Yokoro, K']","['Yanagihara K', 'Hamada K', 'Seyama T', 'Imamura N', 'Yokoro K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*microbiology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/microbiology', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*microbiology', 'Virus Replication']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1982 Feb;41(2):360-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.41.2.360-366.1982.,['10.1128/JVI.41.2.360-366.1982 [doi]'],,PMC256766,,,,,,

In six cell lines, however, both kappa-chain genes remained in embryonic form; lambda-chain genes were in embryonic form in all the cell lines. These results suggested the hierarchy of Ig gene rearrangements, beginning with mu and proceeding to kappa and then to lambda. JH rearrangement was also shown to precede the appearance of a B lymphocyte antigen. In three cell lines (A1-A3), which were considered subclones derived from a single common precursor, it was suggested that one rearranged JH gene was functional, and the other was nonfunctional, indicating that allelic exclusion already operated in pre-B cells.","['Sugiyama, H', 'Akira, S', 'Yoshida, N', 'Kishimoto, S', 'Yamamura, Y', 'Kincade, P', 'Honjo, T', 'Kishimoto, T']","['Sugiyama H', 'Akira S', 'Yoshida N', 'Kishimoto S', 'Yamamura Y', 'Kincade P', 'Honjo T', 'Kishimoto T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1982 Jun;128(6):2793-7.,,"['AI-00265/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-12741/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Differentiation of HL-60 cells was characterized by increased phagocytosis, increased lysozyme activity (EC 3.2.1.17) in the growth medium, and changes in morphology to those characteristics of more mature cells resembling macrophages. Many of the cells treated with TPA became aggregated, attaching firmly to culture flasks. The average intracellular myeloperoxidase activity (EC 1.11.1.7) per cell decreased during induction of differentiation by TPA. It was also found that TPA enhanced, rather than inhibited, differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by DMSO. In addition to TPA, several polyfunctional diterpene esters of the tigliane, ingenane, and daphnane type have been tested for their ability to induce morphological and functional changes of HL-60 cells. The activities of the compounds to induce these changes correlated well with their activities as tumor promoters in two-step carcinogenesis in mouse skin. In particular, half the concentrations required for induction of adhesion of the cells to flasks were roughly correlated to the potency of these compounds as tumor promoters. Among the compounds tested, phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (PDD), ingenol-3-hexadecanoate, Pimelea factor P1 and Pimelea factor P2 were as active as TPA, while 4-O-methyl-TPA and 4 alpha-PDD were much less active.

We have also studied the immune mediated degranulation of these cells induced by the above lipid membrane targets. In some cases both studies were carried out with liposomes containing various surface densities of lipid haptens. From these studies we conclude that freely mobile nonaggregated lipid haptens in bilayer membrane targets can trigger efficient serotonin release from rat basophil leukemia cells in the presence of specific antihapten IgE. Solid target membranes are also effective as stimulators of serotonin release. The release of serotonin depends strongly on the surface density of lipid haptens over a narrow range of surface densities.

Under aerobic conditions microsomal indicine N-oxide reduction was stimulated to half the levels seen under anaerobic conditions. EDTA alone was much less effective at stimulating indicine N-oxide reduction, while FeCl3 alone had no effect on reduction. Other complexes of Fe(III) had little or no effect in stimulating microsomal indicine N-oxide reduction. Fe(III)-EDTA stimulated indicine N-oxide reduction by purified NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and NADPH. It is probable that iron serves to transfer electrons between microsomal flavoprotein reductases and indicine N-oxide. The redox potential and the presence of an exchangeable ligand, such as water, in the inner ligand sphere of the iron complex are suggested to be important factors in determining which iron complexes will stimulate indicine N-oxide reduction. EDTA complexes of other transition metal ions do not stimulate indicine N-oxide reduction. Hydroxyl radicals, detected as the spin adduct of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyroline-N-oxide, appear to be formed during Fe(II)-EDTA-dependent reduction of indicine N-oxide under anaerobic conditions. Fe(III)-EDTA at concentrations between 50 and 250 microM stimulated indicine N-oxide reduction by rat isolated hepatocytes up to 5-fold under anaerobic conditions and to half these values under aerobic conditions. By themselves, EDTA and FeCl3 at similar concentrations produced a small stimulation of indicine N-oxide reduction by hepatocytes under anaerobic conditions.

Whereas these peculiar cytoplasmic inclusions are commonly seen in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and can be present in a few cells in other hematologic disorders, to our knowledge they have never been documented in insulinoma. In fact, they are exceedingly rare in epithelial tumors. A review of the literature uncovered only two instances, one in an adenoma of the adrenal cortex, and one in a paraganglioma. In these two cases and in the insulinoma reported here, RPCs tend to be longer, have fewer lamellae, and occur in greater numbers per single cell than in HCL. Although the nature and significance of RLCs remain poorly understood, the fact that all three epithelial neoplasms in which they have been observed belong to the endocrine system is noteworthy.","['Perez-Atayde, A R', 'Hartman, A S', 'Seiler, M W']","['Perez-Atayde AR', 'Hartman AS', 'Seiler MW']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Adenoma, Islet Cell/*ultrastructure', 'Adult', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/*ultrastructure', 'Insulinoma/*ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*ultrastructure', 'Ribosomes/*ultrastructure']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1982 May;106(5):221-3.,,,,,,,,,

In protocol 2, laparotomy was systematic in patients over 50 (35 cases). Patients with stages 1 and II treated as mentioned above. Patients with stage III received two Mopp courses followed by total nodal irradiation. Patients older than 50 with stages I and II and poor prognosis factors received chemotherapy only. Laparotomy was associated with a 0% mortality rate and a 3,6% morbidity rate. No myelitis or pericarditis were observed. Herpes zoster occurred in 24% of the patients, pulmonary apex fibrosis in 6%, hypothyroiditis in 2,4%, and leucopenia in 3,6%. Two late infectious complications were fatal. No solid tumor was apparent. Acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma developed in two patients.

Recombinant plasmid clones were obtained that contained both cloned fragments of Friend spleen locus-forming virus (SFFV) DNA and the herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (TK; ATP:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21) gene (tk). The effects of the LTR on tk expression were determined by constructing clones containing tk coding sequences with or without 5' sequences necessary for the initiation of transcription, inserted either 200 or 1200 base pairs downstream from the SFFV 5' LTR. The expression of the HSV TK protein by these clones was tested by gene transfer of the cloned into TK- mouse cells and assay of TK enzyme activity in TK+ transformants. These experiments demonstrate that: (i) the SFFV 5' LTR activates expression of tk coding sequences when these sequences are inserted 200 base pairs downstream from, and in the same orientation as, the LTR; (ii) tk is not activated when placed 1200 base pairs downstream from, and in the same orientation as, the LTR or when tk is inserted in either site in the opposite orientation as the LTR; (iii) the SFFV 5' LTR does not interfere with in vivo expression of tk when it is flanked by homologous 5' promoter sequences.

The p24 core protein was purified to homogeneity. The amino acid composition, the COOH-terminal amino acid, and the NH(2)-terminal amino acid sequence of the first 25 residues of this major internal structural protein were determined. These results were then compared to the known structure of the internal core protein of other retroviruses. The compositional data reveal that HTLV p24 is chemically distinct from p30-p24 of other animal retroviruses, in agreement with the earlier immunological analyses. However, HTLV p24 shares the common NH(2)-terminal proline and COOH-terminal leucine of all mammalian type C viral p30s. In addition, like bovine leukemia virus (BLV), HTLV lacks the common prolylleucylarginine tripeptide and the larger conserved region found near the NH(2) terminus of the other mammalian type C viral p30s. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of HTLV p24 with previously determined sequences of other retrovirus proteins, including BLV p24, reveals statistically significant sequence homology only to BLV. The results reported here demonstrate that HTLV p24 is related to but chemically distinct from the major core protein of other retroviruses. Similarly, previous results showed that there was no immunological crossreactivity of the p24 protein and reverse transcriptase of HTLV with other retroviruses, including BLV, and no nucleic acid sequence homology. However, the present results, combined with the common size of the p24 and reverse transcriptase, suggest that HTLV may be closer to BLV than any other known retrovirus.","['Oroszlan, S', 'Sarngadharan, M G', 'Copeland, T D', 'Kalyanaraman, V S', 'Gilden, R V', 'Gallo, R C']","['Oroszlan S', 'Sarngadharan MG', 'Copeland TD', 'Kalyanaraman VS', 'Gilden RV', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*analysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*analysis', 'Lymphoma/microbiology', 'Retroviridae/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Viral Core Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Feb;79(4):1291-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.4.1291.,['10.1073/pnas.79.4.1291 [doi]'],,PMC345948,,,,,,

In uninduced and induced cells, the chromatin regions containing the alpha- and beta-(major)-globin genes are more sensitive to digestion by DNase I than is the region containing an immunoglobulin gene (Igalpha) not expressed during erythroid differentiation. However, at low concentrations of DNase I, a 6- to 10-fold increase in site-specific cleavages was generated in chromatin regions near both the alpha- and beta(major)-globin genes in cells induced to differentiate by HMBA. The DNase I hypersensitive site near the beta(major)-globin gene maps to a small region near the 5' terminus of the gene. No detectable change in the pattern of DNA methylation around either the alpha- or beta-globin genes was observed during HMBA-mediated erythroid differentiation.

In contrast to previously characterized monoclonal antibodies that recognize the transferrin receptor, this antibody, designated 42/6, blocks the binding of transferrin to its receptor and inhibits the growth of the human T leukemic cell line, CCRF-CEM, in vitro. Inhibition of cell growth was dose dependent, and as little as 2.5 micrograms of purified antibody per ml had a detectable effect, even though transferrin was present in the tissue culture medium in large molar excess. Cells grown in the presence of antibody for 7 days accumulated in S phase of the cell cycle. The addition of iron to antibody-treated cultures in the form of ferric complexes or ferrous sulfate did not overcome the growth inhibitory effects of the anti-transferrin-receptor antibodies. This result suggests that either transferrin is the only means by which CCRF-CEM leukemic cells can be provided with sufficient iron in vitro or that other factors in addition to iron starvation are involved in the antibody-mediated growth inhibition.

Under optimal conditions, including the use of neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes, 200 microgram/ml of BLV purified from the supernatant fluid of BLV-infected bat cells had haemagglutinating titres of about 512 units. BLV haemagglutination was drastically affected by pH and temperature; maximum agglutination occurred at pH 6 and 4 degrees C. That the BLV haemagglutinin is a glycoprotein was suggested by the fact that trypsin, potassium periodate or neuraminidase, but not lipid solvents or phospholipase C, significantly reduced the haemagglutinating (HA) activity of purified BLV. Furthermore, purified BLV glycoprotein of mol. wt. 51 000 (gp51) had HA activity. The receptors for BLV on mouse erythrocytes were inactivated by proteolytic enzymes but not by sodium deoxycholate or potassium periodate. Neuraminidase treatment of erythrocytes increase their agglutinability fourfold. Haemagglutination is a relatively sensitive test for detecting BLV glycoprotein because 0.4 microgram/ml of glycoprotein can be detected by this method. The pH and temperature sensitivity of the BLV HA reaction and specificity for mouse erythrocytes distinguish BLV from that of equine infectious anaemia virus and murine leukaemia virus, the other C type retroviruses known to have HA activity.","['Sentsui, H', 'Thorn, R M', 'Kono, Y', 'Ferrer, J F']","['Sentsui H', 'Thorn RM', 'Kono Y', 'Ferrer JF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Hemagglutinins, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests', '*Hemagglutination, Viral', 'Hemagglutinins, Viral/analysis/immunology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Sheep', 'Temperature']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1982 Mar;59(Pt 1):83-9. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-59-1-83.,['10.1099/0022-1317-59-1-83 [doi]'],['CA 14193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Two viruses were cloned from type II tumour cells: a xenotropic virus (II clone 1) and an N-tropic ecotropic virus (II clone 2). No pathogenic activity was found when II clone 1 was inoculated into newborn and adult DBA/2J and NIH/Swiss mice observed for up to 20 months, whereas II clone 2 caused a rapid anaemic erythroleukaemia in both N- and B-type newborn mouse strains. It caused a similar form of leukaemia in susceptible N-type adult mice, but at a lower frequency and with a longer latency (usually greater than 5 months). This finding demonstrated a lack of NB restriction in newborn mice. The virus was much less active in DBA/2J mice from which it had been originally cloned; it also appeared to cause lymphoma or to shorten the latency of spontaneous lymphoma in DBA/2J mice.","['Vinton, E C', 'Woytowicz, J M', 'Levy, S B']","['Vinton EC', 'Woytowicz JM', 'Levy SB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,,IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Lymphoma/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Retroviridae/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Splenomegaly']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1982 Mar;59(Pt 1):73-81. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-59-1-73.,['10.1099/0022-1317-59-1-73 [doi]'],['CA24530/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Application of combined ultrasound and X-irradiation have shown that with some experimental animal tumours the radiation dose required to locally control 50% of the tumours can be reduced by ultrasound. These results were also consistent with a thermal mechanism of action hypothesis. Fractionated X-irradiation was not enhanced as much as single dose. Pulsing the ultrasound with the same time-average intensity resulted in the same radiosensitivity enhancement. The combined effects of ultrasound and cancer chemotherapy drugs have been studied in mouse leukaemia. The treatment was applied in vitro with cells in suspension. Subsequent to treatment, the cells were inoculated into host mice and survival was monitored. Cytotoxic action of 5 of 10 drugs studied was enhanced by ultrasound. A thermal mechanism of action apparently was not involved. Cavitation in the suspension probably played a role in the cytotoxic enhancement. Experimental data are consistent with the concept that ultrasound causes rapidly reversible cell damage which, in the presence of cytotoxic drugs, is not so readily reversed and results in significant loss of lethal potential of the malignant cells to the host.","['Kremkau, F W']",['Kremkau FW'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer Suppl,The British journal of cancer.

The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve was about 25 times larger in the leukemic rats at both dose levels. The data indicate that daunorubicin has a lower volume of distribution in leukemic rats as compared with normals. The large reduction in plasma clearance of daunorubicin in the leukemic rats can to some extent be explained by impairment of hepatic and renal functions but the results indicate that the leukemic state per se was of importance for the observed pharmacokinetic differences. This finding may be of importance for the treatment of patients with a high leukemic cell load, since higher retention of the drug in the central compartment leads to lower concentrations in poorly vascularized tissues, which favours the development of resistant leukemic cell clones.","['Andersson, B', 'Beran, M', 'Alvan, G', 'Peterson, C']","['Andersson B', 'Beran M', 'Alvan G', 'Peterson C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Acta Radiol Oncol,Acta radiologica.

In uninfected cat DNAs, the U5 LTR segment from the Gardner-Arnstein strain B virus is present at approximately 150 copies per cell. This level is approximately 10-fold greater than that of endogenous internal FeLV sequences. The U5 sequences differ in copy number and, to some extent, in location from one animal to another. For any one animal, the sequence organization of the U5 segments is the same among different tissues, showing that the pattern is inherited through the germ line. Most importantly, the viral U3 LTR probe hybridizes only very weakly with uninfected cat DNAs. Both the U3 and the U5 regions of the LTR from the Gardner-Arnstein strain of virus cross-hybridize with DNA derived from four other infectious FeLVs representing A, B, and C subtypes. Thus, the C3 region may be used as a probe for studying the number and location of exogenously acquired FeLV proviruses in infected cat tissues. In some cases exogenously acquired proviruses are present in unique sites in the genome of virus-positive cat lymphosarcomas, indicating a monoclonal origin for the tumor. In other tumors, the proviral sequences are randomly distributed over many sites. Lymphosarcomas of virus-negative cats have no exogenous U3 sequences despite epidemiological evidence of an association of virus-negative leukemia with exposure to FeLV.","['Casey, J W', 'Roach, A', 'Mullins, J I', 'Burck, K B', 'Nicolson, M O', 'Gardner, M B', 'Davidson, N']","['Casey JW', 'Roach A', 'Mullins JI', 'Burck KB', 'Nicolson MO', 'Gardner MB', 'Davidson N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*microbiology', 'Cats', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tissue Distribution']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Dec;78(12):7778-82. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.12.7778.,['10.1073/pnas.78.12.7778 [doi]'],"['CA 25991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC349354,,,,,,

Sera from rats that had been inoculated with any of several Morris hepatomas or a mammary adenocarcinoma contained immunoglobulins capable of complexing with poly(A) polymerase. No antibodies to the enzyme could be detected in sera from control animals or from those bearing tumors for short periods of time. Antibodies to poly(A) polymerase were also observed in sera from human patients with leukemia, polycythemia vera, and Wilms tumor. The antibodies were not evident in sera from normal volunteers or from patients with nonneoplastic diseases. These included lupus erythematosus, a disorder in which antibodies are produced against an array of nuclear proteins. Immunoglobulins from the serum of one of the human patients were capable of inhibiting poly(A) polymerase activity in vitro, whereas those prepared from the serum of a normal volunteer did not affect enzyme activity. As determined by the diazobenzyloxymethyl-filter technique, the relative concentration of antibodies in the sera of an individual with leukemia (in remission) increased severalfold during a relapse.

Mice that carry both Inc-1 and Inb-1 yield 10- to 50-fold more virus-producing cells than parental strains on induction with halogenated pyrimidines in vitro and demonstrate enhanced murine leukemia virus production in vivo. Here, we show that mice related to BALB/c in origin, i.e., A, C3H/He, and SEC, have an Inc-1 locus that is allelic with that of BALB/c. The C57BR mouse strain has an Inb-1 locus that is allelic with that of B6, located on chromosome 8, 30 cM from Es-1. We also show that the Inc-1 locus of BALB/c mice is located on chromosome 5, 24 cM from Pgm-1 and 43 cM from Gus.

The similarities are so striking as to suggest a common origin of these viruses, which are present in some, but not all, inbred mouse strains. The virogenes of AKR mice may have been acquired by either: (a) common descent of AKR (and other AKV(+) strains) from a common ancestor of AKR and molossinus animals, or (b) horizontal germ line infection of the AKR strains by molossinus virus at 1;he strain's inception followed by fixation through inbreeding. The sexual descent model carries with it a prediction of relative consanguinity of the AKR strain and molossinus, whereas the horizontal infection model does not. We have examined the polymorphic allozyme (allelic isozyme) genotype of 51 nonvirus-related loci in 17 strains of mice including AKR, C58, BALB/c, Swiss, and molossinus. By comparing the composite allozyme genotype of different inbred and outbred mouse strains, the ""genetic distance"" statistic was derived. Genetic distance measures the degree of allelic substitution between populations and increases proportionately with the amount of time the populations have been reproductively isolated. The genetic distance computed between molossinus and AKR is large, nearly 5-10 times the distance between known related populations and strains (e.g., C57L vs. C57BL/6). Molossinus had a similarly large distance from AKV negative strains (Swiss, C57L) as it did from AKV- positive strains. Cellular DNA sequences that flank the integrated AKV provirus were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion of liver DNA from molossinus, AKR, and additional inbred strains that express ecotropic murine leukemia virus. The integration flanks of three AKR provirus sequences, Akv-1, Akv-2, and a third uncharacterized sequence, were not evident in molossinus cell DNA, which contained at least six different proviral integration fragments. These data effectively exclude the interpretation of consanguinity of AKR and molossinus and support the notion of acquisition of the endogenous virus in AKR by horizontal infection of the molossinus virus.","[""O'Brien, S J"", 'Moore, J L', 'Martin, M A', 'Womack, J E']","[""O'Brien SJ"", 'Moore JL', 'Martin MA', 'Womack JE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,['EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)'],IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*genetics', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1982 Apr 1;155(4):1120-23. doi: 10.1084/jem.155.4.1120.,['10.1084/jem.155.4.1120 [doi]'],,PMC2186636,,,,,,

For this, substrains of mice have been previously derived carrying the Moloney leukemia virus (M-MuLV) in their germ line. Virus activation occurs in some of these substrains at different stages of development, resulting in two classes of viral genomes. The genetically transmitted (endogenous) copy is present in every cell, whereas somatically acquired (""exogenous"") copies are carried only in cells that were superinfected. We compared these two classes of M-MuLV genomes using two parameters. DNA sequences of the endogenous M-MuLV genome in all mouse substrains were highly methylated in GCGC, the recognition sequence of the restriction enzyme Hha I, and were not infectious (specific infectivity less than 10(-7) pfu per proviral genome) in a DNA transfection assay. In contrast, the ""exogenous"" copies were hypomethylated and infectious. These parameters are strongly correlated to genome activity in the animal: only tissues carrying exogenous copies express virus-specific RNA. With the assumption that gene expression of transfected DNA is controlled by mechanisms that are relevant for gene expression in the animal, our results suggest that DNA methylation plays a causative role in gene regulation during development and differentiation.","['Stuhlmann, H', 'Jahner, D', 'Jaenisch, R']","['Stuhlmann H', 'Jahner D', 'Jaenisch R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'Lysogeny', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*embryology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell. 1981 Oct;26(2 Pt 2):221-32. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90305-6.,"['0092-8674(81)90305-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(81)90305-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The virus-transformed epithelial cells produced enhanced amounts of fibronectin into their growth media. Nontransformed M. musculus castaneous epithelial cells mainly produced type I collagen, as shown by metabolic labeling and polypeptide analysis. A significant increase in the glycoprotein production was seen by the MuLV-transformed cells, whereas small changes in the collagen production were apparent after MSV transformation. MuLV-transformed cells produced increased amounts of type I collagen and also some collagenous polypeptides that comigrated with procollagen type IV chains. The ratio of the procollagen type I chains deposited in the matrix was altered in transformed cells. Radioactive surface labeling of the cells revealed changes of the high-molecular-weight glycoproteins in both the MSV- and the MuLV-transformed cells.

It was found that both resistant sublines exhibited collateral sensitivity instead of cross-resistance to these new antipurine drugs. Since more potent cytotoxic activities of these drugs against 6-MP-resistant cells were observed even in vivo cell culture systems, this collateral sensitivity was proved on a cellular basis. Biochemical studies revealed that 6-MP-resistant sublines of both P388 and L1210 leukemia are deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity. In these cells, not only the activation of 6-MP to its nucleotide but also the synthesis of guanosine 5'-monophosphate via the salvage pathway seems to be severely restricted. However, SL-1250 and SM-108 can be activated to their nucleotide even in these 6-MP-resistant cells because the activation of these compounds is proceeded by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. In conclusion, suppression of de novo purine synthesis with SL-1250 and SM-108 seems to be a very efficient means of killing these 6-MP-resistant cells, which lack a salvage pathway for guanosine 5'-monophosphate.","['Inaba, M', 'Fukui, M', 'Yoshida, N', 'Tsukagoshi, S', 'Sakurai, Y']","['Inaba M', 'Fukui M', 'Yoshida N', 'Tsukagoshi S', 'Sakurai Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Purines)', '66148-63-8 (5-carbamoyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl-piperonylate)', '85-32-5 (Guanosine Monophosphate)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'U6IZ97918F (4-carbamoylimidazolium 5-olate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biotransformation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Guanosine Monophosphate/metabolism', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/metabolism', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Purines/*biosynthesis']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Mar;42(3):1103-6.,,,,,,,,,

As a result, the mortality from cancers has dropped by 15% for persons under the age of 45 years and even more for those under 30 years of age. Many other metastatic cancers can now be successfully controlled with chemotherapy and, ultimately, more will be added to the growing list of curable cancers. The chemotherapeutic agents responsible for the cures of some cancers include asparaginase, actinomycin D, Adriamycin, bleomycin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytosine arabinoside, 5-fluorouracil, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, nitrogen mustard, prednisone, procarbazine, and vincristine. The discovery of new effective drugs such as AMSA and anthracenedione promises to improve the success rates obtained with present therapy. Chemotherapy is indicated for every patient who has metastatic cancer, since virtually every patient can receive some palliation from such therapy, while for some patients chemotherapy holds the promise of prolongation of life or even cure.","['Boh-Seng, Y']",['Boh-Seng Y'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 1981 Jul;10(3):364-7.,,,,,,,,,

Using cytosolic and particulate extracts of normal human lymphocytes we measured protein-kinase activities, then following partial purification by DEAE and phosphocellulose chromatography the isoenzymes of cyclic AMP dependent and independent protein-kinases and casein-kinases were determined in order to establish a profile (12 normal subjects). The same methodology was applied to the lymphocytes of 5 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 3 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Compared to normal lymphocytes, the specific activity of cytosolic and particulate extracts from the leukemics was higher for histone and casein-kinases, following elimination of an inhibitory activity present in the crude extracts. Studies of the isoenzymes showed, in some individuals, the presence in both cytosolic and particulate extracts of two important cyclic AMP dependent histone-kinase activities, which were very low or absent in normal lymphocyte extracts. In the particulate extracts we found a constant increase in casein-kinase activities concerning essentially one of the two isoenzymes present. Also, the ratio of the different isoenzymes separated by chromatography was considerably modified with regard to both histone and casein-kinases. These quantitative and qualitative abnormalities were present in some CLL cells and in non-granulocytic acute leukemic cells. They resembled the modification reported during normal lymphocyte stimulation by phytohemagglutinin, and also seemed to reflect the intensity of cellular replication and to some degree the progression of the disease.","['Boivin, P', 'Galand, C']","['Boivin P', 'Galand C']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,"['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protamine Kinase)']",IM,"['Casein Kinases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Protamine Kinase/blood', 'Protein Kinases/*blood']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1981;23(5):257-65.,,,,Proteine-kinases des cellules de leucemies humaines.

Life table analysis revealed an overall 25% risk of CLM at 3 years. CLM was diagnosed during all phases of the patients' clinical course, but the majority (83%) were cases diagnosed at the time of progressive systemic disease. Univariate log rank analysis indicated that pretreatment factors associated with the development of CLM included: involvement of the brain, spinal cord, bone marrow, liver or bone; extensive disease; and male sex. Patients who did not obtain a complete response to systemic therapy were at greater risk of developing CLM than complete responders. Multivariate analysis of these factors indicated that liver metastases were most strongly associated with the time to development of CLM, followed in order of importance by bone and CNS metastases. Patients usually presented with signs and symptoms reflecting involvement of multiple areas of the neuraxis including the cerebrum, cranial nerves and spinal cord; 51 of the 60 patients had intracerebral metastases and 27 had spinal cord lesions during their clinical course. Autopsy features including focal or diffuse involvement of the leptomeninges with infiltration of the Virchow-Robin spaces were similar to meningeal lymphoma and leukemia, except that CLM was rarely the sole manifestation of CNS tumor. Median survival following the diagnosis of CLM was 7 weeks. However, most deaths were attributed to systemic disease, and treatment with intrathecal chemotherapy and irradiation often provided palliation. With the increased awareness of this complication, an antemortem diagnosis increased from 39% prior to 1977, to 88% of patients after 1977.","['Rosen, S T', 'Aisner, J', 'Makuch, R W', 'Matthews, M J', 'Ihde, D C', 'Whitacre, M', 'Glatstein, E J', 'Wiernik, P H', 'Lichter, A S', 'Bunn, P A Jr']","['Rosen ST', 'Aisner J', 'Makuch RW', 'Matthews MJ', 'Ihde DC', 'Whitacre M', 'Glatstein EJ', 'Wiernik PH', 'Lichter AS', 'Bunn PA Jr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/pathology/*secondary', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/pathology/*secondary', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/pathology/*secondary', 'Meninges/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Spinal Cord/pathology', 'Spinal Cord Neoplasms/pathology/secondary']",1982/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1982 Jan;61(1):45-53. doi: 10.1097/00005792-198201000-00005.,['10.1097/00005792-198201000-00005 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

In order to directly assess the relationship between endorphin activity and acute behavioral distress, beta-endorphin immunoreactivity (beta-EPI) was measured by radioimmunoassay in cerebrospinal fluid of 75 children with acute leukemia undergoing routine lumbar puncture. These data were related to four measures of behavioral distress collected during the procedure. For children 4 years of age and above, beta-EPI correlated inversely with age (r = -.31,p less than or equal to .05). All behavioral measures also inversely correlated with age (r = -.26 to -.67,p less than or equal to .05 to .001). Females had a significantly lower mean beta-EPI than males (p less than or equal to .01), and exhibited greater behavioral distress. beta-EPI and behavioral measures interacted with the use of specific antileukemia agents. L-Asparaginase was associated with lower beta-EPI (p less than or equal to .05), while prednisone was associated with lower behavioral distress on three of the four measures (p less than or equal to .05 to .01). After controlling for age, sex, and chemotherapy, beta-EPI and nurse ratings of anxiety were positively correlated (partial correlation coefficient = .31, p less than or equal to .05). Correlations between beta-EPI and other behavioral measures demonstrated positive trends. Results of this study are interpreted as support for the reactive nature of beta-EPI in cerebrospinal fluid to acute distress, and may help explain documented sex differences in distress behavior.

Patterns of virus expression were determined for mice of various inbred strains, congenic lines carrying single V loci, and the linkage testing stocks used in mapping studies. Segregation analysis resulted in the genetic mapping of V loci from six inbred strains to five mouse chromosomes. The V locus of A/J was mapped to chromosome 5 and shown to be allelic with that of BALB/cJ and C3H/HeJ (Cv); this suggests that Cv-represents a stable ancestral V locus present in Bagg albino stocks before the separation of inbred lines. The single, poorly inducible V locus of C57BL/10J and one of the four high virus loci of C58/Lw were mapped to the same region of chromosome 8 and may represent an allelic pair with different patterns of expression. An N-tropic V locus of the SEA/GnJ mouse was mapped to chromosome 9, and one of the three V loci of C3H/FgLw was mapped to chromosome 7. The endogenous B-tropic virus of B10.BR/SgLi was mapped to chromosome 11. These studies provide further evidence that endogenous ecotropic V loci are present at different chromosomal sites in unrelated mouse strains and emphasize the role of germ line reinfections in the generation of this diversity.","['Kozak, C A', 'Rowe, W P']","['Kozak CA', 'Rowe WP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antibody Diversity', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A/*genetics', 'Mice, Inbred C3H/*genetics', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/*genetics', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1982 Feb 1;155(2):524-34. doi: 10.1084/jem.155.2.524.,['10.1084/jem.155.2.524 [doi]'],['N01-CP-33288/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2186586,,,,,,

We examined the effect of retinoids on the clonal growth in vitro of myeloid leukemia cells. Retinoic acid inhibited the clonal growth of the KG-1, acute myeloblastic leukemia, and the HL-60, acute promyelocytic leukemia, human cell lines. The KG-1 cells were extremely sensitive to retinoic acid, with 50% of the colonies inhibited by 2.4-nM concentrations of the drug. A 50% growth inhibition of HL-60 was achieved by 25 nM retinoic acid. Complete inhibition of growth of both leukemia cell lines was seen with 1 microM retinoic acid. Exposure of KG-1 cells to retinoic acid for only 3-5 d was sufficient to inhibit all clonal growth. The all-trans and 13-cis forms of retinoic acid were equally effective in inhibiting proliferation. Retinal, retinyl acetate, and retinol (vitamin A) were less potent inhibitors. Clonal growth of the human K562 and mouse M-1 myeloid leukemic cell lines was not affected by 10 microM retinoic acid. Retinoic acid also inhibited the clonal growth of leukemia cells from five of seven patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Retinoic acid at concentrations of 5 nM to 0.3 microM inhibited 50% clonal growth, and 1 microM retinoic acid inhibited 64-98% of the leukemic colonies. The inhibition of clonal growth of KG-1 and HL-60 cell lines and of leukemic cells from two patients was not associated with the presence of a specific cytoplasmic retinoic acid-binding protein.

One type of colony is white and composed of A-MuLV-transformed lymphoid cells that can develop into established cell lines. These cells are indistinguishable in morphology from typical adult-derived lymphoid transformants. The second type of colony is pink or red and composed of erythroid cells in various stages of differentiation. Although A-MuLV is required to induce the erythroid colonies, and at least some cells in all of these colonies are infected with the virus, no permanently growing cell lines have been established from the cells in these colonies. The frequency of the two types of colonies varies depending upon the tissue and the gestational age of the embryo. Erythroid colonies are found following infection of early and mid gestation tissues while lymphoid colonies are found following infection of mid and late gestation tissues. Mixing experiments indicate that the two types of colonies arise from distinct target cells. Because A-MuLV mutants that are defective for lymphoid cell transformation are also defective for erythroid colony induction, expression of a functional Abelson protein is probably required for colony induction. Thus A-MuLV is capable of stimulating the cells of two distinct hematopoietic lineages. In one case, infection leads to transformation, while in the second, it leads to growth and differentiation.

Molecularly cloned bas sequences demonstrated no detectable homology with the onc genes of other mouse transforming viruses, but exhibited a high degree of sequence homology with the ras gene of the rat-derived Harvey murine sarcoma virus (Ha-MuSV) genome. The Ha-MuSV cell-derived sequence (ras) shared a colinear 750 bp region of homology with bas. Moreover, BALB-MuSV transformation was associated with the expression of high levels of a 21,000 dalton protein, immunologically related to the ras gene products, p21.

Both cell lines can support the replication of both transformation-competent and transformation-incompetent viruses such as murine or rat leukemia viruses. Infected T-79 and FRT-L cells had a high colony-forming efficiency (68 and 64%, respectively) when grown in agar and formed tumors when transplanted s.c. into syngeneic rats. These tumors morphologically resemble undifferentiated adenocarcinomas, thus showing that Kirsten sarcoma virus carrying the outer coat of the helper Kirsten murine leukemia virus is able to transform differentiated epithelial cells. Transformed T-79 and FRT-L cells, in contrast to uninfected cells, neither secrete thyroglobulin concentrate iodide, two biochemical markers of differentiated thyroid function.

Restriction enzyme mapping of the cloned mouse fragment revealed the presence of a 5- to 6-kilobase pair VL30 DNA segment flanked by non-VL30 segments of approximately 7 and 0.3 kilobase pairs. Southern blot analysis of VL30 DNA sequence organization in the DNA of two nontransformed mouse cell lines (AKR-2B, C3H/10T 1/2) and two chemically transformed derivatives (AKR-MCA, C3H/MCA-58) revealed 15 to 20 bands organized in an apparent strain-specific pattern. Within a given strain, however, no differences were detectable between the nontransformed cells and their chemically transformed counterparts. The expression of VL30 genes in the above cell lines was assayed by hybridization of 32P-labeled poly(A)-containing polysomal RNA to several internal restriction fragments derived from the cloned VL30 DNA sequence. The level of VL30 RNA was enhanced approximately 10-fold in both chemically transformed cell lines as compared to the nontransformed cell lines (under normal growth conditions). In addition, nontransformed AKR-2B cells maintained in the presence of purified epidermal growth factor exhibited similarly enhanced levels of VL30 RNA sequences in polysomal RNA. Since these cells displayed several growth characteristics of transformed cells but, in an epidermal growth factor-dependent and completely reversible fashion, these data suggest that the expression of VL30 genes is not simply incidental to chemically transformed cells but may be related to alterations in growth control.","['Courtney, M G', 'Schmidt, L J', 'Getz, M J']","['Courtney MG', 'Schmidt LJ', 'Getz MJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*analysis/chemically induced', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/*genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian', '*Genes, Viral', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Poly A', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Virion/*genetics']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Feb;42(2):569-76.,,['GM 25510/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

DNA prepared from patients with acute myeloblastic or acute lymphoblastic leukemia or from the continuous leukemic cell line HL60 was transferred to LTA cells; 48-72 hr later, these recipients expressed hemopoietic differentiation markers as detected by monoclonal antibodies against My-1 (granulocyte specific) and OK-T3 (T-cell specific) using immunofluorescence. The efficiency of transfer was dose and time dependent. We found that genes not expressed in the original cells were expressed after transfer by using this assay. Restriction enzyme analysis showed that My-1 was not expressed with DNA that had been incubated before transfer with either HindIII or Sal I but was present after digestion with either EcoRI or BamHI; after digestion of DNA with the same enzymes, OK-T3 expression was observed only in the HindIII-treated DNA.

Meconium, blood, cloacal swabs, and egg albumen were collected from day-old chicks and adult hens from four breeder flocks. The phenotypic mixing was used as the biological assay for infectious virus. The complement fixation test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used as direct assays for the group-specific antigen of the avian leukosis-sarcoma viruses. Analysis of test results of biological assays has shown that blood from virus-infected chicks was more frequently positive than meconium. Also, direct assay for group-specific antigen was as efficient as the biological assays for detection of positive albumen samples from freshly laid eggs. The rate of false-positive reactors recognized by direct assays was lower in albumen samples than in cloacal swabs collected from hens that produce endogenous virus or group-specific antigen. Data also showed a relatively high concordance, ranging from 71 to 100%, between various assays with test materials from adult hens. Progress in reducing rates of exogenous lymphoid leukosis virus infection can be significant if dams are selected on the basis of any one of the test procedures examined. For complete eradication however, day-old chicks should be selected on the basis of the biological assay of blood of individual chicks reared in small groups.","['Fadly, A M', 'Okazaki, W', 'Smith, E J', 'Crittenden, L B']","['Fadly AM', 'Okazaki W', 'Smith EJ', 'Crittenden LB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Avian Leukosis/blood/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/isolation & purification', 'Biological Assay', 'Birds', 'Complement Fixation Tests/veterinary', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', 'Meconium/immunology', 'Microbiological Techniques/veterinary']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 1981 Sep;60(9):2037-44. doi: 10.3382/ps.0602037.,"['10.3382/ps.0602037 [doi]', 'S0032-5791(19)35561-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,

This culture system increases the efficiency of target cell growth by favoring rapid growth of a mixed population of adherent cells in the primary culture. The nonadherent Abelson virus-infected cell populations expressed pre-B-cell differentiation markers characteristic of Abelson virus-transformed cells (mu-heavy chains of immunoglobulin M and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase). Early after infection, these cell populations exhibited restricted in vitro and in vivo growth properties which differed from those of an established Abelson virus-transformed cell line, 2M3. These included a marked dependency upon the adherent cell layer for growth and viability, a lower efficiency of agar colony formation, and a lower capacity for tumor production in syngeneic animals. Growth of the early populations could be maintained in the absence of the adherent cell layer by using conditioned medium from long-term adherent cell cultures established in the absence of viral infection. After passage of the populations for several weeks, the in vitro growth properties gradually shifted toward that of the 2M3 cell line. Twelve-week-old populations grew independently of the adherent cell layer and showed an increased efficiency of agar colony formation. These data indicate that many lymphoid target cells exhibit an intermediate transformed phenotype when infected with Abelson virus.

The RNAs of OK10-BM virus and OK10 AV had the same mobility in agarose gels, corresponding to 8.0 to 8.5 kilobases, a size considerably larger than that of the transforming component (5 to 6 kb) of most other avian acute leukemia viruses. Fingerprint analysis showed a close relationship between OK10-BM virus and OK10 AV RNAs. The polypeptide compositions of OK10-BM and OK10 AV viruses were similar except for the envelope glycoproteins. In analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the large envelope glycoprotein of OK10-BM virus migrated at M(r) = 78,000 (gp78), whereas OK10 AV had the characteristic 85,000-dalton glycoprotein (gp85) of nondefective avian leukemia viruses. gp78 was weakly labeled with methionine, glycine, proline, or mannose, suggesting that purified OK10-BM virus had reduced amounts of the modified envelope glycoprotein. In cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysates, OK10-BM virion RNA directed the synthesis of a 200,000-dalton polypeptide (p200), a 180,000-dalton polypeptide (pr180), and a 76,000-dalton polypeptide (pr76), whereas OK10 AV RNA gave rise only to pr180 and pr76, suggesting that p200 may represent an OK10-BM-encoded transforming protein. No biochemical evidence for the presence of an associated helper virus was found in the OK10-BM virus population produced by the macrophage cell line. However, when OK10-BM virus was serially passaged in chicken embryo fibroblasts, a virus having structural properties similar to those of OK10 AV (OK10 AV-specific oligonucleotides and gp85) appeared after three passages. Moreover, nonproducer clones of transformed cells could be readily obtained in OK10-BM virus-infected quail cell cultures. It is thus likely that the bone marrow-derived macrophage cell line produces a transforming virus defective in its env gene and low amounts of an associated helper virus, which upon transfer to fibroblasts is preferentially replicated.","['Pfeifer, S', 'Pettersson, R F', 'Kallio, A', 'Oker-Blom, N', 'Vaheri, A']","['Pfeifer S', 'Pettersson RF', 'Kallio A', 'Oker-Blom N', 'Vaheri A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/analysis/*genetics/growth & development', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chick Embryo', 'Fibroblasts', '*Genes, Viral', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Oligoribonucleotides/analysis', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Nov;40(2):533-40. doi: 10.1128/JVI.40.2.533-540.1981.,['10.1128/JVI.40.2.533-540.1981 [doi]'],['CA 24605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC256656,,,,,,

We used hybridization probes enriched for the amv sequences and conditions that facilitate annealing of partially homologous nucleotide sequences to show that cellular sequences related to amv are present in the genomes of all vertebrates ranging from amphibians to humans but were not detected in fish, sea urchins, or Escherichia coli. In contrast to the preceding findings, nontransforming endogenous proviral nucleotide sequences closely related to the remainder of the avian myeloblastosis virus genome and to the entire myeloblastosis-associated helper virus are present only in chicken DNA. The amv-related cellular sequences appear to be highly conserved during evolution and to be contained at only one or a few locations in the genome of vertebrates. Within closely related species, they appear to share common evolutionary genetic loci.

A second lymphoblast antigen (LB-1) unlike BB-1, was present on both T and B cell blasts and virus-transformed T- and B-LCL but not on normal lymphoid tissues.","['Yokochi, T', 'Holly, R D', 'Clark, E A']","['Yokochi T', 'Holly RD', 'Clark EA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Callitrichinae', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macaca nemestrina', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Pan troglodytes', 'Papio', 'Pongo pygmaeus', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1982 Feb;128(2):823-7.,,['RR 00166/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Ribonucleotide pools were evaluated on a chemically bonded anion-exchange column. Deoxynucleotide pools were determined following periodate and methylamine treatment which eliminated the ribonucleotides (greater than 99.9% complete) and allowed for a rapid quantitation of the acid-soluble 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) pools. FdUMP levels as low as 10 fmol/10(6) cells were detectable by polystyrene anion-exchange chromatography. Confirmation of these FdUMP values was performed by rechromatography on a reversed-phase ion-pair column.

Cytotoxicity was mediated by cells that were non-adherent to nylon wool, non-phagocytic and resistant to thy-1.2 antiserum plus complement. Natural MuLV viremia in LC mice did not impair splenic cytotoxicity against TAC-I target cells, Cells infected with amphotropic and ecotropic MuLV of wild mouse origin were not appreciably lysed by LC splenic effectors. Although variable levels of cytotoxicity were detected against TAC-1 by normal spleen cells, consistently low levels of cytotoxicity against allogenic LC lymphoma, sarcoma and carcinoma targets were found using the same splenocytes. These results indicate that LC mice possess splenocytes with the characteristics of natural killer (NK) cells as defined in inbred mice. The resistance of LC-derived targets to lysis by LC NK cells suggests that NK cells may not be involved in natural tumor immunosurveillance or that the development of spontaneous tumors may involve escape from NK-mediated effector mechanisms.","['Scott, J L', 'Pal, B K', 'Rasheed, S', 'Gardner, M B']","['Scott JL', 'Pal BK', 'Rasheed S', 'Gardner MB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Wild', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Rodent Diseases/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology']",1981/08/15 00:00,1981/08/15 00:01,['1981/08/15 00:00'],"['1981/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1981 Aug 15;28(2):241-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910280219.,['10.1002/ijc.2910280219 [doi]'],['N01-CP8-1032/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

Among the serological methods, the radioimmunoassay (RIA) using the BLV glycoprotein (gp) was found to be more sensitive than the RIA using the internal virion antigen (p25) and the immunodiffusion test using the virion gp antigen. The differences in sensitivity between these tests were particularly evident with sera of cattle in early stages of infection. The sensitivities of the syncytia induction assay and the competitive RIA for the direct demonstration of BLV infection in cattle are comparable. Following natural infection, antibodies to the gp antigen in most cattle were detected by the RIA several months before infectious BLV became detectable by the SIA in the blood lymphocytes. It is concluded that the most accurate, sensitive, and rapid method for the detection of BLV infection in cattle is the RIA using the virion gp antigen.

In 18 children, combination chemotherapy was terminated after two and a half or three years of treatment. After that time, one meningeal relapse and six bone-marrow relapses occurred. Within the first 24 hours after application of radioactive gold, headaches, vomiting, and fever occurred in less than 10% of the children. An apathy syndrome, leukecephalopathy, or severe infections, were not observed in a single case. Radioactive gold spreads in the subarachnoid space and is phagocytized by the arachnoidea. The tumoricide effect extends selectively over the space of distribution of the latent meningosis leucaemia. The cerebral parenchyma remains unaffected by radiation.

The model emphasizes the flexible nature of immunoglobulin gene recombination that not infrequently produces aberrant or null genes that are phenotypically excluded from expression. Remaining alleles or isotypic genes can then be utilized as ""spares"" undergoing recombination until a valid gene is formed. Significantly, the excluded allele or isotype is frequently deleted from the genome.

Analysis of radioactive collagen, derived from procollagen by pepsin treatment, showed that both of the tsKi-MSV/MLV-transformed subclones contained a 4-fold greater proportion of type III procollagen than did control MLV-infected cultures. A nonproducer derivative exhibited an even greater change (10-fold), indicating that viral replication was irrelevant. After 48 hr at a nonpermissive temperature, tsKi-MSV-transformed cells retained a high proportion of type III procollagen, suggesting that either this change is not induced by src protein or else there is a slowly reversible or irreversible step involved. Alternatively, type III procollagen mRNA may be long lived. In contrast, the relative rate of procollagen synthesis in transformed cells was clearly regulated by src protein. Translation of mRNA from cells preincubated at permissive or nonpermissive temperatures revealed that the decreased relative rate can be explained by a simultaneous small decrease in the level of procollagen mRNA and a large increase in mRNA for noncollagen proteins.","['Bateman, J F', 'Peterkofsky, B']","['Bateman JF', 'Peterkofsky B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Collagen/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Kirsten murine sarcoma virus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*genetics']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Oct;78(10):6028-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.10.6028.,['10.1073/pnas.78.10.6028 [doi]'],,PMC348970,,,,,,

Post-treatment incubation of BPDE-treated cells shows that this difference can be accounted for by the loss of preferential localisation with time.","['Jack, P L', 'Brookes, P']","['Jack PL', 'Brookes P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Benzopyrenes)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '3417WMA06D (Benzo(a)pyrene)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Benzopyrenes/*metabolism', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Tritium']",1981/11/11 00:00,1981/11/11 00:01,['1981/11/11 00:00'],"['1981/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1981 Nov 11;9(21):5533-52. doi: 10.1093/nar/9.21.5533.,['10.1093/nar/9.21.5533 [doi]'],['R01-CA25807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC327542,,,,,,

While all 2-month-old mice expressed ecotropic virus, only 63% of the 1-month-old mice were virus-positive. However no relationship existed between early virus production (within 1 month) or late virus production and lymphoma latency, total lymphoma incidence, and histopathology. In contrast with high titers of XC+ virus in tail tissues of diseased mice, a markedly low virus content was found in lymphomatous organs. This difference was not due to selective growth of poor virus-producer cells or to inhibitory factors possibly released by the inflammatory cell component. Viral protein content and XC+ virus titer were not closely correlated in the neoplastic organs. Search for XC- viruses revealed that only 1 of 6 aged normal and 16 of 19 lymphomatous mice produced viruses that grew on mink lung cells. By use of a standard limiting dilution cloning procedure, four isolates were obtained that showed tropism for both murine and heterologous cells. Three of these isolates induced cytopathic changes similar to those induced by MCF viruses on mink lung cells but not on mouse cells. Interference and neutralization assays performed to better characterize the virus envelope properties further indicated that SJL/J isolates had features typical of MCF dualtropic viruses.","['De Rossi, A', ""D'Andrea, E"", 'Colombatti, A', 'Fischinger, P J', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L']","['De Rossi A', ""D'Andrea E"", 'Colombatti A', 'Fischinger PJ', 'Chieco-Bianchi L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*growth & development', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Lymphoma/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*microbiology', 'Mink', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Activation']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Dec;67(6):1241-50.,,,,,,,,,

When dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is added to cultures, HL-60 cells undergo morphological and functional differentiation over a period of 6 to 7 days. Differentiation is accompanied by increased binding of the synthetic N-formylated chemotactic peptide N-formylmethionylleucyl[3H]phenylalanine. Binding of N-formylmethionylleucyl[3H]phenylalanine to cells induced to differentiate with DMSO was temperature dependent, specific, saturable, of high affinity, reversible, and proportional to cell number. Dexamethasone increased the number of N-formylated chemotactic peptide receptors in cultures of differentiating HL-60 cells without affecting the affinity of the receptors for the tritiated peptide. This steroid response was dose dependent, proportional in magnitude to glucocorticoid activity, and abolished by cycloheximide. Dexamethasone had little effect on N-formylmethionylleucyl[3H]phenylalanine binding unless DMSO was also present in culture or the cells were first induced by DMSO to differentiate. These results suggest that the glucocorticoid stimulated increase in number of N-formylated chemotactic peptide receptors was mediated by the high-affinity glucocorticoid receptor, involved protein synthesis, and was apparently dependent on differentiation.","['Brandt, S J', 'Barnes, K C', 'Glass, D B', 'Kinkade, J M Jr']","['Brandt SJ', 'Barnes KC', 'Glass DB', 'Kinkade JM Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide']",1981/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Dec;41(12 Pt 1):4947-51.,,"['CA 22294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 5364/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Twenty-one of the 25 calves raised in complete isolation remained negative for BLV until the last evaluation. At this time, 14 calves were older than 28 months of age, and seven were 16 to 20 months old. Three calves in this group became BLV positive before the age of five months, and one became so at the age of 12 months. Of the 16 calves raised in partial isolation, two were positive at the ages of 11 and 18 months, respectively. The other 14 calves remained negative during the 26 to 29 months of observation. It is not known if the six animals that became BLV positive in these two groups were infected by milk, or prenatally, or during contact with their infected dams. While only six of the 41 calves raised in isolation became infected, all 18 calves raised in contact with BLV-positive cows became infected before the age of 26 to 29 months of age, and 12 were positive at 16 to 20 months of age. Thus, it is apparent that, under natural conditions, milk-borne transmission of BLV, if it occurs at all, is much less frequent than contact transmission, despite the fact that, as shown in previous studies, infectious BLV is present in the colostrum and milk of most BLV-positive cows. Passively acquired maternal antibodies to BLV were probably responsible for the resistance of the calves to milk-borne infection.","['Ferrer, J F', 'Piper, C E']","['Ferrer JF', 'Piper CE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*transmission', 'Colostrum/*microbiology', 'Leukemia/*transmission', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Milk/*microbiology', '*Retroviridae']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Dec;41(12 Pt 1):4906-9.,,['P01 CA 14193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,

The addition of tunicamycin, which blocks the formation of these intermediates and thus of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, inhibits the synthesis of erythroglycan (Mr 7000-11 000). Vesicular-stomatitis-virus infection of K-562 cells results in the glycosylation of the G-protein with the transferrin-type oligosaccharide (Mr 3000), but not with the larger erythroglycan. These results suggest that, in K-562 cells, the early stages of erythroglycan biosynthesis are the same as those of the transferrin-type oligosaccharides. However, maturation of the oligosaccharide is influenced by protein structure such that erythroglycan is only expressed on specific glycoproteins.","['Rush, J S', 'Turco, S J', 'Laine, R A']","['Rush JS', 'Turco SJ', 'Laine RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (erythroglycan)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)']",IM,"['*Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Glucosamine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Glycopeptides/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Tunicamycin/*pharmacology', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/metabolism', '*Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1981 Jan 1;193(1):361-5. doi: 10.1042/bj1930361.,['10.1042/bj1930361 [doi]'],"['AM25101/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05374/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1162608,,,,,,

Moreover, the vitamin C concentration in erythrocytes and plasma was considerably higher than in comparable samples of other volunteers treated identically. In the latter cases, the ESR spectrum of the erythrocytes was not modified at all. These findings suggest that there must be a substance which reacts with ascorbic acid specifically. It can be assumed that the enzyme ascorbate oxidase plays this decisive role in the ascorbic acid metabolism. For this reason, different amounts of ascorbate oxidase have been added to healthy erythrocytes treated in vitro with ascorbic acid and to tissue samples of lung cancer. As expected, the vitamin C effect as expressed by the appearance of the SDA signal and the increase in spin concentrations could be reversed. It is suggested, therefore, that in special types of cancer, such as acute lymphatic leukemia and lung cancer, the concentration of ascorbate oxidase or of an enzyme acting like it is, primarily, diminished, while in other types it might be enlarged.","['Lohmann, W']",['Lohmann W'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Z Naturforsch C Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

Many of the tumors that do not fulfill the criteria for RMS have been designated ""sarcomas of uncertain histogenesis."" The introduction of the concept of a soft tissue equivalent of Ewing's sarcoma may have eased the semantic anxiety without improving our conceptual understanding. It is thought that the embryonal RMS, Ewing's sarcoma, and other are derived from a primitive mesenchymal cell. Another separate category of ""small blue cell tumors"" are those which presumably originate from the primitive neuroepithelium. Some of the diagnostic terms applied to this category are ""neuroepithelioma,"" ""medulloepithelioma,"" and ""peripheral neuroblastoma."" Because most of these tumors are hormonally inactive and electron microscopy is not performed, the diagnosis is infrequently considered or proved. The recently described small cell tumor of thoracopulmonary origin is likely a malignant neuroepithelial neoplasm. Hematopoietic tumors, such as non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphomas, granulocytic sarcoma, and malignant histiocytosis, may appear in the soft tissues as the initial manifestation of these system diseases. A final group of malignant soft tissue tumors are the fibrohistiocytic ones with a biphasic pattern of small round cells and spindle cells.

We have shown that no virus RNA expression can be found in PCC4 cells 48 h post-infection and that no nucleic acid sequences can be found in an integrated form in PCC4 cells. However, the kinetics of formation of free proviral intermediates show that the three forms (I, II and III) of free virus DNA are synthesized in both PCC4 and PCD1.

Results indicated increases in gp52 CSA within 4 h of dexamethasone treatment and maximal levels of antigen expression within 12-24 h after treatment. Comparison of gp52 determinants on dexamethasone-stimulated mammary tumor cells demonstrated a greater abundance on C3H Mm5mt/cl than on GR-MMTV cultures. Parallel antigen assays with gp52 and Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) antisera demonstrated that GR-MMTV cells expressed fewer C-type determinants and thus a more preferential expression of gp52 determinants than other cell lines tested. The gp52/R-MuLV binding ratio was only 2.4:1 for C3H cultures in contrast to 5.7:1 for GR cultures. In addition, a comparison of gp52 expression on viral producer and nonproducer cells provided a quantitative estimate of the extent of expression which occurred in a retrovirus nonproducer culture. Results of ISPAT demonstrated that 75% of the gp52 detected on producer cells was present on nonproducer cultures. Comparison of the expression of gp52 CSA and the release of gp 52 into culture fluids during hormone treatments demonstrated that both assays (ISPAT and gp 52 radioimmunoassay) detect and quantitate coordinate changes in the expression and release of MMTV gp52.

The 3STI inhibitor copurified with immunoglobulin, and its activity could be absorbed with BLV. Rabbit anti-BLV serum inhibited 3STI, but rabbit anti-BLV p25 did not. These results indicate that BLV infection induces or expands a BLV-specific lymphocyte population. Spontaneous blastogenesis may be indicative of an immune response which controls virus spread.","['Thorn, R M', 'Gupta, P', 'Kenyon, S J', 'Ferrer, J F']","['Thorn RM', 'Gupta P', 'Kenyon SJ', 'Ferrer JF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Retroviridae/*immunology']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 1981 Oct;34(1):84-9. doi: 10.1128/iai.34.1.84-89.1981.,['10.1128/iai.34.1.84-89.1981 [doi]'],"['CA 14193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CB 84243/CB/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC350824,,,,,,

Two different cloned proviruses were used. The first was derived from an integrated molecule of AKR murine leukemia virus and contains adjacent host information. The origin of the second was an unintegrated permuted copy of Harvey murine sarcoma virus. We found that the leukemia virus cloned provirus, as predicted by structural considerations, contained two functional RNA polymerase II promoters located in the U3 region present at either end of the molecule. These promoters initiate transcription at equal rates in vitro. We also found that the permuted sarcoma virus clone contained an RNA polymerase II promoter in the U3 region. Removal of viral sequences 49 bases upstream of the in vitro sarcoma virus initiation site by restriction cleavage results in loss of specific transcription, indicating a role for this information in in vitro promotion. The 5' ends of in vitro and in vivo viral RNA were compared by nuclease mapping techniques and found to be identical. Based on this evidence, we conclude that murine retroviral genomes contain sufficient information to initiate transcription independent of any host information in vitro and that these viral promoters are probably also active in vivo. In addition to the promoter in U3, Harvey murine sarcoma virus contains a second promoter in vitro that initiates near the 5' boundary of the transformation-specific (src) region of the virus. Initiation by this promoter was insensitive to low levels of alpha-amanitin, and the RNA transcript could be terminated to yield a 340-nucleotide product.","['Ostrowski, M C', 'Berard, D', 'Hager, G L']","['Ostrowski MC', 'Berard D', 'Hager GL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Amanitins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Amanitins/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Operon', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Jul;78(7):4485-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.7.4485.,['10.1073/pnas.78.7.4485 [doi]'],,PMC319816,,,,,,

The close homology of the v-fes sequences shows that GA- and ST-FeSV were formed by recombination of FeLV with similar portions of a cat cellular gene (c-fes).","['Fedele, L A', 'Even, J', 'Garon, C F', 'Donner, L', 'Sherr, C J']","['Fedele LA', 'Even J', 'Garon CF', 'Donner L', 'Sherr CJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Bacteriophage lambda', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Feline/*genetics']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Jul;78(7):4036-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.7.4036.,['10.1073/pnas.78.7.4036 [doi]'],,PMC319720,,,,,,

Viable vaccinia virus actively replicating in the cells of primary BALB/c tissue culture and in a number of continuous murine cell lines has been shown to induce in them expression of major structural p30 protein of murine retroviruses. Vaccinia virus has been also shown to cause biochemical transformation of murine cells. Evidence for the capacity of herpes simplex virus type 2 to induce malignant transformation of BALB/3T3 murine cell line has been obtained and confirmed by transplantation to mice. Transformed cell clones did not contain complete infectious herpes simplex virus but were resistant to superinfection with this virus. N-tropic endogenous murine retrovirus of C type with buoyant density in the saccharose density gradient of 1.18 g/cm3 and a reverse transcriptase activity was expressed in the transformed cells. In the virion structure six proteins typical of these viruses with the prevalence of p30 have been demonstrated. Competitive radioimmunoassay revealed a very high level of virus production: p30 level reached 7500 ng p30 R-MuLV per mg of viral protein.

Detailed restriction endonuclease maps of the 8.8-kilobase (kb) unintegrated linear viral DNAs were derived for five ecotropic and five amphotropic MuLV's from California field mice, for Friend MuLV, and for one ecotropic and one xenotropic MuLV from Mus musculus castaneus. In general, the California MuLV's were similar in their leftward 6 kb (corresponding to the leftward long terminal repeat [LTR], gag, and pol) and rightward 1 kb (7.8 to 8.8 kb, corresponding to p15E and the rightward LTR). For the region spanning 6.0 to 7.7 kb (which includes the sequences that encode gp70) the amphotropic MuLV's shared few enzyme sites with the ecotropic MuLV's, although the California ecotropic MuLV's were highly related to each other in this region, as were the amphotropic MuLV's. Cross-hybridization studies between amphotropic and California ecotropic MuLV DNAs indicated that they were not homologous in the region 6.3 to 7.6 kb; the California ecotropic viral DNAs cross-hybridized in this region to AKR ecotropic MuLV. When the California viral DNAs were compared with AKR ecotropic viral DNA, many differences in enzyme sites were noted throughout the genome. The U3 regions of the wild mouse LTRs showed partial homology to this region in AKR MuLV. The LTR of Moloney MuLV was highly related to that of the California MuLV's, whereas the LTR of Friend MuLV appeared to be a recombinant between the two types of LTRs. The M. musculus castaneus isolates were most closely related to ecotropic and xenotropic MuLV's isolated from inbred mice. One amphotropic MuLV DNA was cloned from supercoiled viral DNA at its unique EcoRI site in pBR322. Viral DNAs with one and two LTRs were isolated. After digestion with EcoRI, DNAs of both types were infectious.

To obtain further evidence for the association of structural markers of p30 with N-, B-, or NB-tropism, we have analyzed the p30's of these same viruses by using two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping and slab gel isoelectric focusing. The results of these analyses suggest that (i) a single peptide unique to the N-tropic virus p30- is present in the p30 of all N-tropic recombinants; (ii) a single peptide unique to the B virus p30 is not present in p30's of the N-tropic recombinants, and this peptide is also absent in p30's of NB-tropic viruses derived from the B-tropic virus; and (iii) p30's of NB-tropic viruses possess a new tryptic peptide not found in the p30 of their B-tropic virus progenitors, and this new peptide is not found in the p30 of the N-tropic virus of BALB/c or the XLPN viruses. These results are consistent with the possibility that p30 may determine the N-, B-, or NB-tropism of murine leukemia viruses.

Newborns represent 1.5% of the children with malignant diseases in the Tumor Registry at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia over the last 30 years. Thus, occasionally the pediatrics radiation therapist must consider treating the very young infant. The specific radiation effects on growth and development must be weighed in reaching a therapeutic decision. All children are vulnerable to the late effects of radiation therapy, but the neonates may be more susceptible because of the immaturity of important organs such as the brain, lung, liver, kidney, and bone. In general, radiation therapy, should be avoided during the first several weeks of life because of the potential increased sensitivity of the liver and kidneys during that period. If radiation therapy is used at all during infancy, the benefits must be weighed against the possibility of significant late effects. Increasing knowledge of pediatric neoplasms has shown that some tumors (such as mesoblastic nephroma) require no treatment except for surgical excision; and other tumors, such as Stage IV-S neuroblastoma, may require very little treatment. In those tumors that require radiation therapy, the use of chemotherapy may allow reduction of the radiation dose. Furthermore, alterations of time-dose-fractionation schemes and careful attention to tumor volume with the use of special techniques, such as ""shrinking fields,"" may decrease the late adverse effects of treatment.","['Littman, P', ""D'Angio, G J""]","['Littman P', ""D'Angio GJ""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,,IM,"['Brain/radiation effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/radiotherapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Growth/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Newborn, Diseases/*radiotherapy', 'Kidney/radiation effects', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Lung/radiation effects', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neuroblastoma/radiotherapy', 'Sacrococcygeal Region/radiation effects', 'Sarcoma/radiotherapy', 'Teratoma/radiotherapy', 'Wilms Tumor/radiotherapy']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1981 Fall;3(3):279-85.,,"['CA-11722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CP-65803/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,27,,,,

In the present paper, the first in vitro transformation of sheep fibroblasts by inoculation with BLV materials from these two cell lines is described. In a few passages after inoculation with these viral materials, morphological alteration occurred. The morphologically altered cells were grown as stable cultures and showed such transformed phenotypes as growth in soft agar medium, increased uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and tumorigenicity in athymic nude mice. This result, together with our previous observation of simultaneous induction of BLV expression and morphological alteration of 3178 cells, suggests the presence of some transforming capacity in these BLV materials similar to that in, for example, murine or avian acute leukemia viruses.

Susceptibility of feline lymphocytes to productive feline leukemia virus infection.,899-910,"The interplay between feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline lymphocytes (lc) infected in vitro or in vivo was investigated. Surface marker analysis and viral infectivity (VI) assays of lc populations were used to determine susceptibility of lc subsets to FeLV. The principal FeLV-replicating cell in the mesenteric lymph node of persistently infected, preleukemic cats was a nonadherent, complement receptor (CR)-bearing lc (B-cell). The lymph nodes of preleukemic cats also had increased numbers of uninfected T-cells [cells forming rosettes with guinea pig erythrocytes (GPE)] and cells with receptors for the Fc portion of 7S IgG (Fc gamma R cells) as compared with lymph nodes of age-matched specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats. The induction of productive infection of feline peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBL) in vitro depended on a 48-hour in vitro preincubation period before virus exposure. The equivalent susceptibility of whole and adherent cell-depleted PBL to productive infection and the failure of hydrocortisone to enhance viral infection were compatible with identification of the FeLV-replicating cell as an lc. Furthermore, lc from susceptible SPF kittens replicated 50 times as much FeLV as did lc from resistant adult SPF cats. The Ic productively infected with FeLV after in vitro exposure were more precisely identified with the use of Ficoll-Isopaque density gradient separations of rosetted and nonrosetted lc. Whole PBL, GPE rosette-positive PBL (T-cells), and CR-positive PBL (B-cells) were permissive to FeLV infection, and maximal VI was evident at 14 days after exposure. The substantial (1,325-fold) increment in VI found in the Fc gamma R-depleted PBL suggested a role for Fc gamma R cells in the containment of FeLV infection. Unstimulated mononuclear leukocytes from blood, spleen, lymph node, thymus, and marrow were susceptible to productive FeLV infection after in vitro exposure. The degree of spontaneous DNA synthesis in marrow, thymus, and spleen but not lymph node or PBL was inversely related to permissiveness to viral replication. Mitogen activation of lc was associated with decreased viral replication when either T-cell mitogens (concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, or pokeweed mitogen) or a B-cell mitogen (dextran sulfate) was used. Virus production by spleen cells and PBL was enhanced twofold to tenfold by prior lc stimulation by the B-cell mitogen, lipopolysaccharide, or protein A-bearing Staphylococcus aureus, a mitogen for feline T-cells with Fc gamma R. Both productively infected (preincubated) and nonproductively infected (freshly isolated) PBL transferred infectious FeLV to autochthonous peritoneal macrophages (M theta); most of the virus in PBL-peritoneal M theta cocultures was produced by adherent cells, irrespective of whether the adherent or nonadherent cell population was inoculated originally.","['Rojko, J L', 'Hoover, E A', 'Finn, B L', 'Olsen, R G']","['Rojko JL', 'Hoover EA', 'Finn BL', 'Olsen RG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Mitogens)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/microbiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/microbiology', 'Macrophages/microbiology', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Virus Replication']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Oct;67(4):899-910.,,"['1-F32-CA06087-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP91008-05/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA22527-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

Role of macrophages.,889-98,"The role of autochthonous peritoneal feline macrophages (M theta) in the age-related resistance of cats to feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was investigated by a study of the functional properties and FeLV susceptibility of M theta from kittens and adult cats and the effect of hydrocortisone (HC) and silica on M theta-FeLV interactions. Although the phagocytic functions of isolated M theta from kittens and adults were equivalent, the mean FeLV susceptibility of M theta from kittens was five times that of M theta from adult cats, thus establishing a direct correlation between the age-related susceptibility of cats and M theta from cats to FeLV. M theta of viremic cats were found to be infected with FeLV in vivo; virus titers were slightly higher than those obtained after in vitro infection of M theta, M theta from cats that had experienced regressive FeLV infection were not significantly more resistant to FeLV infection in vitro than were M theta from naive adult specific-pathogen-free cats. HC, which has been shown to enhance the in vivo FeLV susceptibility of cats, also enhanced the permissiveness of M theta from cats to FeLV in vitro (600-fold for M theta from adult cats and 200-fold for M theta) from kittens. M theta permissiveness to FeLV was highly sensitive to HC and occurred in M theta infected in vivo or in vitro. In parallel with the effect of HC on the natural resistance of cats to FeLV, administration of silica before virus inoculation also markedly enhanced the FeLV susceptibility of adult cats. Silica was toxic for isolated M theta but not for lymphocytes in vitro, and silica produced monocytopenia and neutrophilia, delayed skin allograft rejection, and augmented feline oncovirus-associated cell membrane antigen antibody responses in vivo. These experiments indicate that M theta were linked to the natural resistance of cats to FeLV and that the temporary elimination of M theta functions (e.g., by silica) and/or the conversion of the M theta-FeLV relationship from a nonpermissive to a permissive state (e.g., by corticosteroids) resulted in failure of early virus containment, in persistent virus amplification in hemolymphatic tissues, and in subsequent FeLV-related proliferative or antiproliferative disease.","['Hoover, E A', 'Rojko, J L', 'Wilson, P L', 'Olsen, R G']","['Hoover EA', 'Rojko JL', 'Wilson PL', 'Olsen RG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology/microbiology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Virus Replication']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Oct;67(4):889-98.,,"['1-F32-CA06087-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP91008-05/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA22527/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7204500,,,,,,

However, OFA-I was found in only 15% of gastrointestinal tumors. The four hepatoma specimens tested were negative for OFA-I. OFA-I was also present in metastases and normal-appearing tissues of patients with OFA-I positive tumors but was not found in normal tissues from noncancer patients. These studies demonstrated that OFA-1 is widely distributed among human tumors. It appears to be more prevalent in tumors of ectodermal and mesodermal origin.","['Rees, W V', 'Irie, R F', 'Morton, D L']","['Rees WV', 'Irie RF', 'Morton DL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (oncofetal antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Brain Neoplasms/immunology', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology', 'Carcinoma/immunology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/immunology', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/immunology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/immunology', 'Sarcoma/immunology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/immunology', 'Tissue Distribution']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Sep;67(3):557-62.,,"['CA09010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Glycosylation of env precursor glycoproteins.,463-70,"We have compared the glycopeptides obtained after extensive pronase digestion of the env precursors (PrENV proteins) of ecotropic, xenotropic, and dual-tropic murine leukemia viruses. Two glycopeptide size classes, having molecular weights of approximately 2,200 and 1,500, were shown to be associated with the PrENV proteins of all murine leukemia viruses studied. Glycopeptides associated with the env precursors were totally susceptible to endo-beta-N-acetyglucosaminidase H. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of partial endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion products of the env precursor of dual-tropic mink cell focus-forming virus (MCF 247) revealed the presence of seven bands, suggesting that six glycosylation sites were present on the precursor molecule. The MCF 247 PrENV protein had been previously shown to be accessible to lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination on the surface of infected cells. The cell surface PrENV molecules had the same electrophoretic mobility as pulse-labeled PrENV protein, and after endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment a similar shift in electrophoretic mobility was observed for the cell surface PrENV protein and the pulse-labeled precursors, a finding which indicated that the PrENV protein located on the cell surface also possessed only mannose-rich oligosaccharides. These results indicated that the env precursor glycoproteins of dual-tropic viruses had the unusual property of migrating to the cell surface without undergoing the normal oligosaccharide processing and proteolytic cleavage events that had been observed for ecotropic and xenotropic murine leukemia virus glycoproteins.","['Kemp, M C', 'Famulari, N G', 'Compans, R W']","['Kemp MC', 'Famulari NG', 'Compans RW']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/analysis', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/analysis', 'Glycopeptides/*analysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*analysis/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mink', 'Protein Precursors/*analysis/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis/metabolism']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Aug;39(2):463-70. doi: 10.1128/JVI.39.2.463-470.1981.,['10.1128/JVI.39.2.463-470.1981 [doi]'],"['CA 15297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27950/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC171356,,,,,,

It has led to the concept that regions of conserved nucleic acid sequences, the slowly divergent sequences, contain signals of translational, transcriptional, or integrative significance. Interspersed among the conserved regions are rapidly divergent sequences in which base changes, insertions, and deletions are especially prevalent. In the present study, CPC-1, a type C virus isolated from Colobus polykomos, was shown to be related to another Old World type C monkey virus, endogenous stump-tailed monkey virus, MAC-1, by analysis of their 5'-terminal nucleotide sequences. The 5'-terminal regions of CPC-1 and MAC-1 showed a 76% nucleotide correspondence and were of similar lengths, 132 and 127 nucleotides, respectively. Previous strong-stop analyses of other type C viruses have defined two subgroups: (i) Rauscher murine leukemia virus and gibbon ape leukemia virus and (ii) baboon endogenous virus and endogenous cat virus RD114. Based on the present sequence analysis of their 5'-terminal sequences, CPC-1 and MAC-1 formed a third subgroup. Computer-assisted comparison of the 5'-terminal sequences of CPC-1 and MAC-1 to the previously reported sequence of avian spleen necrosis virus (SNV) (Shimotohno et al., Nature [London] 285:550-554, 1980) showed SNV to be a member of that subgroup of mammalian type C viruses. Consistent with the inclusion of SNV in this subgroup of mammalian type C viruses, SNV was distantly related to other mammalian type C viruses. Interestingly, the SNV 5'-terminal sequences showed no significant evolutionary relationship by these criteria to the avian leukemia and sarcoma viruses. CPC-1, MAC-1, and SNV contained conserved regulatory signals in similar positions in their 5'-terminal RNA sequences analogous to those observed in other mammalian type C retroviruses. These sequences included the canonical AAUAAA sequence, a palindrome, a putative ribosome binding site, and an integration site. Some of these highly conserved subsequences were common to 3'- and 5'-terminal noncoding sequences of nonviral eucaryotic mRNA's (Efstratiadis et al., Cell 21:653-668, 1980). Thus, analysis and comparison of 5'-terminal nucleotide sequences have been useful in defining common functional signals and in extending the matrix of relationships among retroviruses.","['Lovinger, G G', 'Mark, G', 'Todaro, G J', 'Schochetman, G']","['Lovinger GG', 'Mark G', 'Todaro GJ', 'Schochetman G']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Computers', '*Genes, Viral', '*RNA, Viral', 'Retroviridae/classification/*genetics']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Jul;39(1):238-45. doi: 10.1128/JVI.39.1.238-245.1981.,['10.1128/JVI.39.1.238-245.1981 [doi]'],['N01-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC171282,,,['GENBANK/M12211'],,,

Mutants used included ts 28, a late mutant which releases noninfectious viruses at 39 degrees C, and ts 29, a double mutant with a ts lesion in its reverse transcriptase and a late block affecting virus budding. Immunological typing of the translational products of clonal recombinant viruses made it possible to establish their partial genetic maps and localize regions of the viral genome affected by different ts lesions. Recombinants involving Rauscher MuLV ts 28 invariably contained BALB-virus-2 p15, p12, and p30 proteins, localizing the late defect in replication by this mutant to the 5' moiety of the viral gag gene. All ts 29-derived recombinants contained the entire BALB:virus-2 gag and pol genes. Substitution of the pol gene is in agreement with the reported thermolability of Rauscher MuLV ts 29 reverse transcriptase (Tronick et al., J. Virol. 16:1476-1482, 1975). Substitution of the gag gene suggests that internal structural proteins are actively involved in the virus budding processing. Rauscher MuLV recombinants were used to establish the genetic map of the Rauscher MuLV genome by T1 oligonucleotide fingerprinting analysis. Detection of Rauscher MuLV T1 oligonucleotides in representative recombinant viruses, whose protein phenotypes were established by immunological techniques, permitted their assignment to specific regions of the viral genome. The genetic map of Rauscher MuLV generated in these studies should be useful for identifying and characterizing the viral gene(s) involved in leukemogenesis.","['Merregaert, J', 'Barbacid, M', 'Aaronson, S A']","['Merregaert J', 'Barbacid M', 'Aaronson SA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oligoribonucleotides/analysis', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Temperature', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Jul;39(1):219-28. doi: 10.1128/JVI.39.1.219-228.1981.,['10.1128/JVI.39.1.219-228.1981 [doi]'],,PMC171280,,,,,,

The linearized B- and N-tropic MuLV DNAs were then inserted in lambda vector Charon 21A and cloned. Seventeen B-tropic and ten N-tropic recombinants were analyzed. The viral insert of these 27 MuLV recombinants could be grouped into 3 classes. The first class included permuted full-length molecules of 8.8 kilobase pairs (kbp) having two long terminal repeats (LTR) (0.55 kbp) mixed with 8.25-kbp molecules. The second class included 8.25-kbp molecules which harbored only one LTR copy. The third class of inserts was made of molecules with deletions of various lengths (0.1 to 3 kbp). These deletions were localized by restriction enzyme analysis. Significantly more deletions were observed in N-tropic than in B-tropic recombinants, although these two genomes isolated from acutely infected cells seemed to differ only by the absence of a 70-base-pair (bp) sequence in the N-tropic LTR. The biological activity of each of the recombinants of the first and second classes was assayed by transfection on NIH/3T3 cells. Two recombinants, one B-tropic (lambda B-16) and one N-tropic (lambdaN-20) were found to be infectious. Both were able to give rise to replication-competent MuLV which could form large XC plaques and had kept the tropism of its progenitor. Like its progenitor in vivo DNA, lambdaN-20-cloned DNA lacked a 70-bp sequence in its unique LTR. The emerging N-tropic MuLV after transfection with lambdaN-20 was used to acutely infect NIH/3T3 cells. The viral DNA intermediates isolated were now found to have two LTR copies. They had also acquired a 70-bp sequence in each LTR. The acquisition or loss of this 70-bp sequence did not seem to affect the replication, the XC plaque formation, or the tropism of the virus.","['Rassart, E', 'DesGroseillers, L', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Rassart E', 'DesGroseillers L', 'Jolicoeur P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease HindIII)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Circular/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease HindIII', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Jul;39(1):162-71. doi: 10.1128/JVI.39.1.162-171.1981.,['10.1128/JVI.39.1.162-171.1981 [doi]'],,PMC171275,,,,,,

Possible structural homology between these functionally related proteins was investigated by two-dimensional analysis of both methionine-containing and phosphate-containing tryptic peptides derived from biosynthetically labeled proteins. Marked differences were found between the maps of both [35S]methionine-labeled and 32P-labeled tryptic peptides. This suggests that the transforming gene of Rous sarcoma virus and the putative transforming genes of Abelson virus and Y73 virus are different. In addition, each of these genes has been shown previously to be unrelated to the putative transforming gene of Fujinami sarcoma virus, another virus which encodes a protein with associated tyrosine protein kinase activity. Therefore, it appears that there exist at least four distinct classes of functionally related RNA tumor viruses. Analysis of phosphorylated tryptic peptides did, however, reveal homology between one of the two phosphotyrosine-containing tryptic peptides of p90 of Y73 virus and the single phosphotyrosine-containing tryptic peptide of p60src of Rous sarcoma virus. Comigration of these two peptides in several different buffers and the identical mobility of their phosphorylated cleavage products after secondary digestion with protease V8 of Staphylococcus aureus indicated that p60src and p90 contain an identical site of tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo. The results are discussed with respect to the evolution of RNA tumor viruses which encode proteins with associated tyrosine protein kinase activities and the limitations of analysis of detecting homology between genes by both molecular hybridization and peptide mapping.","['Patschinsky, T', 'Sefton, B M']","['Patschinsky T', 'Sefton BM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/analysis', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/analysis', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Methionine/analysis', 'Peptides/analysis', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Retroviridae/*analysis', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis/physiology']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Jul;39(1):104-14. doi: 10.1128/JVI.39.1.104-114.1981.,['10.1128/JVI.39.1.104-114.1981 [doi]'],"['CA-14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17289/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC171270,,,,,,

Virus-induced tumors in the AKR/FuRdA and AKR/JS strains showed a reintegration pattern of AKR-MLV sequences unique for the individual animal, suggesting a monoclonal origin for the outgrown tumors. An analysis of tumor DNAs from the AKR/FuRdA and AKR/JS substrains with restriction enzymes cleaving within the proviral genome revealed a new EcoRI restriction site and BamHI restriction site not present in normal tissues. The positions of these sites corresponded both with cleavage sites of EcoRI and BamHI in integrated Moloney recombinants and with the structure of isolated AKR mink cell focus-forming viruses. All tumors analyzed to data contain nearly identical integrated recombinant genomes, suggesting a causal relationship between the formation of recombinants and the leukemogenic process.","['Quint, W', 'Quax, W', 'van der Putten, H', 'Berns, A']","['Quint W', 'Quax W', 'van der Putten H', 'Berns A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Recombination, Genetic']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Jul;39(1):1-10. doi: 10.1128/JVI.39.1.1-10.1981.,['10.1128/JVI.39.1.1-10.1981 [doi]'],,PMC171259,,,,,,

Resistance to this disease is correlated with the endogenous expression of an MCF/xenotropic virus-gp70-related protein that may interfere with the replication or spread of MCF viruses. These ideas are supported by the following observations: (a) after infection with F-MuLV, only 6/13 strains of mice-developed disease, and studies with crosses between susceptible and resistant strains indicated that resistance was dominant. Although F-MuLV was shown to replicate equally well in all strains tested, viruses coding for MCF-specific viral envelope proteins could be detected only in the spleens of mice from strains that were resistant to F-MuLV-induced disease and not in the spleens of mice from strains that were resistant to F-MuLV-induced disease; (b) a Friend MCF (Fr-MCF) virus isolated from the spleen of an F-MuLV-infected mouse from a susceptible strain induced the same erythroproliferative disease when injected as an appropriate pseudotype into mice from susceptible but not resistant strains of mice; and (c) resistant but not susceptible strains of mice endogenously express MCF/xenotropic virus-related envelope glycoproteins that may be responsible for resistance by blocking receptors for MCF viruses. These results not only indicate that Fr-MCF virus is a crucial intermediate in the induction of disease by F-MuLV, but also suggest that a novel gene, either an MCF/xenotropic virus-related envelope gene or a gene controlling its expression, is responsible for resistance to erythroleukemia induced by F-MuLV.","['Ruscetti, S', 'Davis, L', 'Feild, J', 'Oliff, A']","['Ruscetti S', 'Davis L', 'Feild J', 'Oliff A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Virus Replication']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1981 Sep 1;154(3):907-20. doi: 10.1084/jem.154.3.907.,['10.1084/jem.154.3.907 [doi]'],,PMC2186461,,,,,,

Relation to Gix G(rada1), G(aksl2) systems of MuLV-related antigens.",659-75,"A new cell surface antigen of the mouse related to xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is described. The antigen, designated G(erld), is defined by cytotoxic tests with the B6-x-ray-induced ERLD and naturally occurring antibody. G(erld) is distinct from all previously defined cell surface antigens. Monoclonal antibody with the same specificity has been developed. Inbred mouse strains are classified as G(erld)+ or G(erld)- according to the presence of absence of the antigen on lymphoid cells. G(erld)+ strains differ with regard to quantitative expression of G(erld) on normal thymocytes. The emergence of G(erld)+ tumors in G(erld)- strains indicates the presence of genes coding for the antigen even in strains not normally expressing the antigen. G(erld) has the characteristic of a differentiation antigen in normal mice. In G(erld)+ strains, high levels of the antigen are found on thymocytes with lower levels being detected on cells of spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow. No G(erld) was detected in brain or kidney or on erythrocytes. The segregation ratios for G(erld) expression on thymocytes in backcross and F2 mice of crosses between G(erld)+ (B6, 129, and B6-Gix+) and G(erld)- (BALB/c) strains suggest that G(erld) expression is controlled by a single locus in B6, by two unlinked loci in 129, and by three unlinked loci in B6-Gix+ mice. Induction of the antigen by MuLV infection of permissive cells in vitro indicates that G(erld) is closely related to xenotropic and dualtropic MuLV; all xenotropic and dualtropic MuLV tested induced the antigen, whereas the majority of ecotropic and the two amphotropic MuLV failed to do so. As dualtropic MuLV are thought to be recombinants between ecotropic and xenotropic MuLV sequences, G(erld) coding by dualtropic MuLV may signify the contribution of the xenotropic part in the recombinational event. Serological and biochemical characterization indicates that G(erld) is related to the gp 70 component of the MuLV envelope. The relation of G(erld) to the previously defined gp 70-related cell surface antigens (Gix, G(rada), and G(aksl2) is discussed, particularly with regard to their characteristics as differentiation antigens, the genetic origin of dualtropic MuLV, and the leukemogenicity of MuLV.","['Obata, Y', 'Stockert, E', 'DeLeo, A B', ""O'Donnell, P V"", 'Snyder, H W Jr', 'Old, L J']","['Obata Y', 'Stockert E', 'DeLeo AB', ""O'Donnell PV"", 'Snyder HW Jr', 'Old LJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics/*immunology', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",1981/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1981 Sep 1;154(3):659-75. doi: 10.1084/jem.154.3.659.,['10.1084/jem.154.3.659 [doi]'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP8-1054/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2186439,,,,,,

A-particles present mainly as closed ""virus fields"" in the vicinity of the cell nucleus, frequently in the Golgi area. The intracisternal A-particles appear inside the lumen of expanded vesicles of the cytoplasma.

We have confirmed this prediction by showing that the nontransforming retrovirus, Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), can insert its provirus within the selectable target provided by a single provirus in a clonal rat cell line (B31) transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). Analysis of over 60 morphological revertants of M-MuLV-superinfected B31 cells revealed two lines with inserts of M-MuLV proviruses within the RSV provirus but outside the transforming gene of RSV (src), at sites 0.6 and 4.0 kb from the 5' end. The inserts did not inactivate initiation of RSV RNA synthesis but did affect elongation or processing, or both, generating species with the 5' end of RSV RNA linked to sequences that presumably derive from the inserted M-MuLV DNA. In one mutant line, most of the insert was excised at low frequency, apparently by homologous recombination between repeated sequences at the ends of M-MuLV DNA. After excision, RSV src mRNA was present in normal amounts, and the cells resumed a transformed appearance. In at least four independent lines, large portions of the left end of the RSV provirus (from 1 to 6 kb) and variable amounts of leftward flanking cellular DNA (from 0.5 to 10-15 kb or more) were deleted, without nearby insertions of M-MuLV NA. The deletions removed the putative promoter for synthesis of RSV RNA; in the two cases examined, no RSV RNA was detected. These deletions may represent a second mutational effect of the superinfection by M-MuLV.","['Varmus, H E', 'Quintrell, N', 'Ortiz, S']","['Varmus HE', 'Quintrell N', 'Ortiz S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Rats', '*Recombination, Genetic']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell. 1981 Jul;25(1):23-36. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90228-2.,"['0092-8674(81)90228-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(81)90228-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Extent of disease was the major predictor of complete remission (CR) frequency and survival greater than 2 years, with CR rates being 40% for patients with limited disease (LD) and 10% for those with extensive disease. Patients who were classified as having extensive disease on the basis of isotope scan evidence of a single bone metastasis had survival characteristics and response rates similar to those of patient with LD. A multivariate analysis of various factors, which may influence overall survival, reveals a good-risk population to be defined as having LD and an initial performance status less than or equal to 2, with or without a single metastatic focus on bone scan. Furthermore, this risk definition fairly successfully predicted which patients had the greatest chance of achieving a CR (45%). Age less than 70 years was shown to be a significantly adverse factor on survival in these multivariate analyses after adjusting for risk. When long-term survivors (less than 24 months) were investigated by multivariate analyses, the new risk system was found to be the only significant pretreatment factor. Interestingly, sex was the next marginally influential factor on long-term survival. Future stratification by these risk categories should lead to more homogeneous subgroups for comparison of different therapeutic approaches and should provide some indication as to how much better the newer treatment program is within each risk group.","['Maurer, L H', 'Pajak, T F']","['Maurer LH', 'Pajak TF']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/secondary', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Radiography', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Random Allocation', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1981 Sep-Oct;65(9-10):767-74.,,"['A-16188/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA-04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Our results indicate (i) that lymphoid leukosis tumors are clonal in origin; (ii) that there are multiple sites in the cellular genome of the target tissue where the virus DNA can integrate and that, in the majority of the tumors, at least one such site of each tumor is adjacent to a cellular sequence related to the oncogene of MC-29 virus; and (iii) that deletions and other structural alterations in the proviral DNA may facilitate tumorigenesis.","['Fung, Y K', 'Fadly, A M', 'Crittenden, L B', 'Kung, H J']","['Fung YK', 'Fadly AM', 'Crittenden LB', 'Kung HJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/etiology/*genetics', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/metabolism', '*DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Linkage']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Jun;78(6):3418-22. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.6.3418.,['10.1073/pnas.78.6.3418 [doi]'],,PMC319579,,,,,,

Immunocytologic studies revealed the T-cell origin of these thymic type lymphomas. Alteration of the T-cell system during latency period was represented by reduced thymic weight, cell numbers, as well as absolute and relative T-cell reduction. Absolute T-cell reduction was also observed in the spleen, although the reduction of splenic lymphoid cells was mainly caused by a decrease of B cells. In lymph node subnormal variations of theta-positive cells took place, whereas B-cell distribution was not altered.

Rauscher p10 is composed of 56 amino acid residues; the other p10s are similar in size but differ from Rauscher by a few conservative amino acid substitutions. The structure of Rauscher p10 was compared to the structure of a functionally homologous protein from Rous avian sarcoma virus. The comparison revealed regions of amino acid sequence homologies which indicate a phylogenetic relationship between the murine and avian viral strains. The analyses revealed a periodic placement of three Cys residues and a Gly-His sequence. A structure involving these residues is found once in the murine protein and twice in the avian protein. A similar structure is seen in the single stranded nucleic acid binding protein of bacteriophage T4.

Cultures were derived from the bone marrow of BALB/Mo mice, which carry Mo-MuLV as an endogenous virus, or from BALB/c, 129/J, or balb/c X 129/J mice that were infected with Mo-MuLV in vitro. The following parameters were tested: longevity of generation of granulocytes; biological properties of nonadherent cells in colony-forming assays for pluripotential stem cells and committed granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit culture, erythroid, or metachromasia-positive mast cell-basophil colony-forming cells; differentiation of nonadherent cells following cocultivation with thymic or bone marrow stromal cells; and generation of WEHI-3 dialyzed conditioned medium-dependent permanent cell lines. Granulocytes were generated for 65 weeks in BALB/Mo marrow cultures, 31 weeks for BALB/c, 22 weeks in 129/J, and 28 weeks in balb/c X 129/J cultures. Exogenous infection of BALB/c cultures with Mo-MuLV increased the longevity of hematopoiesis to 41 weeks. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit cultures were produced for 61 weeks in BALB/Mo cultures, 25 to 40 weeks in Mo-MuLV-infected cultures, and 19 to 33 weeks in uninfected control cultures. Nonadherent cells harvested from BALB/Mo marrow cultures generated cloned permanent WEHI-3 dialyzed conditioned medium-dependent, nonleukemogenic granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit culture cell lines at greater efficiency than did Mo-MuLV-infected or uninfected BALB/c cultures. The cell lines differentiated to mature granulocytes following cocultivation with purified marrow or thymic stromal cells. There was no detectable differentiation of nonadherent cells to lymphocytes or mast cells. Thus, Mo-MuLV does not detectably transform granulocyte progenitor cells in vitro to granulocytic leukemia. However, Mo-MuLV replication stimulates self-renewal of granulocyte progenitor cells in both primary marrow culture and in suspension culture in WEHI-3 dialyzed conditioned medium.","['Greenberger, J S', 'Shadduck, R K', 'Jaenisch, R', 'Waheed, A', 'Sakakeeny, M A']","['Greenberger JS', 'Shadduck RK', 'Jaenisch R', 'Waheed A', 'Sakakeeny MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*physiopathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*physiopathology', 'Virus Replication']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Sep;41(9 Pt 1):3556-65.,,"['CA-15237-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25412-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26785-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

An i.p. inoculated virus-enriched fraction from A3 cells (BALB/c/HeA) had a similar oncogenic effect as i.p. and s.c. inoculated whole A3 cells. The average MT ages were reduced in all 3 groups. Cell lines BBM (BALB/c/CrglA) and BB (C57BL/LiA) were tested as i.p. inoculated whole cells. Again, the average MT age was reduced in thus treated BALB/c/Crgl females. In the case of C57BL/LiA the percentage of animals with MT was strongly increased in the BB cell inoculated group (1 MT in control group). Bioassay results corrected for intercurrent death cases (including leukosis) were statistically significant.

Chromosome patterns in stimulated lymphocytes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,293-306,"In the present study the B-cell mitogens from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and lipopolysaccharide-B from E. coli (LPS) were used to stimulate the blood cells of 27 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to undergo mitosis. In 14 CLL cases EBV was used as the only mitotic stimulant and in 5 cases both EBV and LPS. In 8 cases neither EBV nor LPS caused mitotic cells to appear. In 9 cases the cells were characterized by abnormal clones, including 5 cases with +12 (including 1 case with a possible Philadelphia chromosome), 2 cases with 14q+ and 1 case with an i(17q). No correlation was found between the types of surface membrane immunoglobulins and the chromosome abnormalities in the leukemic lymphocytes. The effects of EBV on normal lymphocytes were also investigated and found to be nonspecific (e.g., tetraploidy), although in every case EBV caused a definite increase in the mitotic index. The results indicate that 1) EBV and LPS stimulate leukemic cells of CLL to undergo mitosis, 2) about 50% of the patients have clonal abnormalities in the leukemic cells, and 3) CLL is associated with karyotypic changes seen in lymphoma (14q+), although the most common anomaly in our material was a +12.","['Morita, M', 'Minowada, J', 'Sandberg, A A']","['Morita M', 'Minowada J', 'Sandberg AA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Polysaccharides, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/*ultrastructure', 'Escherichia coli', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial/immunology']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1981 Jun;3(4):293-306. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(81)90038-8.,"['0165-4608(81)90038-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(81)90038-8 [doi]']","['CA-2599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-5834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

In the group of patients with breast carcinoma a correlation was noted between age and the probability of detection of these antibodies. Histopathologic examination of breast cancers indicated that antibodies to antigens in mouse mammary tumors were more often found in patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the mucinous type than with other types of breast tumors. No correlation was demonstrable between the incidence of detection of these antibodies and the stage of the disease. Immunochemical analyses indicated that the antibody activity was present in IgG and IgM classes of immunoglobulins.

The present study sought to examine this association further by detection of antigens related to these viruses on the surface of acute leukaemia cells. Antisera against the whole viruses or the major internal protein of simian sarcoma, endogenous baboon and Rauscher viruses were tested against mononuclear cells from patients with acute leukaemia at various stages of their disease in 51Cr release leucocyte dependent cytotoxic assays. A high proportion of the patients had antigens related to these viruses detectable on their blood leucocytes at some stage in their disease whereas with one exception blood leucocytes from non-leukaemic subjects did not. The expression of these antigens did not show a close relation to the number of blast cells in blood detected on morphological grounds. Antigens related to the non-human primate viruses were detected on mononuclear cells from bone marrow samples of several non-leukaemic patients which indicated they were not specifically associated with leukaemia. Antigens related to the Rauscher virus were detected on cells of practically all bone marrow samples tested. These results suggest that assays to detect these antigens would be of limited usefulness to monitor disease activity in patients with acute leukaemia. Their expression on blood leucocytes however appeared strongly associated with acute leukaemia and further studies to assess the prognostic and epidemiological significance of detection of these antigens appears warranted.","['Pullen, S', 'Hersey, P']","['Pullen S', 'Hersey P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Bone Marrow/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae/*immunology']",1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathology. 1981 Apr;13(2):289-98. doi: 10.3109/00313028109081668.,['10.3109/00313028109081668 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Metastatic thymic lymphoma specifically infected by thymotropic retrovirus.,123-30,"Tissue distribution of radiation leukemia virus (RadLV) was examined after its inoculation into normal C57BL/6J (B6) mice, B6 mice bearing a transplantable, non-virus-producing thymic lymphoma (RL12-NP), and B6 mice bearing a transplanted non-virus producing, Harvey murine sarcoma virus-transformed fibrosarcoma. Virus expression was determined by competition radioimmunoassay for murine leukemia virus (MuLV) p30 (predominant group-reactive antigen of MuLV) and for RadLV p12 (a highly type-specific MuLV polypeptide) and by membrane immunofluorescence for cell surface gp71 (predominant envelope glycoprotein of MuLV). Normal adult B6 mice were given three sequential iv injections of RadLV and were examined several times up to 200 days later for the appearance of neoplastic disease or expression of virion antigens. No clinical abnormalities were noted, and animals remained healthy for greater than 200 days. Significant levels of MuLV p30 and RadLV p12 were detected only in the thymuses. Organs and tumors from RL12-NP-inoculated animals contained low or nondetectable levels of virion antigens. Inoculation of mice with RL12-Rad, a cell line derived by in vitro infection of RL12-NP cells with RadLV, produced widespread, discrete metastatic tumors and infiltrated the lymphoid organs of B6 mice in a pattern identical to that observed after administration of RL12-NP cells. Lymphoid organs of RL12-Rad-inoculated animals expressed variable levels of virion antigens reflecting differences in the extent of tumor cell infiltration as opposed to virus spread from tumor to host cells. Administration of infectious RadLV systemically into RL12-NP tumor-bearing animals converted these tumors to viron antigen expressors with levels in superinfected tumors equivalent to those found in RL12-Rad-induced tumors. Infection was highly selective, and host tissues were minimally contaminated by the inoculated virus. Part of this selectivity was explained by the thymotropic property of RadLV. A rapidly dividing murine fibrosarcoma was not infected by RadLV, but this same non-virus-expressing tumor could be infected by common fibrotropic MuLV isolates.","['Iglehart, J D', 'Weinhold, K J', 'Huper, G', 'Thiel, K', 'Bolognesi, D P']","['Iglehart JD', 'Weinhold KJ', 'Huper G', 'Thiel K', 'Bolognesi DP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Jul;67(1):123-30.,,"['5T32-CA09058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25863-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP33308/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

On the other hand, colony-forming ability and the expression of xenotropic virus of K-BALB cells after X-irradiation were unaffected by caffeine. These data suggest a linear relationship between the degree of endogenous virus expression and the amount of lethal damages after irradiation.

The cyclic GMP concentration is the same everywhere except in monoblastic cells and leukocytes from solid tumor patients.

Detection was by an enzyme-linked immunoassay recently developed in our laboratory. In the women with breast cancer, 62% of the East Africans, 28% of the Indians, 19% of the Americans but only 5% of the Chinese had antibody to MuMTV. Among healthy women, 21% of the Africans, 3% of the Americans and 5% of the Chinese possessed this antibody. Several family members of breast cancer patients, males as well as females, had increased levels of MuMTV antibody. The MuMTV-reactive antibody was removed by absorption with MuMTV, deglycosylated MuMTV and gp52, the major MuMTV envelope protein. It was not absorbed out by murine leukemia viruses, red blood cells from various species, fetal calf serum or carbohydrates. The results suggest that there may be more than one form of breast cancer, definable by reactivity to MuMTV. The murine mammary tumor virus (MuMTV) is the etiological agent of breast cancer in mice. The induction of mammary tumorigenesis, however, is dependent upon the genetic makeup, hormonal status, and diet of the infected mouse. Thus, even in a situation where a known single cause for breast cancer exists, disease manifestation is subordinate to diverse factors in the individual host.","['Day, N K', 'Witkin, S S', 'Sarkar, N H', 'Kinne, D', 'Jussawalla, D J', 'Levin, A', 'Hsia, C C', 'Good, R A']","['Day NK', 'Witkin SS', 'Sarkar NH', 'Kinne D', 'Jussawalla DJ', 'Levin A', 'Hsia CC', 'Good RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Trans Assoc Am Physicians,Transactions of the Association of American Physicians,7506109,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Africa, Eastern', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*immunology', 'United States']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Trans Assoc Am Physicians. 1980;93:123-9.,,"['AL-11843/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,

Sera from inoculated mice were tested for their effect on this reactivity. At the optimal dilution, tumor extracts induced significant reactions with cells from tumor-bearing mice (progressors) and from mice with regressed tumors (regressors); cells from normal mice and from mice with transplanted, chemically induced tumors were unaffected. Sera from progressor mice specifically blocked the reactivity of syngeneic cells. At the time of maximal tumor development, this blocking activity disappeared and the serum became unblocking: i.e., the regressor serum neutralized the blocking factor in progressor serum. The blocking or unblocking factors were tumor-specific; no cross-reactivity occurred with similar factors related to the chemically induced tumor. Normal cells were not significantly affected by exposure to blocking and unblocking sera.

When shifted from the permissive (37 degrees C) to the nonpermissive (41.5 degrees C) temperature, the cellular phenotype reverted to normal within 2 h, but it required about 48 h at 37 degrees C to revert back to the transformed morphology. A temperature-resistant (tr) FSV clone was isolated from a tumor of an animal. All ts mutants were tumorigenic in animals but induced tumors only after latent periods of 12 to 25 days, compared to 5 to 6 days with tr virus. The ts lesions of the FSV mutants affected 90% of the phosphorylation of the nonstructural, gag-related 140,000-kilodalton phosphoprotein coded by FSV (p140), but did not affect virus replication or the synthesis of p140. Upon shifting from the permissive to the nonpermissive temperature, p140 was 90% dephosphorylated with an approximate (32)P half-life of 20 min. When shifted back to the permissive temperature, the preexisting p140 was rephosphorylated in the absence of protein synthesis within a 90-min test period. Likewise, most of the phosphate of fully phosphorylated p140 was exchanged at the permissive temperature within 30 to 90 min even when protein synthesis was inhibited. However, the protein structure of p140 had a half-life of 5 h at both temperatures. These results prove p140 to be a substrate of reversible phosphorylation. Superinfection and transformation of ts FSV-infected cells maintained at the nonpermissive temperature with acute leukemia virus MC29 failed to phosphorylate p140. It would follow that in vivo phosphorylation of ts p140 is controlled by an FSV-specific mechanism and is a prerequisite, not a consequence, of transformation. p140 of ts FSV recovered from cells maintained at 41.5 degrees C with anti-gag serum was over 10 times less phosphorylated by associated kinase than the same protein recovered from cells at 37 degrees C if assayed in vitro at 20 degrees C. This kinase activity associated with or dissociated from p140 with a half-life of less than 30 min during temperature shifts of ts FSV-infected cells. However, p140 recovered from ts FSV-infected cells maintained at 37 degrees C was phosphorylated by associated kinase in vitro not only at 20 degrees C but also, and essentially at the same level, at 41.5 degrees C. This suggests that the kinase associated with the immunocomplex of p140 of ts FSV is not temperature sensitive. p140 translated in vitro from ts and tr FSV RNA lacked kinase activity. We conclude that a fully phosphorylated p140 is necessary for the maintenance of transformation by FSV. This is consistent with the notion that other highly oncogenic viruses also code for nonstructural phosphoproteins with probable transforming function. A model which postulates that p140 is a substrate of reversible phosphorylation and that the lesion of the ts FSV clones described herein affects association of p140 with a cellular kinase rather than a hypothetical intrinsic kinase activity of the protein is most compatible with our data.","['Lee, W H', 'Bister, K', 'Moscovici, C', 'Duesberg, P H']","['Lee WH', 'Bister K', 'Moscovici C', 'Duesberg PH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Peptides)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*physiology', 'Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Mutation', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Quail', 'Temperature', 'Transforming Growth Factors']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Jun;38(3):1064-76. doi: 10.1128/JVI.38.3.1064-1076.1981.,['10.1128/JVI.38.3.1064-1076.1981 [doi]'],['CA-11426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC171246,,,,,,

Distinct syncytia were seen within 2 h after inoculation of cells with highly concentrated (500-fold) cell-free BLV preparations and within 4 to 8 h when unconcentrated cell-free BLV preparations were used. Indicator cell densities of 1 x 10(5) to 2 x 10(5) were optimal for rapid and maximal syncytium formation. Pretreatment of BLV with reference BLV leukemic serum and antiserum prepared against purified BLV significantly inhibited (95%) syncytium formation. Reference bovine viral diarrhea virus serum, foamy-like bovine syncytial virus serum, and control serum had little effect (17% inhibition). Antiserum to BLV gp51 inhibited syncytium formation by greater than 96%, whereas antiserum to BLV p24 reduced syncytium activity to a much lesser extent (38% inhibition). Treatment of BLV with beta-propiolactone (0.005 to 0.05%) had little or no effect upon syncytium-forming activity, whereas UV irradiation (15 ergs/mm(2) per s for 30 min) reduced, but did not completely destroy, the fusion activity. However, both beta-propiolactone and UV irradiation drastically reduced the replication potential of BLV, as demonstrated by the lack of p24 expression in the inoculated cells. Concentrations of cycloheximide, cytosine arabinoside, tunicamycin, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose which effectively blocked cellular macromolecular synthesis did not significantly inhibit syncytium formation. These latter results suggested that de novo protein and DNA synthesis as well as protein glycosylation were not required for early syncytium formation. Thus, these experiments demonstrated that replication of BLV by the indicator cells was not essential for cell fusion.","['Graves, D C', 'Jones, L V']","['Graves DC', 'Jones LV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '6RC3ZT4HB0 (Propiolactone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Fusion/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Propiolactone/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Jun;38(3):1055-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.38.3.1055-1063.1981.,['10.1128/JVI.38.3.1055-1063.1981 [doi]'],"['2S07RR05411/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC171245,,,,,,

Seven isolates (four noninfectious, three infectious) were studied by heteroduplexing followed by electron microscopy or by S1 nuclease treatment and gel electrophoresis. No regions of nonhomology between proviruses were detected by either criterion, and in no case did we observe homology between flanking sequences. Random shearing or removal of flanking sequences by S1 nuclease had no effect on the status of infectivity of the clones. Thus, we were unable to find molecular differences between infectious and noninfectious proviruses.

The conclusions are: (i) three viruses coding for Abelson-specific proteins of molecular weight 120,000, 100,000, and 90,000 had genomes indistinguishable in size, suggesting that the shorter proteins are the result of early translational termination; (ii) compared with the genome encoding the 120,000-dalton (120K) protein, a genome coding for a 160K protein was 0.8 kilobase larger in the A-MuLV-specific region; and (iii) a genome coding for a 92K protein had a 700-base pair deletion internal to the coding region.

Both the phosphotyrosine level in protein of FSV-infected cells and the protein kinase activity assayed in immune complexes containing the FSV protein P140 were temperature-sensitive. The presumed transforming proteins of these ASVs were compared with those of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), Abelson murine leukemia virus and the Snyder-Theilen and Gardner-Arnstein strains of feline sarcoma virus (FeSV), which have previously been associated with tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity. FSV and PRC II proteins were shown to be structurally related to one another and to the FeSV proteins by tryptic peptide mapping and by immunological studies.

The injection of ICRF-159 concurrently with the administration of DR resulted in a marked decrease in the toxicity of the antibiotic. However, when DX was injected concurrently with ICRF-159 an increase in antibiotic toxicity was observed, except when ICRF-159 was employed at a very low dosage. ICRF-159 administered alone did not influence the tumor growth in the systems tested and did not result in antimetastatic activity. In mice bearing transplanted MLV-M leukemia, the effects of the combination of ICRF-159 with DR or DX were not superior to those of DR or DX treatment on either tumor growth or lifespan. The treatment of MS-2 tumor with the ICRF-159 and DX combination neither produced a therapeutic synergism (therapeutic response superior to the maximum response obtainable by either agent independently) nor antagonized the antineoplastic action of DX. A marked inhibition of tumor growth and increase in lifespan were observed in the mice treated with a high dose of DR (10 mg/kg/injection) plus ICRF-159 (50 mg/kg/injection).

The leukemic cells studied were found to have higher specific activities of cytosol cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-independent casein kinase and lower activation by cAMP of their cytosol histone kinase compared to the normal myeloid cells studied. Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography revealed correspondingly higher amounts of cAMP-independent protein kinase isoenzymes (two casein kinase and one histone kinase peaks) in the leukemic cells, as well as altered ratios of the two cAMP-dependent isozymes. Casein phosphorylating activities extracted from the nuclei of the leukemic cell lines were also high compared to normal myeloid cells. Further purification and estimation of molecular weights of the isoenzymes present in leukemia were accomplished by gel filtration, using Sephacryl S-200. Resolution of the acute myeloblastic leukemia cell line nuclear casein kinase activity into two peaks was also thereby accomplished. The nuclear peaks eluted earlier than the corresponding cytoplasmic peaks; thus, the nuclear isoenzymes may not be identical to those from the cytoplasm.

The glucocorticoid receptor concentration of the leukaemic blast cells ranged from 0 to 0.94 fmol/microgram DNA. Thirteen patients had blast cells with a glucocorticoid receptor concentration over 0.22 fmol/microgram DNA. These patients had significantly increased remission and survival rates (p = 0.006) compared with those with a low receptor concentration. This finding cannot be explained by a difference in sensitivity to glucocorticoids since these were not used as therapeutic agents. Adenosine deaminase and 5'nucleotidase activities both varied within two orders of magnitude. No correlation could be found between activities of these enzymes and remission or survival rate.

The dose-limiting toxicities involved the central nervous system (CNS) and the kidneys. Other toxicities included bronchitis, decreases in hematocrit, arthralgias, and myalgias.

These results suggest that prophylactic granulocyte transfusions have no statistically significant effect on the frequency of septicemia or other infections, do not enhance remission rates or survival, and are associated with an increased risk for pulmonary complications and cytomegalovirus infections.","['Winston, D J', 'Ho, W G', 'Gale, R P']","['Winston DJ', 'Ho WG', 'Gale RP']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia/etiology', 'Random Allocation', 'Risk', 'Sepsis/*prevention & control']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1981 May;94(5):616-22. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-94-5-616.,['10.7326/0003-4819-94-5-616 [doi]'],"['CA-15688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HB-62961/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,

Immune complexes have been previously shown to induce hand-mirror-cell (HMC) formation in human lymphocytes and have been associated with increased number of HMC in acute leukemia. We studied the ability of immune complexes to induce HMC in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), a disease of cellular immune deficiency. Our findings indicate that lymphocytes from patients with WAS adhere to immune complexes but have a defect in their ability to form HMC when compared with normal human lymphocytes. These results support the concept that immune complexes induce HMC formation and that the HMC is related to the normal cellular immune response.","['McGraw, T P', 'Folds, J D', 'Whisnant, J K', 'Phillips, T M', 'Stass, S A']","['McGraw TP', 'Folds JD', 'Whisnant JK', 'Phillips TM', 'Stass SA']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens, Viral', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Child', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/*immunology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1981;10(2):157-63. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830100207.,['10.1002/ajh.2830100207 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The ANAE, ANBE, and AP activities appeared specially localized within cytoplasmic granules. Electron microscopy substantiated a prominence of membrane-bound dense-core cytoplasmic granules. The variegated appearance of these dense-core granules and the cytochemical profile suggest that the aberrant granules are lysosomal in nature. Both the prominent cytoplasmic granules and the older age distribution led to early misdiagnosis of myelocytic leukemia. The distinctive cytochemical/morphologic profile and the ease of misdiagnosis suggest an important morphologic variant of acute lymphocytic leukemia.","['Grogan, T M', 'Insalaco, S J', 'Savage, R A', 'Vail, M L']","['Grogan TM', 'Insalaco SJ', 'Savage RA', 'Vail ML']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Azure Stains)', '0 (Phenothiazines)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Azure Stains', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Esterases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulation Tissue/*anatomy & histology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', '*Phenothiazines', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1981 May;75(5):716-22. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/75.5.716.,['10.1093/ajcp/75.5.716 [doi]'],,,,,,,,
