The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) plays an important role in tumor cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and survival. In this study, we investigated the effects and the molecular mechanisms of gossypol on NF-kappaB activation and NF-kappaB-related gene expression in human leukemia U937 cells. Treatment with concentrations of gossypol greater than 10 microM resulted in significant cell cytotoxicity and DNA fragmentation, indicative of apoptosis. Treatment with 10 microM gossypol also induced caspase-3 activation and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and resulted in the induction of apoptosis in approximately 20% of cells as determined by annexin-V staining 24h after treatment. Furthermore, gossypol exposure decreased the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with gossypol also downregulated expression of NF-kappaB-regulated gene products, including inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP)-1, IAP-2, and X-linked IAP. Attenuation of NF-kappaB activity by pretreatment with PDTC, an NF-kappaB nuclear translocation inhibitor, significantly induced apoptosis in the presence of gossypol. Gossypol also suppressed NF-kappaB p65 mRNA accumulation, resulting in suppression of total NF-kappaB activity. This was associated with a downregulation of Sp1-binding activity, a transcription factor controlling p65 transcription. These results suggest that gossypol-induced apoptosis partially involves suppression of NF-kappaB activity.","['Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Kim, Mun-Ock', 'Lee, Jae-Dong', 'Kim, Gi-Young']","['Moon DO', 'Kim MO', 'Lee JD', 'Kim GY']","['Faculty of Applied Marine Science, Cheju National University, Jeju Special Self-Governing Province, 690-756, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Sp1 kinase)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gossypol/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(08)00050-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2008.01.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Jun 18;264(2):192-200. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2008.01.030.

Aqueous mistletoe extracts (MT) contain the three mistletoe lectins I, II and III as one predominant group of biologically active agents. Although MT is widely used, there is a lack of scientifically sound preclinical and clinical data. In this paper, we describe for the first time the in vivo efficacy and mechanism of action of MT in lymphoblastic leukemia. For this purpose, we first investigated both the cytotoxic effect and the mechanism of action of two standardized aqueous MTs (MT obtained from fir trees (MT-A); MT obtained from pine trees (MT-P)) in a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line (NALM-6). MT-A, MT-P and ML-I inhibited cell proliferation as determined by Casy Count analysis at very low concentrations with MT-P being the most cytotoxic extract. DNA-fragmentation assays indicated that dose-dependent induction of apoptosis was the main mechanism of cell death. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of MT-A and MT-P in an in vivo SCID-model of pre-B ALL (NALM-6). Both MTs significantly improved survival (up to 55.4 days) at all tested concentrations in contrast to controls (34.6 days) without side effects.","['Seifert, Georg', 'Jesse, Patrick', 'Laengler, Alfred', 'Reindl, Tobias', 'Luth, Maria', 'Lobitz, Stephan', 'Henze, Gunter', 'Prokop, Aram', 'Lode, Holger N']","['Seifert G', 'Jesse P', 'Laengler A', 'Reindl T', 'Luth M', 'Lobitz S', 'Henze G', 'Prokop A', 'Lode HN']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Otto-Heubner-Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Charite, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany. georg.seifert@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Plant Lectins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mistletoe/*chemistry', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*therapeutic use', 'Plant Lectins/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2007/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(08)00047-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2008.01.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Jun 18;264(2):218-28. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2008.01.036.

Therefore, we attempted to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for SITO-induced anti-proliferation in human leukemia cells. Treatment with SITO increased caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in U937 and HL60 cells. This effect was associated with significant G2/M arrest and endoreduplication. We also demonstrated that SITO treatment significantly increases levels of polymeric alpha-tubulin and promoted microtubule polymerization. We next elucidated that ectopic expression of Bcl-2 accelerates endoreduplication in U937 cells. Furthermore, the specific Bcl-2 inhibitor, HA14-1, prevented endoreduplication through G2 phase arrest. Interestingly, SITO treatment did not significantly promote endoreduplication or decrease cell viability in Bcl-2 null K562 cells. SITO treatment also induced a gradual increase of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt phosphorylation. Treatment with the selective PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY29004 completely blocked endoreduplication and apoptosis in the presence of SITO. In addition, treatment with SITO-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), however significance of ERK activation in the execution of apoptosis and endoreduplication is unknown. These results suggest that SITO induces endoreduplication by promoting spindle microtubule dynamics through the Bcl-2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.","['Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Kim, Mun-Ock', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Kim, Gi-Young']","['Moon DO', 'Kim MO', 'Choi YH', 'Kim GY']","['Faculty of Applied Marine Science, Cheju National University, Jeju Special Self-Governing Province 690-756, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080307,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sitosterols)', '0 (Tubulin)', '5LI01C78DD (gamma-sitosterol)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Sitosterols/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/drug effects']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2007/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(08)00051-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2008.01.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Jun 18;264(2):181-91. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2008.01.032.

Expectedly, SNP309G females were found to be at a higher risk of accelerated onset of cancers. We have therefore analysed, in a pilot study, whether the status of MDM2 SNP309 and p53 codon-72 polymorphism, which was also shown to affect cancer predisposition, would affect cancer risk, onset age, overall survival and response to therapy in Chinese leukaemia patients. p53 SNP was not associated with any of the parameters. However, in contrast to expectations, the MDM2 SNP309G allele was associated with reduced risk of leukaemia.

FeLV-A is minimally pathogenic, FeLV-C can cause pure red cell aplasia, and FeLV-B is associated with a variety of pathogenic properties such as lymphoma, leukemia and anemia. FeLV-induced neoplasms are caused, at least in part, by somatically acquired insertional mutagenesis in which the integrated provirus may activate a proto-oncogene or disrupt a tumor suppressor gene. The common integration sites for FeLV have been identified in six loci with feline lymphomas: c-myc, flvi-1, flvi-2 (contains bmi-1), fit-1, pim-1 and flit-1. Oncogenic association of the loci includes that c-myc is known as a proto-oncogene, bmi-1 and pim-1 have been recognized as myc-collaborators, fit-1 appears to be closely linked to myb, and flit-1 insertion is shown to be associated with over-expression of a cellular gene, e.g. ACVRL1. Thus, identification of common integration sites for FeLV is a tenable model to clarify oncogenesis.

Supportive treatments do not seem to have reduced early exitus in this subset of patients. Prognostic impact of hyperleukocytosis on outcome has been the object of few studies. Clinical characteristics and outcome of 45 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia presenting to our institution with a white cell count (WBC) above 100 x 10(9)L(-1) were reviewed. The outcome of this subset of patients was compared with 200 patients with a leukocyte count lower than 100 x 10(9)L(-1) similarly treated in the same period. Eight hyperleukocytic patients (17%) died of intracranial haemorrhage or pulmonary failure due to leukostasis within the first 7 days of treatment. A significant association was found between complete response (CR) and absence of hyperleukocytosis, but if early deaths were removed from analysis the difference was no longer significant. Hyperleukocytosis also significantly reduces the overall survival (OS) but does not significantly influence the disease-free survival (DFS). We reviewed in literature studies in which the outcome of series of at least 10 patients with hyperleukocytosis were compared with that of patients with a leukocyte count lower than 100 x 10(9)L(-1).

BCR/ABL is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase influencing cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. To what extent and by which mechanism BCR/ABL affects the adhesion of leukemic cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) is controversial. To characterize adhesion of BCR/ABL-transformed 32D cells (32D-BCR/ABL) to the BMSC line M2-10B4, we used washing assays and single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS). Compared to control 32D cells (32D-V), 32D-BCR/ABL developed threefold higher adhesion forces. This enhanced cell adhesion could be reduced to control levels after specifically inhibiting the activity of the tyrosine kinase BCR/ABL using imatinib mesylate (IM). SCFS showed that the adhesion forces of 32D-BCR/ABL were strongest to fibronectin and collagen type I, suggesting that beta1-integrin has a major role in mediating the adhesion of leukemic cells to BMSC. Indeed, the beta1-integrin blocking antibody Ha2/5 abrogated the attachment of 32D-V and 32D-BCR/ABL cells to BMSC. Although 32D-BCR/ABL cells show significantly increased beta1-integrin expression, no significant difference of beta1-integrin mRNA levels could be detected, indicating a post-transcriptional regulation of beta1-comprising integrin heterodimers by BCR/ABL. The data presented here argue that the interaction of beta1-integrin and extracellular matrix components is functionally important in leukemic cells expressing high-levels of BCR/ABL, and could provide a rationale for the development of optimized targeted therapies.","['Fierro, Fernando A', 'Taubenberger, Anna', 'Puech, Pierre-Henri', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Muller, Daniel J', 'Illmer, Thomas']","['Fierro FA', 'Taubenberger A', 'Puech PH', 'Ehninger G', 'Bornhauser M', 'Muller DJ', 'Illmer T']","['Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Technical University, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080205,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen Type I/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/physiology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Integrin beta1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2007/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(08)00143-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2008.01.085 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2008 Apr 4;377(4):1082-93. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.01.085.

In order to further explore the critical events leading to apoptosis in sulforaphane-treated U937 human leukemia cells, the following effects of sulforaphane on components of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were examined: generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alteration of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and the expression changes of Bcl-2 family proteins. The cytotoxic effect of sulforaphane was mediated by its induction of apoptosis as characterized by the occurrence of DNA ladders, apoptotic bodies and chromosome condensation in U937 cells. The sulforaphane-induced apoptosis in U937 cells correlated with the generation of intracellular ROS, collapse of MMP, activation of caspase-3, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression. The quenching of ROS generation with antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine conferred significant protection against sulforaphane-elicited ROS generation, disruption of the MMP, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. In conclusion, the present study reveals that the cellular ROS generation plays a pivotal role in the initiation of sulforaphane-triggered apoptotic death in U937 cells.","['Choi, Woo Young', 'Choi, Byung Tae', 'Lee, Won Ho', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Choi WY', 'Choi BT', 'Lee WH', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Graduate School of Oriental Medicine, Pusan National University, Pusan 609-735, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080211,France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sulfoxides', 'Thiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/12/30 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0753-3322(08)00016-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2008.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2008 Nov;62(9):637-44. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2008.01.001.

We have identified 6MP and 6TG as reversible and slow-binding inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro, which is the first report about small molecule reversible inhibitors of PLpro. The inhibition mechanism was investigated by kinetic measurements and computer docking. Both compounds are competitive, selective, and reversible inhibitors of the PLpro with K(is) values approximately 10 to 20 microM. A structure-function relationship study has identified the thiocarbonyl moiety of 6MP or 6TG as the active pharmacophore essential for these inhibitions, which has not been reported before. The inhibition is selective because these compounds do not exert significant inhibitory effects against other cysteine proteases, including SARS-CoV 3CLpro and several cathepsins. Thus, our results present the first potential chemical leads against SARS-CoV PLpro, which might be used as lead compounds for further optimization to enhance their potency against SARS-CoV. Both 6MP and 6TG are still used extensively in clinics, especially for children with acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemia.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of common PBX1 variants with type 2 diabetes in French Caucasian subjects. METHODS: Employing a case-control design, we genotyped 39 SNPs spanning the PBX1 locus in 3,093 subjects to test for association with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Several PBX1 SNPs, including the G21S coding SNP rs2275558, were nominally associated with type 2 diabetes but the strongest result was obtained with the intron 2 SNP rs2792248 (P = 0.004, OR 1.20 [95% CI 1.06-1.37]). The SNPSpD multiple testing correction method gave a significance threshold of P = 0.002 for the 39 SNPs genotyped, indicating that the rs2792248 association did not survive multiple testing adjustment. SNP rs2792248 did not show evidence of association with the French 1q linkage signal (P = 0.31; weighted NPL score 2.16). None of the PBX1 SNPs nominally associated with type 2 diabetes were associated with a range of quantitative metabolic traits in the normoglycemic control subjects CONCLUSION: The available data does not support a major influence of common PBX1 variants on type 2 diabetes susceptibility or quantitative metabolic traits. In order to make progress in identifying the elusive susceptibility variants in the 1q region it will be necessary to carry out further large association studies, meta-analyses of existing data from individual studies, and deep resequencing of the 1q region.","['Duesing, Konsta', 'Charpentier, Guillaume', 'Marre, Michel', 'Tichet, Jean', 'Hercberg, Serge', 'Balkau, Beverley', 'Froguel, Philippe', 'Gibson, Fernando']","['Duesing K', 'Charpentier G', 'Marre M', 'Tichet J', 'Hercberg S', 'Balkau B', 'Froguel P', 'Gibson F']","['Genomic Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus, Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, UK. k.duesing@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080229,England,BMC Med Genet,BMC medical genetics,100968552,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/04/17 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2007/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2350-9-14 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2350-9-14 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genet. 2008 Feb 29;9:14. doi: 10.1186/1471-2350-9-14.,,PMC2292156,"['G0600331/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0700342/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'GR065414MF/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0000477/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been linked to HTLV-1 pathogenesis and to various kinds of cancers, including adult T-cell leukemia. NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) is critical for non-canonical activation of NF-kappaB and for the development of lymphoid organs. HTLV-1 activates NF-kappaB by the non-canonical pathway, but examination of the role of NIK in proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells in vivo has been hindered by lack of a suitable animal model. Alymphoplasia (aly/aly) mice bear a mutation of NIK, resulting in defects in the development of lymphoid organs and severe deficiencies in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. In the present study we therefore used a mouse model of HTLV-1 infection with aly/aly mice. The number of HTLV-1-infected cells in the reservoir organs in aly/aly mice was significantly smaller than in the control group 1 month after infection. In addition, aly/aly mice did not maintain provirus for 1 year and antibodies against HTLV-1 were undetectable. These results demonstrate that the absence of functional NIK impairs primary HTLV-1 proliferation and abolishes the maintenance of provirus. Interestingly, clonal proliferation of HTLV-1-infected mouse cells was not detected in aly/aly mice, which is consistent with the lack of HTLV-1 persistence. These observations imply that the clonal proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells in secondary lymphoid organs might be important for HTLV-1 persistence.","['Nitta, Takayuki', 'Tanaka, Masakazu', 'Sun, Binlian', 'Sugihara, Eiji', 'Kimura, Mako', 'Kamada, Yuhei', 'Takahashi, Hideto', 'Hanai, Shuji', 'Jiang, Shi-Wen', 'Fujisawa, Jun-ichi', 'Miwa, Masanao']","['Nitta T', 'Tanaka M', 'Sun B', 'Sugihara E', 'Kimura M', 'Kamada Y', 'Takahashi H', 'Hanai S', 'Jiang SW', 'Fujisawa J', 'Miwa M']","['Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennoudai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080227,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/*enzymology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/05/20 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS766 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00766.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 May;99(5):872-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00766.x.

Users are confronted with a multitude of classification methods of varying complexity that can be applied to this task. To help decide which method to use in a given situation, we compare important characteristics of a range of classification methods, including simple univariate filtering, penalised likelihood methods and the random forest. Classification accuracy is an important characteristic, but the biological interpretability of molecular profiles is also important. This implies both parsimony and stability, in the sense that profiles should not vary much when there are slight changes in the training data. We perform a random resampling study to compare these characteristics between the methods and across a range of profile sizes. We measure stability by adopting the Jaccard index to assess the similarity of resampled molecular profiles. We carry out a case study on five well-established cancer microarray data sets, for two of which we have the benefit of being able to validate the results in an independent data set. The study shows that those methods which produce parsimonious profiles generally result in better prediction accuracy than methods which don't include variable selection.

In approximately 85% of cancers telomerase is activated (TA) but in some tumours, in particular sarcomas, an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway is used. Liposarcomas are the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in adults and they activate ALT or telomerase with equal frequency, however no TMM has been identified in approximately 50% of liposarcomas. In our study, we have shown that instability at the minisatellite MS32, usually associated with ALT activation, aids the identification of liposarcomas that have recombination-like activity at telomeres in absence of ALT associated PML-bodies (APBs). Furthermore, using single molecule telomere analysis, we have detected complex telomere mutations directly in ALT positive liposarcomas and interestingly in some liposarcomas with an unknown TMM but high MS32 instability. We have shown by sequence analysis that some of these complex telomere mutations must arise by an inter-molecular recombination-like process rather than by deletion caused by t-loop excision or by unequal telomere-sister-chromatid-exchange (T-SCE), which is known to be elevated in ALT cell lines. Preliminary evidence also suggests that inter-molecular recombination events may be processed differently in liposarcomas with APBs compared to those without. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time, that some telomerase negative liposarcomas without APBs have other features associated with ALT, indicating that the incidence of ALT in these tumours has previously been under-estimated. This has major implications for the use of cancer treatments targeted at TMMs.","['Jeyapalan, Jennie N', 'Mendez-Bermudez, Aaron', 'Zaffaroni, Nadia', 'Dubrova, Yuri E', 'Royle, Nicola J']","['Jeyapalan JN', 'Mendez-Bermudez A', 'Zaffaroni N', 'Dubrova YE', 'Royle NJ']","['Department of Genetics, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Liposarcoma/enzymology/genetics/*ultrastructure', '*Microsatellite Instability', 'Minisatellite Repeats', '*Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23412 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Jun 1;122(11):2414-21. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23412.,,,['G0500336/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual treatment response may be influenced by copy number alterations (CNA) leading to altered gene expression. We aimed to evaluate CNA using high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) in different treatment-response groups. Leukemic genomic profiles of 25 standard risk (MRD-SR) and 25 high risk (MRD-HR) patients were compared. CNAs were found in 46/50 patients (92%). The most significant difference was a gain of 1q23-qter because of an unbalanced t(1;19), found in 10/25 MRD-SR patients, but in none of the MRD-HR patients (P < 0.001). The most frequent CNAs in the MRD-HR group were deletions of genomic regions harboring the immunoglobulin genes (Ig), e.g., 2p11.2 in 60% of MRD-HR compared to 28% of MRD-SR (P = 0.045). Combining all Ig loci, significantly more MRD-HR than MRD-SR patients displayed deletions (17:8 patients, P = 0.02). Frequency of other CNAs, such as loss of 9p21 or gains of 21q, did not differ strongly between the two patient groups. This is the first study evaluating the clinical significance of CNA as detected by array-CGH in childhood ALL and the first to suggest that such analyses may provide clinically important data.

B-cell CLL is the most common type of leukemia occurring in the US and Western nations. B-cell CLL is characterized by progressive defects in both cell-mediated and humoral-mediated immunity. B-lymphocyte defects, low gammaglobulin levels, and quantitative and functional T-cell defects have been documented in the setting of CLL. In concert with each other, they account for the increased susceptibility of the CLL patients to infectious agents. Moreover, several recent surveys have pointed out that CLL patients are at high risk of developing a large variety of second malignant neoplasms. Different therapeutic modalities used for CLL may further exacerbate immunosuppression by depleting both T- and B-immune effectors, thus favoring various infectious diseases and perhaps altering the immune surveillance. The occurrence of 2 or more second cancers is increasingly reported in the context of CLL. Increased awareness of this association is warranted. Future development of surveillance strategies may be needed for a growing population of surviving patients who are at risk for second nonlymphoid neoplasms.","['Dasanu, Constantin A', 'Alexandrescu, Doru T']","['Dasanu CA', 'Alexandrescu DT']",['c_dasanu@yahoo.com'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20071115,United States,MedGenMed,MedGenMed : Medscape general medicine,100894134,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/*immunology/therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*epidemiology/secondary', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Distribution', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology/secondary', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,epublish,MedGenMed. 2007 Nov 15;9(4):35.,58,PMC2234297,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To prevent the emerging of resistance resulting from its abuse, an optimal method and dosage are needed. In the field of hematological malignancies, LVFX is one of the choices for prophylaxis for febrile neutropenia (FN). There is no consensus about the optimal dosage and method among hematologists. Aims To determine the population pharmacological parameters based on the population pharmacokinetics of LVFX. We considered the optimal dosage and method of LVFX based on various simulations depicted by personal computer. METHODS: We performed population pharmacokinetic analysis for seven patients receiving LVFX as prophylaxis (200 mg, b.i.d.) for FN with blood sampling. One patient received 100 mg t.i.d. All patients were treated at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine. RESULTS: Clearance (CL) is 5.8 L/hr, distribution volume (Vd) is 58.5 L, area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC(0-24)) is 69.0 microg x hr/mL, t1/2 is 6.9 hr, Cmax is 3.4 microg/mL at administration of 200 mg b.i.d. Cmax (peak) of 500 mg, and q.d. is simulated as 8.54 microg/mL. CONCLUSION: For LVFX 500 mg q.d. is predicted to be the most effective dosage and method. Because the predicted Cmax value is similar to that of western countries, the frequency of adverse effects is thought to be same as in western countries. 500 mg, q.d., may also be an optimal dosage and method for Japanese.","['Nomura, Kenichi', 'Fujimoto, Yoshiko', 'Morimoto, Yasutaka', 'Kanbayashi, Yuko', 'Matsumoto, Yosuke', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi']","['Nomura K', 'Fujimoto Y', 'Morimoto Y', 'Kanbayashi Y', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Taniwaki M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science. nomuken@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20080303,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6GNT3Y5LMF (Levofloxacin)', 'A4P49JAZ9H (Ofloxacin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/complications', '*Levofloxacin', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications/drug therapy', 'Ofloxacin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pilot Projects']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/03/22 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/47.0582 [pii]', '10.2169/internalmedicine.47.0582 [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med. 2008;47(5):375-8. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.47.0582.

Cytotoxic potency against HL-60 was as follows; simvastatin (SV)>atorvastatin>cerivastatin>fluvastatin. Interestingly, HL-60-R2, an all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-resistant HL-60 variant, was twice as sensitive to SV than HL-60. Further studies revealed the particular mechanism of action of SV-induced apoptosis in leukemia. SV directly and rapidly disordered mitochondria with a loss of its membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and subsequent irreversible damage with cytochrome c leakage and, finally, SV induced apoptosis through caspase-9 activation, whereas several studies have shown that other statins induced apoptosis to leukemia by the depletion of isoprenoids used for the prenylation of small GTPases, which are essential for cellular signal transduction. Our findings suggest that the mitochondrial pathway plays an important role in the higher potency of SV as a new class of agents for anti-leukemic therapy alone and/or in combination with agents.","['Tomiyama, Naoki', 'Matzno, Sumio', 'Kitada, Chihiro', 'Nishiguchi, Eri', 'Okamura, Noboru', 'Matsuyama, Kenji']","['Tomiyama N', 'Matzno S', 'Kitada C', 'Nishiguchi E', 'Okamura N', 'Matsuyama K']","[""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mukogawa Women's University, 11-68 Koshien Kyuban-cho, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 663-8179, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Simvastatin/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/04/22 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/31.369 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.31.369 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2008 Mar;31(3):369-74. doi: 10.1248/bpb.31.369.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this cell line and the fluorescent probe JC-1, they developed a flow cytometry-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay that quantifies ABCB1 efflux. They screened a library of 880 off-patent drugs for their ability to inhibit ABCB1 efflux and then measured the ability of 11 lead compounds to reverse in vitro DNR-mediated drug resistance and the toxic doses for each agent. Seven of the 11 drugs were able to reverse drug resistance at a concentration significantly below its toxic dose.

Forty-three tumor samples were tested for genetic changes using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Among them, 39 samples were available for protein expression analysis by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All 43 patients (24 women and 19 men; mean age 44.6+/-13.6 years; range 18-75 years; 9 with malignant, 7 extra-adrenal, and 27 benign) showed multiple copy number losses or gains. The average copy number change was 13.10 in malignant, 13.93 in benign, and 13.47 in paraganglioma patients. There is no significant difference among the three groups of pheochromocytomas. However, we discovered that in the malignant pheochromocytomas, 6 of the 9 patients (67%) showed erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB-2) oncogene gain, whereas only 12 of the 34 (35%) identified change in the benign and extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. Further, IHC confirmed that ERBB-2-positive staining was more frequent and stronger in malignant pheochromocytomas than in benign and extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. Our study illustrates the chromosomal changes of the whole genome of Chinese pheochromocytoma patients. The results suggest that there may be certain progression of genetic events that involves chromosomes 1p, 3p, 6p, 11q, 12q, 17q, and 19q in the development of pheochromocytomas, and the activation of ERBB-2 located on chromosome 17q is an important and early event in the malignancy development of these tumor types. The overexpression of ERBB-2 identified by IHC suggested that this oncogene could be associated with the malignancy of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.","['Yuan, WenQi', 'Wang, WeiQinq', 'Cui, Bin', 'Su, TingWei', 'Ge, Yan', 'Jiang, Lei', 'Zhou, WeiWei', 'Ning, Guang']","['Yuan W', 'Wang W', 'Cui B', 'Su T', 'Ge Y', 'Jiang L', 'Zhou W', 'Ning G']","['Department of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, School of Medicine, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Endocr Relat Cancer,Endocrine-related cancer,9436481,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Gland Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/secondary', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Genes, erbB-2/*genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/secondary', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/secondary', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraganglioma/*genetics/pathology', 'Pheochromocytoma/*classification/*genetics/secondary', 'Prognosis']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['15/1/343 [pii]', '10.1677/ERC-07-0188 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Relat Cancer. 2008 Mar;15(1):343-50. doi: 10.1677/ERC-07-0188.,,PMC2254511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent report found an association between the use of dexrazoxane and the risk of developing secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in children with Hodgkin's disease. We report the absence of an association of SMNs in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 95-01. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred five children with high-risk (HR) ALL were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin alone (n = 100) or doxorubicin with dexrazoxane (n = 105) during the induction and intensification phases of multiagent chemotherapy. We compared incidence of SMNs in these two groups. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6.2 years, no differences in the incidence of SMNs were noted between the group that received dexrazoxane and the group that did not (P = .66). One SMN (a melanoma located outside of the cranial radiation field) occurred in a patient who was randomly assigned to doxorubicin alone. No SMNs were observed in patients randomly assigned to receive dexrazoxane. CONCLUSION: Dexrazoxane was not associated with an increased risk of SMNs in children treated for HR ALL. Given the potential importance of dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant, we recommend that dexrazoxane continue to be used and studied in doxorubicin-containing pediatric regimens.","['Barry, Elly V', 'Vrooman, Lynda M', 'Dahlberg, Suzanne E', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Athale, Uma H', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Larsen, Eric C', 'Moghrabi, Albert', 'Samson, Yvan', 'Schorin, Marshall A', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B']","['Barry EV', 'Vrooman LM', 'Dahlberg SE', 'Neuberg DS', 'Asselin BL', 'Athale UH', 'Clavell LA', 'Larsen EC', 'Moghrabi A', 'Samson Y', 'Schorin MA', 'Cohen HJ', 'Lipshultz SE', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB']","['Departments of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115, USA. elly_barry@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Razoxane/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/7/1106 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.12.2481 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Mar 1;26(7):1106-11. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.12.2481.,,,['CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with relapsed/refractory leukemias (n = 24, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and n = 11, T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia) were entered onto three different protocols. For schedule A, patient received nelarabine daily for 5 days, whereas for schedule B, nelarabine was administered on days 1, 3, and 5. Schedule C was similar to schedule B except that fludarabine was also infused. Plasma and cellular pharmacokinetics were studied during the first cycle. RESULTS: Responses were achieved in 20%, 15%, and 63% of patients receiving schedule A, B, and C, respectively. Histologic category, number of prior therapies, and fludarabine refractoriness did not influence the response rate. The most common nonhematologic toxicity was peripheral neuropathy. Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia complicated 23% and 26% of courses respectively, and were significantly more frequent among patients with pre-existing marrow failure. Pharmacokinetics of plasma nelarabine and arabinosylguanine (ara-G) and of cellular ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP) were similar in the two groups of diagnoses, and the elimination of ara-GTP from leukemia cells was slow (median, > 24 hours). The median peak intracellular concentrations of ara-GTP were significantly different (P = .0003) between responders (440 micromol/L; range, 35 to 1,438 micromol/L; n = 10) and nonresponders (50 micromol/L; range, 22 to 178 micromol/L; n = 15). CONCLUSION: Nelarabine is an effective regimen against indolent leukemias, and combining it with fludarabine was most promising. Determination of tumor cell ara-GTP levels may provide a predictive test for response to nelarabine.","['Gandhi, Varsha', 'Tam, Constantine', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Jewell, Roxanne C', 'Rodriguez, Carlos O Jr', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Plunkett, William', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Gandhi V', 'Tam C', ""O'Brien S"", 'Jewell RC', 'Rodriguez CO Jr', 'Lerner S', 'Plunkett W', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Box 71, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA. vgandhi@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)', ""72490-81-4 (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanosine 5'-triphosphate)"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleotides/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2008/03/04 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2008/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/7/1098 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.14.1986 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Mar 1;26(7):1098-105. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.1986.,,,"['CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, ABT-737 also induces mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilization (MIMP) resulting in mitochondrial matrix swelling and rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), so permitting the rapid efflux of cytochrome c from mitochondrial cristae and facilitating rapid caspase activation and apoptosis. BAX and BAK appear to be involved in the OMM discontinuities as they localize to the OMM break points. Notably, ABT-737 induced mitochondrial matrix swelling and OMM discontinuities in other primary B-cell malignancies, including mantle cell, follicular and marginal zone lymphoma cells but not in several cell lines studied. Thus, we describe a new paradigm of apoptosis in primary B-cell malignancies, whereby targeting of BCL2 results in all the classical features of apoptosis together with OMM rupture independent of caspase activation. This mechanism may be far more prevalent than hitherto recognized due to the failure of most methods, used to measure apoptosis, to recognize such a mechanism.","['Vogler, M', 'Dinsdale, D', 'Sun, X-M', 'Young, K W', 'Butterworth, M', 'Nicotera, P', 'Dyer, M J S', 'Cohen, G M']","['Vogler M', 'Dinsdale D', 'Sun XM', 'Young KW', 'Butterworth M', 'Nicotera P', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080229,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2008/03/01 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/03/01 09:00'],"['2008/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['cdd200825 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2008.25 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2008 May;15(5):820-30. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2008.25.

Our major goal was to determine a guideline for the detection of minimal residual disease using CD20+/CD34+ and myeloid Ag+/CD19+ combination in the bone marrow of acute leukemia in complete remission (CR) after chemotherapy. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 117 patients with acute leukemia in complete remission after chemotherapy and from 22 healthy controls were immunophenotyped by triple staining and measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The CD20+/CD34+ cells in the large lymphocyte gate (R1) ranged from 0% to 3.% (0.8plusmn;0.82%, P=0.000) in CD20+/CD34+ B-lineage ALL CR (N=31), from 0.03% to 4.2% (0.7plusmn;0.83%, P=0.000) in CD20-/CD34- B-lineage ALL CR (N=66), from 0.1% to 0.96% (0.45plusmn;0.32%, P=0.016) in T-ALL CR (N=10), and from 0.02% to 0.48% (0.18plusmn;0.15%, P=0.776) in AML CR (N=10). The CD13,33+/CD19+ cells in R1 gate ranged from 0% to 2.69% (0.37plusmn;0.48%, P<0.001) in CD13,33+/CD19+ B-lineage ALL CR (N=31), from 0% to 1.8% (0.31plusmn;0.28%, P<0.001) in CD13,33-/CD19+B-lineage ALL CR (N=65), from 0.02% to 0.64% (0.29plusmn;0.22%, P=0.071) in T-ALL CR (N=9), and from 0% to 0.17% (0.07plusmn;0.09%, P=0.341) in AML CR (N=3). CONCLUSIONS: Using an immunophenotypic method for the detection of early relapse or minimal residual disease of B-lineage ALL bone marrow in CR after chemotherapy, different cutoff values should be applied according to antigen combination and gating. When the proportion of aberrant antigen combination was less than 5% in large lymphocyte gate, the results should be interpreted with caution.","['Shin, Soyoung', 'Kahng, Jimin', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Lim, Jihyang', 'Kim, Younggoo', 'Han, Kyungja']","['Shin S', 'Kahng J', 'Kim M', 'Lim J', 'Kim Y', 'Han K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*classification/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Remission Induction']",2008/03/01 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/03/01 09:00'],"['2008/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['200801001 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2008.28.1.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2008 Feb;28(1):1-7. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2008.28.1.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within this subgroup, presence of FLT3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3) internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation predicts less favorable outcome. The goal of our study was to discover gene-expression patterns correlated with FLT3-ITD mutation and to evaluate the utility of a FLT3 signature for prognostication. DNA microarrays were used to profile gene expression in a training set of 65 NK-AML cases, and supervised analysis, using the Prediction Analysis of Microarrays method, was applied to build a gene expression-based predictor of FLT3-ITD mutation status. The optimal predictor, composed of 20 genes, was then evaluated by classifying expression profiles from an independent test set of 72 NK-AML cases. The predictor exhibited modest performance (73% sensitivity; 85% specificity) in classifying FLT3-ITD status. Remarkably, however, the signature outperformed FLT3-ITD mutation status in predicting clinical outcome. The signature may better define clinically relevant FLT3 signaling and/or alternative changes that phenocopy FLT3-ITD, whereas the signature genes provide a starting point to dissect these pathways. Our findings support the potential clinical utility of a gene expression-based measure of FLT3 pathway activation in AML.","['Bullinger, Lars', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Kranz, Raphael', 'Stirner, Christoph', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Scholl, Claudia', 'Kim, Young H', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Tibshirani, Robert', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Pollack, Jonathan R']","['Bullinger L', 'Dohner K', 'Kranz R', 'Stirner C', 'Frohling S', 'Scholl C', 'Kim YH', 'Schlenk RF', 'Tibshirani R', 'Dohner H', 'Pollack JR']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080228,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)'],IM,"['*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2008/03/01 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/03/01 09:00'],"['2008/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41136-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-115055 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 1;111(9):4490-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-115055.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs of 19-25 nucleotides in length that have been linked to the development of cancer. Here, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the biology of NPMc+ AML. The miRNA expression was evaluated in 85 adult de novo AML patients characterized for subcellular localization/mutation status of NPM1 and FLT3 mutations using a custom microarray platform. Data were analyzed by using univariate t test within BRB tools. We identified a strong miRNA signature that distinguishes NPMc+ mutated (n = 55) from the cytoplasmic-negative (NPM1 unmutated) cases (n = 30) and includes the up-regulation of miR-10a, miR-10b, several let-7 and miR-29 family members. Many of the down-regulated miRNAs including miR-204 and miR-128a are predicted to target several HOX genes. Indeed, we confirmed that miR-204 targets HOXA10 and MEIS1, suggesting that the HOX up-regulation observed in NPMc+ AML may be due in part by loss of HOX regulators-miRNAs. FLT3-ITD+ samples were characterized by up-regulation of miR-155. Further experiments demonstrated that the up-regulation of miR-155 was independent from FLT3 signaling. Our results identify a unique miRNA signature associated with NPMc+ AML and provide evidence that support a role for miRNAs in the regulation of HOX genes in this leukemia subtype. Moreover, we found that miR-155 was strongly but independently associated with FLT3-ITD mutations.","['Garzon, Ramiro', 'Garofalo, Michela', 'Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Briesewitz, Roger', 'Wang, Lisheng', 'Fernandez-Cymering, Cecilia', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Liu, Chang-Gong', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Liso, Arcangelo', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Mancini, Marco', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Foa, Robin', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Falini, Brunangelo']","['Garzon R', 'Garofalo M', 'Martelli MP', 'Briesewitz R', 'Wang L', 'Fernandez-Cymering C', 'Volinia S', 'Liu CG', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T', 'Liso A', 'Diverio D', 'Mancini M', 'Meloni G', 'Foa R', 'Martelli MF', 'Mecucci C', 'Croce CM', 'Falini B']","['Departments of Medicine and Molecular Virology and Human Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, and College of Pharmacology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43221, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080228,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Mutant Proteins/*genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/metabolism']",2008/03/01 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2008/03/01 09:00'],"['2008/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['0800135105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0800135105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Mar 11;105(10):3945-50. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0800135105.

EMS are rare, destructive, extramedullary tumor masses that consist of immature leukemia cells. These tumors can occur anywhere in the body and have to be differentiated from lymphoma, carcinoma or infectious processes. We report a previously healthy 61-year-old male who presented with progressive left-sided hip pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left hip joint revealed an extensive lytic lesion with pathological fracture of the femur. The lesion was confirmed by biopsy to be EMS with bcr-abl rearrangement in tumor cell nuclei by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Laboratory tests showed normal metabolic and complete blood counts with normal differential. Peripheral blood RT-PCR for bcr-abl was negative. Bone marrow examination revealed a normocellular with progressive trilineage hematopoiesis and no evidence of increased blast count. On the basis of available literature for the treatment of EMS, our patient received standard AML induction chemotherapy consisting of idarabucin and cytarabine.

Because cranial irradiation can cause many acute and late complications (eg, second cancers, neurocognitive deficits, endocrine disorders, and growth impairment), it has been largely replaced by intensive intrathecal treatment and systemic chemotherapy. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (12-18 Gy) is given to 2-20% of patients with ALL who have an increased risk of CNS relapse (such as T-cell immunophenotype, overt CNS disease, high-risk cytogenetic features, or poor response to remission induction treatment), and for the estimated 2% of patients with AML who have overt CNS disease at diagnosis. Although this strategy restricts CNS relapse to 3-8% of patients, several challenges remain. Methods need to eliminate relapse without the use of cranial irradiation in very high-risk patients. Effective retrieval treatment is needed for patients with relapsed or refractory CNS leukaemia, and intrathecal treatment with improved efficacy and reduced side-effects remains a long-term objective. Perhaps the most formidable challenge is to treat children with CNS relapse after a short initial remission or cranial irradiation.","['Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Howard, Scott C']","['Pui CH', 'Howard SC']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38015-2794, USA. ching-hon.pui@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

We aimed to assess whether an intensive chemotherapy protocol that had a 10-day interval between treatments would improve event-free survival (EFS) in patients aged 1 year or over with high-risk neuroblastoma. METHODS: Between Oct 30, 1990, and March 18, 1999, patients with stage 4 neuroblastoma who had not received previous chemotherapy were enrolled from 29 centres in Europe. Patients were randomly assigned to rapid treatment (cisplatin [C], vincristine [O], carboplatin [J], etoposide [E], and cyclophosphamide [C], known as COJEC) or standard treatment (vincristine [O], cisplatin [P], etoposide [E], and cyclophosphamide [C], ie, OPEC, alternated with vincristine [O], carboplatin [J], etoposide [E], and cyclophosphamide [C], ie, OJEC). Both regimens used the same total cumulative doses of each drug (except vincristine), but the dose intensity of the rapid regimen was 1.8-times higher than that of the standard regimen. The standard regimen was given every 21 days if patients showed haematological recovery, whereas the rapid regimen was given every 10 days irrespective of haematological recovery. Response to chemotherapy was assessed according to the conventional International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC). In responders, surgical excision of the primary tumour was attempted, followed by myeloablation (with 200 mg/m2 of melphalan) and haemopoietic stem-cell rescue. Primary endpoints were 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year EFS. Data were analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered on the clinical trials site of the US National Cancer Institute website, number NCT00365755, and also as EU-20592 and CCLG-NB-1990-11. FINDINGS: 262 patients, of median age 2.95 years (range 1.03-20.97), were randomly assigned-132 patients to standard and 130 patients to rapid treatment. 111 patients in the standard group and 109 patients in the rapid group completed chemotherapy. Chemotherapy doses were recorded for 123 patients in the standard group and 126 patients in the rapid group. 97 of 123 (79%) patients in the standard group and 84 of 126 (67%) patients in the rapid group received at least 90% of the scheduled chemotherapy, and the relative dose intensity was 1.94 compared with the standard regimen. 3-year EFS was 24.2% for patients in the standard group and 31.0% for those in the rapid group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.66-1.14], p=0.30. 5-year EFS was 18.2% in the standard group and 30.2% in the rapid group, representing a difference of 12.0% (1.8 to 22.3), p=0.022. 10-year EFS was 18.2% in the standard group and 27.1% in the rapid group, representing a difference of 8.9% (-1.2 to 19.0), p=0.085. Myeloablation was given a median of 55 days earlier in patients assigned rapid treatment than those assigned standard treatment. Infective complications (numbers of patients with febrile neutropenia and septicaemia, and if given, time on antibiotic and antifungal treatment) and time in hospital were greater with rapid treatment. Occurrence of fungal infection was the same in both regimens. INTERPRETATION: Dose intensity can be increased with a rapid induction regimen in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. There was no significant difference in OS between the rapid and standard regimens at 5 years and 10 years. However, an increasing difference in EFS after 3 years suggests that the efficacy of the rapid regimen is better than the standard regimen. A rapid induction regimen enables myeloablation to be given much earlier, which might contribute to a better outcome.","['Pearson, Andrew D J', 'Pinkerton, C Ross', 'Lewis, Ian J', 'Imeson, John', 'Ellershaw, Caroline', 'Machin, David']","['Pearson AD', 'Pinkerton CR', 'Lewis IJ', 'Imeson J', 'Ellershaw C', 'Machin D']","[""Children's Department, Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, UK. andrew.pearson@icr.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

A subset of HES patients presents an interstitial deletion in chromosome 4q12, which leads to the expression of an imatinib-responsive fusion gene, FIP1L1-PDGFRA. These patients are diagnosed as chronic eosinophilic leukaemia (CEL). We treated seven CEL and HES patients, six of which expressed FIP1L1-PDGFRA, with imatinib using initial daily doses ranging from 100 to 400 mg. In a remission maintenance phase, the patients were treated with imatinib once weekly. All imatinib-treated patients achieved a complete haematological remission (CHR), and five of the six patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA expression exhibited molecular remission. The decreased imatinib doses were as follows: 200 mg/week in three patients, 100 mg/week in two patients and 100 mg/d in the remaining two patients. For remission maintenance, imatinib doses were set at 100 mg/week in five patients and 200 mg/week in two patients. At a median follow-up of 30 months all patients remained in CHR and FIP1L1-PDGFRA expression was undetectable in five of the six FIP1L1-PDGFRA-expressing patients.

How genetic material from circulating cells is acquired by solid-organ tissue cells is debated. The purpose of this study was to provide clinical evidence for cell fusion between circulating cells and solid-organ tissue cells. MATERIAL & METHODS: The clinical model was a male-into-female blood stem cell transplantation setting using the Y-chromosome as a blood-derived cell marker and the patient's BCR/ABL fusion gene. Endometrial cells were chosen as the target cells because of their uniquely female genotype. RESULTS: The Y-chromosome and the BCR/ABL fusion gene were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization and were colocalized with estrogen receptor-staining endometrial cells. Both donor-derived Y-chromosome and patient-derived fusion gene were identified in the same endometrial cells, thereby indicating cell fusion as the mechanism for genetic material transfer in a clinical setting. CONCLUSION: These findings contribute to our understanding of how blood-derived cells interact with solid-organ tissue cells.","['Korbling, Martin', 'de Lima, Marcos J', 'Thomas, Elizabeth', 'Khanna, Abha', 'Najjar, Amer M', 'Gu, Jun', 'Gelovani, Juri G', 'Broaddus, Russell']","['Korbling M', 'de Lima MJ', 'Thomas E', 'Khanna A', 'Najjar AM', 'Gu J', 'Gelovani JG', 'Broaddus R']","['University of Texas, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Unit 423, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA. mkorblin@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Regen Med,Regenerative medicine,101278116,,IM,"['Adult', '*Cell Fusion', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', '*Models, Biological', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2008/03/01 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2008/03/01 09:00'],"['2008/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/17460751.3.2.157 [doi]'],ppublish,Regen Med. 2008 Mar;3(2):157-64. doi: 10.2217/17460751.3.2.157.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

V gamma 9 V delta 2 T cells expanded in the presence of Zoledronate and IL-2 express CD16 (Fc gamma RIII), which raises the possibility that V gamma 9 V delta 2 T cells could be used in conjunction with tumor targeting monoclonal antibody drugs to increase antitumor cytotoxicity by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Cytotoxic activity against CD20-positive B lineage lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and HER2-positive breast cancer cells was assessed in the presence of rituximab and trastuzumab, respectively. Cytotoxicity of V gamma 9 V delta 2 T cells against CD20-positive targets was higher when used in combination with rituximab. Similarly, V gamma 9 V delta 2 T cells used in combination with trastuzumab resulted in greater cytotoxicity against HER2-positive cells in comparison with either agent alone and this effect was restricted to the CD16(+)V gamma 9 V delta 2 T cell population. Our results show that CD16(+)V gamma 9 V delta 2 T cells recognize monoclonal antibody coated tumor cells via CD16 and exert ADCC similar to that observed with NK cells, even when target cells are relatively resistant to monoclonal antibodies or V gamma 9 V delta 2 T cells alone. Combination therapy involving ex vivo expanded CD16(+)V gamma 9 V delta 2 T cells and monoclonal antibodies may enhance the clinical outcomes for patients treated with monoclonal antibody therapy.","['Tokuyama, Hirotake', 'Hagi, Tomomi', 'Mattarollo, Stephen R', 'Morley, Jacqueline', 'Wang, Qiao', 'So, Hang-Fai', 'Moriyasu, Fuminori', 'Nieda, Mie', 'Nicol, Andrew J']","['Tokuyama H', 'Hagi T', 'Mattarollo SR', 'Morley J', 'Wang Q', 'So HF', 'Moriyasu F', 'Nieda M', 'Nicol AJ']","['Centre for Immune and Targeted Therapy, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Perforin/metabolism', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*analysis', '*Receptors, IgG/immunology', 'Rituximab', '*T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Trastuzumab', 'U937 Cells']",2008/03/01 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/03/01 09:00'],"['2008/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23365 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Jun 1;122(11):2526-34. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23365.,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,"['Int J Cancer. 2011 Dec 1;129(11):2761.

Because induction therapy did not achieve complete remission for this man, we initiated re-induction therapy with enocitabin and daunomycin. Seven days after chemotherapy, the patient experienced a catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) due to methicilin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). When treatment with albekacin and fosfomycin was in effective, linezolid was administrated intravenously and he became afebrile. On day 8 after linezolid administration, however, he reported general fatigue and slight consciousness disturbance. His serum sodium concentration was 119 mEq/L and his urinary sodium excretion rose to 143 mEq/day, although intravenous sodium intake was 98 mEq/day. Because of the sufficiency of urine volume and weight loss, we surmise that inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) syndrome was unlikely. We diagnosed renal salt wasting syndrome (RSWS) based on calculation of the amount of sodium intake and the amount of sodium excreted from the kidneys. After linezolid was discontinued and aggressive treatment with sodium supplement begun, his consciousness cleared as his low serum sodium level rose. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first case reported on the development of RSWS after linezolid treatment.

We report here a case of a 38-year-old man with inv(16) acute myeloid leukemia (AML, M2) who suffered a central nervous system (CNS) relapse after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor. After complete remission was achieved by chemotherapy, he received allogeneic BMT from his HLA-matched sister. His leukemia relapsed in the CNS 2.5 years after the allogeneic BMT. Lumbar puncture revealed 780/muL white blood cells with 67.3% leukemia cells and 32.7% mature lymphocytes. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe for the Y chromosome demonstrated that both leukemia cells and lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were derived from the recipient, although the bone marrow cells were from the donor. No leukemia cells with inv(16) were detected by FISH in the bone marrow. This is the first report to clarify the chimerism of lymphocytes in the CSF of patients with isolated EMR in the CNS after allogeneic SCT, in which analysis revealed that autologous immunologic cells rather than donor lymphocytes responded to the recurrent isolated leukemic cells in CNS. This observation suggests that the CNS is a ""sanctuary"" site not only from chemotherapy but also from the graft-versus-leukemia effect.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with biopsy-proven, clinical stage III breast cancer and adequate organ function were eligible. Neoadjuvant doxorubicin (30 mg/m(2) days 1-3, every 28 days for 4 cycles) was followed by mastectomy, in stable or responding patients. Sixteen weeks of postoperative CMF followed (continuous oral cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day); methotrexate (0.7 mg/kg IV) and fluorouracil (12 mg/kg IV) weekly, weeks 1-8, and than biweekly, weeks 9-16). Radiation therapy followed adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Clinical response rate was 71% (79/111, 95% CI = 62-79%), with 19% complete clinical response. Pathologic complete response was 5% (95% CI = 2-11%). Median follow-up is 15.6 years. Half of the patients progressed by 2.2 years; half died by 5.4 years (range 6 months-15 years). The hazard of dying was greatest in the first 5 years after diagnosis and declined thereafter. Time to progression and overall survival were predicted by number of pathologically involved lymph nodes (TTP: HR [10 vs. 1 node] 2.40, 95% CI = 1.63-3.53, P < 0.0001; OS: HR 2.50, 95% CI = 1.74-3.58, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: After multimodality treatment for locally advanced breast cancer, long-term survival was correlated with the number of pathologically positive lymph nodes, but not to clinical response. The hazard of death was highest during the first 5 years after diagnosis and declined thereafter, indicating a possible intermediate endpoint for future trials of neoadjuvant treatment.","['Kimmick, G G', 'Cirrincione, C', 'Duggan, D B', 'Bhalla, K', 'Robert, N', 'Berry, D', 'Norton, L', 'Lemke, S', 'Henderson, I C', 'Hudis, C', 'Winer, E']","['Kimmick GG', 'Cirrincione C', 'Duggan DB', 'Bhalla K', 'Robert N', 'Berry D', 'Norton L', 'Lemke S', 'Henderson IC', 'Hudis C', 'Winer E']","['Duke University Medical Center, Duke South, Durham, NC 27710, USA. gretchen.kimmick@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080228,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CMF regimen']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Mastectomy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/02/29 09:00,2009/02/12 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10549-008-9943-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2009 Feb;113(3):479-90. doi: 10.1007/s10549-008-9943-2.

Patients with this syndrome usually present with severe leg pain. This case report demonstrates the successful pain control of this pain syndrome in a 42-year-old female patient who had been given CIs (FK and CSP) as an immunosuppressive agent after a bone marrow transplant. Twenty-one days after the transplantation, she complained of severe pain in her bilateral lower extremities; this lasted several weeks, and was resistant to ordinary analgesics such as intramuscular pentazocine, intravenous morphine, and even oral nifedipine, which is generally accepted as an effective analgesic agent for the pain in this syndrome. Due to the presence of allodynia, our patient's pain had neuropathic pain-like characteristics, unlike the pain in previously reported patients with other organ transplants. Her pain was successfully relieved by the administration of oral amytriptyline, clonazepam, oxycodone, and intravenous lidocaine, all of which ordinarily have an analgesic effect on neuropathic pain. CIPS in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplants treated with FK may have a mechanism by which neuropathic pain may develop that is different from that in patients with other organ transplants.","['Noda, Yukiko', 'Kodama, Kenji', 'Yasuda, Tetsujiro', 'Takahashi, Shosuke']","['Noda Y', 'Kodama K', 'Yasuda T', 'Takahashi S']","['Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20080227,Japan,J Anesth,Journal of anesthesia,8905667,"['0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Calcineurin Inhibitors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Leg/physiopathology', 'Pain/*chemically induced', 'Pain Management', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Syndrome', 'Tacrolimus/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/05/15 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2007/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00540-007-0574-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Anesth. 2008;22(1):61-3. doi: 10.1007/s00540-007-0574-2.

ALL IC stratification comprises the response to prednisone, bone marrow (BM) morphology at days 15 and 33, age, WBC and BCR/ABL or MLL/AF4 presence. Here, we compared this stratification to the MRD-based criteria using MRD evaluation in 163 patients from four ALL IC member countries at days 8, 15 and 33 and week 12. MRD negativity at day 33 was associated with an age of 1-5 years, WBC<20,000 microl(-1), non-T immunophenotype, good prednisone response and non-M3 morphology at day 15. There were no significant associations with gender or hyperdiploidy in the study group, or with TEL/AML1 fusion within BCP-ALL. Patients with M1/2 BM at day 8 tended to be MRD negative at week 12. Patients stratified into the standard-risk group had a better response than intermediate-risk group patients. However, 34% of them were MRD positive at day 33 and/or week 12. Our findings revealed that morphology-based ALL IC risk-group stratification allows the identification of most MRD high-risk patients, but fails to discriminate the MRD low-risk group assigned to therapy reduction.","['Fronkova, E', 'Mejstrikova, E', 'Avigad, S', 'Chik, K W', 'Castillo, L', 'Manor, S', 'Reznickova, L', 'Valova, T', 'Zdrahalova, K', 'Hrusak, O', 'Jabali, Y', 'Schrappe, M', 'Conter, V', 'Izraeli, S', 'Li, C K', 'Stark, B', 'Stary, J', 'Trka, J']","['Fronkova E', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Avigad S', 'Chik KW', 'Castillo L', 'Manor S', 'Reznickova L', 'Valova T', 'Zdrahalova K', 'Hrusak O', 'Jabali Y', 'Schrappe M', 'Conter V', 'Izraeli S', 'Li CK', 'Stark B', 'Stary J', 'Trka J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, CLIP, Second Medical School, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080228,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Cell Shape', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200822 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.22 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 May;22(5):989-97. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.22.

Niches facilitate the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as unipotent, while supporting lineage commitment of the expanding blood populations. As the physical locale that regulates HSC function, the niche function is vitally important to the survival of the organism. This places considerable selective pressure on HSCs, as only those that are able to engage the niche in the appropriate context are likely to be maintained as stem cells. Since niches are central regulators of stem cell function, it is not surprising that molecular parasites like neoplasms are likely to seek out opportunities to harvest resources from the niche environment. As such, the niche may unwittingly participate in tumorigenesis as a leukemic or neoplastic niche. The niche may also promote metastasis or chemo-resistance of hematogenous neoplasms or solid tumors. This review focuses on what is known about the physical structures of the niche, how the niche participates in hematopoiesis and neoplastic growth and what molecules are involved. Further understanding of the interactions between stem cells and the niche may be useful for developing therapeutic strategies.","['Shiozawa, Y', 'Havens, A M', 'Pienta, K J', 'Taichman, R S']","['Shiozawa Y', 'Havens AM', 'Pienta KJ', 'Taichman RS']","['Department of Periodontics and Oral Medicine, University of Michigan School of Dentistry, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1078, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20080228,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200848 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.48 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 May;22(5):941-50. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.48.

However, the precise mechanisms by which NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in specific cancer cells remain largely unknown. In our current study, we now report that NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) is overexpressed at the pretranslational level in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells (H-RS) that do not express viral regulatory proteins. The overexpression of NIK causes cell transformation in rat fibroblasts, which is abolished by a super-repressor form of IkappaBalpha. Notably, depletion of NIK in ATL cells by RNA interference reduces the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity, and efficiently suppresses tumor growth in NOD/SCID/gammac(null) mice. These results indicate that the deregulated expression of NIK plays a critical role in constitutive NF-kappaB activation in ATL and H-RS cells, and suggest also that NIK is an attractive molecular target for cancer therapy.","['Saitoh, Yasunori', 'Yamamoto, Norio', 'Dewan, M Zahidunnabi', 'Sugimoto, Haruyo', 'Martinez Bruyn, Vicente J', 'Iwasaki, Yuki', 'Matsubara, Katsuyoshi', 'Qi, Xiaohua', 'Saitoh, Tatsuya', 'Imoto, Issei', 'Inazawa, Johji', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Yamamoto, Naoki', 'Yamaoka, Shoji']","['Saitoh Y', 'Yamamoto N', 'Dewan MZ', 'Sugimoto H', 'Martinez Bruyn VJ', 'Iwasaki Y', 'Matsubara K', 'Qi X', 'Saitoh T', 'Imoto I', 'Inazawa J', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Watanabe T', 'Masuda T', 'Yamamoto N', 'Yamaoka S']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080227,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hodgkin Disease/*etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/enzymology/pathology']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)47198-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-110635 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 15;111(10):5118-29. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-110635.

While proteasome inhibitors stabilize p27(Kip1), agents inhibiting SCF(Skp2) may represent more directly targeted drugs with the promise of enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity. Using high-throughput screening, we identified Compound A (CpdA), which interfered with SCF(Skp2) ligase function in vitro, and induced specific accumulation of p21 and other SCF(Skp2) substrates in cells without activating a heat-shock protein response. CpdA prevented incorporation of Skp2 into the SCF(Skp2) ligase, and induced G(1)/S cell-cycle arrest as well as SCF(Skp2)- and p27-dependent cell killing. This programmed cell death was caspase-independent, and instead occurred through activation of autophagy. In models of multiple myeloma, CpdA overcame resistance to dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and melphalan, as well as to bortezomib, and also acted synergistically with this proteasome inhibitor. Importantly, CpdA was active against patient-derived plasma cells and both myeloid and lymphoblastoid leukemia blasts, and showed preferential activity against neoplastic cells while relatively sparing other marrow components. These findings provide a rational framework for further development of SCF(Skp2) inhibitors as a novel class of antitumor agents.","['Chen, Qing', 'Xie, Weilin', 'Kuhn, Deborah J', 'Voorhees, Peter M', 'Lopez-Girona, Antonia', 'Mendy, Derek', 'Corral, Laura G', 'Krenitsky, Veronique Plantevin', 'Xu, Weiming', 'Moutouh-de Parseval, Laure', 'Webb, David R', 'Mercurio, Frank', 'Nakayama, Keiichi I', 'Nakayama, Keiko', 'Orlowski, Robert Z']","['Chen Q', 'Xie W', 'Kuhn DJ', 'Voorhees PM', 'Lopez-Girona A', 'Mendy D', 'Corral LG', 'Krenitsky VP', 'Xu W', 'Moutouh-de Parseval L', 'Webb DR', 'Mercurio F', 'Nakayama KI', 'Nakayama K', 'Orlowski RZ']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080227,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Autophagy', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*physiology', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41159-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-112904 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 1;111(9):4690-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-112904.

Therefore, new treatment regimens are necessary to prevent relapse and improve therapeutic outcomes. Previous studies have shown that the sesquiterpene lactone, parthenolide (PTL), ablates bulk, progenitor, and stem AML cells while causing no appreciable toxicity to normal hematopoietic cells. Thus, PTL must evoke cellular responses capable of mediating AML selective cell death. Given recent advances in chemical genomics such as gene expression-based high-throughput screening (GE-HTS) and the Connectivity Map, we hypothesized that the gene expression signature resulting from treatment of primary AML with PTL could be used to search for similar signatures in publicly available gene expression profiles deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We therefore devised a broad in silico screen of the GEO database using the PTL gene expression signature as a template and discovered 2 new agents, celastrol and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, that effectively eradicate AML at the bulk, progenitor, and stem cell level. These findings suggest the use of multicenter collections of high-throughput data to facilitate discovery of leukemia drugs and drug targets.","['Hassane, Duane C', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Corbett, Cheryl', 'Li, Xiaojie', 'Abboud, Ramzi', 'Young, Fay', 'Liesveld, Jane L', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Hassane DC', 'Guzman ML', 'Corbett C', 'Li X', 'Abboud R', 'Young F', 'Liesveld JL', 'Carroll M', 'Jordan CT']","['James P.

We evaluated these physical characteristics in FLT3/ITD-positive patients who were treated on CCG-2941/2961 and correlated them with clinical outcome. Fiftynine of 77 FLT3/ITD-positive patients (77%) had a single ITD, 16 (21%) had 2 ITDs, and 2 (3%) had 3 ITDs. The length of the duplicated region varied from 6 to 51 amino acids, and in all cases amino acid residues Y591-Y597 were duplicated. Structural analysis demonstrated that Y591-Y597 encodes the switch and zipper regions of the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3. In addition, 24 of 77 patients (31%) had duplication of the critical STAT5 docking sites Y589/591. Patients with longer ITDs had a worse relapse-free survival (19% vs 51%, P = .035), while the presence of more than 1 ITD was not clinically significant. Physical characteristics including the length of FLT3/ITD may influence FLT3 activation state by altering its structure and may impact response to therapy.","['Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Stirewalt, Derek L', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Boggon, Titus J', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Rocnik, Jennifer L', 'Lange, Beverly J', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Meshinchi S', 'Stirewalt DL', 'Alonzo TA', 'Boggon TJ', 'Gerbing RB', 'Rocnik JL', 'Lange BJ', 'Gilliland DG', 'Radich JP']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, USA. smeshinc@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080227,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Binding Sites', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*chemistry/*genetics']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)47175-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-117770 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 15;111(10):4930-3. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-117770.

Alemtuzumab was initially approved in 2001 under accelerated approval regulations. Conversion to regular approval was based on a single study submitted to verify clinical benefit. Efficacy and safety were demonstrated in an open-label, international, multicenter, randomized trial of 297 patients with previously untreated, Rai stage I-IV B-CLL experiencing progression of their disease. Patients were randomized to either alemtuzumab, 30 mg i.v. over 2 hours three times per week on alternate days for a maximum of 12 weeks, or chlorambucil, 40 mg/m(2) orally every 28 days for a maximum of 12 months. The progression-free survival time, the primary study endpoint, was significantly longer in the alemtuzumab arm than in the chlorambucil arm. Both the overall and complete response rates were also significantly higher in the alemtuzumab arm. No differences in survival were observed. There were no new safety signals identified in patients receiving alemtuzumab. The most serious, and sometimes fatal, toxicities of alemtuzumab are cytopenias, infusion reactions, and infections.","['Demko, Suzanne', 'Summers, Jeffrey', 'Keegan, Patricia', 'Pazdur, Richard']","['Demko S', 'Summers J', 'Keegan P', 'Pazdur R']","['P.A.-C., U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland 20993, USA. suzanne.demko@fda.hhs.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Approval', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/2/167 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2007-0218 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2008 Feb;13(2):167-74. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2007-0218.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accepted justification for permitting minor siblings to donate bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells is that the donor will benefit because of the greater likelihood of survival and less suffering of the sibling. Based on the limited data from four small retrospective studies of the risks and benefits for minor donors, we argue that there is a possibility, illustrated by this case, that the donor may not benefit, particularly if the transplant is unsuccessful. We, therefore, encourage the oncology community to increase support for minor donors, particularly mentally delayed ones. We also argue that the donation can be ethically justified based on the donor's familial duty to his sister. The basis of familial duties is complex, including such factors as the nature, intimacy, and history of the relationship and the specific risks and benefits to all involved. We examine each of these factors for our case study.","['Pentz, Rebecca D', 'Haight, Ann E', 'Noll, Robert B', 'Barfield, Raymond', 'Pelletier, Wendy', 'Davies, Stella', 'Alderfer, Melissa A', 'Hinds, Pamela S']","['Pentz RD', 'Haight AE', 'Noll RB', 'Barfield R', 'Pelletier W', 'Davies S', 'Alderfer MA', 'Hinds PS']","['Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA. rpentz@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*ethics', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', '*Intellectual Disability', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Male', 'Minors', '*Siblings']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/2/148 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2007-0185 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2008 Feb;13(2):148-51. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2007-0185.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Descriptions of chronic and acute leukemia and myeloma followed thereafter. In the first years of the 20th century the discovery of x-radiation permitted palliative orthovoltage radiation therapy of Hodgkin's disease. Following World War II, legitimate drug therapy for the hematological malignancies was introduced: nitrogen mustard, adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisone acetate, and anti-folic acid derivatives, initially aminopterin. Today, about 14 classes of drugs (different mechanisms of action) and >50 individual agents are being used, with others under study. Several examples of agents targeting specific transcription factors or oncoproteins have been introduced. Despite remarkable progress, including the ability to cure acute leukemia in about 70% of children, cure several genetic variants of acute myelogenous leukemia in younger adults, cure some cases of lymphoma in children and younger adults, and induce prolonged remission in many affected persons, the majority of patients face an uncertain outcome and shortened life. Thus, we have much to do in the next several decades. The significant hurdles we must overcome include: the apparent infrequency of an exogenous cause that can be avoided, the exponential increase in incidence rates with age and the dramatic negative effect of aging on the results of treatment, the challenge of one trillion or more disseminated cancer cells among which are a smaller population of cancer stem cells, the profound genetic diversity of the hematological malignancies (apparently hundreds of unique genetic primary lesions), the redundant growth and survival pathways defining the cancer phenotype, the decreasing market for pharmaceutical companies as therapy becomes more specific (fewer target patients) and drug development costs become more expensive, and the significant negative long-term effects of current therapy on both children and adults. These challenges will be gradually overcome, if we (a) develop new models of cooperation among academia, industry, and government, (b) continue the growth of international participation in cancer research (more keen minds to the task), and (c) convince the governments of the world, including that of the U.S., that an investment in minimizing the effects of cancer is as important as defending against other threats to the welfare and longevity of their citizens.","['Lichtman, Marshall A']",['Lichtman MA'],"['University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York 14620, USA. mal@urmc.rochester.edu']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/etiology/history', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/etiology/history', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/etiology/history', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/2/126 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2007-0228 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2008 Feb;13(2):126-38. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2007-0228.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activated fusion proteins undergo a cascade of conformational transitions and ultimately resolve into a compact trimer of hairpins or six-helix bundle structure, which pulls the interacting membranes together to promote lipid mixing. Significantly, synthetic peptides based on a C-terminal region of the trimer of hairpins are potent inhibitors of membrane fusion and viral entry, and such peptides are typically extensively alpha-helical. In contrast, an atypical peptide inhibitor of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) includes alpha-helical and nonhelical leash segments. We demonstrate that both the C helix and C-terminal leash are critical to the inhibitory activities of these peptides. Amino acid side chains in the leash and C helix extend into deep hydrophobic pockets at the membrane-proximal end of the HTLV type 1 (HTLV-1) coiled coil, and these contacts are necessary for potent antagonism of membrane fusion. In addition, a single amino acid substitution within the inhibitory peptide improves peptide interaction with the core coiled coil and yields a peptide with enhanced potency. We suggest that the deep pockets on the coiled coil are ideal targets for small-molecule inhibitors of HTLV-1 entry into cells. Moreover, the extended nature of the HTLV-1-inhibitory peptide suggests that such peptides may be intrinsically amenable to modifications designed to improve inhibitory activity. Finally, we propose that leash-like mimetic peptides may be of value as entry inhibitors for other clinically important viral infections.","['Mirsaliotis, Antonis', 'Lamb, Daniel', 'Brighty, David W']","['Mirsaliotis A', 'Lamb D', 'Brighty DW']","['The Biomedical Research Centre, Ninewells, Hospital and Medical School, The University, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080227,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antiviral Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Giant Cells/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Virus Internalization']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02458-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02458-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 May;82(10):4965-73. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02458-07.

Recent studies using analyses with enhanced sensitivity have correlated loads throughout FeLV with the clinical outcome, though remarkably, during the acute phase of infection, proviral and viral RNA burdens in the peripheral blood do not differ between groups. We hypothesized that viral loads in specific leukocyte subsets influence the infection outcome. Using a method established to determine the proviral and cell-associated viral RNA loads in specific leukocyte subsets, we evaluated viral loads in eleven FeLV-exposed specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats 2.5 years post-infection. Six cats had undergone regressive infection whereas five were persistently viremic. Aviremic cats had lower total proviral blood loads than the persistently infected cats and FeLV proviral DNA was shown to be integrated into genomic DNA in four out of four animals. Lymphocytes were predominantly infected vs. moncytes and granulocytes in aviremic cats. In contrast, persistently viremic cats were provirus-positive in all leukocyte subsets. The acute phase kinetics of FeLV infection were analyzed in two additional cats; an early lymphoreticular phase with productive infection in lymphocytes in both cats and in monocytes in one cat was followed by infection of the granulocytes; both cats became persistently infected. These results indicate that FeLV persistent viremia is associated with secondary viremia of bone marrow origin, whereas regressive cats only sustain a non-productive infection in low numbers of lymphocytes.","['Cattori, Valentino', 'Pepin, Andrea C', 'Tandon, Ravi', 'Riond, Barbara', 'Meli, Marina L', 'Willi, Barbara', 'Lutz, Hans', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina']","['Cattori V', 'Pepin AC', 'Tandon R', 'Riond B', 'Meli ML', 'Willi B', 'Lutz H', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R']","['Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstreet 260, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080119,Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/immunology/*virology', 'Cats', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*veterinary', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*veterinary/virology', 'Viral Load/veterinary']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(08)00024-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.01.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2008 May 15;123(1-2):124-8. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.01.018.

Fluorescence-labelled isotype controls (ICs) are commonly used to set limits for the discrimination of antigen positive vs. negative events. OBJECTIVES: The influence of different ICs on the characterisation and quantification of MPs was studied. Antigen negative MPs stained with an antibody of interest were evaluated as an alternative control. METHODS: MPs were prepared from platelets, endothelial cell lines and leucemic cell lines and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or phycoerythrin (PE) labelled antibodies or isotype controls. Results are given as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) or percentage of ""false-positive"" events above a fluorescence intensity > 1. RESULTS: Using identical instrument settings, seven different ICs (FITC-conjugates N = 3, PE-conjugates N = 4) resulted in a wide range of MFI and percentage of positive events with a mean coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.77. Instead, NMPs showed less variability with a mean CV of 0.50 and allowed a reliable and reproducible quantification of MPs when set as controls with < 2% false-positive events above an FI > 1. As a result, the expression of certain antigens (e.g. CD62P) was lower compared to previous reports in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Diversity in the staining intensity of isotype controls is a potential source of error in the characterisation and quantification of MPs by flow cytometry. The use of antigen negative MPs to adjust instrument settings is suggested.","['Trummer, Arne', 'De Rop, Christiane', 'Tiede, Andreas', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Eisert, Roswith']","['Trummer A', 'De Rop C', 'Tiede A', 'Ganser A', 'Eisert R']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. trummer.arne@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080304,United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '11016-17-4 (Phycoerythrin)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Endothelial Cells/immunology/ultrastructure', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods/standards', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'P-Selectin/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phycoerythrin', 'Staining and Labeling/methods/standards']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2007/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-3848(08)00012-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.thromres.2008.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2008;122(5):691-700. doi: 10.1016/j.thromres.2008.01.005.

In the previous studies, we reported that when combined with fluconazole, plagiochin E had synergetic effects against the resistant strain of Candida albicans. Herein, we examined the reversal effect of plagiochin E on multidrug resistance in adriamycin-induced resistant K562/A02 cells and the parental K562 cells. Its cytotoxicity and reversal effects on multidrug resistance were assessed by MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay. Apoptosis percentage of cells was obtained from Annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propridium iodide (PI) double-staining. The effects of plagiochin E on P-glycoprotein activity were evaluated by measuring rhodamine 123 (Rh123)-associated mean fluorescence intensity and P-glycoprotein expression on the basis of the flow cytometric technology, respectively. The results showed that plagiochin E ranging from 2 to 12 mug/ml had little cytotoxicity against K562/A02 cells. When combined with adriamycin, it significantly promoted the sensitivity of K562/A02 cells toward adriamycin through increasing intracellular accumulation of adriamycin in a dose-dependent manner. Further study demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of plagiochin E on P-glycoprotein activity was the major cause of increased stagnation of adriamycin inside K562/A02 cells, indicating that plagiochin E, as a new class of mutidrug resistance inhibitor, may effectively reverse the multidrug resistance in K562/A02 cells via inhibiting expression and drug-transport function of P-glycoprotein.","['Shi, Yan-Qiu', 'Qu, Xian-Jun', 'Liao, Yong-Xiang', 'Xie, Chun-Feng', 'Cheng, Yan-Na', 'Li, Song', 'Lou, Hong-Xiang']","['Shi YQ', 'Qu XJ', 'Liao YX', 'Xie CF', 'Cheng YN', 'Li S', 'Lou HX']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080205,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (plagiochin E)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2007/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(08)00114-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.01.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2008 Apr 14;584(1):66-71. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.01.039.

These differences have an impact on precautionary policy. We examine the statistical aggregation of results from individual disparate studies. Without consistent exposure metrics, the advantage of meta-analysis to estimate magnitude of effect is lost. However, counting positive and statistically significant results yields important information. This is not a substitute for meta-analysis, but a fall-back when meaningful meta-analysis is not available. Representative results from 33 independent adult leukemia studies tabled by IARC yielded 23.5 positives (p approximately 0.01) and 9 significant-positives (p<10(-7)). From 43 representative results from CDHS, there were 32 positive (p<0.001) and 14 significant-positives (p<10(-12)). There were no significant-negative results in either list. Results for adult brain cancer gave a similar, but less clear, message. Childhood leukemia EMF studies have been sufficiently comparable to allow selective pooled analysis, which was important in classifying carcinogenicity. Aggregating all the studies suggests that results for childhood leukemia are not stronger, numerically, than those for adult leukemia. CDHS did not note the number of significant-positives, but noted the meta-analytic summary and the number of positives, forming a view about the strength of these findings. IARC shows no evidence of considering the aggregation of results other than subjectively. It considered individual studies but this led to a tendency to fragment and dismiss evidence that is intrinsically highly significant. We make recommendations for future reviews.","[""O'Carroll, Michael J"", 'Henshaw, Denis L']","[""O'Carroll MJ"", 'Henshaw DL']","[""Vice-Chancellor's Office, University of Sunderland, Chester Road, Sunderland SR1 3SD, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Risk Anal,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,8109978,,IM,"['Adult', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', '*Epidemiologic Measurements', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Research Design', 'Review Literature as Topic', 'World Health Organization']",2008/02/29 09:00,2008/08/07 09:00,['2008/02/29 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['RISK1009 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01009.x [doi]']",ppublish,Risk Anal. 2008 Feb;28(1):225-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01009.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bedside RNA stabilization systems (e.g., PAXgene) have been developed to inhibit RNA degradation during shipment of samples from the clinical site to the specialized laboratory. In CML, blood but not bone marrow samples have been examined using RNA stabilization in previous studies. Therefore, we sought to investigate the applicability of the PAXgene system for bone marrow samples in CML. METHODS: Simultaneously stabilized blood and bone marrow samples were obtained from 55 imatinib-resistant CML patients to compare RNA yield and purity, expression of two housekeeping genes (total ABL and beta-glucuronidase; GUS) by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, BCR-ABL expression (ratios BCR-ABL/ABL and BCR-ABL/GUS), and BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations analyzed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. RESULTS: RNA extraction revealed high-quality RNA derived from both stabilized blood and bone marrow samples. RNA yield was significantly higher in bone marrow (median 9.9 microg RNA/mL bone marrow) than in blood (median 4.3 microg RNA/mL blood) (p=0.0005). The number of housekeeping gene transcripts was comparable in blood and bone marrow (median ABL copies/2 microL cDNA 13,260 vs. 25,590; median GUS copies/2 microL cDNA 35,490 vs. 60,200; n.s.). Further, ratios BCR-ABL/ABL (blood vs. bone marrow, median 47% vs. 57%) and ratios BCR-ABL/GUS (blood vs. bone marrow, median 26% vs. 21%) were not significantly different. Results of mutation analysis corresponded in 51 out of 55 patients (93%), whereas moderate differences were observed in four patients. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that bone marrow can be effectively stabilized using the PAXgene system and shows concordance with blood in terms of BCR-ABL mRNA quantification and mutation analysis in imatinib-resistant CML patients.","['Ernst, Thomas', 'Hoffmann, Jana', 'Erben, Philipp', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Muller, Martin C']","['Ernst T', 'Hoffmann J', 'Erben P', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A', 'Muller MC']","['III.

Nevertheless, the optimal schedule is uncertain. A dose-dense schedule was previously evaluated in a Cancer and Leukemia Group B study of patients with non-SCLC, resulting in a 42% response rate and median survival of 12.3 months. Because of these promising results, this dose and schedule of paclitaxel was evaluated in patients with ES-SCLC. METHODS: Patients were eligible for this phase II trial (Cancer and Leukemia Group B 39901) if they had documented ES-SCLC, no prior chemotherapy, and performance status of 0 to 2. Paclitaxel was administered as an intravenous infusion at 150 mg/m2 over 3 hours weekly for 6 consecutive weeks every 8 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients with median age of 65 were enrolled. Of them 25 were men and 33 with a performance status 0 to 1. A median of two 8-week cycles were delivered. The percent of patients with grade 3/4 toxicity included neutropenia 22%, anemia 9%, febrile neutropenia 6%, fatigue 20%, sensory neuropathy 26%, motor neuropathy 11%, and dyspnea 17%. There were two treatment-related deaths, both from pneumonitis. The overall response rate was 33% (3% complete response and 30% partial response). Median progression-free and overall survivals were 3.7 and 9.2 months, respectively. One-year progression-free and overall survivals were 17% and 36%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with ES-SCLC, dose-dense weekly paclitaxel was associated with fairly mild hematologic toxicity.

Survival following relapse is dismal for most patients. Clofarabine, a purine nucleoside analog, has recently been approved for use in relapsed and refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Clofarabine and cytarabine together may be synergistic and have been used safely in adult leukemia patients. CASE REPORT: We describe the administration of this combination to a 9-year-old boy with multiple relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who failed to achieve remission after the third attempt. He achieved complete morphologic and cytogenetic remission with 1 cycle of this combination. CONCLUSION: This case is the first report of successful remission induction in a multiple relapsed pediatric leukemia patient using the clofarabine and cytarabine combination. Although it is a single case, it highlights the need for further studies to assess safety and efficacy of this combination in pediatric patients.","['Gidwani, Pooja', 'Ramesh, K H', 'Liu, Yingxian', 'Kolb, Edward Anders']","['Gidwani P', 'Ramesh KH', 'Liu Y', 'Kolb EA']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10467, USA. pooja_gidwani@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20080226,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Secondary Prevention']",2008/02/28 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['000118664 [pii]', '10.1159/000118664 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2008;54(2):120-4. doi: 10.1159/000118664.

RESULTS: Three patients infected with documented malaria during a febrile neutropenic episode are presented. Two patients (1 with Hodgkin's disease and the other with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) were successfully treated and are alive after a follow-up period of 120 and 90 months, respectively. A third patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia developed renal failure as a complicating factor of malaria and died.

There is evidence that mutated receptor tyrosine kinases of subclass III, for example the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and KIT-protein, are aberrantly localized in human cancers. In order to further analyze this phenomenon, we investigated the localization of FLT3, a subclass III receptor tyrosine kinase frequently mutated in leukemia. By immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy we found that in retrovirally transduced COS7 cells, wild type FLT3 receptor protein is localized primarily at the cell surface. In contrast, a mutant FLT3 receptor protein with an internal tandem duplication (ITD) accumulates in a perinuclear region and is not detectable at the plasma membrane. Surprisingly, and in contrast to previously published data, intracellular FLT3-ITD accumulation could neither be detected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) nor in the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, transient overexpression per se leads to accumulation of wild type FLT3 receptor protein in the ER in addition to surface localization, probably due to inefficient intracellular transport by the overloaded sorting machinery of the secretory pathway. Based on our data and the immature glycosylation pattern of FLT3-ITD, we speculate that the mutant protein resides most probably in an unidentified compartment of the secretory pathway between the ER and the Golgi apparatus.","['Koch, Sina', 'Jacobi, Angela', 'Ryser, Martin', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Thiede, Christian']","['Koch S', 'Jacobi A', 'Ryser M', 'Ehninger G', 'Thiede C']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der Technischen Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Deutschland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080227,Switzerland,Cells Tissues Organs,"Cells, tissues, organs",100883360,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology', 'Golgi Apparatus/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Mutant Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Retroviridae', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*chemistry/*metabolism']",2008/02/28 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/02/28 09:00'],"['2008/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['000118788 [pii]', '10.1159/000118788 [doi]']",ppublish,Cells Tissues Organs. 2008;188(1-2):225-35. doi: 10.1159/000118788.

CML-specific characteristics include a latency time of several years, a period of coexistence of malignant and normal cells and an eventual dominance of the malignant clone. Different drug therapies are available, most notably imatinib, which inhibits the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase. Although the chromosomal aberration causing CML is well known, the resulting dynamic effects on the system behavior are not sufficiently understood yet. Here, we apply an already established mathematical model of hematopoietic stem cell organization. Based on parameter estimates for normal hematopoiesis, we systematically explore the changes in these parameters necessary to reproduce CML-specific characteristics regarding emergence and course of disease as well as a variety of qualitative and quantitative clinical data on CML treatment. Our results indicate that 1 or more of the following mechanisms are compatible with the induction of a dominant clone in the proposed model: a retarded differentiation process, a reduced turnover time or a defective cell-microenvironment interaction of the neoplastic cells. However, in order to explain the massive overproduction of malignant cells, an unregulated and abnormal activation of leukemia stem cells into cycle has to be assumed additionally. Based on our simulation results we conclude that CML dynamics can most appropriately be explained by a modulation of the cell-microenvironment interactions of leukemia stem cells, including both the process of stem cell silencing and activation into cycle.","['Horn, Matthias', 'Loeffler, Markus', 'Roeder, Ingo']","['Horn M', 'Loeffler M', 'Roeder I']","['Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany. matthias.horn@imise.uni-leipzig.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080227,Switzerland,Cells Tissues Organs,"Cells, tissues, organs",100883360,,IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/*therapy', '*Models, Biological']",2008/02/28 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/02/28 09:00'],"['2008/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['000118786 [pii]', '10.1159/000118786 [doi]']",ppublish,Cells Tissues Organs. 2008;188(1-2):236-47. doi: 10.1159/000118786.

Patients were divided into two cohorts for model development and validation based on availability of specimen material. Initially, GEP from 55 patients with sufficient material were analysed using HG-U133A microarrays, identifying an 18-gene classifier (GC) that was more predictive of outcome than conventional prognostic parameters. After feature selection and validation of expression levels by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), a three-gene qRT-PCR risk index [glutamine synthetase (GLUL), ornithine decarboxylase antizyme inhibitor (AZIN), immunoglobulin J chain (IGJ)] was developed that predicted outcome with an accuracy of 89% in the array cohort and 87% in the independent validation cohort. The data demonstrate the feasibility of using GEP to improve risk stratification in childhood ALL.

However, only a poor response is observed following rituximab monotherapy. The use of chemo-immunotherapy is often associated with haematological and infectious complications. Thus, an antibody with an enhanced ability to kill CLL cells could lead to better clinical responses to antibody monotherapy and the possibility of lowering drug doses during chemo-immunotherapy. We generated a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), EMAB-6, which has a low fucose content. Apoptosis and complement activities for EMAB-6 were similar to those seen for rituximab. By contrast, EMAB-6 mAb showed improved Fcgamma receptor IIIA (FcgammaRIIIA)/CD16 binding and FcgammaRIIIA-dependent effector functions. It induced a higher in vitro antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against CLL cells and a higher FcgammaRIIIA-mediated interleukin-2 production by FcgammaRIIIA(+) Jurkat cells in the presence of CLL cells at both low and maximally saturating concentrations. Comparative studies between CLL and lymphoma cells coated with EMAB-6 or rituximab indicated that the difference of efficacy was more pronounced at low doses and when target cells expressed fewer CD20 molecules. Thus, EMAB-6 mAb represents a promising drug candidate for the treatment of CLL by inducing a strong cytotoxicity against tumour cells that express low CD20 levels.","['de Romeuf, Christophe', 'Dutertre, Charles-Antoine', 'Le Garff-Tavernier, Magali', 'Fournier, Nathalie', 'Gaucher, Christine', 'Glacet, Arnaud', 'Jorieux, Sylvie', 'Bihoreau, Nicolas', 'Behrens, Christian K', 'Beliard, Roland', 'Vieillard, Vincent', 'Cazin, Bruno', 'Bourel, Dominique', 'Prost, Jean-Francois', 'Teillaud, Jean-Luc', 'Merle-Beral, Helene']","['de Romeuf C', 'Dutertre CA', 'Le Garff-Tavernier M', 'Fournier N', 'Gaucher C', 'Glacet A', 'Jorieux S', 'Bihoreau N', 'Behrens CK', 'Beliard R', 'Vieillard V', 'Cazin B', 'Bourel D', 'Prost JF', 'Teillaud JL', 'Merle-Beral H']","['LFB Research Department, 70 rue du Dr Yersin, Bioincubateur Eurasante, 59120 Loos, France. deromeuf@lfb.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (FCGR3A protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, IgG/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/02/28 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2008/02/28 09:00'],"['2008/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6974 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06974.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Mar;140(6):635-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06974.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present report discusses a case in which radiotherapy was employed to benefit a patient with Eisenmenger's-associated painful splenomegaly. Because of the patient's high anesthesia risk, palliative surgical splenectomy was not feasible. The patient underwent three-dimensional conformal treatment planning, and a total of 42.5 Gy at 2.5 Gy per fraction was prescribed to the spleen. At 4 months following radiotherapy completion, the patient reported durable pain relief and no untoward small bowel effects; moreover, there was a 43% reduction in splenic volume on follow-up CT. Although there have been previous reports of hematological and myeloproliferative-associated splenomegaly that have been treated with a lower dose per fraction and lower total dose radiotherapy, we advocate the use of 2.0-2.5 Gy per fraction to a total dose approaching 40 Gy for adequate duration of response when treating cardiogenic-associated painful splenomegaly in patients for whom surgical splenectomy cannot be performed.","['Osorio, Jonathan I', 'Watkins, John M', 'Strange, Charlie', 'Jenrette, Joseph M 3rd']","['Osorio JI', 'Watkins JM', 'Strange C', 'Jenrette JM 3rd']","['School of Medicine Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20080227,Japan,Radiat Med,Radiation medicine,8412264,,IM,"['Cholecystitis, Acute/complications', 'Eisenmenger Complex/*complications', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure/etiology', 'Pain/*etiology/*radiotherapy', 'Palliative Care/*methods', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Conformal/methods', 'Spleen/diagnostic imaging/radiation effects', 'Splenomegaly/*etiology/*radiotherapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/28 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11604-007-0194-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Med. 2008 Feb;26(2):84-7. doi: 10.1007/s11604-007-0194-7.

We retrospectively compared the outcome of autologous (auto) and allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with APL in CR2 or CR3. Fifteen patients received auto and 13 received allo HSCT between 1999 and 2004 at eight hospitals belonging to the Nagoya Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group. Four-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for autografted patients were 68.9 and 75.8%, whereas those for allografted patients were 46.2 (P = 0.350) and 46.2% (P = 0.185), respectively. Three autografted patients and one allografted patient relapsed, and one autografted patient and five allografted patients died without leukemia relapse. Among 14 autografted patients who were evaluated for MRD with molecular analysis, relapse occurred in one with positive MRD (n = 2) and two with negative MRD (n = 12).

In order to identify novel TAAs, we performed comparative microarray analysis of (heterogeneous) tissues and found regulator of G protein-signaling 1 (RGS1) extensively up-regulated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissues. To examine the possible function of this molecule as a novel, broadly applicable TAA, synthetic full-length RGS1-mRNA was synthesized for the transfection of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). These modified antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were then used to induce RGS1-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in vitro. The CTLs generated from several healthy donors and a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) elicited an antigen-specific and HLA-A2- and -A3-restricted cytolytic activity against tumor cells endogenously expressing the RGS1 protein including renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), melanoma, ovarian carcinoma and the primary autologous CLL-blasts. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the in vitro induction of RGS1-specific CTLs by RNA-transfected DCs is feasible and highly effective. Since this molecule is (over-) expressed in a broad variety of malignancies it might represent an interesting novel TAA in the context of cancer vaccines designed to target RGS1 expressing tumor cells.","['Grunebach, Frank', 'Erndt, Stefanie', 'Hantschel, Maik', 'Heine, Annkristin', 'Brossart, Peter']","['Grunebach F', 'Erndt S', 'Hantschel M', 'Heine A', 'Brossart P']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080227,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (RGS Proteins)', '0 (RGS1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Electroporation', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RGS Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transfection']",2008/02/28 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/02/28 09:00'],"['2008/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-008-0486-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2008 Oct;57(10):1483-91. doi: 10.1007/s00262-008-0486-5.

The anticancer drugs used in the treatment of patients suffering from the disease have many side effects due to their toxicity. This fact has prompted researchers to search for other agents instead of, or in combination with, these anticancer drugs. Differentiating agents (DAs) including Na-Butyrate (NaBu), trans-retinoic acid (TRA), dibutyryl- cAMP (Bu-cAMP) and many others have been used for this purpose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this investigation, we studied 120 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML),presenting to the Oncology Institute of Tanta, Egypt. We studied the effect of some differentiating agents (DAs)mainly Na-Butyrate (Na-Bu., 1mM), trans-retinoic acid (TRA, l micro M) and dibutyryl-cAMP (Bu-cAMP, lmM) on the morphology of leukemia cells propagated ex-vivo for 3 and 6 days. We also studied the level of interferon- gamma and its release in the conditioned media of the leukemic cells compared to normal leukocytes. RESULTS: The results revealed that DAs enhanced the conversion of the immature granulocytes into mature ones clearly at 6 days of treatment when we used the agents in combination. The results also showed that statistically significant elevation (p<0.001) of interferon- gamma level was found to be in the conditioned media of the treated leukemic cells (3 and 6 days) using the previously mentioned agents alone or in combination; that could reach almost the level in the cultured media of normal leukocytes. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this work could highlight the possibility of using DAs as a novel complementary therapy in the management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) via the activation of the immune surveillance of patients suffering from AML through raising the interferon- gamma level. Further work is recommended to use DAs in clinical trials with and without conventional anticancer drugs for the management of patient with AML.","['El-Houseini, Motawa E', 'Amer, Iman R', 'Hussein, Tarek D']","['El-Houseini ME', 'Amer IR', 'Hussein TD']","['The Department of Cancer Biology NCI, Cairo University.

With high rates of complete cytogenetic response induced by imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, exploring refinements in current methods of minimal residual disease monitoring is relevant. RECENT FINDINGS: Estimation of leukemic burden can influence treatment decisions. Real-time RT-PCR has become the method of choice for quantifying bcr-abl transcripts in patients undergoing therapy. Efforts are in progress to standardize this technique. The numbers of bcr-abl transcripts can vary in serial specimens, and it is important that changes in treatment (e.g. referral for transplantation, imatinib dose increase, or switch to a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor) be based on consistent rises in transcript number over time rather than on a single change. SUMMARY: Prognosis in newly diagnosed patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase has dramatically improved with the availability of imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In parallel, methods of monitoring minimal residual disease are evolving. Although real-time RT-PCR is now a standard monitoring method, the clinical significance of frequent and more precise follow up in patients achieving a complete cytogenetic response requires better definition.","['Sahay, Tannu', 'Schiffer, Charles A']","['Sahay T', 'Schiffer CA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, abl/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/02/28 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/02/28 09:00'],"['2008/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f42898 [doi]', '00062752-200803000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2008 Mar;15(2):134-9. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f42898.,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emergence of imatinib mesylate and other, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors has transformed the landscape of transplantation in this setting. Treatment algorithms have been rewritten and, despite advances in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (e.g. improved supportive care, decreased toxicity and reduced intensity conditioning), transplantation worldwide has declined. Additionally, the near universal exposure to imatinib mesylate or other kinase inhibitors before transplant consideration has increased expectations regarding outcomes after transplantation. SUMMARY: This review summarizes the history of transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia and defines the new natural history for this leukemia in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor era. Ultimately, enhanced understanding of the appropriate role of transplantation in these patients will lead to the best long-term outcomes.","['Maziarz, Richard T']",['Maziarz RT'],"['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97201, USA. maziarzr@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/physiopathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2008/02/28 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/02/28 09:00'],"['2008/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f428ac [doi]', '00062752-200803000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2008 Mar;15(2):127-33. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f428ac.,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although use of alternative donors in these patients is increasing, the role of alternative donors in these high-risk patients, especially in first remission, remains undefined. RECENT FINDINGS: Results of recent studies indicate that the outcomes with unrelated donors matched at allele levels (10/10) are similar to those in human leukocyte antigen identical sibling donor transplant recipients. Encouraging results have been reported in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia with the use of unrelated donors, extending the benefit of allografting to a wider patient population. Cord blood transplantation and haploidentical transplants are alternative options when a suitable unrelated donor is not available in a timely manner. Disease status at the time of transplantation appears to be a major determinant of outcome with any of these options because outcomes remain dismal for patients with active leukemia at transplantation. SUMMARY: Encouraging data from current studies indicate that the use of alternative donors in high-risk acute myeloid leukemia patients in first remission deserves prospective evaluation. This option should be included in future clinical trial designs.","['Gupta, Vikas']",['Gupta V'],"['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. vikas.gupta@uhn.on.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Haploidy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/02/28 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/02/28 09:00'],"['2008/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f3de99 [doi]', '00062752-200803000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2008 Mar;15(2):115-20. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f3de99.,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several approaches have been tested in phase II study designs, few comparative data exist to guide treatment choices. We searched the recent literature in Medline, EMBASE and BIOSIS, and abstracts from the American Society of Hematology and American Society of Clinical Oncology published between 2005 and 2007. We reviewed each report to identify studies that used a phase II or III design and that included a majority of adults with non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia described as 'relapsed' or 'refractory'. RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies utilized novel cytotoxic chemotherapies, immunotherapies, epigenetic agents, and small molecule inhibitors. It is not possible to identify a single regimen or approach as the standard of care in relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia. New and promising approaches are being explored, however. SUMMARY: Outcomes in patients treated for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia remain inadequate. Striking a balance between the treatment-related mortality associated with salvage therapies, response rates of salvage regimens, and the likelihood of long-term disease-free survival are critical in planning a treatment approach for the individual patient with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.","['Mato, Anthony R', 'Morgans, Alicia', 'Luger, Selina M']","['Mato AR', 'Morgans A', 'Luger SM']","['Abramson Cancer Center and Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/classification/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction/methods']",2008/02/28 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/02/28 09:00'],"['2008/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f463d2 [doi]', '00062752-200803000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2008 Mar;15(2):108-14. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f463d2.,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As many new nucleosides are being investigated in clinical trials, this review aims to update the current state of experience with these new compounds and where they may fit into treatment strategies for acute myeloid leukemia.

Some have entered clinical trials and are actively investigated in the context of acute myeloid leukemia therapy. Clofarabine is the most-developed compound, and single-agent experience and combinations with other active agents in acute myeloid leukemia are being explored. Troxacitabine and sapacitabine are still in single-agent phases of their development and clinical experience is accumulating quickly. SUMMARY: Nucleosides remain the most important class of drugs in acute myeloid leukemia and the interest in new compounds is strong. The plethora of new analogs continues to provide ample opportunity to expand the effectiveness of these drugs in acute myeloid leukemia therapy.

RECENT FINDINGS: Monoclonal antibodies used in acute myeloid leukemia have been directed against the antigens CD33, CD45, and CD66. Unconjugated monoclonal antibodies such as lintuzumab have modest activity against overt acute myeloid leukemia but can eliminate minimal residual disease in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Most experience with immunoconjugates is with gemtuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody linked to the potent antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin has shown activity both singly, particularly in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and combined with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies against CD45 and CD66 have also been used to intensify the conditioning regimen before stem cell transplantation. The most promising results were obtained with radiolabeled anti-CD45 antibodies. Antibodies reactive with CD66 have been used to deliver targeted radiation to hematopoietic tissues in patients with advanced myeloid malignancies. SUMMARY: Both unlabeled monoclonal antibodies and immunoconjugates appear to have a limited role if used as single agents to treat acute myeloid leukemia. These agents hold promise as potentially useful additions to conventional therapy, but the optimal dosing and timing remain to be defined.","['Amadori, Sergio', 'Stasi, Roberto']","['Amadori S', 'Stasi R']","['Department of Hematology, Tor Vergata University Hospital, Rome, Italy. sergio.amadori@ptvonline.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/drug effects/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy']",2008/02/28 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/02/28 09:00'],"['2008/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f3de84 [doi]', '00062752-200803000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2008 Mar;15(2):95-100. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3282f3de84.,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Mammalian target of rapamycin is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that controls initiation of mRNA translation, cell cycle progression, and cellular proliferation. Recent dramatic advances in research into cellular signaling by mammalian target of rapamycin and its effectors, and better understanding of aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin pathways in hematologic malignancies have stimulated considerable interest in the clinical development of inhibitors that target this pathway. Numerous clinical trials using mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors are ongoing in various hematologic malignancies. Such trials are direct extensions of preclinical work establishing that inhibition of this pathway blocks cell proliferation and/or induces apoptotic cell death, both in vitro and in vivo. SUMMARY: The role of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in hematologic malignancies is of considerable interest with major clinical/translational relevance. Here, our understanding of the functional roles of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and its deregulation in hematologic malignancies are summarized and resulting clinical/translational efforts discussed.","['Altman, Jessica K', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Altman JK', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

It is increasingly recognized that the cause of chemoresistance and relapse resides within the leukemia stem cell population. Successful eradication of leukemia stem cells would require a comprehensive profile of both the acquired molecular lesions and intrinsic features of leukemia stem cells. This review describes recent work identifying molecular markers that may lead to development of novel therapeutics, ultimately aiming to eradicate leukemia stem cells in acute myeloid leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: In recent years, novel specific cell surface antigens have allowed identification of leukemia stem cells and permitted their distinction from normal hematopoietic stem cells. Novel concepts of leukemia stem cells and niche interaction have elucidated the mechanisms that control leukemia stem cell survival and chemoresistance. Recent detection of genetic aberrations affecting regulators of HOX gene expression and chromatin modifying enzymes, such as CDX2 and hDOT1L, respectively, elucidates new key players in stem cell self-renewal and leukemic transformation. SUMMARY: The discovery of novel markers and survival pathways for leukemia stem cells has increased our potential to specifically target and eliminate the leukemic stem cell compartment, which is likely to improve clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Buzzai, Monica', 'Licht, Jonathan D']","['Buzzai M', 'Licht JD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Robert H.

Natural products, such as dietary flavonoids, have been suggested as natural proteasome inhibitors with potential use for cancer prevention and therapeutics. We previously reported that apigenin, a flavonoid widely distributed in many fruits and vegetables, can inhibit proteasome activity and can induce apoptosis in cultured leukemia Jurkat T cells. Whether apigenin has proteasome-inhibitory activity in the highly metastatic human breast MDA-MB-231 cells and xenografts,however, is unknown. METHODS: MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell cultures and xenografts were treated with apigenin, followed by measurement of reduced cellular viability/proliferation,proteasome inhibition, and apoptosis induction. Inhibition of the proteasome was determined by levels of the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity, by ubiquitinated proteins, and by accumulation of proteasome target proteins in extracts of the treated cells or tumors. Apoptotic cell death was measured by caspase-3/caspase-7 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and immunohistochemistry for terminal nucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick end labeling positivity. RESULTS: We report for the first time that apigenin inhibits the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity and induces apoptosis not only in cultured MDA-MB-231 cells but also in MDA-MB-231 xenografts. Furthermore, while apigenin has antibreast tumor activity, no apparent toxicity to the tested animals was observed. CONCLUSION: We have shown that apigenin is an effective proteasome inhibitor in cultured breast cancer cells and in breast cancer xenografts. Furthermore, apigenin induces apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells and exhibits anticancer activities in tumors. The results suggest its potential benefits in breast cancer prevention and treatment.","['Chen, Di', 'Landis-Piwowar, Kristin R', 'Chen, Marina S', 'Dou, Q Ping']","['Chen D', 'Landis-Piwowar KR', 'Chen MS', 'Dou QP']","['The Prevention Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48201-2013, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Breast Cancer Res,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apigenin/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/*diet therapy/*enzymology/physiopathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Random Allocation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2008/02/27 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/bcr1797 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res. 2007;9(6):R80. doi: 10.1186/bcr1797.,,PMC2246179,"['R01 CA120009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA112625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA120009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R03CA112625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MEASURES: The measures were serum cortisol and prolactin levels, quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and semi-structured interviews. Primary outcome measure was the fall in serum cortisol levels. RESULTS: A significant difference was seen between arms in cortisol (P=0.002) and prolactin (p=0.031) levels from baseline to 30 min post-session. Aromatherapy and massage arms showed a significantly greater drop in cortisol than the rest arm. Only the massage arm had a significantly greater reduction in prolactin then the rest arm. The EORTC QLQ-C30 showed a significant reduction in 'need for rest' for patients in both experimental arms compared with the control arm, whereas the semi-structured interviews identified a universal feeling of relaxation in patients in the experimental arms. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated that in isolated haematological oncology patients, a significant reduction in cortisol could be safely achieved through massage, with associated improvement in psychological well-being. The implications are discussed.","['Stringer, Jacqui', 'Swindell, Ric', 'Dennis, Michael']","['Stringer J', 'Swindell R', 'Dennis M']","['Haematology and Transplant Unit, Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK. jacqui.stringer@christie.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,"['9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Aromatherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*blood', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Massage', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prolactin/*blood', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Rest', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2008/02/27 09:00,2009/03/19 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.1331 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2008 Oct;17(10):1024-31. doi: 10.1002/pon.1331.,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We compared two cohorts of children of the Childhood Cancer Registry of the Rhone-Alpes Region: Cohort I (1987-1992, 909 patients) and Cohort II (1996-1999, 648 patients). RESULTS: In all cancers together, 75 TRDs were reported in Cohort I and 24 in Cohort II (P = 0.001). Cumulative incidence at 5 years declined from 7.9% to 4.1%, and overall survival (OS) increased from 71.0% to 77.2%. TRDs declined by nearly 10-fold in patients with solid malignant tumors (P = 0.02) and central nervous system tumors (P = 0.001), but OS improved for patients with solid malignant tumors only (P = 0.01). No difference was observed in treatment- and transplantation-related deaths in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), but OS was better in patients with AML (P = 0.02). Between the two cohorts, transplantation-related mortality did not decrease and was higher at 5 years in patients with ALL who received unrelated-matched donor transplants (41.3%) than in those receiving sibling-matched donor transplants (18.7%). OS improved in the respective transplant groups (37.0% and 64.2%). Severe graft-versus-host disease was also observed among patients with ALL (P = 0.036). The decrease in TRDs was correlated with compliance to therapeutic guidelines. CONCLUSION: Although mortality declined, improved adherence to therapeutic guidelines and more restricted indications of allograft are needed to preclude further treatment- and transplantation-related deaths, particularly among those with leukemia.","['Freycon, Fernand', 'Trombert-Paviot, Beatrice', 'Casagranda, Leonie', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Plantaz, Dominique', 'Marec-Berard, Perrine']","['Freycon F', 'Trombert-Paviot B', 'Casagranda L', 'Bertrand Y', 'Plantaz D', 'Marec-Berard P']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of the Rhone-Alpes Region, Saint-Etienne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Registries']",2008/02/27 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21506 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jun;50(6):1213-20. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21506.,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The national Swedish Family-Cancer Database contains information on a large population of multiple births providing an unbiased dataset for the estimation of cancer risk in twins. Lifelong cancer incidence in these twins has already been reported as similar to that in singleton births. In contrast, the present paper presents robust estimates of a significantly reduced childhood cancer risk in twins to age 15. METHODS: Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) were used to measure cancer risk for twins, taking the corresponding rates for singletons as reference. Rates were adjusted for age, sex, period of birth, and residential area. Follow up data cover the period 1958-2002. RESULTS: Overall childhood cancer risk was significantly reduced in all twins (SIR 0.81 [95% CI: 0.69-0.94]) as was the risk for Wilms tumour (SIR 0.34 [95% CI: 0.09-0.88]). These significant reductions in risk were both driven by effects in same sex twins (overall cancer SIR 0.77 [95% CI: 0.64-0.93], Wilms tumour 0.12 [95% CI: 0.00-0.71]). Leukaemia risk was also significantly reduced for same sex twins (SIR 0.69 [95% CI: 0.47-0.97]). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the evidence that twins experience less childhood cancer than singletons. The risk reduction is most marked for Wilms tumour but may, to a varying extent, be true for a number of childhood neoplasms.","['Murphy, M F G', 'Bunch, K J', 'Chen, B', 'Hemminki, K']","['Murphy MF', 'Bunch KJ', 'Chen B', 'Hemminki K']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. michael.murphy@ccrg.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Twin Study']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Sex Factors', '*Twins', 'Twins, Monozygotic', 'Wilms Tumor/epidemiology/etiology']",2008/02/27 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21479 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jul;51(1):62-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21479.,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, a variety of methods have been explored and algorithms for candidate gene prioritization are gaining in their usefulness. Here, we propose an algorithm for detecting gene-disease associations based on the human protein-protein interaction network, known gene-disease associations, protein sequence, and protein functional information at the molecular level. Our method, PhenoPred, is supervised: first, we mapped each gene/protein onto the spaces of disease and functional terms based on distance to all annotated proteins in the protein interaction network. We also encoded sequence, function, physicochemical, and predicted structural properties, such as secondary structure and flexibility. We then trained support vector machines to detect gene-disease associations for a number of terms in Disease Ontology and provided evidence that, despite the noise/incompleteness of experimental data and unfinished ontology of diseases, identification of candidate genes can be successful even when a large number of candidate disease terms are predicted on simultaneously.

The participants noted that the predominant differences for lymphoma families, as compared with other childhood hematological conditions, center around the issues of, firstly, the intensity of treatment. While the treatment protocol is comparatively shorter, the parents perceive it to be more arduous due to the intense and continuous nature of treatment. Important issues noted in this regard were the negative impact of the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic drugs, the stress associated with the invasiveness of accessing the child's veins for blood samples and to inject medications and the experience of undergoing lumbar punctures. Secondly, the relatively rare occurrence of pediatric lymphoma was reported to result in feelings of isolation from other families with children with a hematological malignancy and the unavailability of information and support services focusing specifically on childhood lymphoma. Thirdly, the relatively high curative success rate of lymphomas can have the effect that the parents feel that their angst is somewhat trivialized by other parents at the hospital. Recommendations include the importance of the availability of the full range of supportive care services, attention to the difficult emotional states the child patients experience, clinical strategies that lessen the trauma of treatment, and the use of positive role models by way of contact with or information of children who have successfully completed treatment.","['McGrath, Pam', 'Phillips, Emma']","['McGrath P', 'Phillips E']","['International Program of Psycho-Social Health Research, Central Queensland University, Kenmore Old, Australia. pam_mcgrath@bigpond.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Issues Compr Pediatr Nurs,Issues in comprehensive pediatric nursing,7702326,,,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', '*Attitude to Health', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects/psychology', 'Child', '*Cost of Illness', 'Female', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', '*Lymphoma/psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Nursing Methodology Research', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Psychology, Child', 'Qualitative Research', 'Queensland', 'Social Isolation', 'Spinal Puncture/adverse effects/psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2008/02/27 09:00,2008/05/17 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['790913824 [pii]', '10.1080/01460860701877209 [doi]']",ppublish,Issues Compr Pediatr Nurs. 2008 Jan-Mar;31(1):37-54. doi: 10.1080/01460860701877209.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have performed flow cytometry immunophenotyping on blast cells from 28 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 13 patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) and 7 patients with T-ALL using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against panCD66 (clone D14HD11), CD66a (clone 4.3.17), CD66c (clone 9A6) and CD15s. Expression of the panCD66 mAb was found to be positive in 13 of 28 patients with AML (46%) and in 6 of 13 patients with BCP-ALL (46%) but negative for all the seven patients with T-ALL. In AML, panCD66, CD66a and CD66c were more frequently coexpressed with CD65, CD15 and CD64 than with CD13, CD33 or the two progenitor markers CD34 and CD117. In contrast to CD15, the expression of the sialylated Lewis X (CD15s) was associated with CD117 positivity in the majority of AML cases (64 vs. 85%, P = 0.043). Radioimmunotherapeutic strategies targeting CD66 antigens should consider the heterogeneous expression pattern of CD66 molecules in acute leukemias especially in AML where expression is correlated with mature granulomonocytic cells but not with CD34 and CD117 positive progenitor cells.","['Ratei, Richard', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Schabath, Richard', 'Ehrfeldt, Angelika', 'Grunert, Fritz', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter']","['Ratei R', 'Karawajew L', 'Schabath R', 'Ehrfeldt A', 'Grunert F', 'Ludwig WD']","['HELIOS Klinikum Berlin, Charite-University Medical School Berlin, Robert-Roessle-Clinic, Campus-Buch, Schwanebecker Chaussee 50, 13125, Berlin, Germany. richard.ratei@helios-kliniken.de.', 'HELIOS Klinikum Berlin, Charite-University Medical School Berlin, Robert-Roessle-Clinic, Campus-Buch, Schwanebecker Chaussee 50, 13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'HELIOS Klinikum Berlin, Charite-University Medical School Berlin, Robert-Roessle-Clinic, Campus-Buch, Schwanebecker Chaussee 50, 13125, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine and Cell Research, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Genovac, Freiburg, Germany.', 'HELIOS Klinikum Berlin, Charite-University Medical School Berlin, Robert-Roessle-Clinic, Campus-Buch, Schwanebecker Chaussee 50, 13125, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080227,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD66 antigens)', '0 (CEACAM6 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Sialyl Lewis X Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligosaccharides/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*metabolism', 'Sialyl Lewis X Antigen']",2008/02/27 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0044-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0044-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Mar;87(2):137-143. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0044-0.

There is increasing concern about the influence of rheumatoid arthritis therapy on the risk for hematologic malignant neoplasms. METHODS: We used a case-control design nested in a cohort of 23,810 patients with rheumatoid arthritis assembled from administrative databases covering the population of Quebec, Canada. The study was carried out from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2003. Case patients having hematologic malignant neoplasms were ascertained from physician billing and hospitalization records; each case patient was matched for age and sex with 10 control subjects. Adjusting for clinical variables and concomitant medications, we used conditional logistic regression to analyze potential associations between disease-modifying antirheumatic drug exposures and risk for hematologic malignant neoplasms. We estimated rate ratios attributable to each disease-modifying antirheumatic drug exposure. RESULTS: During the study, hematologic malignant neoplasms developed in 619 patients, including lymphomas in 346 patients, leukemia in 178 patients, and multiple myelomas in 95 patients. The unadjusted rate ratios for hematologic malignant neoplasms after drug exposures were as follows: methotrexate, 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.40); azathioprine, 1.44 (95% CI, 1.01-2.03); and cyclophosphamide, 2.21 (95% CI, 1.52-3.20). Because biologic agents first appeared in the Regie d'Assurance Maladie du Quebec formulary in 2002, there were few exposures to these drugs. Adjusted estimates suggested that hematologic cancer risk was most elevated after exposure to cyclophosphamide (rate ratio, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.24-2.73). For lymphomas only, the adjusted rate ratio after cyclophosphamide exposure was 2.12 (95% CI, 1.33-3.54). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the greatest relative risk for hematologic malignant neoplasms was noted after use of cyclophosphamide. Assessments of risk related to newer and emerging therapies should carefully consider previous and concomitant medication exposures.","['Bernatsky, Sasha', 'Clarke, Ann E', 'Suissa, Samy']","['Bernatsky S', 'Clarke AE', 'Suissa S']","['Division of Clinical Epidemiology, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)'],IM,"['Antirheumatic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2008/02/27 09:00,2008/04/25 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['168/4/378 [pii]', '10.1001/archinternmed.2007.107 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 2008 Feb 25;168(4):378-81. doi: 10.1001/archinternmed.2007.107.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphologically, it is identified as the M3 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia by the French-American-British classification and cytogenetically is characterized by a balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, which results in the fusion between promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha). It seems that the disease is the most malignant form of acute leukemia with a severe bleeding tendency and a fatal course of only weeks. Chemotherapy (CT; daunorubicin, idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside) was the front-line treatment of APL with a complete remission (CR) rate of 75% to 80% in newly diagnosed patients. Despite all these progresses, the median duration of remission ranged from 11 to 25 months and only 35% to 45% of the patients could be cured by CT. Since the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in the treatment and optimization of the ATRA-based regimens, the CR rate was raised up to 90% to 95% and 5-year disease free survival (DFS) to 74%. The use of arsenic trioxide (ATO) since early 1990s further improved the clinical outcome of refractory or relapsed as well as newly diagnosed APL.

A CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone that recognizes a novel HLA-B*2705-restricted H-Y antigen encoded by the DDX3Y gene was isolated from a male who had received a hematopoietic cell graft from his human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sister. The antigenic peptide is a decamer that differs from the homologous DDX3X-encoded peptide at 4 positions. Expression of DDX3Y and of the H-Y epitope that it encodes was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by CTL recognition assays. Expression of DDX3Y is detected in all myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cells that carry an intact Y chromosome. Moreover, the DDX3Y-encoded H-Y epitope is presented on the surface of both myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cells from male HLA-B*2705(+) patients. DDX3Y-specific CTLs prevent engraftment of human acute leukemia in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune deficient mice, demonstrating that the DDX3Y-encoded H-Y antigen is also expressed in leukemic stem cells.

One subgroup, including MLL-rearranged, CALM-AF10 or inv (7)(p15q34) patients, is characterized by elevated expression of HOXA genes. Using a gene expression-based clustering analysis of 67 T-ALL cases with recurrent molecular genetic abnormalities and 25 samples lacking apparent aberrations, we identified 5 new patients with elevated HOXA levels. Using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH), a cryptic and recurrent deletion, del (9)(q34.11q34.13), was exclusively identified in 3 of these 5 patients. This deletion results in a conserved SET-NUP214 fusion product, which was also identified in the T-ALL cell line LOUCY. SET-NUP214 binds in the promoter regions of specific HOXA genes, where it interacts with CRM1 and DOT1L, which may transcriptionally activate specific members of the HOXA cluster. Targeted inhibition of SET-NUP214 by siRNA abolished expression of HOXA genes, inhibited proliferation, and induced differentiation in LOUCY but not in other T-ALL lines.

Defects in the neutral SMase (nSMase) gene Smpd3, the primary regulator of ceramide biosynthesis, are responsible for developmental defects of bone; regulation of ceramide levels have been implicated in macrophage differentiation, but this pathway has not been directly implicated in human cancer. In a genomic screen for gene copy losses contributing to tumorigenesis in a mouse osteosarcoma model, we identified a somatic homozygous deletion specifically targeting Smpd3. Reconstitution of SMPD3 expression in mouse tumor cells lacking the endogenous gene enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced reduction of cell viability. Nucleotide sequencing of the highly conserved SMPD3 gene in a large panel of human cancers revealed mutations in 5 (5%) of 92 acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and 8 (6%) of 131 acute lymphoid leukemias (ALLs), but not in other tumor types. In a subset of these mutations, functional analysis indicated defects in protein stability and localization.

We provide evidence that As(2)O(3) induces phosphorylation/activation of the MAPK signal-integrating kinases (Mnks) 1 and 2 in leukemia cell lines. Such activation is defective in cells with targeted disruption of the p38alpha MAPK gene, indicating that it requires upstream engagement of the p38 MAPK pathway. Studies using Mnk1(-/-) or Mnk2(-/-), or double Mnk1(-/-)Mnk2(-/-) knock-out cells, establish that activation of Mnk1 and Mnk2 by arsenic trioxide regulates downstream phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E at Ser-209. Importantly, arsenic-induced apoptosis is enhanced in cells with targeted disruption of the Mnk1 and/or Mnk2 genes, suggesting that these kinases are activated in a negative-feedback regulatory manner, to control generation of arsenic trioxide responses. Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of Mnk activity enhances the suppressive effects of arsenic trioxide on primary leukemic progenitors from patients with acute leukemias. Taken together, these findings indicate an important role for Mnk kinases, acting as negative regulators for signals that control generation of arsenic trioxide-dependent apoptosis and antileukemic responses.","['Dolniak, Blazej', 'Katsoulidis, Efstratios', 'Carayol, Nathalie', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Redig, Amanda J', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Ueda, Takeshi', 'Watanabe-Fukunaga, Rie', 'Fukunaga, Rikiro', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Dolniak B', 'Katsoulidis E', 'Carayol N', 'Altman JK', 'Redig AJ', 'Tallman MS', 'Ueda T', 'Watanabe-Fukunaga R', 'Fukunaga R', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

Its therapeutic use in leukaemia was described a century ago. Recent rekindling in the interest of As2O3 is due to its high efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). As2O3 has also been tested clinically in other blood and solid cancers. Most studies have used intravenous As2O3, although an oral As2O3 is equally efficacious. Side effects of As2O3 are usually minor, including skin reactions, gastrointestinal upset, and hepatitis. These respond to symptomatic treatment or temporary drug cessation, and do not compromise subsequent treatment with As2O3. During induction therapy in APL, a leucocytosis may occasionally occur, which can be associated with fluid accumulation and pulmonary infiltration. The condition is similar to the APL differentiation syndrome during treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, and responds to cytoreductive treatment and corticosteroids. Intravenous As2O3 treatment leads to QT prolongation. In the presence of underlying cardiopulmonary diseases or electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia, serious arrhythmias may develop, with torsades du pointes reported in 1% of cases. This may be related to a dose-dependent arsenic-mediated inhibition of potassium ion channels that compromises cardiac repolarization. Because of slow intestinal absorption, oral-As2O3 gives a lower plasma arsenic concentration, which is associated with lesser QT prolongation and hence a more favorable cardiac safety profile. As2O3 does not appear to enter the central nervous system. However, if the blood brain barrier is breached, elemental arsenic may enter the cerebrospinal fluid. As2O3 is predominantly excreted in the kidneys, and dose adjustment is required when renal function is impaired.","['Au, Wing-Yan', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam']","['Au WY', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China. ylkwong@hkucc.hku.hk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Prodrugs/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",2008/02/27 09:00,2009/04/23 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1745-7254.2008.00771.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2008 Mar;29(3):296-304. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7254.2008.00771.x.,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This condition has an adverse impact on the oral-health-related quality of life of patients undergoing marrow transplantation therapy. The purpose of this study was to create and validate a Patient-Reported Oral Mucositis Symptom (PROMS) scale. This scale allows evaluation of symptoms of oral mucositis that threaten quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PROMS scale was compared with previously validated tools measuring quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy--Bone Marrow Transplant), symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), psychological well-being (Affect Balance Scale) and stressful life events, as well as an objective, clinician-rated assessment of oral mucositis (Visual Analogue Scale--Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale). Thirty-four patients who were to undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, were enrolled in this validation study. RESULTS: The PROMS scale had high internal reliability, as well as good convergent and discriminant validity relative to subjective measures of well-being. Longitudinal assessments showed that changes in PROMS scores were strongly correlated with changes in clinical assessment of oral mucositis over the first 2 weeks after transplantation, when the onset of oral mucositis typically occurs and the lesions are most severe. CONCLUSIONS: Oral mucositis in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation can be quantified reliably with the easily administered PROMS scale. The PROMSscale provides a valid measure of the impact of oral mucositis on the oral-health-related quality of life of patients affected by this malady.","['Kushner, Jennifer A', 'Lawrence, Herenia P', 'Shoval, Irit', 'Kiss, Thomas L', 'Devins, Gerald M', 'Lee, Linda', 'Tenenbaum, Howard C']","['Kushner JA', 'Lawrence HP', 'Shoval I', 'Kiss TL', 'Devins GM', 'Lee L', 'Tenenbaum HC']","['Department of Biological and Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto, 124 Edward St., Room 515D, Toronto, ON M5G 1G6.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,Canada,J Can Dent Assoc,Journal (Canadian Dental Association),7907605,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Mucositis/etiology/*psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Self-Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Stomatitis/etiology/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects']",2008/02/27 09:00,2008/03/11 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Can Dent Assoc. 2008 Feb;74(1):59.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the exception of Down syndrome, prenatal radiation exposure, and higher birth weight, particularly for acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), few risk factors have been firmly established. Translocations present in neonatal blood spots and the young age peak of diagnosis suggest that early-life factors are involved in childhood leukemia etiology. METHODS: We investigated the association between birth characteristics and childhood leukemia through linkage of the Minnesota birth and cancer registries using a case-cohort study design. Cases included 560 children with ALL and 87 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnoses from 28 days to 14 years. The comparison group was comprised of 8,750 individuals selected through random sampling of the birth cohort from 1976-2004. Cox proportional hazards regression specific for case-cohort studies was used to compute hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Male sex (HR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.16-1.70), white race (HR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.13-4.76), and maternal birth interval > or = 3 years (HR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.70) increased ALL risk, while maternal age increased AML risk (HR = 1.21/5 year age increase, 95% CI 1.0-1.47). Higher birth weights (>3798 grams) (HRALL = 1.46, 1.08-1.98; HRAML = 1.97, 95% CI 1.07-3.65), and one minute Apgar scores < or = 7 (HRALL = 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61; HRAML = 1.62, 95% CI 1.01-2.60) increased risk for both types of leukemia. Sex was not a significant modifier of the association between ALL and other covariates, with the exception of maternal education. CONCLUSION: We confirmed known risk factors for ALL: male sex, high birth weight, and white race. We have also provided data that supports an increased risk for AML following higher birth weights, and demonstrated an association with low Apgar scores.","['Johnson, Kimberly J', 'Soler, John T', 'Puumala, Susan E', 'Ross, Julie A', 'Spector, Logan G']","['Johnson KJ', 'Soler JT', 'Puumala SE', 'Ross JA', 'Spector LG']","['Division of Epidemiology/Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. john5713@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080225,England,BMC Pediatr,BMC pediatrics,100967804,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",2008/02/27 09:00,2008/04/18 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2007/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2431-8-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2431-8-7 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Pediatr. 2008 Feb 25;8:7. doi: 10.1186/1471-2431-8-7.,,PMC2292161,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML has also been localized in the cytoplasm, although its function in this localization remains elusive. A general property of primary cancers is their high glycolytic rate which results from increased glucose consumption. However, the mechanism by which cancer cells up-regulate glycolysis is not well understood. Here, we have shown that cytoplasmic PML (cPML) directly interacts with M2-type pyruvate kinase (PKM2), a key regulator of carbon fate. PKM2 determines the proportion of carbons derived from glucose that are used for glycolytic energy production. Over-expression of PML-2KA mutant in the cytoplasm, which was generated by mutagenesis of the nuclear localization signals of PML, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells suppressed PKM2 activity and the accumulation of lactate. PKM2 exists in either an active tetrameric form which has high affinity for its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or a less active dimeric form which has low affinity for its substrate. Over-expression of PML-2KA suppressed the activity of the tetrameric form of PKM2, but not the dimeric form. Our findings suggest that cPML plays a role in tumor metabolism through its interaction with PKM2.","['Shimada, Nobukazu', 'Shinagawa, Toshie', 'Ishii, Shunsuke']","['Shimada N', 'Shinagawa T', 'Ishii S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, RIKEN Tsukuba Institute, 3-1-1 Koyadai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0074, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.40 (Pyruvate Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Energy Metabolism/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Pyruvate Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/02/27 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['GTC1165 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2443.2008.01165.x [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2008 Mar;13(3):245-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2443.2008.01165.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare bone age (BA) and dental age (DA) to chronological age (CA) in childhood ALL survivors. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed hand-wrist and panoramic radiographs of patients treated on contemporary single institution protocols for ALL between 1991 and 2004. We recorded patient demographics, therapeutic protocol, CA, DA, and BA. The cohort was divided into three categories based on age at diagnosis (< 6 years, 6-9 years, > 9 years). RESULTS: Of 73 patients, 39 (53.4%) were boys; 55 (75.3%) were Caucasian. Median CA at diagnosis was 4.5 years (range: 0.1-11.0 years); time to study was 4.1 years (range: 0.3-11.4 years). BA was normal in 61 (83.6%), delayed in 10 (13.7%), and advanced in 2 (2.7%). DA was normal in 41 (56.9%), delayed in 8 (11.1%), and advanced in 23 (31.9%). Abnormal BA, abnormal DA, and discrepancy between BA and DA are not statistically significantly associated with investigated patient or treatment factors. CONCLUSIONS: DA may be altered in 43.1% of patients treated for ALL. A large prospective study is warranted to better define our observations and to determine their impact on dental and orthodontic management.","['Martin, Mary Beth', 'Li, Chin-Shang', 'Rowland, Christopher C', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Kaste, Sue C']","['Martin MB', 'Li CS', 'Rowland CC', 'Howard SC', 'Kaste SC']","['Department of Orthodontics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080219,England,Int J Paediatr Dent,International journal of paediatric dentistry,9107511,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,"['Adolescent', '*Age Determination by Skeleton', '*Age Determination by Teeth', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', '*Child Development', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dental Care for Children', 'Dental Care for Chronically Ill', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Radiotherapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",2008/02/27 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['IPD892 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-263X.2007.00892.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Paediatr Dent. 2008 May;18(3):217-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-263X.2007.00892.x.

Eight infertile mutation-positive women were diagnosed with idiopathic infertility (n=5) and endometriosis (n=3) and their levels of aPLs in serum were compared with 115 infertile women without any LIF gene mutation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for the detection of seven antiphospholipid antibodies; the results were statistically assessed by the Fisher's 2 by 2 exact test to evaluate the association of the LIF gene mutations and aPLs in serum of infertile patients. The presence of aPLs was significantly higher in our study group (100%) than in 30% of aPLs-positives in control infertile patients (p = 0.0035) which indicates that the aPLs are elevated in women with LIF gene mutations.,"['Kralickova, M', 'Ulcova-Gallova, Z', 'Sima, R', 'Vanecek, T', 'Sima, P', 'Krizan, J', 'Sucha, R', 'Uher, P', 'Hes, O', 'Novotny, Z', 'Rokyta, Z', 'Vetvicka, V']","['Kralickova M', 'Ulcova-Gallova Z', 'Sima R', 'Vanecek T', 'Sima P', 'Krizan J', 'Sucha R', 'Uher P', 'Hes O', 'Novotny Z', 'Rokyta Z', 'Vetvicka V']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, 301 66 Plzei, Czechia.

These drugs are now a component of therapy for many common malignancies, including breast, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers, as well as lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma. The mechanisms of action and toxicities of targeted therapies differ from those of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Targeted therapies are generally better tolerated than traditional chemotherapy, but they are associated with several adverse effects, such as acneiform rash, cardiac dysfunction, thrombosis, hypertension, and proteinuria. Small molecule inhibitors are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes and are subject to multiple drug interactions. Targeted therapy has raised new questions about the tailoring of cancer treatment to an individual patient's tumor, the assessment of drug effectiveness and toxicity, and the economics of cancer care. As more persons are diagnosed with cancer and as these patients live longer, primary care physicians will increasingly provide care for patients who have received targeted cancer therapy.","['Gerber, David E']",['Gerber DE'],"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-8852, USA. david.gerber@utsouthwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am Fam Physician,American family physician,1272646,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/economics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Eruptions/etiology', 'Heart/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Proteinuria/chemically induced', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thrombosis/chemically induced', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/drug effects', 'Ventricular Dysfunction/chemically induced']",2008/02/27 09:00,2008/02/29 09:00,['2008/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am Fam Physician. 2008 Feb 1;77(3):311-9.,44,,,,,,,"['Am Fam Physician. 2008 Feb 1;77(3):294, 296.

An infectious etiology has been suspected and the role of the Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) has been suggested. Several studies have tried to establish a link between HHV-6 infections and hematological malignancies, with discordant results. The potential role of HHV-6 in the pathogenesis of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia was investigated. HHV-6 genome copy number was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (RQ-PCR) in bone marrow or peripheral blood samples obtained from 36 children (median age = 4 years) with B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 31) and T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 5) at diagnosis and during complete remission. Positive samples were further characterized to define viral variant, A or B. A total of 24.7% of samples were positive for HHV-6 genome: 13.9% were leukemia samples and 34.1% were complete remission samples. Viral load was low with values lower at diagnosis (median viral copy number = 22.9) than at complete remission (median copy number = 60.1). Among the 17 patients with positive samples, 15 were typed as B-variant whereas 2 could not be typed. These results argue against a role of HHV6 infection in the development of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. They also suggest that HHV-6 may infect latently bone marrow progenitors but seems not able to infect leukemic cells, raising again the question of the mechanism of virus fusion and entry. This observation shows that a reactivation may be observed during complete remission supporting the possibility of virus reactivation in immunocompromised hosts.","['Seror, Elisa', 'Coquerel, Berenice', 'Gautheret-Dejean, Agnes', 'Ballerini, Paola', 'Landman-Parker, Judith', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Schneider, Pascale', 'Vannier, Jean-Pierre']","['Seror E', 'Coquerel B', 'Gautheret-Dejean A', 'Ballerini P', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Leverger G', 'Schneider P', 'Vannier JP']","['Laboratoire de recherche MERCI, Faculte de Medecine et Pharmacie de Rouen, France. seror.je@laposte.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood/virology', 'Bone Marrow/virology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*virology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*virology', 'Roseolovirus Infections/*complications/*virology', 'Viral Load']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.21118 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2008 Apr;80(4):689-93. doi: 10.1002/jmv.21118.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient population was relatively young (median age 37, oldest patient 67), and patients were excluded if they had prior MDS or prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Complete remission (CR) rate, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients were calculated. One hundred and fifty-three patients who had karyotype results were divided into four groups according to Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria. Differences of CR rate, DFS and OS of different groups were evaluated. The CR rate of all 196 cases was 153/196 (78.1%), and 95.3% of these were within 1 - 2 courses. Median DFS of the 153 CR patients was 23.8 (range from 1.0 to 153) months. DFS rates at 3 years and 5 years were 41.1% and 35.9%, respectively. The median OS of 196 patients was 19.3 (0.5 - 154) months. The probabilities of 3-year and 5-year OS were 31.5% and 29.2%, respectively. CR rate, DFS and OS of the different cytogenetic risk groups were also be analyzed. According to SWOG criteria, patients were classified into favorable, intermediate, adverse and unknown (a group where the meaning of chromosomes are unclear) groups. CR rate, median DFS and OS were 91.9%, 90.8 months and 94.4 months for the favorable group; 86.4%, 22.0 months and 22.8 months for the intermediate group; 59.4%, 9 months and 10.5 months for the adverse group; 76.0%, 22.0 months, 16.1 months for the unknown group, respectively. The differences among the four groups were statistically significant (P = 0.001, 0.0033, 0.0001). We conclude that triple-drugs induction regimens based on HA (HAD/M) are highly effective in adult AML in China. Cytogenetics is the important prognostic factor.

We examined the prognostic utility of serial bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring by RQ-PCR in a cohort of patients with CBF AML with long term clinical follow-up. Twenty-nine patients were evaluated with a median follow of 34 months. Twelve relapses occurred at a median of 11 months (range 4 - 17) from diagnosis. RQ-PCR levels at diagnosis, post-induction chemotherapy and post-consolidation were not predictive of outcome. However, a >or=1 log(10) rise at any stage in transcript level relative to the level from a remission bone marrow sample correlated with inferior leukemia free survival (LFS) and imminent morphologic relapse (hazard ratio 8.6). Relapses occurred a median of 60 days (range 45 - 272) after a log(10) rise. A >or=1 log(10) rise in transcript levels strongly predicts subsequent morphologic relapse in CBF AML and therefore defines molecular relapse.

Indicators of poor prognosis include del(5q)/-5, del(7q)/-7, abnormal 3q or complex karyotype. In recent years, it has become clear that aberrations in 17p represent one of the indicators of poor prognosis in haematological malignancies. In AML, deletions in 17p have been shown to indicate a dismal prognosis; genetic aberrations in 9p have also been discussed as influencing long-term survival in AML. In this study, we correlated genetic abnormalities in chromosomes 9 and 17 in patients with de novo AML to in vitro cytotoxicity of conventional anti-leukemic drugs, and long-term overall survival. Blast cells were isolated from 387 patients diagnosed with AML. Chromosomal analysis was successful in 336 cases. All samples were tested for in vitro cytotoxicity against fludarabine, amsacrine, mitoxantrone, etoposide, daunorubicin and Ara-C after being cultured for 4 days, using an ATP assay. Among the 336 patients, five main groups were identified. Abnormal chromosome 17 (n = 22), abnormal 9p (n = 13), monosomy 7 or deletion 7q (n = 35), complex karyotype (n = 52) and normal karyotype (n = 132). Patients with abnormalities of chromosome 17 showed significantly greater resistance to all drugs tested and significantly shorter overall survival compared with patients with normal and complex karyotypes (p = 0.0001 and 0.041, respectively). All patients with abnormalities of chromosome 17 died within 11 months of diagnosis. A tendency towards shorter overall survival and greater drug resistance was also noted when comparing chromosome 17 abnormalities with del(7q)/-7, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Patients with abnormal 9p showed significantly shorter overall survival but did not differ significantly as regards in vitro drug resistance compared with patients presenting with a normal karyotype. Chromosomal abnormalities affecting the p53 pathway have a significant impact on cytostatic drug resistance and survival in AML. Developing new drugs targeting the p53 pathway could be a way to improve treatment of AML.","['Nahi, Hareth', 'Lehmann, Soren', 'Bengtzen, Sofia', 'Jansson, Monika', 'Mollgard, Lars', 'Paul, Christer', 'Merup, Mats']","['Nahi H', 'Lehmann S', 'Bengtzen S', 'Jansson M', 'Mollgard L', 'Paul C', 'Merup M']","['Department of Haematology, Karolinska Institute at Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/04/10 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['790366510 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701861645 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Mar;49(3):508-16. doi: 10.1080/10428190701861645.,,,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Mar;49(3):383-4.

Two hundred and ninety neutropenic periods following chemotherapy in 84 AML patients were retrospectively evaluated. Neutropenic fever was found in 280 periods (97%). Severe sepsis developed in 35 occasions (13%) and 9 patients (11%) died due to severe sepsis. In 165 episodes with neutropenic fever (59%), the potential causative organism was found in blood cultures. Gram-negative bacteria were more commonly found in patients who developed severe sepsis (40% vs. 23%, p = 0.03).

Relapse occurred in 15 patients with isolated hematologic relapse in 13 and isolated central nervous system relapse in 2. Seven patients died of treatment-related complications. The medical cost for each patient does not exceed 25,000 USD. Contemporary risk-directed therapy can cure approximately two thirds of patients with ALL at relatively low cost.

The dominant factors that are contributed to tolerance to cytocidal effects of MTX including pharmacokinetic factors, impaired transmembrane uptake as the most frequent rote of provoking resistance to MTX, augmented drug efflux, impaired intracellular polyglutamation as a determining process of drug efficacy, alterations in expression or activity of target enzymes and increased intracellular folate pools; and finally role of 7-hydroxymethotrexate on response or resistance to MTX will be discussed in more detail.

JAK3 is important in lymphoid and JAK2 in myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation. The thrombopoietin receptor MPL is one of several JAK2 cognate receptors and is essential for myelopoiesis in general and megakaryopoiesis in particular. Germline loss-of-function (LOF) JAK3 and MPL mutations cause severe combined immunodeficiency and congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, respectively. Germline gain-of-function (GOF) MPL mutation (MPLS505N) causes familial thrombocytosis. Somatic JAK3 (e.g. JAK3A572V, JAK3V722I, JAK3P132T) and fusion JAK2 (e.g. ETV6-JAK2, PCM1-JAK2, BCR-JAK2) mutations have respectively been described in acute megakaryocytic leukemia and acute leukemia/chronic myeloid malignancies. However, current attention is focused on JAK2 (e.g. JAK2V617F, JAK2 exon 12 mutations) and MPL (e.g. MPLW515L/K/S, MPLS505N) mutations associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). A JAK2 mutation, primarily JAK2V617F, is invariably associated with polycythemia vera (PV). The latter mutation also occurs in the majority of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF). MPL mutational frequency in MPNs is substantially less (<10%). In general, despite a certain degree of genotype - phenotype correlations, the prognostic relevance of harbouring one of these mutations, or their allele burden when present, remains dubious. Regardless, based on the logical assumption that amplified JAK-STAT signalling is central to the pathogenesis of PV, ET and PMF, several anti-JAK2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed and are currently being tested in humans with these disorders.","['Tefferi, Ayalew']",['Tefferi A'],"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Janus Kinase 3/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics', 'STAT Transcription Factors', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/04/10 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['790794251 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190801895360 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Mar;49(3):388-97. doi: 10.1080/10428190801895360.,167,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) is highly up-regulated in pancreatic carcinoma and is associated with the anti-apoptosis and the resistance to chemotherapy drugs. Suppression of Mcl-1 would be an approach to induce apoptosis and enhance the chemosensitivity. METHODS: In this study, three pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1, BxPC-3 and SW1900) stably expressing shRNAs targeting Mcl-1 gene were established and gene expression inhibition was assessed by Real-Time QPCR and Western blotting. The effects of Mcl-1 downregulation mediated by RNAi were explored in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We showed that the specific downregulation of Mcl-1 strikingly inhibited cell growth, colony formation, cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro, and markedly decreased the tumorigenicity in a mouse xenograft model. Moreover, knockdown of Mcl-1 significantly increased the chemosensitivity to Gemcitabine in pancreatic carcinoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that the specific downregulation of Mcl-1 by RNAi is a promising approach to induce apoptosis and enhance the chemosensitivity for pancreatic carcinoma gene therapy.","['Wei, San-Hua', 'Dong, Ke', 'Lin, Fang', 'Wang, Xi', 'Li, Bin', 'Shen, Jian-Jun', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Wang, Rui', 'Zhang, Hui-Zhong']","['Wei SH', 'Dong K', 'Lin F', 'Wang X', 'Li B', 'Shen JJ', 'Zhang Q', 'Wang R', 'Zhang HZ']","[""Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xinsi Road, 710038, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080223,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Inverted Repeat Sequences', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-008-0697-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2008 Nov;62(6):1055-64. doi: 10.1007/s00280-008-0697-7.

Much less is known about the effectiveness of As2O3 in other neoplastic disorders. In this paper, we report that after 18 h in vitro treatment with 4 microM As2O3, 75+/-18% of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) cells (n=52) underwent apoptosis. It is important to note that B-CLL cells harboring a deletion of chromosome 17p13, which predisposes to fludarabine resistance and has been identified as an important negative predictor of clinical outcome, were more susceptible to As2O3 toxicity than cells lacking this aberration. Furthermore, unfavourable risk profiles such as unmutated IgVH status, high CD38 expression and prior treatment were associated with significantly higher sensitivity of B-CLL cells to As2O3. As2O3 also preferentially killed B-CLL cells compared to B cells from healthy age-matched controls. Molecular analysis revealed that basal superoxide dismutase activity was positively correlated with the pro-apoptotic activity of As2O3 pointing to a role of reactive oxygen species in cell death induction. The high activity of As2O3 in B-CLL cells from high-risk patients makes it a promising drug for high-risk and/or fludarabine-refractory B-CLL patients.","['Merkel, Olaf', 'Heyder, Christoph', 'Asslaber, Daniela', 'Hamacher, Frank', 'Tinhofer, Inge', 'Holler, Claudia', 'Stocher, Markus', 'Prokesch, Andreas', 'Papak, Christine', 'Scheideler, Marcel', 'Trajanoski, Zlatko', 'Greil, Richard']","['Merkel O', 'Heyder C', 'Asslaber D', 'Hamacher F', 'Tinhofer I', 'Holler C', 'Stocher M', 'Prokesch A', 'Papak C', 'Scheideler M', 'Trajanoski Z', 'Greil R']","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, IIIrd Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectiology, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria. o.merkel@salk.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080223,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/11/01 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00109-008-0314-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2008 May;86(5):541-52. doi: 10.1007/s00109-008-0314-6.

Hormetic and adaptive responses are such two examples. However, whether adaptive response could be induced in tumor cells by LDR, especially under in vivo condition, remains elusive, and was systemically investigated in the present study. Four tumor cell lines: two human leukemia cell lines (erythroleukemia cell line K562, and acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60), and two human solid tumor cell lines (lung carcinoma cell line NCI-H446 and glioma cell line U251), along with one normal cell line (human fibroblast cells, MRC-5), were irradiated with LDR at 75 mGy of X-rays as D1 and then 4 Gy of X-rays as D2 (i.e.: D1 + D2) or only 4 Gy of X-rays (D2 alone). Three tumor-bearing animal models were also used to further define whether LDR induces adaptive response in tumor cells in vivo. Adaptive response was observed only in normal cell line, but not in four tumor cell lines, in response to LDR, showing a resistance to subsequent D2-induced cell growth inhibition. Three tumor-bearing mouse models with U251, NCI-H446 or S180 tumor cells were used to confirm that pre-exposure of tumor-bearing mice to D1 did not induce the resistance of tumor cells in vivo to D2-induced tumor growth inhibition. Furthermore, a higher apoptotic effect, along with higher expression of apoptosis-related genes P53 and Bax and lower expression of anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-2, was found in tumor cells of the tumor-bearing mice exposed to D1 + D2 than those in the tumor cells of the tumor-bearing mice exposed to D2 alone. These results suggest that LDR does not induce adaptive response in the tumor cells under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, which is a very important, clinic-relevant phenomenon.","['Jiang, Hongyu', 'Li, Wei', 'Li, Xiuyi', 'Cai, Lu', 'Wang, Guanjun']","['Jiang H', 'Li W', 'Li X', 'Cai L', 'Wang G']","['Department of Hematology at the First Clinical College, Jilin University, Changchum, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080222,England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,,IM,"['Adaptation, Biological/radiation effects', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Tolerance/*radiation effects']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jrr/07072 [pii]', '10.1269/jrr.07072 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2008 May;49(3):219-30. doi: 10.1269/jrr.07072.

A malformation may involve physiologic changes or changes in lifestyle that might affect cancer risks. METHODS: In Norway and Sweden, the population-based medical birth and cancer registries were linked to identify subsequent cancer occurrence in children with birth defects and among their parents and siblings. Altogether, 5.2 million children and their families were included. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) served as a measure of relative risk. RESULTS: There was an increased overall cancer risk in individuals with birth defects in the two countries [SIR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.6-1.9], and the increased risk remained into early adulthood. Individuals with malformations in the nervous system were at increased risk of developing cancer in the brain/nervous system (Norway: SIR, 58; 95% CI, 41-80; Sweden: SIR, 8.3; 95% CI, 4.0-15), individuals with Down syndrome were at an increased risk of leukemia (Norway: SIR, 36; 95% CI, 26-48; Sweden: SIR, 36; 95% CI, 28-46), and there was an increased overall cancer risk for individuals with multiple birth defects (Norway: SIR, 5.5; 95% CI, 3.3-8.7; Sweden: SIR, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.2-5.4). There was no increased overall cancer risk among mothers (SIR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.0-1.0), fathers (SIR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.0), and siblings (SIR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.1) of children with birth defects. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an increased overall cancer risk in individuals with birth defects.

TIF2, member of the p160 family, is a histone acetyl transferase (HAT). Deletion of p160 genes were performed in mice. Some observations suggest that p160 family members may perform overlapping functions in mice. Therefore, we decided to choose the zebrafish model to study TIF2. The aim of this study was to characterize the role of this HAT during embryonic development. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We use antisense, morpholino-modified oligomers to transiently knockdown tif2 gene, thus determining whether TIF2 plays a role in zebrafish early development. RESULTS: We show that tif2 is involved in embryogenesis and in primitive hematopoiesis. tif2-knockdown zebrafish embryos are smaller than controls, they demonstrate shorter tails, they display notochord deformation and they exhibit U-shaped tail somites. A synthetic RNA encoding human TIF2 rescues the tif2-knockdown phenotype. Analysis of fli1 expression by whole-mount in situ hybridization indicates normal angioblast specification, but altered localization of intersomitic vessels. The posterior intermediate cell mass, in which a part of primitive hematopoiesis occurs, is altered in tif2 morphants and whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses of l-plastin and mpx expression suggest a specific inhibition of granulocytic and macrophagic differentiation at late stages. CONCLUSION: These data indicate an important role for TIF2 in zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis.","['Zhuravleva, Julia', 'Solary, Eric', 'Chluba, Johanna', 'Bastie, Jean-Noel', 'Delva, Laurent']","['Zhuravleva J', 'Solary E', 'Chluba J', 'Bastie JN', 'Delva L']","['Inserm, University of Burgundy, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080304,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (plastin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Embryonic Development/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics', 'Models, Animal', 'Morpholines/chemistry', 'Myelopoiesis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Zebrafish/embryology/*genetics']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2007/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00003-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.12.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 May;36(5):559-67. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.12.014.

Identification and characterization of undifferentiated mast cells in mouse bone marrow. Blood 105, 4282-4289]. In rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, mAb BGD6 precipitates cell-surface proteins of approximately 110 and 40-60 kDa. An expression cloning strategy was used to identify proteins that interact with mAb BGD6. A RBL-2H3 cDNA library in plasmids was transfected into PEAK cells, which do not bind mAb BGD6, and positive cells were selected with mAb BGD6. The plasmids recovered from the positive cells were amplified; retransfected into PEAK cells and after several screening cycles a positive clone was identified. This clone showed almost complete identity to Fc gamma RIIB (CD32), the low affinity IgG receptor. However, in contrast to the sequence in GenBank, this clone had an insert of 141 bp which codes for a longer isoform of this molecule with an extra 47 aa in its cytoplasmic domain. In RBL-2H3 cells both isoforms were expressed, with higher expression of the shorter form. The mechanism of binding of mAB BGD6 on both RBL-2H3 and CD32 transfected PEAK cells was then examined. Intact mAb BGD6 bound to both RBL-2H3 and CD32 expressing PEAK cells, but F(ab')(2) fragments bound only to RBL-2H3 cells demonstrating that mAb BGD6 binds to Fc gamma RIIB only through its Fc portion. On RBL-2H3 cells, the Fab of an anti-CD32 mAb partially inhibited the binding of intact mAb BGD6. The binding pattern of mAb BGD6 inhibited with anti-CD32 resembled that of the F(ab')(2) fragment of the antibody suggesting that the Fc portion of mAb BGD6 contributes to its binding on cells that have Fc gamma RIIB. These results are consistent with a model where mAb BGD6 binds through its Fab portion to a approximately 110 kDa protein and the Fc tail interacts with Fc gamma RIIB (CD32).","['Guiraldelli, Michel F', 'Berenstein, Elsa H', 'Grodzki, Ana Cristina G', 'Siraganian, Reuben P', 'Jamur, Maria Celia', 'Oliver, Constance']","['Guiraldelli MF', 'Berenstein EH', 'Grodzki AC', 'Siraganian RP', 'Jamur MC', 'Oliver C']","['Receptors and Signal Transduction Section, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080304,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Fc gamma receptor IIB)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian', 'Clone Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Models, Immunological', 'Plasmids/isolation & purification', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/*immunology', 'Transfection']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/06/06 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-5890(07)00651-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2007.07.041 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2008 Apr;45(8):2411-8. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2007.07.041.

So far, most FeLV pathogenesis and vaccine studies were conducted assaying parameters, such as virus isolation and antigen detection. Accordingly, regressive infection was characterized by transient or undetectable viremia, while persistent viremia is typically observed in cats with progressive infection. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, the spectrum of host response categories to FeLV infection was recently refined by investigating proviral and plasma viral RNA loads. Cats believed to be immune to FeLV infection were found to turn provirus-positive after virus exposure. Moreover, efficacious FeLV vaccines were found unable to prevent provirus-integration and minimal viral replication. Remarkably, no difference was found in initial proviral and plasma viral RNA loads between cats with different infection outcomes. Only subsequently, the infection outcome is associated with FeLV loads. FeLV provirus was found to persist for years; reoccurrence of viremia and disease development was observed in some cats. Thus, aviremic provirus-positive cats are FeLV carriers and, following reactivation, may act as an infection source. However, integrated viral DNA may also be essential for solid protection and long-lasting maintenance of protective immunity. In conclusion, real-time TaqMan PCR and RT-PCR assays are highly sensitive and specific. They yield a more sensitive measure for FeLV exposure than antigen detection, virus isolation or immunofluoresence assays. We recommend the use of real-time PCR assays to identify FeLV exposed cats, particularly in catteries, and investigate obscure clinical cases that may be FeLV-associated. The use of sensitive molecular methods will contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the FeLV pathogenesis.","['Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina', 'Cattori, Valentino', 'Tandon, Ravi', 'Boretti, Felicitas S', 'Meli, Marina L', 'Riond, Barbara', 'Lutz, Hans']","['Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Cattori V', 'Tandon R', 'Boretti FS', 'Meli ML', 'Riond B', 'Lutz H']","['Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstr. 260, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland. rhofmann@vetclinics.uzh.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080119,Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/blood', 'Carrier State/immunology/veterinary/virology', 'Cats', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Feline/diagnosis/immunology/prevention & control/*virology', 'Proviruses/immunology', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Viral Load/veterinary']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(08)00023-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.01.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2008 May 15;123(1-2):119-23. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.01.017.

They represent footprints of ancient retroviral infection and are vertically transmitted from parents to their offspring. In the genome of all domestic cats, sequences closely related to exogenous FeLV known as endogenous feline leukemia virus (enFeLV), are present. enFeLV are incapable of giving rise to infectious virus particles. However, transcription and translation of enFeLV have been demonstrated in tissues of healthy cats and in feline cell lines. The presence of enFeLV-env has been shown in specific embryonic tissues and adult thymic cells. In addition, the enFeLV-env region recombines with FeLV subgroup A giving rise to an infectious FeLV-B virus. enFeLV envelope protein, FeLIX (FeLV infectivity X-essory protein) is also involved in mediating FeLV-T infection. In order to test the hypothesis that the enFeLV loads play a role in exogenous FeLV-A infection and pathogenesis, quantitative real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays were developed. An assay, specific to U3 region of all different subtypes of exogenous FeLV, was designed and applied to quantify exogenous FeLV proviral or viral load in cats, while three real-time PCR assays were designed to quantify U3 and env enFeLV loads (two within U3 amplifying different sequences; one within env). enFeLV loads were investigated in blood samples derived from Swiss privately owned domestic cats, specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats and European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris). Significant differences in enFeLV loads were observed between privately owned cats and SPF cats as well as among SPF cats originating from different catteries and among domestic cats of different breeds. When privately owned cats were compared, FeLV-infected cats had higher loads than uninfected cats. In addition, wildcats had higher enFeLV loads than domestic cats. In conclusion, the quantitative real-time PCR assays described herein are important prerequisites to quantify enFeLV proviral loads in felids and thus are important tools to investigate the role of enFeLV loads in FeLV infection.","['Tandon, Ravi', 'Cattori, Valentino', 'Willi, Barbara', 'Lutz, Hans', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina']","['Tandon R', 'Cattori V', 'Willi B', 'Lutz H', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R']","['Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland. rtandon@vetclinics.uzh.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080119,Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Wild', 'Cat Diseases/*virology', 'Cats', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Proviruses/chemistry/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*veterinary/virology']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(08)00025-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.01.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2008 May 15;123(1-2):129-33. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.01.027.

However, its role in the control of pRb-E2F complexes is not well established. TGFbeta inhibits phosphorylation of pRb at several serine and threonine residues and regulates the association of E2F transcription factors with pRb family proteins. Recent studies found that predominantly E2F-4, p130, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) are found to bind to corresponding E2F-responsive promoters in G0/G1 phase. As cells progress through mid-G1, p130-E2F4 complex are replaced by p107-E2F4 followed by activators E2F1, 2, and 3. pRb was not detectable in the promoters containing the E2F-responsive site in cycling cells but was associated with E2F4-p130 complexes or E2F4-p107 complexes during G0/G1 phase. In human myeloid leukemia cell line, MV4-11, TGFbeta upregulated pRb-E2F-4 and p130-E2F-4, and downregulated p107-E2F-4 complexes. However, pRB-E2F1 and pRb-E2F3 complexes were found in proliferating cells but not in TGFbeta arrested G1 cells. In addition, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA) could not detect pRb-E2F DNA-binding activities either in S or G1 phase but exhibited the existence of p107-E2F4 in proliferating cells and p130-E2F4 complexes in TGFbeta-arrested G1 cells, respectively. Our data suggest that p107 and p130, but not pRb, and the repressor E2F, but not activator E2Fs, play a critical role in regulating E2F-responsive gene expression in TGFbeta-mediated cell cycle control in human myeloid leukemia cells.","['Hu, Xiao Tang']",['Hu XT'],"['School of Natural and Health Science, Barry University, 11300 Northeast Second Avenue, Miami Shores, FL 33161, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080221,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'E2F Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(08)00327-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.02.051 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 May 2;369(2):277-80. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.02.051.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 1,032 patients underwent TBI in one or two fractions before autologous or allogeneic hematologic stem cell transplantation for acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The TBI regimens were normalized by using the biological effective dose (BED) concept. The BED values were divided into three dose groups. Study end points were relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis was performed, stratified by disease. RESULTS: In the highest TBI dose group, RI was significantly lower and NRM was higher vs. the lower dose groups. However, a significant influence on RFS and OS was not found. Relapses in the eye region were found only after shielding to very low doses. Age was of significant influence on OS, RFS, and NRM in favor of younger patients. The NRM of patients older than 40 years significantly increased, and OS decreased. There was no influence of age on RI. Men had better OS and RFS and lower NRM. Type of transplantation significantly influenced RI and NRM for patients with acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. There was no influence on RFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: Both RI and NRM were significantly influenced by the size of the BED of single-dose or two-fraction TBI regimens; OS and RFS were not. Age was of highly significant influence on NRM, but there was no influence of age on RI. Hyperfractionated TBI with a high BED might be useful, assuming NRM can be reduced.","['van Kempen-Harteveld, M Loes', 'Brand, Ronald', 'Kal, Henk B', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Hofman, Pieter', 'Schattenberg, Anton V', 'van der Maazen, Richard W', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Eijkenboom, Wil M H', 'van der Lelie, Johannes P', 'Oldenburger, Foppe', 'Barge, Renee M', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Vossen, Jaak M J J', 'Noordijk, Evert M', 'Struikmans, Henk']","['van Kempen-Harteveld ML', 'Brand R', 'Kal HB', 'Verdonck LF', 'Hofman P', 'Schattenberg AV', 'van der Maazen RW', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Eijkenboom WM', 'van der Lelie JP', 'Oldenburger F', 'Barge RM', 'van Biezen A', 'Vossen JM', 'Noordijk EM', 'Struikmans H']","['Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands. mlvankempen@tiscali.nl']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20080304,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', 'Radiation Protection/methods', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness', 'Sex Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/mortality']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2007/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(07)04749-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.11.072 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Aug 1;71(5):1444-54. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.11.072.

Patients with stage IV, relapsed or refractory diseases have a dismal prognosis, with survival measured in months only. To develop an efficacious chemotherapeutic regimen, we conducted a dose-escalation feasibility study of a new chemotherapeutic regimen, SMILE, comprising the steroid dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide. The components of SMILE are multidrug resistance-unrelated agents and etoposide. Etoposide shows both in vitro and in vivo efficacy for Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. Eligible patients had newly diagnosed stage IV, relapsed or refractory diseases after first-line chemotherapy, were 15-69 years of age, and had satisfactory performance scores (0-2). Four dose levels of methotrexate and etoposide were originally planned to be evaluated. At level 1, six patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, were enrolled. Their disease status was newly diagnosed stage IV (n = 3), first relapse (n = 2), and primary refractory (n = 1). All of the first three patients developed dose-limiting toxicities, and one of them died of sepsis with grade 4 neutropenia. A protocol revision stipulating early granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration was made. Two out of three additional patients developed dose-limiting toxicities that were all manageable and transient. For the six enrolled patients, the overall response rate was 67% and the complete response rate was 50%.

This phenomenon is known as translesion replication or replicative bypass. Failing this, the cell is increasingly likely to undergo apoptosis. In this study, we found that proteasome inhibitors prevent translesion replication in human cancer cells but not in normal cells. Three proteasome inhibitors, MG-132, lactacystin, and MG-262, inhibited UV-induced translesion replication in a wide range of cancer cell lines, including HeLa, HGC-27, MCF-7, HepG2, WiDr, a malignant melanoma, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and a multiple myeloma cell line; irrespective of cell origin, histological type, or p53 status. In contrast, these inhibitors had little or no influence on normal fibroblasts (NB1RGB and TIG-1) or a normal liver mesenchymal (LI90) cell line. Among the DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents, cisplatin caused a UV-type translesion reaction; the proteasome inhibitors delayed cisplatin-induced translesion replication in cancer cell lines but had only a weak effect on normal cell lines. Therefore, translesion replication would be an effective target of proteasome inhibitors for cancer chemotherapy by which cancer cells can be efficiently sensitized to DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents, such as cisplatin.","['Takezawa, Jun', 'Ishimi, Yukio', 'Yamada, Kouichi']","['Takezawa J', 'Ishimi Y', 'Yamada K']","['Division of Genetic Biochemistry, The National Institute of Health and Nutrition, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8636, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080224,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (MG 262)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Caffeine/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/05/20 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS764 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00764.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 May;99(5):863-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00764.x.

Imatinib inhibits the activity of chimeric kinase BCR-ABL, which is responsible for the development of CML. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of a multidrug resistance protein, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), in the evolution of CML treated with imatinib. We demonstrate here that although imatinib is a substrate for Pgp, cultured CML cells (strain K562/i-S9), overexpressing active Pgp, do not exhibit imatinib resistance. Studies of CML patients in the accelerated phase have shown variations in the number of Pgp-positive cells (Pgp+) among individual patients treated with imatinib. During treatment of patients with imatinib for 6-12 months, the number of Pgp-positive cells significantly increased in most patients. The high number of Pgp+ cells remained in patients at least for 4.5 years and correlated with active Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux. Such correlation was not found in the group of imatinib-resistant patients examined 35-60 months after onset of imatinib therapy: cells from the imatinib-resistant patients exhibited efficient Rh123 efflux irrespectively of Pgp expression. We also compared the mode of Rh123 efflux by cells from CML patients who underwent imatinib treatment for 6-24 months and the responsiveness of patients to this therapy.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Analysis of the bone density accretion in children and adolescents in various time after tretament for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 107 patients (70 males) who had been treated for ALL according to the protocol of the Polish Pediatric Leukemia, Lymphoma Study Group. Mean age at diagnosis was 7.3 years (range 1-19 years). They received chemotherapy with different doses of methotrexate: 46 patients - 5 g/m2; 24 - 2 g/m2 and 37 children received in doses of 0,5-1 g/m2. Cranial irradiation was performed in 22 patients in doses of 12 Gy, in 39 patients in doses of 18 Gy, 46 children did not receive cranial irradiation. The examinations were performed three times. First: immediately after end of maintenance therapy; second: 1,5 years after therapy and third: longer than 5 years after therapy. History of fractures, bone mineral density (BMD) measurements of lumbar spine (L2-L4) and total body were performed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (GE Medical Systems Lunar DPX-L), expressed as g/cm2 and compared to reference values obtained from the 473 age - and gender-matched healthy children from the same region of Poland. RESULTS: at all points we did not find any differences between studied group and age- and gender-matched peers: BMI Z-score 0.77 vs 1.57 vs 0.72); BMD-total Z-score (-0.11 vs 0.012 vs 0.21); BMD-spine Z-score (0.03 vs 0.10 vs 0.08). BMD SDS > - 2 in first study was observed in 11.5% patients, in second - in 10% and in last - in 7.1% patients. In consecutive examinations we observed accretion of bone mass, similar as in healthy populationi. Age at diagnosis, gender, cumulative doses of steroids, using CNS radtiotherapy, high doses of methotrexate did not relate to examined (after treatment) parameters. Patients with history of fractures had lower BMD-total in second assessment and lower BMD-spine in all examiantions, however, statistical significant was not reach. CONCLUSIONS: The disease itself and its complex treatment did not disturb the bone density accretion in examined patients. The patients with history of fractures (before and after tretament) tended to have lower mean values of bone density, (especially in region of spine) than patients without fractures. Small number of patients in last examination did not allowed to conclude about peak bone mass in our patients.","['Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Konstantynowicz, Jerzy', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna']","['Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Konstantynowicz J', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M']","['Akademia Medyczna w Bialymstoku, Klinika Onkologii Dzieciecej. kmroslan@amb.edu.pl']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Pol Merkur Lekarski,Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,9705469,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone Density/*drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/26 09:00,2008/03/15 09:00,['2008/02/26 09:00'],"['2008/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pol Merkur Lekarski. 2007 Oct;23(136):271-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Przyrost masy kostnej u chorych leczonych w dziecinstwie z powodu ostrej bialaczki limfoblastycznej.,,,,

(2002) Nat Med 8:613-619]. To identify whether LIF exerts direct effects within the central nervous system to limit demyelination, we have studied the influence of LIF upon the phenotype of mice challenged with cuprizone, a copper chelator, which produces a toxic oligodendrocytopathy. We find that exogenously administered LIF limits cuprizone-induced demyelination. Knockout mice deficient in LIF exhibit both potentiated demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss after cuprizone challenge, an effect that is ameliorated by exogenous LIF, arguing for a direct beneficial effect of endogenous LIF receptor signaling. Numbers of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in cuprizone-challenged mice are not influenced by either exogenous LIF or LIF deficiency, arguing for effects directed to the differentiated oligodendrocyte. Studies on the influence of LIF upon remyelination after cuprizone challenge fail to reveal any significant effect of exogenous LIF. The LIF-knockout mice do, however, display impaired remyelination, although oligodendrocyte replenishment, previously identified to occur from the progenitor pool, is not significantly compromised. Thus endogenous LIF receptor signaling is not only protective of oligodendrocytes but can also enhance remyelination, and exogenous LIF has therapeutic potential in limiting the consequences of oligodendrocyte damage.","['Marriott, Mark P', 'Emery, Ben', 'Cate, Holly S', 'Binder, Michele D', 'Kemper, Dennis', 'Wu, Qizhu', 'Kolbe, Scott', 'Gordon, Ian R', 'Wang, Hong', 'Egan, Gary', 'Murray, Simon', 'Butzkueven, Helmut', 'Kilpatrick, Trevor J']","['Marriott MP', 'Emery B', 'Cate HS', 'Binder MD', 'Kemper D', 'Wu Q', 'Kolbe S', 'Gordon IR', 'Wang H', 'Egan G', 'Murray S', 'Butzkueven H', 'Kilpatrick TJ']","['Howard Florey Institute, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Myelin Proteins)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', '5N16U7E0AO (Cuprizone)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Cuprizone', 'Demyelinating Diseases/chemically induced/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*administration & dosage/deficiency/*physiology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myelin Proteins/metabolism', 'Myelin Sheath/drug effects/*physiology', 'Oligodendroglia/pathology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Wound Healing/drug effects/genetics/*physiology']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/06/21 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/glia.20646 [doi]'],ppublish,Glia. 2008 Apr 15;56(6):686-98. doi: 10.1002/glia.20646.,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURES: Sunitinib was tested at concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 1.0 microM against 23 cell lines from the PPTP in vitro panel. We also compared sunitinib (53.5 mg/kg) or vehicle administered for 28 days by oral gavage in 46 murine xenograft models representing 9 distinct pediatric cancer histologies. RESULTS: The leukemia cell line, Kasumi-1 (gain-of-function KIT(Asn822Lys) mutation) was the only line with an in vitro response to sunitinib (IC(50) 75.7 nM). Sunitinib significantly prolonged EFS in 19 of 35 (54%) of the solid tumor, and in 3 of 8 (38%) of the ALL xenografts analyzed. Using the PPTP time to event measure of efficacy, sunitinib had intermediate (13) and high (1) levels of activity against 14 of 34 evaluable solid tumor xenografts, including 4 of 6 rhabdomyosarcoma, 4 of 5 Ewing tumor, and 2 of 3 rhabdoid tumor xenografts. Following cessation of treatment for the 14 solid tumor xenografts without tumor events by day 28, tumor growth rate increased in most. The only regression noted to sunitinib in the solid tumor panels was a complete response in a rhabdoid tumor xenograft. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition against most of the PPTP's solid tumor panels, but little activity against the neuroblastoma and ALL panel. Antitumor activity was manifested primarily as tumor growth delay, consistent with an anti-angiogenic effect for sunitinib against many of the pediatric preclinical models evaluated.

The functional alterations of neutrophils by hyperglycemia are thought to be partially responsible for such infections. In this study, we investigated the functional changes of neutrophil-like differentiated cell lines (dHL-60, dTHP-1, and dNB-4) by treatment with 5.5 mM, 11 mM, or 35 mM of glucose. In dHL-60 cells, the incubation with high glucose (35 mM) resulted in the enhancement of cell aggregation, the suppression of cellular fragility, the induction of reactive-oxygen species (ROS) production by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation, and the impairment of phagocytosis. In dTHP-1 cells, the treatment with higher glucose generated the suppression of cellular fragility and extremely impaired phagocytosis (by 35 mM), and induced ROS production due to PMA stimulation (by 11 mM). Furthermore, the higher glucose exposure to dNB-4 cells enlarged intracellular vacuoles (by 35 mM) and induced ROS production due to PMA stimulation (by 11 mM). Since the ROS generation of those cells was enhanced only after PMA stimulation under the higher glucose conditions, glucose may have a priming effect rather than a triggering effect. These extraordinary sensitivities caused by the higher glucose treatments may reflect the dysfunction or overactivation of neutrophils.","['Oya-Ito, Tomoko', 'Naitou, Hirotaka', 'Masuda, Shuichi', 'Kinae, Naohide', 'Ohashi, Norio']","['Oya-Ito T', 'Naitou H', 'Masuda S', 'Kinae N', 'Ohashi N']","['Graduate School of Nutritional and Environmental Sciences, University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Mol Nutr Food Res,Molecular nutrition & food research,101231818,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3OWL53L36A (Mannitol)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Aggregation/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glucose/administration & dosage', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mannitol/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Vacuoles/drug effects']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mnfr.200600122 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Nutr Food Res. 2008 Mar;52(3):360-9. doi: 10.1002/mnfr.200600122.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of nonrandom cytogenetic abnormalities in human leukemia and lymphoma was recognized over 40 years ago, but the mechanisms of genome reorganization remain incompletely understood. The development of molecular cytogenetics, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technology, has played a significant role in our understanding of cancer biology by providing a means for 'interrogating' tumor cells for a variety of gross genetic changes in the form of either numerical or structural chromosome aberrations. Here, we have identified cytogenetic abnormalities in naturally occurring canine hematopoietic tumors that are evolutionarily conserved compared with those that are considered characteristic of the corresponding human condition.

A total of 40 newly diagnosed patients consist of children [31 cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 9 cases with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)] were prospectively included into the study. The online real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR was used for the quantification of hTERT in bone marrow (BM). All cases were re-evaluated for their survival after 2 years. The highest hTERT mRNA value was observed in Pre B-cell ALL patients followed by B-cell ALL, T-cell ALL and AML. The hTERT mRNA relative ratio difference between the ALL and AML groups was significant. No significant association was found when hTERT mRNA expression was evaluated in relation with the hematological parameters (except hemoglobin level), blast percentages and the risk groups. No significant difference was determined between the rate of complete remission and relapse of cases with the hTERT mRNA values in all malignancy groups. Patients who had higher initial hTERT mRNA values showed significantly longer disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in ALL (P = 0.000 and 0.01, respectively). Although DFS and OS was longer in AML patients with lower initial hTERT mRNA, the difference was not significant. In conclusion, the hTERT mRNA expression values were not significantly associated with the known prognostic factors in children both with ALL and AML. hTERT mRNA value is a significant factor for childhood ALL at diagnosis in relation to the estimated survival.","['Cogulu, Ozgur', 'Kosova, Buket', 'Gunduz, Cumhur', 'Karaca, Emin', 'Aksoylar, Serap', 'Erbay, Ayse', 'Karapinar, Deniz', 'Vergin, Canan', 'Vural, Filiz', 'Tombuloglu, Murat', 'Cetingul, Nazan', 'Ozkinay, Ferda']","['Cogulu O', 'Kosova B', 'Gunduz C', 'Karaca E', 'Aksoylar S', 'Erbay A', 'Karapinar D', 'Vergin C', 'Vural F', 'Tombuloglu M', 'Cetingul N', 'Ozkinay F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University, 35100, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey. ozgur.cogulu@ege.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080222,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12185-008-0054-y [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Apr;87(3):276-83. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0054-y.

In this report, we demonstrate significantly increased levels of TF-specific procoagulant activity (PCA) of plasma MPs in five patients presenting with overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to an underlying malignancy, including non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 1), melanoma (n = 1), prostate cancer (n = 2), and acute promyelocytic leukemia (n = 1). Clotting experiments on available tumor cell samples suggested that cancer cells were a potential source of circulating TF-positive MPs at least in three of the five patients. Furthermore, follow-up plasma samples from two surviving patients revealed that response of their malignancies to specific anti-cancer therapy was paralleled by resolution of overt DIC and a significant decline in MP-associated TF PCA. Levels of plasma TF antigen, as assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were also increased at presentation albeit to a lesser extent compared to MP-associated TF PCA, likely due to insufficient solubilization of the phospholipid-incorporated full-length TF molecule by the detergent. In summary, our findings suggest that MP-associated TF PCA may play an important pathogenic role in the evolution of overt DIC in various types of malignancy.","['Langer, Florian', 'Spath, Brigitte', 'Haubold, Katja', 'Holstein, Katharina', 'Marx, Guy', 'Wierecky, Jan', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Dierlamm, Judith', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Eifrig, Barbara']","['Langer F', 'Spath B', 'Haubold K', 'Holstein K', 'Marx G', 'Wierecky J', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Dierlamm J', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Eifrig B']","['Onkologisches Zentrum, II.

We tested apoptosis-inducing ability of short hairpin RNAs targeting exon 5 (shWTE5), exon10 (shWTE10) and 3'UTR (shWT3U) of the WT1 gene. Among the three WT1-shRNAs, since shWTE5 most effectively induced apoptosis, its ability as an apoptosis-inducing agent was intensively examined. shWTE5 induced mitochondrial damage and resultant apoptosis in five WT1-expressing solid cancer cells originated from gastric (AZ-521), lung (LU99B), ovarian (TYKnuCPr) cancers, fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) and glioblastoma (A172). Moreover, shWTE5 significantly enhanced apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents, doxorubicin (DOX) and etoposide (ETP), or by death ligand TRAIL in all of the four solid tumor cells examined (HT-1080, LU99B, TYK and A172). Transduction of one each of WT1 isoforms with exon 5 [17AA(+)KTS(+) and 17AA(+)KTS(-)] prevented mitochondrial damage induced by ETP or TRAIL and inhibited apoptosis. These results showed that shWTE5 induced apoptosis through the suppression of the WT1 isoform with exon 5. Furthermore, shWTE5 increased expression of proapoptotic Bak and Bax proteins and decreased antiapoptotic Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 proteins in WT1-expressing HT-1080 cells, indicating that WT1 isoforms with exon 5 might play an antiapoptotic role through regulation of Bcl-2 family genes in solid tumor cells. The results presented here demonstrated that WT1-shRNA targeting exon 5 should serve as a potent anti-cancer agent for various types of solid tumors.","['Tatsumi, Naoya', 'Oji, Yusuke', 'Tsuji, Naoko', 'Tsuda, Asako', 'Higashio, Mari', 'Aoyagi, Sayaka', 'Fukuda, Ikuyo', 'Ito, Ken', 'Nakamura, Junya', 'Takashima, Satoshi', 'Kitamura, Yayoi', 'Miyai, Saori', 'Jomgeow, Tanyarat', 'Li, Zheyu', 'Shirakata, Toshiaki', 'Nishida, Sumiyuki', 'Tsuboi, Akihiro', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Sugiyama, Haruo']","['Tatsumi N', 'Oji Y', 'Tsuji N', 'Tsuda A', 'Higashio M', 'Aoyagi S', 'Fukuda I', 'Ito K', 'Nakamura J', 'Takashima S', 'Kitamura Y', 'Miyai S', 'Jomgeow T', 'Li Z', 'Shirakata T', 'Nishida S', 'Tsuboi A', 'Oka Y', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor/physiology', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genetic Therapy', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'WT1 Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Mar;32(3):701-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PSP treatment enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin (Doxo), etoposide (VP-16) but not cytarabine (Ara-C). Bivariate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)/DNA flow cytometry analysis estimated a longer DNA synthesis time (Ts) for the PSP treated cancerous cells suggesting that PSP enhanced the apoptotic effect of Doxo and VP-16 via creating an S-phase trap in the human breast cancer cell line ZR-75-30. The participation of PSP in the apoptotic machinery of the chemotherapeutic agents was further supported by a reduced ratio of protein expression of Bcl-xL/Bax of the cancer cells. This study provides further insight into the synergistic mechanisms of PSP and supports the hypothesis that the anticancer potentials of PSP is not limited to leukemia but may also be used as an adjuvant therapy for breast cancers.","['Wan, Jennifer Man-Fan', 'Sit, Wai-Hung', 'Louie, Jimmy Chun-Yu']","['Wan JM', 'Sit WH', 'Louie JC']","['Food and Nutritional Science Division, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, PR China. jmfwan@hkusua.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (polysaccharide peptide)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Proteoglycans/*pharmacology']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Mar;32(3):689-99.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is thought that the inhibition of telomerase is a target of retinoids and is closely tied to the differentiated phenotype. This study demonstrates the epigenetic changes associated with ATRA-induced inhibition of telomerase activity, including the hypoacetylation and hypermethylation of the hTERT promoter. Further, we have found changes in the differential expression of the three DNA methyltransferases during ATRA-induced differentiation of HL60 human leukemia cells. These results suggest that alteration of DNA methylation may play a role in the activation of telomerase in cancer cells and that epigenetic mechanisms may represent a target for differentiation therapy mechanisms.

However, the potential use of LfcinB as an anticancer agent is presently limited by the need for relatively high concentrations of the peptide to trigger apoptosis. Ceramide is a membrane sphingolipid that is believed to function as a second messenger during apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the role of ceramide in LfcinB-induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM and Jurkat T-leukemia cell lines. Exposure to LfcinB caused nuclear condensation and fragmentation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and DNA fragmentation in CCRF-CEM and Jurkat T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Treatment with C6 ceramide, a cell-permeable, short-chain ceramide analog, also induced apoptotic nuclear morphology, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation in T-leukemia cells. Although LfcinB treatment did not cause ceramide to accumulate in CCRF-CEM or Jurkat cells, the addition of C6 ceramide to LfcinB-treated T-leukemia cells resulted in increased DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, modulation of cellular ceramide metabolism either by inhibiting ceramidases with D-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol or N-oleoylethanolamine, or by blocking glucosylceramide synthase activity with 1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, enhanced the ability of LfcinB to trigger apoptosis in both Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells. In addition, LfcinB-induced apoptosis of T-leukemia cells was enhanced in the presence of the antiestrogen tamoxifen, which has multiple effects on cancer cells, including inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase activity. We conclude that manipulation of cellular ceramide levels in combination with LfcinB therapy warrants further investigation as a novel strategy for the treatment of T cell-derived leukemias.","['Furlong, Suzanne J', 'Ridgway, Neale D', 'Hoskin, David W']","['Furlong SJ', 'Ridgway ND', 'Hoskin DW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 1X5, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '146897-68-9 (lactoferricin B)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.23 (Ceramidases)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramidases', 'Ceramides/*metabolism/physiology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glucosyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactoferrin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Mar;32(3):537-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once activated, the mutant receptor requires the function of Stat5 in order to effect clonal expansion of this stem cell population.

NK cell-mediated rejection of allogeneic BMCs is dependent on donor and recipient MHC alleles and other factors that are not yet fully characterized. Whereas the molecular mechanisms of allogeneic MHC recognition by NK receptors have been well studied in vitro, guidelines to understand NK cell allogeneic reactivity under the control of multiple genetic components in vivo remain less well understood. In this study, we use congenic mice to show that BMC rejection is regulated by haplotypes of the NK gene complex (NKC) that encodes multiple NK cell receptors. Most importantly, host MHC differences modulated the NKC effect. Moreover, the NKC allelic differences also affected the outcome of hybrid resistance whereby F1 hybrid mice reject parental BMCs. Therefore, these data indicate that NK cell alloreactivity in vivo is dependent on the combination of the host NKC and MHC haplotypes. These data suggest that the NK cell self-tolerance process dynamically modulates the NK cell alloreactivity in vivo.","['Iizuka, Koho', 'Scalzo, Anthony A', 'Xian, Hong', 'Yokoyama, Wayne M']","['Iizuka K', 'Scalzo AA', 'Xian H', 'Yokoyama WM']","['Department of Medicine, Rheumatology Division, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63310, USA. iizuk001@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily B)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, NK Cell Lectin-Like)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Graft Rejection/genetics/immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', '*Haplotypes/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Multigene Family/*immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily B', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Receptors, NK Cell Lectin-Like', 'Self Tolerance/genetics', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/deficiency/genetics']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['180/5/3260 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.180.5.3260 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Mar 1;180(5):3260-7. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.180.5.3260.,,,['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some cases respond to the in vitro cross-linking of surface immunoglobulin (sIg) with effective activation. In contrast, the remaining cases do not respond to such stimulation, thereby resembling B cells anergized after antigen encounter in vivo. However the biochemical differences between the 2 groups are ill defined, and in humans the term B-cell anergy lacks a molecular definition. We examined the expression and activation of key molecules involved in signaling pathways originating from the BCR, and we report that a proportion of CLL patients (a) expresses constitutively phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in the absence of AKT activation; (b) displays constitutive phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and increased nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) transactivation; and (c) is characterized by cellular unresponsiveness to sIg ligation. This molecular profile recapitulates the signaling pattern of anergic murine B cells. Our data indicate that constitutive activation of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway along with NF-AT transactivation in the absence of AKT activation may also represent the molecular signature of anergic human B lymphocytes. CLL cases with this signature may be taken as a human model of anergic B cells aberrantly expanded.","['Muzio, Marta', 'Apollonio, Benedetta', 'Scielzo, Cristina', 'Frenquelli, Michela', 'Vandoni, Irene', 'Boussiotis, Vassiliki', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Muzio M', 'Apollonio B', 'Scielzo C', 'Frenquelli M', 'Vandoni I', 'Boussiotis V', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Ghia P']","['Department of Oncology, Unit and Laboratory of Lymphoid Malignancies, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080221,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Clonal Anergy', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/07/18 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)47059-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-111344 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Jul 1;112(1):188-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-111344.

Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, interferes with mitochondrial activation to inhibit apoptosis. Here, we have determined the effect of CUGBP2 on Mcl-1 expression. We developed a HCUG2 cell line by stably expressing CUGBP2 in the HCT-116 colon cancer cells. HCUG2 cells demonstrate decreased levels of proliferation and increased apoptosis, compared with HCT-116 cells. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated higher levels of cells in the G(2)-M phase. Western blot analyses demonstrated that there was decreased Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 protein but increased expression of Bax, cyclin B1, and Cdc2. Immunocytochemistry also demonstrated increased levels of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 in the nucleus of HCUG2 cells. However, there was colocalization of phosphorylated histone H3 with transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). Furthermore, immunostaining for alpha-tubulin demonstrated that there was disorganization of microtubules. These data suggest that CUGBP2 expression in HCUG2 cells induces the cells to undergo apoptosis during the G(2)-M phase of the cell cycle. We next determined the mechanism of CUGBP2-mediated reduction in Mcl-1 expression. Mcl-1 protein, but not Mcl-1 mRNA, was lower in HCUG2 cells, suggesting translation inhibition. CUGBP2 binds to Mcl-1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) both in vitro and in HCUG2 cells. Furthermore, CUGBP2 increased the stability of both endogenous Mcl-1 and luciferase mRNA containing the Mcl-1 3'-UTR. However, luciferase protein expression from the luciferase-Mcl-1 3'-UTR mRNA was suppressed. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CUGBP2 inhibits Mcl-1 expression by inhibiting Mcl-1 mRNA translation, resulting in driving the cells to apoptosis during the G(2) phase of the cell cycle.","['Subramaniam, Dharmalingam', 'Natarajan, Gopalan', 'Ramalingam, Satish', 'Ramachandran, Ilangovan', 'May, Randal', 'Queimado, Lurdes', 'Houchen, Courtney W', 'Anant, Shrikant']","['Subramaniam D', 'Natarajan G', 'Ramalingam S', 'Ramachandran I', 'May R', 'Queimado L', 'Houchen CW', 'Anant S']","['Dept. of Medicine, Univ. of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080221,United States,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,American journal of physiology.

We tested the hypothesis that LIF expression in human skeletal muscle is regulated by exercise. Fifteen healthy young male volunteers performed either 3 h of cycle ergometer exercise at approximately 60% of VO2,max(n = 8) or rested (n = 7). Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis prior to exercise, immediately after exercise, and at 1.5, 3, 6 and 24 h post exercise. Control subjects had biopsy samples taken at the same time points as during the exercise trial. Skeletal muscle LIF mRNA increased immediately after the exercise and declined gradually during recovery. However, LIF protein was unchanged at the investigated time points. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that LIF mRNA and protein expressions are modulated by calcium (Ca(2+)) in primary human skeletal myocytes. Treatment of myocytes with the Ca(2+) ionophore, ionomycin, for 6 h resulted in an increase in both LIF mRNA and LIF protein levels. This finding suggests that Ca(2+) may be involved in the regulation of LIF in endurance-exercised skeletal muscle. In conclusion, primary human skeletal myocytes have the capability to produce LIF in response to ionomycin stimulation and LIF mRNA levels increase in skeletal muscle following concentric exercise. The finding that the increase in LIF mRNA levels is not followed by a similar increase in skeletal muscle LIF protein suggests that other exercise stimuli or repetitive stimuli are necessary in order to induce a detectable accumulation of LIF protein.","['Broholm, Christa', 'Mortensen, Ole Hartvig', 'Nielsen, Soren', 'Akerstrom, Thorbjorn', 'Zankari, Alaa', 'Dahl, Benny', 'Pedersen, Bente Klarlund']","['Broholm C', 'Mortensen OH', 'Nielsen S', 'Akerstrom T', 'Zankari A', 'Dahl B', 'Pedersen BK']","['Centre of Inflammation and Metabolism, Rigshospitalet - Section 7641, Tagensvej 20, DK-2100, Copenhagen, Denmark. bkp@rh.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080221,England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Muscle Contraction/*physiology', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/*physiology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*physiology', 'Physical Endurance/*physiology', 'Physical Exertion/*physiology']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['jphysiol.2007.149781 [pii]', '10.1113/jphysiol.2007.149781 [doi]']",ppublish,J Physiol. 2008 Apr 15;586(8):2195-201. doi: 10.1113/jphysiol.2007.149781.

In developing new molecular tests under physiological ex vivo conditions, we quantified the production of mRNAs for p21 and PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis), which are involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, respectively. METHODS: We stimulated human whole blood with a chemotherapeutic drug (cytarabine, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, aclarubicin, etoposide, or idarubicin) for 4 h and then quantified mRNA by assessing mRNA recovery and cDNA-synthesis efficiency in each sample. We also used immunoassay and flow cytometry to investigate nucleosome and annexin V, respectively, as apoptosis markers. RESULTS: Ex vivo mRNA analysis yielded more positive results than nucleosome and annexin V analyses. The concentrations of cytarabine- and daunorubicin-induced p21 and PUMA mRNAs were significantly lower in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients than in healthy controls (P <0.0001), whereas idarubicin induced significantly greater responses in AML patients than in controls (P = 0.01). The patients had different mRNA-response patterns, which were largely classifiable into 4 groups. Prednisone enhanced cytarabine or mitoxantrone induction of p21 and PUMA mRNAs in 3 (2.6%) of 114 reactions. All 15 patients who achieved complete remission had received at least one drug that produced positive mRNA responses, whereas we observed a lack of mRNA response to the clinically used drugs in all 3 cases in which the therapy failed to induce any hematologic improvement.

Here we set out to target the macropinocytotic pathway with a combinatorial approach. From the screening of acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia Molt-4 cells with a random phage-display peptide library, we isolated a phage displaying the sequence CAYHRLRRC. This peptide contains a lymph node-homing motif (Cys-Ala-Tyr) and a cell-penetrating motif (Arg-Leu-Arg-Arg). Binding of this ligand-directed phage to a large panel of leukemia/lymphoma cells and to patient-derived samples was much higher than to non-leukemia control cells. CAYHRLRRC phage internalization into Molt-4 cells is both energy- and temperature-dependent. Flow cytometry with fluorescein-labeled peptide and endocytosis blocking with specific inhibitors revealed that CAYHRLRRC is indeed taken up through macropinocytosis in Molt-4 and K562 human leukemia cells. Unexpectedly, the cell surface receptor for the CAYHRLRRC peptide is not a heparan sulfate proteoglycan as it would be predicted for other cell-penetrating peptides. Confirming this interpretation, a CAYHRLRRC-directed peptidomimetic-induced cell death in all the leukemia and lymphoma cells was evaluated, whereas a control transactivator of transcription protein (tat)-directed proapoptotic peptidomimetic was non-selective. In summary, the targeting peptide CAYHRLRRC is selectively internalized through macropinocytosis in leukemia and lymphoma cells and has potential as a drug lead for ligand-directed anti-leukemia therapies.","['Nishimura, Shinpei', 'Takahashi, Shunsuke', 'Kamikatahira, Hiromi', 'Kuroki, Yuko', 'Jaalouk, Diana E', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Koivunen, Erkki', 'Arap, Wadih', 'Pasqualini, Renata', 'Nakayama, Hitoshi', 'Kuniyasu, Akihiko']","['Nishimura S', 'Takahashi S', 'Kamikatahira H', 'Kuroki Y', 'Jaalouk DE', ""O'Brien S"", 'Koivunen E', 'Arap W', 'Pasqualini R', 'Nakayama H', 'Kuniyasu A']","['Department of Molecular Cell Function, Graduate School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, 5-1 Ohe-honmachi, Kumamoto 862-0973, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080221,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/methods', 'Drug Design', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Pinocytosis']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)61970-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M708849200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Apr 25;283(17):11752-62. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M708849200.

Constitutive JAK activation leads to persistent activation of STAT transcription factors, and several cancers exhibit constitutive STAT activation, in the absence of JAK or STAT activating mutations. Recently, a unique somatic mutation in JAK2 was identified in a majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. This mutation, encoding a V617F substitution, promotes JAK2 catalytic activation and cytokine-independent signaling. JAK2 and JAK3 mutations have also been identified in a minority of polycythemia vera and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia patients, and it is predicted that further JAK-STAT mutations will be identified in different cancers. Recent discoveries also suggest that mutated JAK proteins will be potent targets for anti-cancer therapy.","['Constantinescu, Stefan N', 'Girardot, Michael', 'Pecquet, Christian']","['Constantinescu SN', 'Girardot M', 'Pecquet C']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels B-1200, Belgium. stefan.constantinescu@bru.licr.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Trends Biochem Sci,Trends in biochemical sciences,7610674,"['0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'STAT Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0004(08)00025-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.tibs.2007.12.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Biochem Sci. 2008 Mar;33(3):122-31. doi: 10.1016/j.tibs.2007.12.002.,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This hypothesis was prospectively tested. METHODS: Between May 1997 and April 2001, 180 men with clinical stage T1c-T3cN0M0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate were registered on a study evaluating whether the endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI)-defined change in tumor volume (TV) during neoadjuvant (n) AST was associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) outcome. Of these, 141 had sufficient tissue to perform immunohistochemical detection of the p53 protein expression status and 113 had complete eMRI information. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to assess whether p53 protein expression status predicted time to PSA failure adjusting for known prognostic factors. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 6.9 years and adjusting for PSA level, Gleason score, clinical stage, and eMRI-defined TV change during nAST, men with abnormal compared with normal p53 expression were at increased risk of PSA failure (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-5.9; P = 0.008 for the 141; HR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.1-5.4; P = 0.03 for the 113). Adjusted estimates of PSA failure were significantly higher (P = 0.03) in men with abnormal compared with normal p53 expression. At 5 years, these respective estimates were 33% and 18%. CONCLUSIONS: Maximizing local control and randomized trials evaluating the impact on survival of adding novel agents to maximal local therapy are warranted in men whose prostate cancer demonstrates abnormal p53 expression.","[""D'Amico, Anthony V"", 'Halabi, Susan', 'Vollmer, Robin', 'Loffredo, Marian', 'McMahon, Elizabeth', 'Sanford, Ben', 'Archer, Laura', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Small, Eric J', 'Kantoff, Philip W']","[""D'Amico AV"", 'Halabi S', 'Vollmer R', 'Loffredo M', 'McMahon E', 'Sanford B', 'Archer L', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Small EJ', 'Kantoff PW']","[""Department of Radiation Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA. adamico@partners.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080221,United States,Urology,Urology,0366151,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '76W6J0943E (Flutamide)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Flutamide/*therapeutic use', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/*agonists', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/06/03 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0090-4295(07)02353-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.urology.2007.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Urology. 2008 May;71(5):933-7. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2007.11.005.

Recent studies have demonstrated an important role for aberrant transcriptional regulation in AML pathophysiology. Although several transcription factors (TFs) involved in myeloid development and leukemia have been studied extensively and independently, how these TFs coordinate with others and how their dysregulation perturbs the genetic circuitry underlying myeloid differentiation is not yet known. We propose an integrated approach for mammalian genetic network construction by combining the analysis of gene expression profiling data and the identification of TF binding sites. RESULTS: We utilized our approach to construct the genetic circuitries operating in normal myeloid differentiation versus acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of AML. In the normal and disease networks, we found that multiple transcriptional regulatory cascades converge on the TFs Rora and Rxra, respectively. Furthermore, the TFs dysregulated in APL participate in a common regulatory pathway and may perturb the normal network through Fos. Finally, a model of APL pathogenesis is proposed in which the chimeric TF PML-RARalpha activates the dysregulation in APL through six mediator TFs. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates the utility of our approach to construct mammalian genetic networks, and to obtain new insights regarding regulatory circuitries operating in complex diseases in humans.","['Chang, Li Wei', 'Payton, Jacqueline E', 'Yuan, Wenlin', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Nagarajan, Rakesh', 'Stormo, Gary D']","['Chang LW', 'Payton JE', 'Yuan W', 'Ley TJ', 'Nagarajan R', 'Stormo GD']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University, St Louis, MO 63130, USA. lwc1@ural.wustl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080221,England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Computational Biology/*methods', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology', 'Rats', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2007/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['gb-2008-9-2-r38 [pii]', '10.1186/gb-2008-9-2-r38 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Biol. 2008;9(2):R38. doi: 10.1186/gb-2008-9-2-r38.

Our focus is on vector-valued data sources, each consisting of measurements of the same entity but on different variables, and on tasks where source-specific variation is considered noisy or not interesting. Principal components analysis of all sources combined together is an obvious choice if it is not important to distinguish between data source-specific and shared variation. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) focuses on mutual dependencies and discards source-specific ""noise"" but it produces a separate set of components for each source. RESULTS: It turns out that components given by CCA can be combined easily to produce a linear and hence fast and easily interpretable feature extraction method. The method fuses together several sources, such that the properties they share are preserved. Source-specific variation is discarded as uninteresting. We give the details and implement them in a software tool. The method is demonstrated on gene expression measurements in three case studies: classification of cell cycle regulated genes in yeast, identification of differentially expressed genes in leukemia, and defining stress response in yeast. The software package is available at http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/mi/software/drCCA/. CONCLUSION: We introduced a method for the task of data fusion for exploratory data analysis, when statistical dependencies between the sources and not within a source are interesting.

However, the biochemical basis by which Nanog achieves this function remains unknown. In the present study, we show that Nanog dimerizes through a functionally critical domain. Co-immunoprecipitation of Nanog molecules tagged with distinct epitopes demonstrates that Nanog self-associates through a region in which every fifth residue is tryptophan. In vitro binding experiments establish that this region participates directly in self-association. Moreover, analytical ultracentrifugation indicates that, in solution, Nanog is in equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms with a K(d) of 3 muM. The functional importance of Nanog dimerization is established by ES cell colony-forming assays in which deletion of the tryptophan-repeat region eliminates the capacity of Nanog to direct LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor)-independent self-renewal.","['Mullin, Nicholas P', 'Yates, Adam', 'Rowe, Arthur J', 'Nijmeijer, Bianca', 'Colby, Douglas', 'Barlow, Paul N', 'Walkinshaw, Malcolm D', 'Chambers, Ian']","['Mullin NP', 'Yates A', 'Rowe AJ', 'Nijmeijer B', 'Colby D', 'Barlow PN', 'Walkinshaw MD', 'Chambers I']","[""MRC Centre Development in Stem Cell Biology, Institute for Stem Cell Research, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, U.K.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2008/02/23 09:00,2008/04/25 09:00,['2008/02/23 09:00'],"['2008/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20080134 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20080134 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2008 Apr 15;411(2):227-31. doi: 10.1042/BJ20080134.,,,['G19/38/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,['Biochem J. 2008 Apr 15;411(2):e5-7.

CASE DESCRIPTION: Presented patient underwent alloSCT in second complete hematological and cytogenetic remission with presence of promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor A (PML-RARA) detected in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with sensitivity of 10(-2). After transplant, this patient remained in complete hematological and cytogenetic remission but nested RT-PCR assays with detection thresholds of 10(-3)/10(-4) were positive for PML-RARA rearranged gene even chimerism tests showed 100% of donor profile. He was in a very good clinical condition and presented symptoms of transient limited chronic graft vs. host disease. Twenty one months after transplant, the leukemic relapse in the pleura, heart and pericardium was diagnosed. At that time, PML-RARA transcript detected in RT-PCR assay (10(-2)) was positive for the first time after transplant. During salvage chemotherapy he died because of cardiogenic shock.

Therefore, IL-32 has been primarily studied in inflammatory models such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. The regulation of endogenous IL-32 in other immune cells remains unknown. In the present study, we stimulated Jurkat T cells with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and examined IL-32 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. All mRNAs of the four IL-32 isoforms and the 12-15 kDa IL-32 protein were independent of PHA and PMA stimulation, however a 9 kDa molecular weight IL-32 protein in the cell culture supernatant was induced by PHA and PMA after 16 h of stimulation. Compared to other human cell lines, the Jurkat cell line constitutively expressed a 12-15 kDa molecule of IL-32, which is smaller than the known IL-32 isoforms. We used IL-32 shRNA to examine the specificity of the 12-15 kDa molecule. Upon IL-32 shRNA transfection, the 12-15 kDa band was decreased specifically as compared to the control scrambled clone. Thus, the constitutive expression of IL-32 mRNA as well as the predominant production of a smaller sized IL-32 isoform in Jurkat cells may implicate a role for IL-32 in human T cell leukemia.","['Ko, Na-Young', 'Chang, Sung-Ho', 'Lee, Jun-Ho', 'Kim, Nam-Wook', 'Kim, Young-Mi', 'Choi, Wahn-Soo', 'Choi, Ji-Da', 'Bae, Su-Young', 'Hong, Jae-Woo', 'Jaekal, Jun', 'Azam, Tania', 'Her, Erk', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun']","['Ko NY', 'Chang SH', 'Lee JH', 'Kim NW', 'Kim YM', 'Choi WS', 'Choi JD', 'Bae SY', 'Hong JW', 'Jaekal J', 'Azam T', 'Her E', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju 380-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080304,England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (IL32 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Jurkat Cells', 'Myeloblastin/metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/immunology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/immunology']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(08)00005-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2008.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2008 Apr;42(1):121-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2008.01.004.

The disease outcome of natural FeLV infection is variable and likely reflects genetic variation both in the virus and the naturally outbreeding host population. A series of studies have been undertaken with the objectives of examining natural FeLV genetic variation, the selective pressures operative in FeLV infection that lead to predominance of natural variants, and the consequences for infection and disease progression. Genetic variation among FeLV isolates was examined in a cohort of naturally infected cats with thymic lymphoma of T-cell origin, non-T-cell multicentric lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorder or anemia. The predominant isolate in the cohort, designated FeLV-945, was identified exclusively in disorders of non-T-cell origin. The FeLV-945 LTR was shown to contain a unique 21-bp repeat element, triplicated in tandem downstream of enhancer. The 21-bp triplication was shown to act as a transcriptional enhancer and to confer a replicative advantage through the assembly of a distinctive transcription factor complex. Oncogene utilization during tumor induction by FeLV-945 was studied using a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus containing the FeLV-945 LTR. This approach identified novel loci of common proviral integration in tumors, including the regulatory subunit of PI-3Kgamma. Mutational changes identified in FeLV-945 SU were shown not to alter receptor usage as measured by host range and superinfection interference, but to significantly increase the efficiency of receptor binding. To determine whether the unique sequence elements of FeLV-945 influence the course of infection and disease in vivo, recombinant viruses were constructed in which the FeLV-945 LTR alone, or the FeLV-945 SU gene and LTR were substituted into the prototype isolate FeLV-A/61E. Longitudinal studies of infected animals showed that substitution of the FeLV-945 LTR into FeLV-A/61E resulted in a significantly more rapid disease onset, but did not alter the tumorigenic spectrum. In contrast, substitution of both the FeLV-945 LTR and SU gene changed the disease outcome entirely. Together, these observations indicate that the distinctive LTR and SU gene of FeLV-945 mediate a rapid pathogenesis with distinctive clinical features and oncogenic mechanisms.","['Levy, Laura S']",['Levy LS'],"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane University School of Medicine, 1430 Tulane Avenue SL-38, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA. llevy@tulane.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20080119,Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*virology', 'Cats', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Retroviridae Infections/*veterinary/*virology', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*veterinary/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(08)00012-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.01.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2008 May 15;123(1-2):14-22. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.01.008.

HA exerted negative effects on beta-hexoaminidase secretion and histamine release in antigen-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL2H3) cells. HA inhibited interaction between IgE and FcepsilonRI and between FcepsilonRI and PKCdelta. HA inhibited CD44 interaction with PKCalpha, indicating that HA targets CD44. PKCalpha and -delta were responsible for increased Rac1 activity and expression of p47(phox), p67(phox). HA inhibited phosphorylation of PKCalpha and -delta. Rac1 was responsible for increased ROS, and NADPH oxidase was the main source for ROS. The inhibition of PKC prevented antigen from increasing phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK. ERK, p38 MAPK, and ROS, were responsible for secretion of beta-hexosaminidase, histamine release, and induction of chemokines. HA suppressed induction of chemokines, such as MIP-2 and Sprr-2a. CD44 mediated effect of antigen on phosphorylation of ERK, p38MAPK, ROS production, secretion of beta-hexosaminidase, and histamine release.

Carnosic acid is a plant-derived polyphenol food preservative with chemoprotective effects against carcinogens. Recent research has shown that carnosic acid potentiates the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on differentiation of human leukemia cells. This study examined the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in combination with carnosic acid on monocytic differentiation as well as intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ levels in human leukemia HL-60 cells. METHODS: HL-60 cells were randomly treated with 1 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3, 100 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3, 10 micromol/L carnosic acid, a combination of 1 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 and 10 micromol/L carnosic acid or placebo. Cell growth was observed by MTT assay for 72 hrs at an interval of 24 hrs. Cells were harvested after 72 hrs of culture. Morphologic features of the cells were observed by microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell cycle, monocytic differentiation marker CD14 expression, and intracellular ROS and Ca2+ levels. RESULTS: A combination of 1 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 and 10 micromol/L carnosic acid resulted in greater proliferation inhibition (Ab: 0.56 0+/- 0.020 vs 1.482 +/- 0.327; P <0.01), mature monocytic features, G0 /G1 cell arrest, higher CD14 expression (57.62 +/- 0.817% vs 2.76 +/- 0.828%; P <0.01), lower intracellular ROS levels (52.67 +/- 10.76% vs 86.46 +/- 40.52%; P <0.01 and similar intracellular Ca2+ levels in HL-60 cells when compared with the placebo group. The ability of a combination of 1 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 and 10 micromol/L carnosic acid to inhibit the proliferation and induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells was similar to that of 100 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3, while the intracellular Ca2+ level (115.64 +/- 17.74 nmol/L vs 185.75 +/- 27.38 nmol/L) was significantly lower than that in the 100 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 group. CONCLUSIONS: Low concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3 combined with 10 micromol/L carnosic acid can produce enhanced differentiation, proliferation inhibition and antioxidant effects of HL-60 cells. The combination of the two inducers dose not increases intracellular Ca2+ levels.","['Ren, Li-Hong', 'Chen, Juan-Juan', 'An, Hui-Ping']","['Ren LH', 'Chen JJ', 'An HP']","['Department of Pediatrics, Second Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China. renlihong1@hotmail.com']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/06/06 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['1008-8830(2008)01-0055-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Feb;10(1):55-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) in the treatment of malignant leukemia in children. METHODS: Six children with malignant leukemia, including three cases of acute lymphocyte leukemia [two high-risk patients and one standard-risk patient in complete remission (CR)], two juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (one in CR and one in the accelerating stage), and one acute myeloblastic leukaemia (in CR), received a UCBT. The umbilical cord blood grafts were HLA-matched (n=1) or HLA-mismatched at 1 (n=1) or 2 (n=1) or 3 (n=3) loci. Busulfan/cyclophosphamide/antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or total body irradiation (TBI)/cyclophosphamide/ATG was involved in the myeloablative pretreatment regimen. The median infused donor nucleated cell was 8.51 x 10(7)/kg of recipient weight, and the CD34+ cell was 1.81 x 10(5)/kg of recipient weight. Cyclosporin, corticoid, mycophenolate mofetil and daclizumab were used for prophylaxis of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). RESULTS: The time to reach an absolute neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L ranged from 11 to 35 days (median: 13 days) and the time to reach a platelet count of 20 x 10(9)/L ranged from 27 to 68 days (median: 30 days) after transplantation, and the donors' hematopoietic stem cells were shown in these patients. Four patients developed grade I to III acute GVHD but responded to steroids and daclizumab. Chronic GVHD was not found during a 3-16-month follow-up. Four patients survived and did not relapse during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Unrelated umbilical cord blood is an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for patients with leukemia. UCBT can tolerate 1-2 HLA mismatches. The incidence of acute GVHD is high in UCBT recipients.","['Tang, Xiang-Feng', 'Luan, Zuo', 'Xu, Shi-Xia', 'Wu, Nan-Hai', 'Huang, You-Zhang', 'Wang, Kai']","['Tang XF', 'Luan Z', 'Xu SX', 'Wu NH', 'Huang YZ', 'Wang K']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Navy General Hospital of People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100037, China. txfeng70@sina.com.cn""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/06/06 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['1008-8830(2008)01-0005-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Feb;10(1):5-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of the protocol for childhood ALL and to investigate the prognostic factors for childhood ALL. METHODS: This is a retrospective study. The eligible patients were treated with the ALL-XH-99 protocol. However a minor modification based on the ALL-XH-99 protocol was performed in this study, i.e., the high-risk patients as the low- and moderate-risk patients were not administered with cranial irradiation. Event-free survival (EFS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the differences of the EFS among groups were compared with the log-rank test. Prognostic factors for childhood ALL were investigated by the stepwise Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen patients were eligible for the ALL-XH-99 protocol clinical study. The 115 patients consisted of 62 low-risk, 12 moderate-risk and 41 high-risk patients. The overall EFS at 5 years in the 115 patients was 69.0 +/- 5.0%. The 5-year-EFS in the low-risk, moderate-risk and high-risk patients was 82.0 +/- 6.0%, 77.0 +/- 15.0% and 43.0 +/- 11.0%, respectively (P <0.01). Relapse occurred in 16 patients (13.9%) in a median time of 17 months. Without administering cranial irradiation to all of the patients, the incidence of CNS leukemia relapse (2/115, 1.7%) was not higher than that previously reported. Multivariate analysis showed that the risk degree of leukemia, the presence of t (9; 22)/bcr/abl fusion gene and leukocyte count were independent adverse prognostic factors for ALL and their hazard ratio was 1.867, 3.397 and 2.236 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effectiveness of the ALL-XH-99 protocol for childhood ALL is satisfactory, with an EFS rate comparable to that of the developed countries. t (9; 22)/bcr/abl is the most important adverse independent prognostic factor for childhood ALL.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of infectious diseases of dogs and cats that impact their health, could spill over to native wildlife, or sentinel diseases of concern to humans. HYPOTHESIS: The isolation of dogs and cats in the Galapagos protects them from diseases common in mainland populations. ANIMALS: Ninety-five dogs and 52 cats presented during a neutering campaign. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was performed. Blood was collected for serological and DNA evaluation of a panel of infectious diseases. RESULTS: Antibodies against parvovirus (100%), parainfluenza virus (100%), adenovirus 1/2 (66-67%), and distemper virus (22%) were present in dogs. Dirofilaria immitis was also common in dogs (34%), with lower prevalences of Wolbachia pipiens (22%), Bartonella sp. (13%), Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. (1%), and Mycoplasma haemocanis (1%) observed. Antibodies against panleukopenia virus (67%), Toxoplasma gondii (63%), calicivirus (44%), and herpesvirus 1 (10%) were detected in cats. Feline leukemia virus antigen, feline immunodeficiency virus antibody, or coronavirus antibodies were not detected. Bartonella sp. (44%) infections were common in cats, but only one was infected with M. haemofelis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Despite their relative seclusion from the rest of the world, cats and dogs of Isabela were exposed to many pathogens found in mainland South America. Parasite prophylaxis, neutering, and strict enforcement of animal movement restrictions would control a majority of the diseases. In the absence of vaccination, a reservoir of susceptible animals remains vulnerable to new disease introductions.","['Levy, J K', 'Crawford, P C', 'Lappin, M R', 'Dubovi, E J', 'Levy, M G', 'Alleman, R', 'Tucker, S J', 'Clifford, E L']","['Levy JK', 'Crawford PC', 'Lappin MR', 'Dubovi EJ', 'Levy MG', 'Alleman R', 'Tucker SJ', 'Clifford EL']","['Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA. levyj@vetmed.ufl.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Cats', 'Communicable Diseases/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dog Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Dogs', 'Ecuador/epidemiology', 'Endemic Diseases/veterinary', 'Female', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVIM34 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1939-1676.2007.0034.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2008 Jan-Feb;22(1):60-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2007.0034.x.,,PMC7166416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small subsets of cells can be studied with high degree of accuracy, and a broad and constantly increasing specter of antibodies is available. Flow cytometry has therefore become the method of choice for evaluation of therapeutic effects at single cell level. These methodological approaches can easily be used to study hematological malignancies, and the future use of this strategy in other malignancies will depend on the development of laboratory techniques to prepare suspensions of viable cells also from tumor biopsies. The selection of biological parameters for evaluation of treatment effects should probably be based on (i) molecular markers involved in cancer-associated genetic abnormalities; (ii) other molecular markers showing altered expression in the malignant cells and thought to be involved in leukemogenesis or having a prognostic impact; (ii) functional assays known to reflect biological characteristics that are important in carcinogenesis (e.g. cell cycle distribution, functional evaluation of apoptosis regulation). These molecules will in addition often represent the therapeutic targets when new anticancer drugs are developed. In this review we use treatment of acute myeloid leukemia with histone deacetylase inhibitors as an example. Based on the criteria mentioned above we suggest that the monitoring of therapeutic effects on the cancer cells in these patients should include differentiation status, histone acetylation, cell cycle distribution, pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling balance and intracellular levels of various transcription factors.","['Ryningen, Anita', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Ryningen A', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. anita.ryningen@mbi.uib.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/03/19 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138920107783018462 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2007 Dec;8(6):401-11. doi: 10.2174/138920107783018462.,143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comprehensive molecular understanding of the regulatory modules involved in carcinogenesis should also be important for improved identification of therapeutic targets and thus for future individualized therapy, e.g., by allowing therapeutic synergy when designing combination therapy against vulnerable points in the malignant cells. The therapeutic potential of knowledge obtained from global gene expression analysis of malignant cells is crucially dependent upon a similarly fine-grained knowledge of gene regulation in normal cells. The deviant gene expression patterns should therefore be assessed on a background of gene expression associated with housekeeping functions, particular differentiation stages and epiphenomena due to genomic instability. Since malignant cells originate from transformed precursor cells, such reference information can be obtained from investigations of embryonic and somatic stem cells. Much has recently been learned about the regulatory modules of normal hematopoietic stem cells and their malignant counterparts, and new biologically and clinically relevant patient subgroups as well as novel prognostic and therapeutic molecular markers have been identified.

In contrast to conventional chemotherapy which acts on all dividing cells generating toxic effects and damage of normal tissues, targeted drugs allow to hit, in a more specific manner, subpopulations of cells directly involved in tumor progression. Molecules controlling cell proliferation and death, such as Tyrosine Kinase Receptors (RTKs) for growth factors, are among the best targets for this type of therapeutic approach. Two classes of compounds targeting RTKs are currently used in clinical practice: monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The era of targeted therapy began with the approval of Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against HER2, for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and Imatinib, a small tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting BCR-Abl, in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. Despite the initial enthusiasm for the efficacy of these treatments, clinicians had to face soon the problem of relapse, as almost invariably cancer patients developed drug resistance, often due to the activation of alternative RTKs pathways. In this view, the rationale at the basis of targeting drugs is radically shifting. In the past, the main effort was aimed at developing highly specific inhibitors acting on single RTKs. Now, there is a general agreement that molecules interfering simultaneously with multiple RTKs might be more effective than single target agents. With the recent approval by FDA of Sorafenib and Sunitinib--targeting VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT-3 and c-Kit--a different scenario has been emerging, where a new generation of anti-cancer drugs, able to inhibit more than one pathway, would probably play a major role.","['Petrelli, A', 'Giordano, S']","['Petrelli A', 'Giordano S']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment (IRCC), University of Turin Medical School, Str.

With the advent of the Human Genome Project (HGP) and the ensuing provision of sequencing data and mapped clones, human cancer cell lines, notably those derived from leukemia-lymphoma (LL) have become increasingly productive tools for cancer gene ascertainment and characterization. Hence, the roles of putative novel cancer genes may be investigated using diverse panels of LL cell lines, both individually by PCR-based methods, and globally by transcriptional chip-profiling. Similar studies have also enabled the faithfulness with which cancer cell lines model their supposed in vivo counterparts to be quantified at last. Several recent transcriptional profiling studies indicate that of all tumor types well characterized human LL cell lines most accurately model the gene expression patterns of their corresponding primary tumors. Analysis using genomic arrays tells a similar story for the stability of chromosome rearrangements in LL cell lines. Well characterized LL cell lines also provide ideal tools for investigating the druggability of individual gene products, e.g. by measuring their transcript levels using q(uantitative)-PCR methods in cells subjected to treatments with small interfering (si)-RNAs.

Understanding the tissue tropism of vectors is a prerequisite for the design of gene therapy trials. Using an ex vivo system of organ culture, we studied factors that determined viral tropism to the epidermal and dermal cells in human and mouse skin. We applied in these studies a lentiviral vector pseudotyped with two glycoproteins that use different cell receptors (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein [VSV-G] and amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope). The extent of infection with the amphotropic pseudotype was much higher than that of VSV-G, especially at low multiplicities of infection. In contrast, the tropism of these two pseudotypes in skin tissues was similar; at low multiplicities the infection was limited to areas near the basal layer of the epidermis, whereas at high multiplicities the infection extended to the dermal layer. To overcome physical barriers in the skin, the epidermal and dermal layers were separated and infected. Whereas the human epidermis was readily infected, we could not detect infection of stem and early progenitor cells in their niche. In contrast, mouse epidermis was completely resistant to infection. Dermal cells of both species were readily infected with the two pseudotypes. Molecular analysis indicated that infection of mouse epidermal cells was restricted after proviral DNA synthesis and before integration. In conclusion, we show that lentiviral tropism in a solid tissue is dependent on several factors, extra- and intracellular, distinct of the cellular receptors.","['Kunicher, Nikolai', 'Falk, Haya', 'Yaacov, Barak', 'Tzur, Tomer', 'Panet, Amos']","['Kunicher N', 'Falk H', 'Yaacov B', 'Tzur T', 'Panet A']","['Department of Virology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dermis/cytology/*virology', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Epidermis/*virology', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Mice', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2007.121 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2008 Mar;19(3):255-66. doi: 10.1089/hum.2007.121.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, a novel microplate developed for high-throughput single cell/clone cultivation and analysis is presented. Rapid single cell seeding into microwells, using conventional flow cytometry, allows several thousands of single cells to be cultivated, short-term (72 h) or long-term (10-14 days), and analyzed individually. By controlled sorting of individual cells to predefined locations in the microplate, analysis of single cell heterogeneity and clonogenic properties related to drug sensitivity can be accomplished. Additionally, the platform requires remarkably low number of cells, a major advantage when screening limited amounts of patient cell samples. By seeding single cells into the microplate it is possible to analyze the cells for over 14 generations, ending up with more than 10 000 cells in each well.

By setting up coculture system of sensitive U937, HL-60 cell line and multidrug-resistant (MDR) HL-60/VCR cells in direct contact with human bone marrow fibroblastoid stromal cell line HFCL, or separated by transwell, the proliferation of AML cells cocultured with HFCL cells was inhibited, compared with AML cells alone. And NBT positive cells increased slightly. The percentage of G1 phase cells of AML cells cocultured with HFCL cells was higher than that without HFCL cells, and that of S phase cells was lower. The expression of CD11b and CD14 increased. Meanwhile HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells treated by TPT were observed to have apoptosis characteristic morphological changes. The proportion of G0/G1 HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells treated with TPT increased and the sub-G1 increased. The percentage of Annexin V-positive cells and apoptotic cells increased with expression of activated Caspase-3 and the reduced expression of Bcl-2. But when they were cocultured with HFCL cells, the percentage of Annexin V-positive cells and apoptotic cells decreased and sub-G1 reduced. After indirect contact with HFCL cells the expression of activated Caspase-3 decreased and the expression of Bcl-2 increased. After direct contact with HFCL cells for 96 h, the expression levels of 582 genes in HL-60 cells were up-regulated, and 1,323 genes were down-regulated at least twofold by Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 set A. The expression change in some genes, such as HL14, was confirmed by RT-PCR and northern blot. In a word, HFCL cells could inhibit the proliferation, induce the monocytic differentiation of U937, HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells, and prevent TPT-induced apoptosis in HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells via modulation of Bcl-2 and active Caspase-3. Many genes might take part in the influence of HFCL cells on AML cells, which may give important insights into the interaction of bone marrow stromal cells and leukemic cells.","['Liang, Rong', 'Huang, Gao-Sheng', 'Wang, Zhe', 'Chen, Xie-Qun', 'Bai, Qin-Xian', 'Zhang, Yong-Qing', 'Dong, Bao-Xia', 'Wang, Wen-Qing']","['Liang R', 'Huang GS', 'Wang Z', 'Chen XQ', 'Bai QX', 'Zhang YQ', 'Dong BX', 'Wang WQ']","[""Department of Hematology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No. 17, West Changle Road, 710032, Xi'an, People's Republic of China. liangjh@fmmu.edu.cn."", ""Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No. 17, West Changle Road, 710032, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No. 17, West Changle Road, 710032, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No. 17, West Changle Road, 710032, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No. 17, West Changle Road, 710032, Xi'an, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No. 17, West Changle Road, 710032, Xi'an, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080221,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Stromal Cells', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0030-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0030-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Mar;87(2):152-166. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0030-6.

We treated ten patients with ablative allogeneic HSCT, who achieved second chronic phase (CP) by the use of imatinib after onset of BC. Median patient age was 32 years (range 17-46). Among them, four patients received HSCT from human leukocyte antigen mismatched haplo-identical family donors. After a median follow-up of 24 months (range 8-42), six out of the ten patients were alive in durable complete cytogenetic remission, one patient died in relapse 4 months after transplantation, the others died of severe acute graft-versus-host disease and associated infections. No unusual organ toxicities and engraftment difficulties were observed. Extensive chronic GVHD developed in three of six patients who could be evaluated. Patients transplanted with haplo-identical donors had a high treatment-related modality.

In this study we investigated the expression of different Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) isoforms during granulocyte differentiation of NB4 cells induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cisRA) or retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonists. METHODS: NB4 cells were analysed for their ability to differentiate into granulocytic lineage by the use of ATRA, 9cisRA or RAR agonists. Expression of signalling proteins was investigated by western blot and real-time PCR. PI3K activity was determined by in vitro kinase assays. RESULTS: Co-treatment of NB4 cells with either LY294002 to inhibit PI3Ks or PD98059 in order to suppress MEK activity led to significant reduction of CD11b surface expression during ATRA, 9cisRA or the RAR alpha agonist Ro40-6055 dependent NB4 cells granulocyte differentiation. We also show that only the G-protein coupled receptor activated PI3Kgamma isoform demonstrates up-regulated protein and mRNA expression during myeloid differentiation of NB4 cells via RAR alpha and RAR beta-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, activation of MAPK cascade including phosphorylation of MEK increases during retinoid induced differentiation of NB4 cells. Interestingly, protein kinase assays of immunoprecipitated PI3Kgamma revealed a protein of about 50 kDa that is phosphorylated when NB4 cells were treated with the RAR alpha agonist Ro40-6055. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data suggest additive effects of PI3K and MAPK activity on ATRA-dependent NB4 cells granulocyte differentiation.","['Scholl, Sebastian', 'Bondeva, Tzvetanka', 'Liu, Yuantao', 'Clement, Joachim H', 'Hoffken, Klaus', 'Wetzker, Reinhard']","['Scholl S', 'Bondeva T', 'Liu Y', 'Clement JH', 'Hoffken K', 'Wetzker R']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical Faculty at Friedrich Schiller University, Erlanger Allee 101, 07740, Jena, Germany. sebastian.scholl@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080221,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class Ib Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CG protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Class Ib Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/agonists', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2007/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00432-008-0356-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2008 Aug;134(8):861-72. doi: 10.1007/s00432-008-0356-8.

There are five APRO (anti-proliferative) genes, BTG1, BTG2, BTG3, TOB and TOB2, and it was reported that certain APRO genes are associated with cell differentiation. However, it is still unknown whether APRO genes are related with the differentiation process of blood cells. In this study, we investigated the expression of APRO genes in 12-O-tetra-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or retinoic acid (RA)-treated HL-60 cell lines. Our data show that the expression of the BTG2 gene was increased in 32 nM TPA-treated and 1 microM RA-treated HL-60 cells, but the expression of the BTG1 and BTG3 genes was not increased. The expression of BTG2 in TPA- or RA-treated HL-60 cells was also increased even in the presence of cyclohexamide, which is an inhibitor of translation, implying that the increased expression of BTG2 mRNA did not require the new synthesis of another protein. Notably, the up-regulation of BTG2 in TPA- or RA-treated HL-60 cells was observed prior to the increased expression of p21. Our data show that PKC pathways are uninvolved with the up-regulation of BTG2 in TPA- or RA-treated HL-60 cells. Thus, the up-regulation of BTG2 genes may be involved in the differentiation process of HL-60 cells after TPA or RA treatment. Furthermore, this event occurred prior to p21 expression, implying that the BTG2 expression plays a role at a very early point during the differentiation processes of hematopoietic cells.","['Cho, Byoung-Ok', 'Jeong, Yong-Wook', 'Kim, Seoung-Hoon', 'Park, Kun', 'Lee, Ji-Hye', 'Kweon, Gi Ryang', 'Park, Jong-Chun']","['Cho BO', 'Jeong YW', 'Kim SH', 'Park K', 'Lee JH', 'Kweon GR', 'Park JC']","['Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Chosun University, Gwangju 501-759, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '141490-22-4 (BTG2 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '*Up-Regulation']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2008 Mar;19(3):633-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) represent the two most prevalent adult hematological malignancies in the western hemisphere. To evaluate the role of NK cells in the immune surveillance and their therapeutic potential for CLL and MM, tumor cell susceptibility to NK-mediated killing was investigated. Results show relative resistance of tumor cells from CLL as well as MM (73 and 70% of the patients, respectively) to NK-mediated killing. To gain insight into molecular mechanisms of this resistance, the expression of the tolerogenic HLA-G molecule in CLL and MM and its relevance to susceptibility to NK-mediated killing were investigated. HLA-G transcript was found in tumor cells from 89% (n=19) of CLL and 100% (n=9) of MM patients examined. HLA-G1 surface expression was observed in CLL and was very low or undetectable in MM. Notably, blocking of HLA-G1 with specific antibody on CLL samples increased their susceptibility to NK-mediated killing, demonstrating that HLA-G participates in protecting CLL cells from NK-mediated killing and may thus contribute to their immune escape in vivo.","['Maki, G', 'Hayes, G M', 'Naji, A', 'Tyler, T', 'Carosella, E D', 'Rouas-Freiss, N', 'Gregory, S A']","['Maki G', 'Hayes GM', 'Naji A', 'Tyler T', 'Carosella ED', 'Rouas-Freiss N', 'Gregory SA']","['Section of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA. guitta.maki@cea.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080221,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA Antigens/analysis/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Tumor Escape']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200815 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.15 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 May;22(5):998-1006. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.15.

Twelve CpG islands (AR, CDKN1C, DLC1, DRD2, GATA4, GDNF, GRIN2B, MTHFR, MYOD1, NEUROD1, ONECUT2 and TFAP2A) showed significant methylation in over 85% of tumors. Interestingly, the methylation levels of a CpG island proximal to FLJ21062 differed between the activated B-cell-like (ABC-DLBCL) and germinal center B-cell-like (GCB-DLBCL) subtypes. In addition, we compared the methylation and expression status of 67 genes proximal (within 500 bp) to the methylation assays. We frequently observed that hypermethylated CpG islands are proximal to genes that are expressed at low or undetectable levels in tumors. However, many of these same genes were also poorly expressed in DLBCL tumors where their cognate CpG islands were hypomethylated. Nevertheless, the proportional reductions in BNIP3, MGMT, RBP1, GATA4, IGSF4, CRABP1 and FLJ21062 expression with increasing methylation suggest that epigenetic processes strongly influence these genes. Lastly, the moderate expression of several genes proximal to hypermethylated CpG tracts suggests that DNA methylation assays are not always accurate predictors of gene silencing.

Major advances in the understanding of leukemogenesis have been made by the characterization and the study of acquired cytogenetic abnormalities, particularly reciprocal translocations observed in AML. Besides these major cytogenetic abnormalities, gene mutations also constitute key events in AML pathogenesis. In this review, we describe the contribution of known gene mutations to the understanding of AML pathogenesis and their clinical significance. To gain more insight in this understanding, we clustered these alterations in three groups: (1) mutations affecting genes that contribute to cell proliferation (FLT3, c-KIT, RAS, protein tyrosine standard phosphatase nonreceptor 11); (2) mutations affecting genes involved in myeloid differentiation (AML1 and CEBPA) and (3) mutations affecting genes implicated in cell cycle regulation or apoptosis (P53, NPM1).

Preliminary studies with human CD34(+) cells cultured in serum-free medium and normal mice showed that hNUDC appears to act as a cytokine, triggering many of the same responses as thrombopoietin (TPO). More intriguingly, recent data gained using a NIH 3T3 system have demonstrated that hNUDC exerts its biological activities through activation of Mpl. In this study, we further compared the biological functions of hNUDC with TPO in an EPO-dependent UT-7 cell line that was engineered to express the thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl). These Mpl-expressing cells following stimulation by either hNUDC or TPO exhibited overlapping patterns of megakaryocytic proliferation and differentiation, manifested by cell morphological change, polyploidy and expression of CD41(+). Similar with TPO, hNUDC induced a sustained activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases-1 and -2 (ERK1/2) as well as p38 mitogen-activated kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways and these activations were inhibited in the presence of PD98059 or SB203580. Further evidence is provided that PD98059 or SB203580 inhibited hNUDC- or TPO-induced cell proliferation and differentiation, suggesting that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways are necessary in megakaryocyte development.","['Tang, Y-S', 'Zhang, Y-P', 'Xu, P']","['Tang YS', 'Zhang YP', 'Xu P']","[""State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol and The Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of Education Ministry, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080221,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (NUDC protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200820 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.20 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 May;22(5):1018-25. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.20.

LAIR-1 is an inhibitory receptor containing a cytoplasmic tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) that binds to the SH2 domain of phosphatases, leading to dephosphorylation of different kinases. Constitutive activation of c-Jun aminoterminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, has been reported in CLL. We show that LAIR-1 is absent in high-risk (HR) CLL and differently expressed on intermediate- and low-risk CLL and the intensity of expression, which is always significantly lower than in healthy donors, correlates with disease stage and progression. Interestingly, both constitutive and sIgM-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK is inhibited by LAIR-1 through an ITIM-dependent signal, as demonstrated by the use of specific ITIM-binding peptides; importantly, this inhibitory signal is missing when LAIR-1 is not expressed as occurs in HR CLL. Moreover, engagement of LAIR-1 blocks constitutive and sIgM-induced Akt phosphorylation, besides nuclear factor kappa-B nuclear translocation, and prevents CLL division. These results suggest that CLL lacking LAIR-1 may miss one of the molecular mechanisms controlling B-cell activation and proliferation.","['Poggi, A', 'Catellani, S', 'Bruzzone, A', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F', 'Gobbi, M', 'Zocchi, M R']","['Poggi A', 'Catellani S', 'Bruzzone A', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Gobbi M', 'Zocchi MR']","['Laboratory of Experimental Oncology D, National Institute for Cancer Research, Genoa, Italy. alessandro.poggi@istge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080221,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Division', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200821 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.21 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 May;22(5):980-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.21.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two patients with severe splenic pain due to ischemia provoked by vascular obstruction of the spleen were successfully treated by laparoscopic subtotal splenectomy, with preservation of the upper splenic pole supplied only by the gastrosplenic vessels. RESULTS: This procedure was safely conducted with minor bleeding and no technical difficulties or complications. The postoperative follow-up of 5 and 21 months has been uneventful and the pain disappeared since the first postoperative day.

Combined deficiency of N-acetyl transferase 2 and glutathione-S-transferase M1 genes produced an odds ratio of 11.91 (95% confidence interval 4.06-34.96, P<0.001). The effect of N-acetyl transferase 2*6B (P<0.001) is significant only at ages <or=40. In the population studied, persons with glutathione-S-transferase M1 null genotype and N-acetyl transferase 2*6B allele are at increased risk of developing AML, and the risk is considerably enhanced in persons with both glutathione-S-transferase M1 and N-acetyl transferase 2 deficiency.","['Majumdar, Sunipa', 'Mondal, Bama Charan', 'Ghosh, Moloy', 'Dey, Sarmistha', 'Mukhopadhyay, Ashis', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Dasgupta, Uma B']","['Majumdar S', 'Mondal BC', 'Ghosh M', 'Dey S', 'Mukhopadhyay A', 'Chandra S', 'Dasgupta UB']","['Department of Biophysics, Molecular Biology and Genetics, University of Calcutta, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,"['EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (NAT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/deficiency/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/deficiency/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/06/26 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CEJ.0b013e3282b6fd68 [doi]', '00008469-200804000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2008 Apr;17(2):125-32. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e3282b6fd68.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As most of the proposed mechanisms underlying this apparent paradox attribute key significance to the individual alpha-chains of IL2 and IL15 receptors, we investigated the spatial organization of the receptors IL2Ralpha and IL15Ralpha at the nanometer scale expressed on a human CD4+ leukemia T cell line using single-molecule-sensitive near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). In agreement with previous findings, we here confirm clustering of IL2Ralpha and IL15Ralpha at the submicron scale. In addition to clustering, our single-molecule data reveal that a non-negligible percentage of the receptors are organized as monomers. Only a minor fraction of IL2Ralpha molecules reside outside the clustered domains, whereas approximately 30% of IL15Ralpha molecules organize as monomers or small clusters, excluded from the main domain regions. Interestingly, we also found that the packing densities per unit area of both IL2Ralpha and IL15Ralpha domains remained constant, suggesting a 'building block' type of assembly involving repeated structures and composition. Finally, dual-color NSOM demonstrated co-clustering of the two alpha-chains. Our results should aid understanding the action of the IL2R-IL15R system in T cell function and also might contribute to the more rationale design of IL2R- or IL15R-targeted immunotherapy agents for treating human leukemia.","['de Bakker, Barbel I', 'Bodnar, Andrea', 'van Dijk, Erik M H P', 'Vamosi, Gyorgy', 'Damjanovich, Sandor', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'van Hulst, Niek F', 'Jenei, Attila', 'Garcia-Parajo, Maria F']","['de Bakker BI', 'Bodnar A', 'van Dijk EM', 'Vamosi G', 'Damjanovich S', 'Waldmann TA', 'van Hulst NF', 'Jenei A', 'Garcia-Parajo MF']","['Applied Optics group, Faculty of Science and Technology, MESA+ Research Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Twente, PO Box 217, 7500 AE Enschede, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (IL15RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/immunology', 'Interleukin-15/*immunology', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/chemistry/immunology/*ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology', 'Microscopy/instrumentation/methods', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Receptor Aggregation/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15/chemistry/immunology/*ultrastructure', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/07/10 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['121/5/627 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.019513 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2008 Mar 1;121(Pt 5):627-33. doi: 10.1242/jcs.019513.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Noninvasive imaging of bcl-2 expression has the potential to identify patients at risk for relapse or treatment failure. The purpose of this study was to synthesize and evaluate radiolabeled peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-peptide conjugates targeting bcl-2 gene expression. An (111)In-labeled PNA complementary to the translational start site of bcl-2 messenger RNA was attached to Tyr(3)-octreotate for somatostatin receptor-mediated intracellular delivery. METHODS: DOTA-anti-bcl-2-PNA-Tyr(3)-octreotate (1) and 3 control conjugates (DOTA-nonsense-PNA-Tyr(3)-octreotate (2), DOTA-anti-bcl-2-PNA-Ala[3,4,5,6]-substituted congener (3), and DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate (4) [DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid]) were synthesized by standard solid-phase 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. In vitro studies were performed in Mec-1 SLL cells, which express both bcl-2 messenger RNA and somatostatin receptors. Biodistributions and microSPECT/CT studies were performed in Mec-1-bearing SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice, a new animal model of human SLL. RESULTS: (111)In-Labeled conjugate 1 was taken up by Mec-1 cells through a somatostatin receptor-mediated mechanism. Biodistribution studies showed specific tumor uptake of conjugate 1, the somatostatin analog 4, and the PNA nonsense conjugate 2, but not of the mutant peptide conjugate 3. Mec-1 tumors could be detected by microSPECT/CT using (111)In-labeled DOTA-Tyr(3)-octreotate (4) and the targeted anti-bcl-2 conjugate (1), but not using the 2 negative control conjugates 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: A new (111)In-labeled antisense PNA-peptide conjugate demonstrated proof of principle for molecular imaging of bcl-2 expression in a new mouse model of human SLL. This imaging agent may be useful for identifying NHL patients at risk for relapse and conventional treatment failure.","['Jia, Fang', 'Figueroa, Said Daibes', 'Gallazzi, Fabio', 'Balaji, Baghavathy S', 'Hannink, Mark', 'Lever, Susan Z', 'Hoffman, Timothy J', 'Lewis, Michael R']","['Jia F', 'Figueroa SD', 'Gallazzi F', 'Balaji BS', 'Hannink M', 'Lever SZ', 'Hoffman TJ', 'Lewis MR']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, Missouri 65211, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080220,United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Peptide Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Indium Radioisotopes/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Probe Techniques', 'Organ Specificity', 'Peptide Nucleic Acids/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/05/17 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['jnumed.107.045138 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.107.045138 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2008 Mar;49(3):430-8. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.107.045138.

Here, we identify, within the GLN family of highly reiterated ERVs, one, and only one, copy that encodes retroviral particles prone to infection of mouse cells. We show that its envelope protein confers an ecotropic host range and recognizes a receptor different from mCAT1 and mSMIT1, the two previously identified receptors for other ecotropic mouse retroviruses. Electron microscopy disclosed viral particle assembly and budding at the cell membrane, as well as release of mature particles into the extracellular space. These particles are closely related to murine leukemia virus (MLV) particles, with which they have most probably been confused in the past. This study, therefore, identifies a new class of infectious mouse ERVs belonging to the family Gammaretroviridae, with one family member still functional today. This family is in addition to the two MLV and mouse mammary tumor virus families of active mouse ERVs with an extracellular life cycle.","['Ribet, David', 'Harper, Francis', 'Esnault, Cecile', 'Pierron, Gerard', 'Heidmann, Thierry']","['Ribet D', 'Harper F', 'Esnault C', 'Pierron G', 'Heidmann T']","['Unite des Retrovirus Endogenes et Elements Retroides des Eucaryotes Superieurs, CNRS UMR 8122, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, F-94805 France. heidmann@igr.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080220,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*physiology', 'Gammaretrovirus', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Receptors, Virus', 'Species Specificity', '*Virion', 'Virus Assembly']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02141-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02141-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 May;82(9):4413-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02141-07.

We studied whether cells expressing CD38 and ZAP-70 are more susceptible to stimulation through B-cell receptors than are cells that do not express CD38 and ZAP-70. DESIGN AND METHODS: CD38-positive and CD38-negative leukemic cells were separated from single cases and compared for their response to B-cell receptor cross-linking and ZAP-70 expression. Cohort studies were also carried out by measuring the apoptotic response to surface immunoglobulin M (IgM) cross-linking in 82 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by surface IgM in 21 patients. RESULTS: CD38-positive cells, isolated from cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia classified as CD38-positive or CD38-negative, expressed more ZAP-70 than the corresponding CD38-negative cells, exhibited more robust protein tyrosine phosphorylation and had a greater tendency to apoptosis upon B-cell receptor cross-linking. In the cohort studies, surface IgM-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation correlated significantly with CD38 and ZAP-70 expression and with the absence of Ig VH gene mutations. Apoptosis induced by surface IgM cross-linking correlated significantly only with the proportion of CD38-positive cells. Difficulties in finding more definitive correlations were probably related to imprecision in the in vitro test system and in the definition of cases as positive or negative. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data indicate that CD38-positive, ZAP-70-positive cells have a greater capacity for signaling through the B-cell receptor and suggest a function for B-cell receptor signaling in promoting chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell expansion, especially within the CD38-positive fraction of the leukemic clone.","['Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Colombo, Monica', 'Matis, Serena', 'Fabbi, Marina', 'Spriano, Mauro', 'Callea, Vincenzo', 'Vigna, Ernesto', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Zupo, Simonetta', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Ferrarini, Manlio']","['Cutrona G', 'Colombo M', 'Matis S', 'Fabbi M', 'Spriano M', 'Callea V', 'Vigna E', 'Gentile M', 'Zupo S', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Morabito F', 'Ferrarini M']","['PhD.

Deregulation of Ikaros and Notch activities cooperate to promote T cell leukemogenesis, providing evidence that they function in converging pathways in developing T cells. In this report, a mechanism for Ikaros:Notch cooperativity is described, revealing a non-redundant role for Ikaros in regulating expression of the Notch target gene Hes1 in a leukemia T cell line. We provide evidence that Ikaros directly represses Hes1 in concert with the transcriptional repressor, RBP-Jkappa, allowing for cross-talk between Notch and Ikaros that impacts regulation of CD4 expression. Taken together, these data describe a potential mechanism for Ikaros' function during T cell development and define Ikaros as an obligate repressor of Hes1.","['Kathrein, Katie L', 'Chari, Sheila', 'Winandy, Susan']","['Kathrein KL', 'Chari S', 'Winandy S']","['Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080220,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Hes1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'CD4 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor HES-1']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)62015-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M709643200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Apr 18;283(16):10476-84. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M709643200.

Five patients made high-titer antibodies against adenovirus and three made IgG reactive with a leukemia-associated surface antigen, which we identified as ROR1. Anti-ROR1 antibodies were not detected in the sera of untreated patients. We generated anti-ROR1 mAbs and found they reacted specifically with the CLL cells of all patients, but not with nonleukemic leukocytes, a wide variety of normal adult tissues, or blood mononuclear cells, including CD5(+) B cells of healthy adults. ROR1 could bind Wnt5a, which induced activation of NF-kappaB when coexpressed with ROR1 in HEK293 cells and enhanced the survival of CLL cells in vitro, an effect that could be neutralized by posttreatment anti-ROR1 antisera. We conclude that patients with CLL can break immune tolerance to ROR1, which is an oncofetal surface antigen and survival-signaling receptor in this neoplastic disease.","['Fukuda, Tetsuya', 'Chen, Liguang', 'Endo, Tomoyuki', 'Tang, Li', 'Lu, Desheng', 'Castro, Januario E', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Cantwell, Mark J', 'Prussak, Charles E', 'Carson, Dennis A', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Fukuda T', 'Chen L', 'Endo T', 'Tang L', 'Lu D', 'Castro JE', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Cantwell MJ', 'Prussak CE', 'Carson DA', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores Cancer Center, and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080219,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)', '0 (oncofetal antigens)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'CD40 Ligand/*immunology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/*immunology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'Wnt-5a Protein']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/04/30 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['0712148105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0712148105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):3047-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0712148105.

We observed that exposure of human marrow stroma cell lines HS5 and HS27a to TNFalpha increases levels of IL-32 mRNA. IL-32, in turn, induces TNFalpha. Marrow stroma from patients with MDS expressed 14- to 17-fold higher levels of IL-32 mRNA than healthy controls. In contrast, cells from patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) expressed only one tenth the level of IL-32 measured in healthy controls. Human KG1a leukemia cells underwent apoptosis when cocultured with HS5 stromal cells, but knockdown of IL-32 in the stromal cells by using siRNA abrogated apoptosis in the leukemia cells. IL-32 knockdown cells also showed dysregulation of VEGF and other cytokines. Furthermore, CD56(+) natural killer cells from patients with MDS and CMML expressed IL-32 at lower levels than controls and exhibited reduced cytotoxic activity, which was unaffected by IL-2 treatment. We propose that IL-32 is a marrow stromal marker that distinguishes patients with MDS and CMML. Furthermore, IL-32 appears to contribute to the pathophysiology of MDS and may be a therapeutic target.","['Marcondes, A Mario', 'Mhyre, Andrew J', 'Stirewalt, Derek L', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Dinarello, Charles A', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Marcondes AM', 'Mhyre AJ', 'Stirewalt DL', 'Kim SH', 'Dinarello CA', 'Deeg HJ']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Department of Pathology, and Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080219,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (IL32 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*immunology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology', 'RNA Interference', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2008/02/22 09:00,2008/04/30 09:00,['2008/02/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['0712391105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0712391105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Feb 26;105(8):2865-70. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0712391105.

We have investigated the capability to analyze simultaneously the parent drug and newly identified metabolites in patients' plasma by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The anticancer drug, imatinib, was chosen as a model drug because it has opened a new area in cancer therapy and is given orally and chronically. In addition, resistance and rare but sometimes severe side effects have been reported with this therapy. The quantification of imatinib and the profiling of its metabolites in plasma were established following three steps: (1) set-up of a generic sample extraction and LC-MS/MS conditions, (2) metabolite identification by LC-MS/MS using either in vitro incubations performed with human liver microsomes (HLMs) or patient plasma samples, (3) the simultaneous determination of plasma levels of imatinib and 14 metabolites in the plasma samples of 38 patients. Partial or cross method validation has been done and revealed that precise determinations of metabolite levels can be performed whereas pure standards are not available. Preliminary results indicate that the disposition of imatinib and its metabolites is related to interindividual variables and that outlier metabolite profiles can be revealed. This article underscores that, in addition to usual therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), LC-MS/MS methods can simultaneously record a complete drug metabolic profile enabling various correlation studies of clinical interest.","['Rochat, Bertrand', 'Fayet, Aurelie', 'Widmer, Nicolas', 'Lahrichi, Sabine L', 'Pesse, Benoit', 'Decosterd, Laurent A', 'Biollaz, Jerome']","['Rochat B', 'Fayet A', 'Widmer N', 'Lahrichi SL', 'Pesse B', 'Decosterd LA', 'Biollaz J']","['Quantitative Mass Spectrometry Facility, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), 1011 Lausanne, Switzerland. bertrand.rochat@chuv.ch']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Mass Spectrom,Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,9504818,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Chromatography, Liquid/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/blood/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/blood/*metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2008/02/21 09:00,2008/07/31 09:00,['2008/02/21 09:00'],"['2008/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jms.1369 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mass Spectrom. 2008 Jun;43(6):736-52. doi: 10.1002/jms.1369.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The brushes were characterized with time-of-flight secondary ion mass-spectrometry (ToF SIMS), atomic force microscopy and contact angle measurements. Fructose caused a well-expressed drop spreading on the surface of copolymer-grafted glass, due to the strong interaction with the boronate groups. Sedimentation of murine hybridoma cells M2139 or human myeloid leukemia cells KG1 onto the DMAA-NAAPBA copolymer-grafted glass plates from 10 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 8.0) resulted in the cell adhesion. The adhered M2139 and KG1 cells could be quantitatively detached from the grafted plates with 0.1 M fructose, which competed with cell surface carbohydrates for binding to the boronates. Evaluation of the binding strength between M2139 cells and the copolymer brush was performed by exposure of the adhered cells to a shear stress. Detachment of a fraction of 18% of the adhered M2139 cells was obtained at a shear force of 1400-2800 pN/cell generated by the running phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), whereas the remaining adhered cells (70%) could be detached with 0.1 M fructose dissolved in the same buffer. Possible applications of the boronate-containing polymer brushes to affinity cell separation can be based upon the facile recovery of the attached cells.","['Ivanov, Alexander E', 'Eccles, John', 'Panahi, Homayon Ahmad', 'Kumar, Ashok', 'Kuzimenkova, Marina V', 'Nilsson, Lars', 'Bergenstahl, Bjorn', 'Long, Nick', 'Phillips, Gary J', 'Mikhalovsky, Sergey V', 'Galaev, Igor Yu', 'Mattiasson, Bo']","['Ivanov AE', 'Eccles J', 'Panahi HA', 'Kumar A', 'Kuzimenkova MV', 'Nilsson L', 'Bergenstahl B', 'Long N', 'Phillips GJ', 'Mikhalovsky SV', 'Galaev IY', 'Mattiasson B']","['Department of Biotechnology, Center for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lund University, P.O.

Its overexpression has been detected and related to many types of cancers including leukemia, suggesting that suppression of cyclin A(2) would be an attractive strategy to prevent tumor progression. Herein, we apply functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes (f-SWNTs) to carry small interfering RNA (siRNA) into K562 cells and determine whether inhibition of cyclin A(2) would be a potential therapeutic target for chronic myelogenous leukemia. The results show functionalized SWNTs can facilitate the coupling of siRNA specifically targeting human cyclin A(2) to form cyclin A(2) siRNA-f-SWNTs complexes. These functionalized SWNTs readily enter K562 cells, resulting in suppression of cyclin A(2) expression. We demonstrate that depletion of cyclin A(2) in this manner inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis, and cyclin A(2) can serve as a novel therapeutic target. siRNA against cyclin A(2) delivered by functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes may be a useful therapeutic strategy for chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.

METHODS: In all, 131 consecutive patients presenting to a single institution with leukemia or MDS after treatment for PST with surgery or chemotherapy/radiotherapy were examined. Management of the secondary acute leukemia and MDS consisted either of intensive therapy including allogeneic blood and marrow transplants or supportive measures. RESULTS: The time from diagnosis of PST to development of acute leukemia or MDS, the cytogenetic profile of patients, and their survival were similar irrespective of PST therapy with surgery alone or strategies involving chemotherapy and/or radiation. The median survival of all 131 patients was 10.5 months with a 5-year survival of 15.6%. Induction therapy and/or transplantation resulted in a median survival of 13.6 months and a 5-year survival of 26.6% compared with 6.5 months and 2% with supportive measures. Subset analysis of transplant recipients revealed a median survival of 17.6 months and a 37.9% 5-year survival. Despite a significantly lower recurrence rate the survival of transplant recipients was not improved secondary to a higher treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate. CONCLUSIONS: Patients developing acute leukemia or MDS after PST demonstrated similar cytogenetic profiles and clinical outcomes independent of the type of treatment.

The World Health Organization (WHO) classified mature NK cell neoplasms into 2 types: 1) extranodal NK cell lymphoma, nasal type and 2) aggressive NK cell leukemia. The mature NK cell tumors are prevalent in Asia and Central and South America. These tumors show polymorphic neoplastic infiltrate with angioinvasion and/or angiodestruction, cytoplasmic azurophilic granules, CD2-positive (CD2+)/CD3-negative (CD3-)/cCD3epsilon+/CD56+ phenotype, and strong association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Loss of chromosomes 6q, 11q, 13q, and 17p are recurrent aberrations. Although blastic NK cell lymphoma, currently referred to as CD4+/CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm, also was included in the NK cell lymphoma category in the WHO classification scheme, existing evidence indicates a plasmacytoid dendritic cell derivation as opposed to an NK cell origin. Recently, rare cases of CD56+ immature lymphoid tumors have been reported in the literature. These tumors are characterized by blastic appearance, CD3-/CD4-/CD56+/CD13-/CD33- phenotype, T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes in germline configuration, and no evidence of EBV, suggesting a true immature NK cell derivation. For this article, the authors reviewed the recent concepts and progress in clinicopathologic features, pathogenesis, genetic characteristics, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment approaches, and outcomes of all subtypes of NK cell neoplasms.","['Liang, Xiayuan', 'Graham, Douglas K']","['Liang X', 'Graham DK']","[""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital, Denver, Colorado, USA. liang.xiayuan@tchden.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness']",2008/02/21 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2008/02/21 09:00'],"['2008/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23316 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Apr 1;112(7):1425-36. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23316.,103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

De-regulated tyrosyl phosphorylation, evoked by gain-of-function mutations and/or over-expression of PTKs, contributes to the pathogenesis of many cancers and other human diseases. PTPs, because they oppose the action of PTKs, had been considered to be prime suspects for potential tumor suppressor genes. Surprisingly, few, if any, tumor suppressor PTPs have been identified. However, the Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase Shp2 (encoded by PTPN11) is a bona fide proto-oncogene. Germline mutations in PTPN11 cause Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes, whereas somatic PTPN11 mutations occur in several types of hematologic malignancies, most notably juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and, more rarely, in solid tumors. Shp2 also is an essential component in several other oncogene signaling pathways. Elucidation of the events underlying Shp2-evoked transformation may provide new insights into oncogenic mechanisms and novel targets for anti-cancer therapy.","['Chan, Gordon', 'Kalaitzidis, Demetrios', 'Neel, Benjamin G']","['Chan G', 'Kalaitzidis D', 'Neel BG']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada. gordon.chan@uhnresearch.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'LEOPARD Syndrome/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics', 'Noonan Syndrome/genetics', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2008/02/21 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/02/21 09:00'],"['2008/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10555-008-9126-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008 Jun;27(2):179-92. doi: 10.1007/s10555-008-9126-y.,137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neural cells can be derived from hESCs either by direct enrichment, or by isolating specific growth factor-responsive and expandable populations of human neural stem cells (hNSCs). Studies have indicated that the direct enrichment method generates a heterogeneous population of cells that may contain residual undifferentiated stem cells that could lead to tumor formation in vivo. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We isolated an expandable and homogenous population of hNSCs (named SD56) from hESCs using a defined media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and leukemia inhibitory growth factor (LIF). These hNSCs grew as an adherent monolayer culture. They were fully neuralized and uniformly expressed molecular features of NSCs, including nestin, vimentin and radial glial markers. These hNSCs did not express the pluripotency markers Oct4 or Nanog, nor did they express markers for the mesoderm or endoderm lineages. The self-renewal property of the hNSCs was characterized by a predominant symmetrical mode of cell division. The SD56 hNSCs differentiated into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes throughout multiple passages in vitro, as well as after transplantation. Together, these criteria confirm the definitive NSC identity of the SD56 cell line. Importantly, they exhibited no chromosome abnormalities and did not form tumors after implantation into rat ischemic brains and into naive nude rat brains and flanks. Furthermore, hNSCs isolated under these conditions migrated toward the ischemia-injured adult brain parenchyma and improved the independent use of the stroke-impaired forelimb two months post-transplantation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The SD56 human neural stem cells derived under the reported conditions are stable, do not form tumors in vivo and enable functional recovery after stroke. These properties indicate that this hNSC line may offer a renewable, homogenous source of neural cells that will be valuable for basic and translational research.","['Daadi, Marcel M', 'Maag, Anne-Lise', 'Steinberg, Gary K']","['Daadi MM', 'Maag AL', 'Steinberg GK']","['Department of Neurosurgery and Stanford Stroke Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA. mdaadi@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080220,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Neurons/*cytology/transplantation', 'Rats', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells', 'Stroke/pathology/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2008/02/21 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/02/21 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0001644 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 Feb 20;3(2):e1644. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0001644.,,PMC2238795,"['P01 NS037520/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS027292/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 NS37520/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS27292/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Definite evidence suggests that tumors harbor a small population of cancer stem cells (CSC) that both give rise to the bulk of the tumor and are tumorigenic in experimental models. Mounting evidence suggests that these cells are responsible for regrowth of a tumor following unsuccessful treatment and for the establishment of metastases. The concept of CSC has been demonstrated in several human cancers including leukemia, breast, prostate, lung, pancreas, colon and brain tumors. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that liver cancer, like other tumors, are derived from a small population of liver cancer stem/progenitor cells. Although still controversial, Liver CSC will likely become the most crucial target in the treatment of liver cancer, and a thorough understanding of its origin, molecular profile and particularly of how the Liver CSC differs from the normal stem cells, might allow it to be targeted selectively and eliminated, thus improving therapeutic outcome. In this review we will summarize the recent evidence for Liver CSC, the relationship between normal and liver stem cells, and the possibility that transformation of different cell types in the liver may generate different types of liver cancers.","['Yi, Shan Yong', 'Nan, Ke Jun']","['Yi SY', 'Nan KJ']","[""Cancer Center of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine of Xi'an, Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080105,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Liver Diseases/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Stem Cells/*pathology']",2008/02/21 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2008/02/21 09:00'],"['2008/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['5527 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.7.3.5527 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Mar;7(3):325-30. doi: 10.4161/cbt.7.3.5527.

Whereas standardization efforts of RQ-PCR, initiated by Europe Against Cancer (EAC) group, have been gradually widespread in the world, Japanese laboratories use their individual protocol for RQ-PCR analysis. Therefore, we assessed the variability of quantitative results obtained from 4 different laboratories in Japan, including 3 companies and Tohoku University Hospital, using identical peripheral blood or bone marrow samples of patients in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 11) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 2). RQ-PCR was designed to quantify the copy numbers of disease-specific fusion chimeras; BCR-ABL (CML) and AML1-ETO (AML). In 5 out of 13 samples, the quantitative results from 4 laboratories varied more than 10 times (up to 712 times). Thus, we next sought to determine factors affecting the variability of RQ-PCR results across laboratories, by sending back RNA and cDNA samples from each company to Tohoku University, and they were further proceed to yield quantitative data. The main difference between companies and Tohoku University was probably due to the difference of blood separation method (Blood lysis or Ficoll-Hypaque).

Ionizing radiation leads to the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) that are associated with radiation-induced cell death. Investigations of biological effects of fullerenol have provided evidence for its ROS/RNS scavenger properties in vitro and radioprotective efficiency in vivo. Therefore we were interested to evaluate its radioprotective properties in vitro in the human erythroleukemia cell line. Pre-treatment of irradiated cells by fullerenol exerted statistically significant effects on cell numbers and the response of antioxidative enzymes to X-ray irradiation-induced oxidative stress in cells. Our study provides evidence that the pre-treatment with fullerenol enhanced the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in irradiated K562 cells.,"['Bogdanovic, Visnja', 'Stankov, Karmen', 'Icevic, Ivana', 'Zikic, Dragan', 'Nikolic, Aleksandra', 'Solajic, Slavica', 'Djordjevic, Aleksandar', 'Bogdanovic, Gordana']","['Bogdanovic V', 'Stankov K', 'Icevic I', 'Zikic D', 'Nikolic A', 'Solajic S', 'Djordjevic A', 'Bogdanovic G']","['Institute of Oncology, Department of Experimental Oncology, Sremska, Kamenica, Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080216,England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,"['0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Fullerenes)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '182024-42-6 (fullerenol)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Free Radical Scavengers/*pharmacology', 'Fullerenes/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism']",2008/02/21 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/02/21 09:00'],"['2008/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jrr/07092 [pii]', '10.1269/jrr.07092 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2008 May;49(3):321-7. doi: 10.1269/jrr.07092.

How these stress-initiated survival pathways influence B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) proteins, the core cell death machinery, has remained unclear; however, two papers now provide insight into stress-mediated survival mechanisms. The liver is unusually resistant to p53-mediated apoptosis. It appears that p53-mediated induction of the gene that encodes insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP1) attenuates the cell death response in hepatocytes by preventing the formation of a complex between p53 and the proapoptotic protein BAK. This is especially interesting as IGFBP1 is not a member of the Bcl-2 family, yet it inhibited BAK. In three unrelated cell lines, another regulatory interaction that influences cell survival occurs at the mitochondria. In this case, protein phosphatase 1gamma (PP1gamma) regulated the phosphorylation status of the Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L)-associated death promoter (BAD). The prefoldin family member URI is normally phosphorylated by S6 kinase 1, which liberates PP1gamma from a URI-PP1gamma complex. However, the withdrawal of growth factors or nutrients stabilizes this complex, which renders PP1gamma inactive. The net response of this stress stimulus is an increased abundance of phosphorylated BAD, which raises the threshold required to trigger cell death. These two studies have identified new players and mechanisms that integrate stress responses and cell death.","['Guicciardi, M Eugenia', 'Gores, Gregory J']","['Guicciardi ME', 'Gores GJ']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080219,United States,Sci Signal,Science signaling,101465400,"['0 (IGFBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', '*Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Hepatocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria, Liver/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/physiology']",2008/02/21 09:00,2008/04/15 09:00,['2008/02/21 09:00'],"['2008/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['stke.17pe9 [pii]', '10.1126/stke.17pe9 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Signal. 2008 Feb 19;1(7):pe9. doi: 10.1126/stke.17pe9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A more potent analog of thalidomide, lenalidomide was developed to enhance immunomodulatory properties with improved safety profile. Its antitumor activity seems mediated through modulation of both the cytokine and cellular tumor cell microenvironment. Preclinical as well as clinical observations demonstrate that lenalidomide downregulates production of various critical prosurvival cytokines in the tumor microenvironment while concurrently promoting activation of T- and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antitumor response. Early clinical investigations noted its efficacy in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma patients. Subsequently, larger randomized studies confirmed the clinical benefit of lenalidomide when added to dexamethasone compared with dexamethasone alone in previously treated myeloma patients resulting in its recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. Consequently, the role of lenalidomide in other B-cell malignancies has been investigated, with impressive results in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This review summarizes the data from various clinical investigations and highlights the impact of lenalidomide in the management of patients with B-cell malignancies.","['Chanan-Khan, Asher A', 'Cheson, Bruce D']","['Chanan-Khan AA', 'Cheson BD']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA. asher.chanan-khan@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080219,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Amyloidosis/drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Thalidomide/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/drug therapy']",2008/02/21 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/02/21 09:00'],"['2008/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.14.5367 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.14.5367 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Mar 20;26(9):1544-52. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.5367.

Candidate genes (TYMS, MTHFR, ABCB1, BGLAP, ACP5, LRP5, ESR1, PAI-1, VDR, PTH, and PTHR) were chosen based on putative mechanisms underlying osteonecrosis risk. All children received dexamethasone, with doses varying by treatment arm. A PAI-1 polymorphism (rs6092) was associated with risk of osteonecrosis in univariate (P = .002; odds ratio = 2.79) and multivariate (P = .002; odds ratio = 2.89) analyses (adjusting for gender, age, and treatment arm). Overall, 21 of 78 (26.9%) children with PAI-1 GA/AA genotypes, versus 25 of 214 (11.7%) children with GG genotype, developed osteonecrosis.

Estimated 6-year event-free survival (6y-pEFS) for all 2169 patients was 79.6% (+/- 0.9%).

However, the normal function of DOT1L in mammalian gene regulation is poorly understood. Here we report that DOT1L recruitment is ubiquitously coupled with active transcription in diverse mammalian cell types. DOT1L preferentially occupies the proximal transcribed region of active genes, correlating with enrichment of H3K79 di- and trimethylation. Furthermore, Dot1l mutant fibroblasts lacked H3K79 di- and trimethylation at all sites examined, indicating that DOT1L is the sole enzyme responsible for these marks. Importantly, we identified chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay conditions necessary for reliable H3K79 methylation detection. ChIP-chip tiling arrays revealed that levels of all degrees of genic H3K79 methylation correlate with mRNA abundance and dynamically respond to changes in gene activity.

Ligation of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI) resulted in NO production in mast cells within minutes. This NO production was largely dependent on NO synthase (NOS) activity and extracellular Ca(2+). The NO production required an aggregation of FcepsilonRI and was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of endothelial NOS (eNOS) at Ser1177 and Akt at Ser473. The phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt and the production of NO were abolished by the PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin. Although thapsigargin (TG) induced NO production as well, this response occurred with a considerable lag time (>10 min) and was independent of FcepsilonRI aggregation and PI-3K and NOS activity. Mast cells underwent apoptosis in response to TG but not upon FcepsilonRI ligation. However, when the NOS-dependent NO production was blocked, FcepsilonRI ligation caused sizable apoptosis, substantial mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase-3/7 activation, and collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, all of which were inhibited by the caspase-3 inhibitor z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone. The data suggest that the NO produced by the PI-3K-Akt-eNOS pathway is involved in protecting mast cells from cell death.","['Inoue, Toshio', 'Suzuki, Yoshihiro', 'Yoshimaru, Tetsuro', 'Ra, Chisei']","['Inoue T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Yoshimaru T', 'Ra C']","['Division of Molecular Cell Immunology and Allergology, Advanced Medical Research Center, Nihon University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, 30-1 Oyaguchikami-cho Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080219,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/enzymology/pathology', 'Mitochondria/pathology', 'Nitric Oxide/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Rats']",2008/02/21 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/02/21 09:00'],"['2008/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1007667 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1007667 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2008 May;83(5):1218-29. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1007667.

Among the furanone-coumarins tested, murrayacoumarin B (compound 2) showed significant cytotoxicity against HL-60 cells. Fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33342 staining revealed that the percentage of apoptotic cells with fragmented nuclei and condensed chromatin increased in a time-dependent manner after treatment with murrayacoumarin B. Interestingly, this furanone-coumarin induced the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, treatment with murrayacoumarin B stimulated the activities of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and caspase-9 and caspase-3 inhibitors suppressed the apoptosis induced by murrayacoumarin B. These results suggest that murrayacoumarin B induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells through activation of the caspase9/caspase-3 pathway triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction.","['Murata, Tomiyasu', 'Itoigawa, Masataka', 'Ito, Chihiro', 'Nakao, Keisuke', 'Tsuboi, Masaru', 'Kaneda, Norio', 'Furukawa, Hiroshi']","['Murata T', 'Itoigawa M', 'Ito C', 'Nakao K', 'Tsuboi M', 'Kaneda N', 'Furukawa H']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Tempaku-ku, Nagoya 468-8503, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (murrayacoumarin B)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'OL659KIY4X (4-Butyrolactone)']",IM,"['4-Butyrolactone/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/drug effects/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromatin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Coumarins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Murraya/*chemistry', 'Time Factors']",2008/02/21 09:00,2008/04/15 09:00,['2008/02/21 09:00'],"['2008/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1211/jpp.60.3.0015 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2008 Mar;60(3):385-9. doi: 10.1211/jpp.60.3.0015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients received conventional conditioning. We selected all patients with unrelated donors who received optimal antithymocyte globuline (ATG) dose, 6 mg/kg. One hundred and seven patients received stem cells from peripheral blood and 75 patients received bone marrow (BM) cells. The incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV were 33.4% and 34.7% in the MUD and sibling group, respectively. After year 2001, the incidence of chronic GVHD was similar in the two groups (27.8% vs. 25.8%). There was no difference in overall survival (60% vs. 60%), transplant-related mortality (18.6% vs. 16.6%) and relapse (23% vs. 26.4%) between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with unrelated donors results in similar GVHD, relapse and survival as compared to using sibling donors.

METHODS: One hundred and eight adult patients with confirmed MDS from marrow biopsies in the 76-month period before April 2006 were retrospectively included in an MDS database. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis of this cohort was 70 years, with skewing of refractory anaemia with excess blasts and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia in the younger patients. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 42% of patients. Median survival was 48 months, and secondary transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia was seen in 27%. Survival, according to the World Health Organization subtypes in ascending order, was refractory anaemia with excess blasts, refractory anaemia, refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblast, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and del(5q). The International Prognostic Scoring System score stratified MDS patients into different risk groups and effectively discriminated significantly different survivals, ranging from a median 4 months for high-risk patients to 72 months for low-risk patients.

Cladribine and pentostatin both have unique but different mechanisms of action, with a lack of cross-resistance between them, which might be exploited in the relapsed or refractory disease setting. Therapy for relapsed and refractory patients also includes novel biologic agents as well as splenectomy. Despite the effective treatment options, the prospect of cure remains elusive due to the frequent presence of MRD even in complete responders.

METHODS: The cytotoxicity of Que alone and the effect of Que and HT to doxorubicin (Dox) cytotoxicity were determined using MTT assay in K562 and K562/A cells. K562/A cells was heated with or without Que pretreatment, and the protein and mRNA levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were determined by flow cytometry (FCM) and RT-PCR, respectively. Intracellular accumulation of Dox, cell cycle and apoptosis were monitored with FCM. RESULTS: Que alone inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner in K562 and K562/A cells. Either Que or HT alone had a weak reversal effect on Dox resistance, however, combination HT and Que showed a much more significant reversal effect on Dox resistance (reverse fold 9.49). The elevated protein expression and mRNA level of HSP70 and P-gp in response to HT were inhibited by Que. Pretreatment with Que caused the cells to accumulate Dox 8.3-fold higher than in control cells. In addition, Que induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in a dose-dependent manner, and the combination of Que and HT was found to have a synergistic effect on apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Que pretreatment could significantly enhance the MDR reversal activity of HT in resistant cell line, by sensitizing the cell to reversing MDR activity of HT.","['Shen, Jing', 'Zhang, Weijing', 'Wu, Jun', 'Zhu, Yunfeng']","['Shen J', 'Zhang W', 'Wu J', 'Zhu Y']","['Affiliated Hospital, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Hyperthermia,"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",8508395,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyperthermia, Induced/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Quercetin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2008/02/20 09:00,2008/05/02 09:00,['2008/02/20 09:00'],"['2008/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['789606311 [pii]', '10.1080/02656730701843109 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hyperthermia. 2008 Mar;24(2):151-9. doi: 10.1080/02656730701843109.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Children 0-14 years of age diagnosed with leukemia between 1990 and 1994 were ascertained through population-based sources at the time of diagnosis. For each participating case, an age, gender, and area-matched control was randomly selected from provincial government health insurance rolls. Risk factor information was obtained through personal interviews with each child's parents. Conditional logistic regression models were used to examine risk of leukemia associated with parental smoking and drinking. RESULTS: Maternal alcohol consumption prior to conception (OR = 1.37, 95% CI, 0.99-1.90) and during pregnancy (OR = 1.39, 95% CI, 1.01-1.93) was associated with an excess risk of childhood leukemia, with a positive dose-response trend for increasing weekly consumption (p < 0.05). Similar results were observed for children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Odds ratios for maternal cigarette smoking before and during pregnancy were consistently elevated above one, but not statistically significant. No relationship was observed with paternal drinking or smoking in the perinatal period.

This alteration is supposed to change the cellular sphingolipid metabolites; however, positive correlations were observed between daunorubicin (DA)-IC50 and the SPHK1 message but not between DA-IC50 and NSMase2 messages, when 16 different leukemia cell lines were used to analyze the relationship between gene expressions and chemosensitivity against DA. Using two cell lines with either the highest or lowest SPHK1 expression, cellular ceramides and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) were quantified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Increased ceramide was observed in DA-sensitive, but not in DA-resistant cell lines treated with low doses of DA. Upon DA treatment, S1P decreased more in the sensitive cell lines than in resistant cell lines. A SPHK inhibitor recovered the DA sensitivity of DA-resistant cells. The modulation of SPHK1 gene expression by either overexpression or using siRNA affected the DA sensitivity of representative cell lines. Results clearly show that SPHK1 is both a good marker to predict the DA sensitivity of leukemia cells and a potential therapeutic target for leukemia with high SPHK1 expression, and suggest that the sphingolipid rheostat plays a significant role in DA-induced cytotoxicity.","['Sobue, S', 'Nemoto, S', 'Murakami, M', 'Ito, H', 'Kimura, A', 'Gao, S', 'Furuhata, A', 'Takagi, A', 'Kojima, T', 'Nakamura, M', 'Ito, Y', 'Suzuki, M', 'Banno, Y', 'Nozawa, Y', 'Murate, T']","['Sobue S', 'Nemoto S', 'Murakami M', 'Ito H', 'Kimura A', 'Gao S', 'Furuhata A', 'Takagi A', 'Kojima T', 'Nakamura M', 'Ito Y', 'Suzuki M', 'Banno Y', 'Nozawa Y', 'Murate T']","['Department of Medical Technology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Daiko minami 1-1-20, Nagoya, 461-8673, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080220,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lysophospholipids/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",2008/02/20 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12185-008-0052-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Apr;87(3):266-75. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0052-0.

The potency of in situ inhibition of TS was used as an endpoint to analyze the in vitro dynamics of RFC/MFR-membrane transport of these antifolates. Both for L1210-RFC and L1210-MFR cells, the potency of in situ TS inhibition was closely correlated with increasing affinities of these transporters for the antifolates (r = 0.64, P < 0.05 and r = -0.65, P < 0.05, respectively). Within the group of antifolates for which MFR had a low binding affinity, those that had the ability to become polyglutamylated, were more potent inhibitors of TS in situ activity than non-polyglutamatable antifolates. In vivo activity of methotrexate, edatrexate, raltitrexed and pemetrexed was assessed in L1210-RFC and L1210-MFR bearing mice that were fed either a standard or a folate-deficient chow. Dietary folate depletion significantly reduced the MTD for methotrexate (sevenfold), edatrexate (sevenfold), raltitrexed (50-fold) and pemetrexed (150-fold). Based on increased life spans, antitumor effects of methotrexate and edatrexate were markedly better in L1210-RFC bearing mice on the folate-deficient chow (ILS: 455 and 544%, respectively) than on standard chow (ILS: 213 and 263%, respectively). No therapeutic effects of methotrexate and edatrexate were observed for L1210-MFR bearing mice on either chow condition, which may be consistent with the low binding affinity for MFR.

It is well documented that cells deficient in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene undergo oxidative stress, which is critically involved in thymic lymphomagenesis in Atm-/- mice. Here we demonstrate that undifferentiated Atm-/- thymocytes show signs of ER stress and of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Using two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, we identified 22 differentially expressed proteins, including the ER stress marker glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), in Atm-/- thymocytes and in Atm-/- thymic lymphoma cells relative to Atm+/+ thymocytes. The phosphorylated alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (p-eIF2alpha), a UPR marker, was also increased in Atm-/- thymocytes. Cells of the ATL-1 line, which were derived from an Atm-/- mouse thymic lymphoma, were more sensitive to the ER stress inducer tunicamycin than were Atm+/+ thymic leukemia ASL-1 cells. Notably, treatment with hydrogen peroxide duplicated the effects of ATM deficiency in cultured thymocytes, and treatment with the novel cell-permeable thiol antioxidant N-acetylcysteine amide (AD4) reduced elevated p-eIF2alpha levels in thymocytes of Atm-/- mice. Thus, we propose that ER stress and the UPR are secondary to oxidative stress in Atm-/- thymocytes.","['Yan, Mingshan', 'Shen, Jianjun', 'Person, Maria D', 'Kuang, Xianghong', 'Lynn, William S', 'Atlas, Daphne', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Yan M', 'Shen J', 'Person MD', 'Kuang X', 'Lynn WS', 'Atlas D', 'Wong PK']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville, TX 78957, USA. mingyan@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (glucose-regulated proteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*deficiency/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*deficiency/genetics', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*deficiency/genetics', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",2008/02/20 09:00,2008/03/14 09:00,['2008/02/20 09:00'],"['2007/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1593/neo.07935 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2008 Feb;10(2):160-7. doi: 10.1593/neo.07935.,,PMC2244691,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA123601-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA123601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES007784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The low proliferative index and slow accumulation of malignant cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most frequent type of leukemia in Europe and North America, suggests that the disease is caused by a defect in apoptosis regulation. Classical apoptosis is executed through the activation of caspases, cysteine proteases which are regulated by a number of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. One such checkpoint is the control of caspase activation by a relatively new family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). They block both the mitochondrial-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways. The IAP family inhibits apoptosis by binding to specific caspases and possibly by other mechanisms. They also participate in the regulation of cellular and intracellular signal transduction. Six human IAPs have been identified: XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, NAIP, livin, and survivin. Because of their important role in regulating apoptosis, IAPs are being investigated as a potential prognostic factor as well as a treatment target in cancer patients. Overexpression of several IAPs has been detected in various hematological malignancies, including acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and many types of lymphoid malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Many publications revealed significant correlation between a high level of IAPs, especially of XIAP and survivin, and tumor progression. It seems that overexpression of XIAP in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and survivin in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and DLBCL could become a new unfavorable prognostic factor. Many studies are now concentrating on evaluating the expression and significance of the other proteins of the IAP family. In this paper the current knowledge of the importance of IAPs in hematological malignancies is presented.","['Grzybowska-Izydorczyk, Olga', 'Smolewski, Piotr']","['Grzybowska-Izydorczyk O', 'Smolewski P']",['Katedra i Klinika Hematologii Uniwersytetu Medycznego w Lodzi.'],['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20080214,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*metabolism']",2008/02/20 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2008/02/20 09:00'],"['2008/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['815999 [pii]'],epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2008 Feb 14;62:55-63.,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rola bialek z rodziny inhibitora apoptozy (IAP)w chorobach rozrostowych ukladu krwiotworczego.,,,,

Mutations of the juxtamembranous and TK domain of the gene are described in 30%-35% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations alter the biologic properties of AML and are associated with prognosis. In recent years, there has been an enormous development of potential inhibitors of FLT3 mutations. These substances are now being studied in clinical protocols. The initial trials reveal that, unlike in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, TK inhibitor (TKI) therapy in AML is more complex. To date, most FLT3 TKIs investigated in clinical studies show a favorable toxicity profile with considerable biologic activity. However, refractory disease and/or the rapid development of resistance toward these new drugs remain major challenges. Strategies to circumvent this unsatisfactory clinical potential of FLT3 TKIs are mainly based on the combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Externalization of PS is a marker of apoptosis, exocytosis, and some nonapoptotic activation events. It has been proposed that PS externalization is regulated by the activity of PLSCR1 (phospholipid scramblase 1), a Ca(2+)-dependent endofacial plasma membrane protein, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated cells. It is, however, unclear how the phosphorylation of PLSCR1 is related to its membrane topography, PS externalization, and exocytosis. Using rat basophilic leukemia cells as a model, we show that nonapoptotic PS externalization induced through the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) or the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein Thy-1 does not correlate with enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1. In addition, PS externalization in FcepsilonRI- or Thy-1-activated cells is not associated with alterations of PLSCR1 fine topography as detected by electron microscopy on isolated plasma membrane sheets. In contrast, activation by calcium ionophore A23187 induces changes in the cellular distribution of PLSCR1. We also show for the first time that in pervanadate-activated cells, exocytosis occurs even in the absence of PS externalization. Finally, we document here that tyrosine-phosphorylated PLSCR1 is preferentially located in detergent-insoluble membranes, suggesting its involvement in the formation of membrane-bound signaling assemblies. The combined data indicate that changes in the topography of PLSCR1 and its tyrosine phosphorylation, PS externalization, and exocytosis are independent phenomena that could be distinguished by employing specific conditions of activation.","['Smrz, Daniel', 'Lebduska, Pavel', ""Draberova, L'ubica"", 'Korb, Jan', 'Draber, Petr']","['Smrz D', 'Lebduska P', 'Draberova L', 'Korb J', 'Draber P']","['Department of Signal Transduction, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, CZ 14220 Prague 4, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080216,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Detergents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', '0 (pervanadate)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Exocytosis', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphatidylserines/*chemistry', 'Phospholipid Transfer Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Tyrosine/chemistry', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)62058-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M710386200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Apr 18;283(16):10904-18. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M710386200.

We performed a randomized phase II trial to test the hypothesis that inhibitors of two eicosanoid pathways (cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2], celecoxib and 5-lipoxygenase [5-LOX], zileuton) added to chemotherapy would improve outcome in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced NSCLC, a performance status of 0 to 2, and no prior therapy were eligible. All patients received carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5.5 mg/mL x min day 1 + gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)) days 1 and 8. Patients were randomly assigned to: (a) zileuton 600 mg PO qid, (b) celecoxib 400 mg PO bid, or (c) celecoxib and zileuton at the same doses. Immunohistochemical staining for COX-2 and 5-LOX was performed without knowledge of outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred forty patients were entered and 134 were eligible and treated. There was no survival difference between the arms. COX-2 expression was a negative prognostic marker for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.51, P = .019 for index >or= 4; HR = 4.16, P = .005 for index = 9) for patients not receiving celecoxib. Patients with increased COX-2 expression (index >or= 4), receiving celecoxib had better survival than did COX-2-expressing patients not receiving drug (HR = .342, P = .005 for OS; HR = .294, P = .002 for failure-free survival). Multivariate analysis confirmed the interaction of COX-2 and celecoxib on survival. 5-LOX expression was neither prognostic nor predictive. CONCLUSION: This study failed to demonstrate the value of dual eicosanoid inhibition or benefit from either agent alone in addition to chemotherapy. However, a prospectively defined subset analysis suggests an advantage for celecoxib and chemotherapy for patients with moderate to high COX-2 expression.","['Edelman, Martin J', 'Watson, Dee', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Morrison, Carl', 'Kratzke, Robert A', 'Jewell, Scott', 'Hodgson, Lydia', 'Mauer, Ann M', 'Gajra, Ajeet', 'Masters, Gregory A', 'Bedor, Michelle', 'Vokes, Everett E', 'Green, Mark J']","['Edelman MJ', 'Watson D', 'Wang X', 'Morrison C', 'Kratzke RA', 'Jewell S', 'Hodgson L', 'Mauer AM', 'Gajra A', 'Masters GA', 'Bedor M', 'Vokes EE', 'Green MJ']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology (111H), 22 South Greene Street, Baltimore, MD 21201-1595, USA. medelman@umm.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Eicosanoids)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)', 'V1L22WVE2S (zileuton)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Celecoxib', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Eicosanoids/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Logistic Models', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/02/29 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/6/848 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.13.8081 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Feb 20;26(6):848-55. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.13.8081.,,,"['CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2008 Feb 20;26(6):825-7.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Honokiol-mediated apoptosis was assessed by analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation. Knockdown of Bax and Bak proteins was achieved by transient transfection using siRNA. Honokiol was administered by oral gavage to male nude mice s.c. implanted with PC-3 cells. Tumor sections from control and honokiol-treated mice were examined for apoptotic bodies (terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay), proliferation index (proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining), and neovascularization (CD31 staining). Levels of Bcl-2 family proteins in cell lysates and tumor supernatants were determined by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Exposure of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and C4-2) to honokiol resulted in apoptotic DNA fragmentation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner irrespective of their androgen responsiveness or p53 status. Honokiol-induced apoptosis correlated with induction of Bax, Bak, and Bad and a decrease in Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 protein levels. Transient transfection of PC-3 cells with Bak- and Bax-targeted siRNAs and Bcl-xL plasmid conferred partial yet significant protection against honokiol-induced apoptosis. Oral gavage of 2 mg honokiol/mouse (thrice a week) significantly retarded growth of PC-3 xenografts without causing weight loss. Tumors from honokiol-treated mice exhibited markedly higher count of apoptotic bodies and reduced proliferation index and neovascularization compared with control tumors. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that honokiol, which is used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of various ailments, may be an attractive agent for treatment and/or prevention of human prostate cancers.","['Hahm, Eun-Ryeong', 'Arlotti, Julie A', 'Marynowski, Stanley W', 'Singh, Shivendra V']","['Hahm ER', 'Arlotti JA', 'Marynowski SW', 'Singh SV']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '11513CCO0N (honokiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lignans/*pharmacology', 'Magnolia/chemistry', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/drug effects/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects/metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/drug effects/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/drug effects/metabolism']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/4/1248 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1926 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Feb 15;14(4):1248-57. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1926.,,,['CA115498/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic analysis of six cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed a novel recurrent t(8;12)(q13;p13), suggesting involvement of ETV6. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to confirm the involvement of ETV6 in the t(8;12)(q13;p13) and reverse transcription-PCR was used to identify the ETV6 partner gene. Detailed immunologic characterization was done, and owing to their lineage promiscuity, the leukemic blast cells were analyzed for NOTCH1 mutations. RESULTS: We have identified a novel recurrent t(8;12)(q13;p13), which results in a fusion between the transcriptional repressor ETV6 (TEL) and the transcriptional coactivator NCOA2 (TIF2) in six cases of childhood leukemia expressing both T-lymphoid and myeloid antigens. The ETV6-NCOA2 transcript encodes a chimeric protein that consists of the pointed protein interaction motif of ETV6 that is fused to the COOH terminus of NCOA2, including the cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein-binding protein (CBP) interaction and the AD2 activation domains. The absence of the reciprocal NCOA2-ETV6 transcript in one of the cases suggests that the ETV6-NCOA2 chimeric protein and not the reciprocal NCOA2-ETV6 is responsible for leukemogenesis. In addition, ETV6-NCOA2 leukemia shows a high frequency of heterozygous activating NOTCH1 mutations, which disrupt the heterodimerization or the PEST domains. CONCLUSIONS: The ETV6-NCOA2 fusion may define a novel subgroup of acute leukemia with T-lymphoid and myeloid features, which is associated with a high prevalence of NOTCH1 mutations.","['Strehl, Sabine', 'Nebral, Karin', 'Konig, Margit', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Strobl, Herbert', 'Ratei, Richard', 'Struski, Stephanie', 'Bielorai, Bella', 'Lessard, Michel', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Strehl S', 'Nebral K', 'Konig M', 'Harbott J', 'Strobl H', 'Ratei R', 'Struski S', 'Bielorai B', 'Lessard M', 'Zimmermann M', 'Haas OA', 'Izraeli S']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Kinderspitalgasse 6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. sabine.strehl@ccri.at""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (NCOA2 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2/*genetics', 'Oncogene Fusion/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/4/977 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4022 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Feb 15;14(4):977-83. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting high-resolution genomic maps, together with array-based measurements of expression levels of RNA in CLL cases with and without del13q14 and quantitative PCR-based expression analysis of selected genes, support the following conclusions: (a) del13q14 is heterogeneous and composed of multiple subtypes, with deletion of Rb or the miR15a/miR16 loci serving as anatomic landmarks, respectively; (b) del13q14 type Ia deletions are relatively uniform in length and extend from breakpoints close to the miR15a/miR16 cluster to a newly identified telomeric breakpoint cluster at the approximately 50.2 to 50.5 Mb physical position; (c) LATS2 RNA levels are approximately 2.6-fold to 2.8-fold lower in cases with del13q14 type I that do not delete Rb, as opposed to del13q14 type II or all other CLL cases; (d) PHLPP RNA is absent in approximately 50% of CLL cases with del13q14; and (e) approximately 15% of CLL cases display marked reductions in miR15a/miR16 expression that are often but not invariably associated with bi-allelic miR15a/miR16 loss. These data should aid future investigations into biological differences imparted on CLL by different del13q14 subtypes.","['Ouillette, Peter', 'Erba, Harry', 'Kujawski, Lisa', 'Kaminski, Mark', 'Shedden, Kerby', 'Malek, Sami N']","['Ouillette P', 'Erba H', 'Kujawski L', 'Kaminski M', 'Shedden K', 'Malek SN']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0936, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (LATS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PHLPP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Multigene Family', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/4/1012 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-3105 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Feb 15;68(4):1012-21. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-3105.,,,"['1R21 CA124420-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 CA46592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have also reported that a mutation of A157R in MM-1, which is often observed in patients with leukemia or lymphoma, abrogated all of the repressive activities of MM-1 toward c-Myc, indicating that MM-1 is a novel tumor suppressor. In this study, to further identify target genes of MM-1, DNA microarray analysis was carried out by comparing expression levels of genes in MM-1 knockdown and parental cells, and the wnt4 gene, a member of the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway, was identified as a target gene of MM-1. Increased expression level of the wnt4 gene, accumulation and translocation of beta-catenin to the cytoplasm and nucleus, and upregulation of TCF/Lef-1, a target protein of the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway, were found in MM-1 knockdown cells. Reporter assays using various deletion constructs of the wnt4 gene promoter showed that MM-1 recognized the region spanning -286 to -229 from a transcription start site, and MM-1 complex was found to bind to this region by chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel mobility shift assays. Furthermore, it was found that Egr-1 and MM-1 were bound to this region and that both proteins mutually down-regulate promoter activity of the wnt4 gene. Since the c-myc gene is the target gene of the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway, these findings suggest that MM-1 inhibits c-Myc by a dual mechanism.","['Yoshida, Tatsuya', 'Kitaura, Hirotake', 'Hagio, Yuko', 'Sato, Toshiya', 'Iguchi-Ariga, Sanae M M', 'Ariga, Hiroyoshi']","['Yoshida T', 'Kitaura H', 'Hagio Y', 'Sato T', 'Iguchi-Ariga SM', 'Ariga H']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080112,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (PFDN5 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (WNT4 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt4 Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt4 Protein', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/05/15 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(08)00021-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.01.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2008 Apr 1;314(6):1217-28. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.01.002.

We have previously shown that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces mTOR-mediated activation of the p70 S6 kinase, suggesting the existence of a mechanism by which retinoids may regulate mRNA translation. We now demonstrate that treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived NB4 cells with ATRA results in dissociation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 from the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E, and subsequent formation of eIF4G-eIF4E complexes. We also show that siRNA-mediated inhibition of 4E-BP1 expression enhances ATRA-dependent upregulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1), a protein that plays a key role in the induction of retinoid-dependent responses. Our data also establish that ATRA- or cis-RA-dependent p21(Waf1/Cip1) protein expression is enhanced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with targeted disruption of the 4e-bp1 gene, in the absence of any effects on the transcriptional regulation of the p21(Waf1/Cip1) gene. Moreover, generation of ATRA- or cis-retinoic acid (cis-RA)-antiproliferative responses is enhanced in 4E-BP1 knockout cells. Altogether, these findings strongly suggest a key regulatory role for the translational repressor 4E-BP1 in the generation of retinoid-dependent functional responses.","['Kannan-Thulasiraman, Padma', 'Dolniak, Blazej', 'Kaur, Surinder', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Kalvakolanu, Dhananjaya V', 'Hay, Nissim', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Kannan-Thulasiraman P', 'Dolniak B', 'Kaur S', 'Sassano A', 'Kalvakolanu DV', 'Hay N', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

METHODS: Seventy-four men aged 50 to 80 years with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate were randomized to receive either telephone-based dietary counseling or standardized, written nutritional information. Telephone dietary counseling targets included increased intakes of vegetables (particularly cruciferous vegetables and tomato products), whole grains, and beans/legumes. Dietary intakes and plasma carotenoid levels were assessed at baseline and at 6 months' follow-up. RESULTS: In the intervention arm, mean daily intakes of total vegetables, crucifers, tomato products, and beans/legumes increased by 76%, 143%, 292%, and 95%, respectively, whereas fat intake decreased by 12% (P = 0.02). In the control arm, there were no significant changes in mean intakes of total vegetables, tomato products, crucifers, beans/legumes, or fat. Similarly, in the intervention arm, mean plasma levels of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, and total carotenoids increased by 33%, 36%, 19%, 30%, and 26%, respectively (P <0.05). In the control arm, there were no significant changes in plasma levels of alpha- or beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, or total carotenoids. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone-based dietary counseling increases vegetable intake, decreases fat intake, and significantly increases plasma levels of potentially anticarcinogenic carotenoids in men with prostate cancer. These data support the feasibility of implementing clinical trials of dietary intervention in men with prostate cancer.","['Parsons, J Kellogg', 'Newman, Vicky', 'Mohler, James L', 'Pierce, John P', 'Paskett, Electra', 'Marshall, James']","['Parsons JK', 'Newman V', 'Mohler JL', 'Pierce JP', 'Paskett E', 'Marshall J']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA. jkparsons@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080215,United States,Urology,Urology,0366151,"['36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Carotenoids/therapeutic use', '*Diet', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*diet therapy/*therapy', 'Random Allocation', 'Telemedicine', 'Time Factors', 'Vegetables']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0090-4295(07)02421-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.urology.2007.11.050 [doi]']",ppublish,Urology. 2008 Sep;72(3):633-7. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2007.11.050.

Advanced disease at diagnosis is a poor prognostic factor, suggesting that earlier detection may improve outcome. No systematic analysis has been published to define the clinical features that are characteristic of MCC. OBJECTIVE: We sought to define the clinical characteristics present at diagnosis to identify features that may aid clinicians in recognizing MCC. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of 195 patients given the diagnosis of MCC between 1980 and 2007. Data were collected prospectively in the majority of cases, and medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: An important finding was that 88% of MCCs were asymptomatic (nontender) despite rapid growth in the prior 3 months (63% of lesions) and being red or pink (56%). A majority of MCC lesions (56%) were presumed at biopsy to be benign, with a cyst/acneiform lesion being the single most common diagnosis (32%) given. The median delay from lesion appearance to biopsy was 3 months (range 1-54 months), and median tumor diameter was 1.8 cm. Similar to earlier studies, 81% of primary MCCs occurred on ultraviolet-exposed sites, and our cohort was elderly (90% >50 years), predominantly white (98%), and often profoundly immune suppressed (7.8%). An additional novel finding was that chronic lymphocytic leukemia was more than 30-fold overrepresented among patients with MCC. LIMITATIONS: The study was limited to patients seen at a tertiary care center. Complete clinical data could not be obtained on all patients. This study could not assess the specificity of the clinical characteristics of MCC. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first to define clinical features that may serve as clues in the diagnosis of MCC. The most significant features can be summarized in an acronym: AEIOU (asymptomatic/lack of tenderness, expanding rapidly, immune suppression, older than 50 years, and ultraviolet-exposed site on a person with fair skin). In our series, 89% of primary MCCs had 3 or more of these findings. Although MCC is uncommon, when present in combination, these features may indicate a concerning process that would warrant biopsy. In particular, a lesion that is red and expanding rapidly yet asymptomatic should be of concern.","['Heath, Michelle', 'Jaimes, Natalia', 'Lemos, Bianca', 'Mostaghimi, Arash', 'Wang, Linda C', 'Penas, Pablo F', 'Nghiem, Paul']","['Heath M', 'Jaimes N', 'Lemos B', 'Mostaghimi A', 'Wang LC', 'Penas PF', 'Nghiem P']","['University of Washington, Division of Dermatology, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cohort Studies', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/03/15 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2007/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0190-9622(07)02389-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaad.2007.11.020 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2008 Mar;58(3):375-81. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2007.11.020.,,PMC2335370,"['K02 AR050993/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 AR050993-04/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 AR050993-02/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 AR050993-03/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA093683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K02-AR050993/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA093683-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS41599'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the strength of associations between BMI and different sites of cancer and to investigate differences in these associations between sex and ethnic groups. METHODS: We did electronic searches on Medline and Embase (1966 to November 2007), and searched reports to identify prospective studies of incident cases of 20 cancer types. We did random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions of study-specific incremental estimates to determine the risk of cancer associated with a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI. FINDINGS: We analysed 221 datasets (141 articles), including 282,137 incident cases. In men, a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was strongly associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (RR 1.52, p<0.0001) and with thyroid (1.33, p=0.02), colon (1.24, p<0.0001), and renal (1.24, p <0.0001) cancers. In women, we recorded strong associations between a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI and endometrial (1.59, p<0.0001), gallbladder (1.59, p=0.04), oesophageal adenocarcinoma (1.51, p<0.0001), and renal (1.34, p<0.0001) cancers. We noted weaker positive associations (RR <1.20) between increased BMI and rectal cancer and malignant melanoma in men; postmenopausal breast, pancreatic, thyroid, and colon cancers in women; and leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in both sexes. Associations were stronger in men than in women for colon (p<0.0001) cancer. Associations were generally similar in studies from North America, Europe and Australia, and the Asia-Pacific region, but we recorded stronger associations in Asia-Pacific populations between increased BMI and premenopausal (p=0.009) and postmenopausal (p=0.06) breast cancers. INTERPRETATION: Increased BMI is associated with increased risk of common and less common malignancies. For some cancer types, associations differ between sexes and populations of different ethnic origins. These epidemiological observations should inform the exploration of biological mechanisms that link obesity with cancer.","['Renehan, Andrew G', 'Tyson, Margaret', 'Egger, Matthias', 'Heller, Richard F', 'Zwahlen, Marcel']","['Renehan AG', 'Tyson M', 'Egger M', 'Heller RF', 'Zwahlen M']","['Department of Surgery, School of Cancer Studies, University of Manchester, UK. arenehan@picr.man.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,,IM,"['*Body Mass Index', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Overweight/*complications', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(08)60269-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60269-X [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2008 Feb 16;371(9612):569-78. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60269-X.,75,,,,,,,"['Lancet. 2008 Feb 16;371(9612):536-7.

Retinoids exert their effects, in part, by binding to nuclear receptors, thereby altering gene expression. Clinical use of retinoids in the treatment of neuroblastoma is of interest due to their success in management of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Using the SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cell line we investigated the effects of the differentiation agent all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) on the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an enzyme previously shown to enhance differentiation in vitro. Manganese superoxide dismutase mRNA, protein, and activity levels increased in a time-dependent manner upon treatment with ATRA. Nuclear levels of the NF-kappaB proteins p50 and p65 increased within 24 h of ATRA administration. This increase paralleled the degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor IkappaB-beta. Furthermore an increase in DNA binding to a NF-kappaB element occurred within a 342-bp enhancer (I2E) of the SOD2 gene with 10 microM ATRA treatment. Reporter analysis showed that ATRA-mediated I2E-dependent luciferase expression was attenuated upon mutation of the NF-kappaB element, suggesting a contribution of this transcription factor to retinoid-mediated upregulation of MnSOD. This study identifies SOD2 as a retinoid-responsive gene and demonstrates activation of the NF-kappaB pathway in response to ATRA treatment of SK-N-SH cells. These results suggest that signaling events involving NF-kappaB and SOD2 may contribute to the effects of retinoids used in cancer therapy.","['Kiningham, Kinsley K', 'Cardozo, Zina-Ann', 'Cook, Carla', 'Cole, Marsha P', 'Stewart, John C', 'Tassone, Mariela', 'Coleman, Mitchell C', 'Spitz, Douglas R']","['Kiningham KK', 'Cardozo ZA', 'Cook C', 'Cole MP', 'Stewart JC', 'Tassone M', 'Coleman MC', 'Spitz DR']","['Department of Pharmacology, Physiology, and Toxicology, Joan C.

Eligible AML patients were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n=11), which received 12 minutes of WEP per day, five days per week for three consecutive weeks, or to a control group (n=11), which received standard ward care. Effects of the WEP were assessed by seven indicators: worst and average fatigue intensities, fatigue interference with patients' daily life, 12-minute walking distance, overall symptom distress, anxiety, and depressive status. All patients were evaluated four times: before chemotherapy (baseline or Day 1), Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21 of chemotherapy. Data were analyzed by Generalized Estimating Equation and revealed that AML patients in the three-week WEP group had a significantly greater increase in 12-minute walking distance than the control group. Patients in the WEP also had lower levels of fatigue intensity and interference, symptom distress, anxiety, and depressive status than the control group. Although preliminary, our results strongly suggest that three weeks of systematic walking exercise is clinically feasible for AML patients undergoing chemotherapy and can effectively improve their fatigue-related experiences.","['Chang, Pi-Hua', 'Lai, Yeur-Hur', 'Shun, Shiow-Ching', 'Lin, Lih-Ying', 'Chen, Mei-Ling', 'Yang, Youngsen', 'Tsai, Jen-Chen', 'Huang, Guey-Shiun', 'Cheng, Sue-Yueh']","['Chang PH', 'Lai YH', 'Shun SC', 'Lin LY', 'Chen ML', 'Yang Y', 'Tsai JC', 'Huang GS', 'Cheng SY']","['Department of Nursing, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20080215,United States,J Pain Symptom Manage,Journal of pain and symptom management,8605836,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Anxiety/complications/psychology', 'Depression/complications/psychology', '*Exercise Therapy', 'Fatigue/*etiology/psychology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Walking/*physiology']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0885-3924(07)00751-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.06.013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pain Symptom Manage. 2008 May;35(5):524-34. doi: 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.06.013.

The immunosuppressive or antileukemic effects of Immucillin-H (ImmH) in cultured cells require co-administration with deoxyguanosine (dGuo) to attain therapeutic levels of intracellular dGTP. In this study we investigated the requirements for sensitivity and resistance to ImmH and dGuo. (3)H-ImmH transport assays demonstrated that the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1 and ENT2) facilitated the uptake of ImmH in human leukemia CCRF-CEM cells whereas (3)H-dGuo uptake was primarily dependent upon concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs). Analysis of lysates from ImmH-resistant CCRF-CEM-AraC-8D cells demonstrated undetectable deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) activity, suggesting that dCK and not deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) was the rate-limiting enzyme for phosphorylation of dGuo in these cells. Examination of ImmH cytotoxicity in a hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT)-deficient cell line CCRF-CEM-AraC-8C, demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to low concentrations of ImmH and dGuo. RT-PCR and sequencing of HGPRT from the HGPRT-deficient CCRF-CEM-AraC-8C cells identified an Exon 8 deletion mutation in this enzyme. Thus these studies show that specific nucleoside transporters are required for ImmH cytotoxicity and predict that ImmH may be more cytotoxic to 6-thioguanine (6-TG) or 6-thiopurine-resistant leukemia cells caused by HGPRT deficiency.","['Huang, Min', 'Wang, Yanhong', 'Gu, Jingjin', 'Yang, Jing', 'Noel, Karen', 'Mitchell, Beverly S', 'Schramm, Vern L', 'Graves, Lee M']","['Huang M', 'Wang Y', 'Gu J', 'Yang J', 'Noel K', 'Mitchell BS', 'Schramm VL', 'Graves LM']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080214,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '426X066ELK (forodesine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Purine Nucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/*therapeutic use']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2007/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00501-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.12.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Aug;32(8):1268-78. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.12.015.

Treatment options for elderly patients with AML remain limited. Standard regimens using cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside [AraC]), a nucleotide analogue, result in significant toxicity with poor overall response. Combination of a cytotoxic chemotherapy and tumor-specific immunotherapy has the potential to improve overall efficacy by inducing an anti-tumor immune response against minimal residual disease. The studies reported here were performed to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of combining a granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-secreting tumor cell immunotherapy with AraC treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57Bl/6 mice were challenged with C1498-luc cells intravenously and evaluated by in vivo imaging throughout the study to monitor the systemic progression of the tumor. Individual animals were euthanized when in vivo total photon counts exceeded 5 x 10(8) and/or when they were in poor clinical condition. Cytotoxicity assay was performed to evaluate effector function and flow cytometry was used for phenotyping of splenocytes from experimental animals. RESULTS: Administration of GM-CSF-secreting tumor cell immunotherapy during AraC -induced cytopenia enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of the immunotherapy, resulting in prolonged survival. AraC treatment did not negatively impact antigen-specific T-cell activation elicited by the immunotherapy and surviving animals treated with the combination demonstrated strong tumor-specific memory responses. CONCLUSION: GM-CSF-secreting tumor cell immunotherapy in combination with AraC prolongs survival of tumor-bearing mice, with a median survival time of 61 days observed in mice treated with AraC alone and 90% of mice treated with the combination therapy still alive by day 150.","['Lin, Jian Min', 'Li, Betty', 'Rimmer, Eric', 'VanRoey, Melinda', 'Jooss, Karin']","['Lin JM', 'Li B', 'Rimmer E', 'VanRoey M', 'Jooss K']","['Department of Preclinical Oncology, Cell Genesys Inc, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphopenia/chemically induced/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2007/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00661-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Mar;36(3):319-28. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that a precise T-cell receptor repertoire analysis may uncover cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) expansions that are less pronounced than those seen in T large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGL), but are pathophysiologically analogous and thus can serve as markers of a T-cell-mediated process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using rational algorithms for T-cell receptor analysis and in vivo tracking of CTL responses previously established in our laboratory, we studied patients with unexplained chronic neutropenia (n = 20), T-LGL (n = 15), and healthy controls (n = 12). We further investigated the involvement of soluble inhibitory factors by coculture assays. To determine the level of immune activation, we studied interferon-gamma expression in CD8(+)cells using Taqman polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Fifteen expanded (immunodominant) CTL clones were detected in 12 of 20 patients. In comparison to LGL leukemia, these clones were less immunodominant, but clearly discernible from subclinical lymphoproliferations in controls. As a surrogate of cytotoxic activity, we found markedly increased production of interferon-gamma in most of the neutropenia patients, irrespective of the presence of immunodominant CTL clones. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, while immunodominant CTL clones are detectable in a proportion of patients only, CTL-mediated pathophysiology may be a general mechanism operating in idiopathic neutropenia. Oligogoclonal CTL expansions in chronic neutropenia may indicate an ongoing autoimmune process, while highly polarized monoclonalities in a subset of neutropenic LGL patients may represent the ""extreme"" end of the clonal continuum.","['Wlodarski, Marcin Wojciech', 'Nearman, Zachary', 'Jiang, Ying', 'Lichtin, Alan', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw Pawel']","['Wlodarski MW', 'Nearman Z', 'Jiang Y', 'Lichtin A', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Taussig Cancer Center of the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Autoimmunity', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clone Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2007/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00667-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Mar;36(3):293-300. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.011.,,PMC2643087,"['U54 RR 019391/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 113972-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 73429/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR019397/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR019391/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL073429-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR019397-05S16959/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL073429/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113972-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS83525'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-RT-PCR) is a sensitive and accurate method in detecting leukemia cell clones and monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD). This study was to evaluate the molecular responses and monitor the MRD in APL patients by RQ-RT-PCR. METHODS: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and compound Huangdai tablets were used for remission induction in 100 newly diagnosed APL patients. Two isoforms of PML/RARalpha were detected by RQ-RT-PCR. The results known as normalized quotient (NQ) were calibrated by the transcripts of ABL control gene. NQ level of transcripts in 33 of these 100 patients were monitored consecutively, and molecular responses were assessed by log-reduction analysis. RESULTS: The median NQ was 0.58 in these 100 APL patients: the median NQ of long isoform was 0.52, while that of short isoform was 0.74 (P>0.05). The NQ of fusion gene transcripts in 33 patients during follow-up decreased from 0.62 at diagnosis to 0.25 at clinical and hematologic remission (CHR) after induction, to 0.000 3 after consolidation chemotherapy and to 0 during maintenance. Of the 33 patients, 21 (63.64%) achieved minor molecular response at first CHR, 32 (96.97%) achieved partial molecular response after consolidation chemotherapy and all achieved major molecular response eventually. CONCLUSION: RQ-RT-PCR combined log-reduction analysis is feasible for monitoring the molecular responses in APL patients.","['Yao, Li', 'Chen, Zi-Xing', 'Cen, Jian-Nong']","['Yao L', 'Chen ZX', 'Cen JN']","['The First Affiliated Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215006, P.

However, as a small self antigen, it has poor immunogenicity. As an important molecule for antigen presentation, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) can efficiently strengthen the immunogenicity of antigen. In this study, we prepared Hsp70 and idiotypic determinant single-chain antibody (Id-ScFv) fragment against SmIg in patient with B-CLL and explored the in vitro antitumor effect of peptide complex Hsp70-Id and the possible immune mechanism. METHODS: Id-ScFv and human Hsp70 proteins were expressed in E.coli and identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electropheresis (SDS-PAGE) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and purified by metal chelate chromatography and DEAE ion-exchange chromatography. The purified Hsp70 was combined with the prepared Id-ScFv to produce peptide complex Hsp70-Id in vitro. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy human were stimulated with Id-ScFv, HSP70 and HSP70-Id, separately. The proliferation rate of PBMCs was determined by MTT assay; the changes of T lymphocyte subsets were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM)u the levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in supernatant were detected by ELISA. Killing efficiency of activated PBMCs to chronic B-cell leukemia cell line Daudi, chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and hepatoma carcinoma cell line HepG2 were tested by cell counting. RESULTS: Id-ScFv and Hsp70 were expressed successfully in E.coli. The proliferation rate of PBMCs and secreting levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha of lymphocytes in Hsp70-Id group were significantly higher than those in Id-ScFv and HSP70 groups (P<0.05), which were significantly higher than that in negative control group (P<0.05). The proportion of CD8+ T cells was increased in Hsp70-Id, Id-ScFv and Hsp70 groups, and the most significant increase was observed in Hsp70-Id group. The activated PBMCs in both Hsp70-Id and Id-ScFv groups had stronger cytotoxic activities to Daudi cells than to K562 or HepG2 cells (P<0.05), and the effect was significantly stronger in Hsp70-Id group than in Id-ScFv group (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Purified Hsp70 and Id-ScFv proteins in a B-CLL patient were prepared successfully. Hsp70-Id complex could significantly enhance specific antitumor effect of PBMCs in vitro through improving the proliferation of PBMCs, activating specific CD8+ T cells, and inducing secretion of Th1 type cytokines.","['Ye, Qin', 'Wang, Zhi-Hua', 'Qin, Shu-Kui']","['Ye Q', 'Wang ZH', 'Qin SK']","['Institute of Tumor, Jianghan University, Wuhan, Hubei, 430056, P.

The AAA ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) contributes to protein degradation and cell cycle regulation, respectively, and it was of interest to study a possible role of VCP/p97 during this myelomonocytic differentiation and retrodifferentiation. RESULTS: Separation of autonomously proliferating human U937 myeloid leukemia cells by centrifugal elutriation demonstrated unaltered VCP/p97 expression levels throughout distinct phases of the cell cycle. However, phorbol ester-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in differentiating human U937 leukemia cells was associated with a significantly increased protein and mRNA amount of this AAA ATPase. These elevated VCP/p97 levels progressively decreased again when growth-arrested U937 cells entered a retrodifferentiation program and returned to the tumorigenic phenotype. Whereas VCP/p97 was observed predominantly in the cytosol of U937 tumor and retrodifferentiated cells, a significant nuclear accumulation appeared during differentiation and G0/G1 growth arrest. Analysis of subcellular compartments by immunoprecipitations and 2D Western blots substantiated these findings and revealed furthermore a tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of VCP/p97 in the cytosolic but not in the nuclear fractions. These altered tyrosine phosphorylation levels, according to distinct subcellular distributions, indicated a possible functional involvement of VCP/p97 in the leukemic differentiation process. Indeed, a down-modulation of VCP/p97 protein by siRNA revealed a reduced expression of differentiation-associated genes in subsequent DNA microarray analysis. Moreover, DNA-binding and proliferation-associated genes, which are down-regulated during differentiation of the leukemic cells, demonstrated elevated levels in the VCP/p97 siRNA transfectants. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrated that monocytic differentiation and G0/G1 growth arrest in human U937 leukemia cells was accompanied by an increase in VCP/p97 expression and a distinct subcellular distribution to be reverted during retrodifferentiation. Together with a down-modulation of VCP/p97 by siRNA, these results suggested an association of this AAA ATPase in the differentiation/retrodifferentiation program.","['Bertram, Catharina', 'von Neuhoff, Nils', 'Skawran, Britta', 'Steinemann, Doris', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Hass, Ralf']","['Bertram C', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Skawran B', 'Steinemann D', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Hass R']","['Dept. of Gynecology, Biochemistry and Tumor Biology Lab, Medical School Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Str, 1, D - 30625 Hannover, Germany. bertram.catharina@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080215,England,BMC Cell Biol,BMC cell biology,100966972,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.6 (VCP protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.6 (Valosin Containing Protein)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'Valosin Containing Protein']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/06/10 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2121-9-12 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2121-9-12 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cell Biol. 2008 Feb 15;9:12. doi: 10.1186/1471-2121-9-12.,,PMC2277395,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the potential of serum cytochrome c (cyto-c) as a biomarker for apoptosis. Cyto-c and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) were released into the culture medium from apoptotic cells induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand in a time-dependent manner in vitro, with different kinetic patterns. Only one-third of 153 patients with hematological malignancies showed high levels of serum cyto-c (>20 ng/ml). Although serum cyto-c level was roughly correlated to serum LD activity, their different kinetic patterns from serial measurements indicated that serum cyto-c rather than LD is a more sensitive indicator for tracking changes of tumor status. Furthermore, serum cyto-c level stratified patients with acute adult T-cell leukemia into favorable and unfavorable subgroups with 5-year survival rates of 67%vs. 11%. In conclusion, serum cyto-c may provide a fast real-time biomarker for tracking changes of tumor status involved in apoptotic cell death, but lacking disease or cell-type specificity.","['Osaka, A', 'Hasegawa, H', 'Tsuruda, K', 'Inokuchi, N', 'Yanagihara, K', 'Yamada, Y', 'Aoyama, M', 'Sawada, T', 'Kamihira, S']","['Osaka A', 'Hasegawa H', 'Tsuruda K', 'Inokuchi N', 'Yanagihara K', 'Yamada Y', 'Aoyama M', 'Sawada T', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Sakamoto, Nagasaki City, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080212,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Cytochromes c/*blood', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia/blood/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/blood/*pathology']",2008/02/19 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLH1033 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2008.01033.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2009 Jun;31(3):307-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2008.01033.x.

In addition, IFNs also exert antitumor activities due to their antiproliferative, immunomodulatory, proapoptotic functions. In the last decades, the successful clinical application of IFNs for treatment of cancer, particularly leukemia, has improved the quality and longevity of life for many patients. The induction of tumor cell apoptosis by IFNs is believed to contribute, at least in part, to the beneficial effects. IFN subtypes, such as IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma, induce apoptosis through cell type-specific signaling pathways, and several putative IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with proapoptotic functions have been identified. Here, we analyzed the ability of IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, or IFN-gamma to induce apoptosis in several malignant hematologic cell lines. We found that treatment with IFN-gamma, but not IFN-alpha, or IFN-beta, specifically induces HL-60 leukemia cells to undergo apoptosis. Roughly 30% of HL-60 cells treated for 48 h with IFN-gamma, but not IFN-gamma, or IFN-beta, underwent apoptosis as monitored by annexin V labeling to determine changes in phosphatidylserine (PS) asymmetry and TUNEL assay to detect DNA fragmentation. Consistent with these results, treatment with IFN-gamma, but not IFN-alpha or IFN-beta, induced the release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a well-characterized caspase-3 substrate. Further investigation into the potential mechanism responsible for mitochondrial disruption revealed that treatment with IFN-gamma caused decreased levels of Bcl-2 and increased levels of Bak. This study thus provides the basis for additional research to uncover the molecular mechanism by which IFN-gamma regulates the expression of Bcl-2 family members in various cell types.","['Zhou, Yan', 'Weyman, Crystal M', 'Liu, Hongli', 'Almasan, Alexandru', 'Zhou, Aimin']","['Zhou Y', 'Weyman CM', 'Liu H', 'Almasan A', 'Zhou A']","['Department of Chemistry, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/04/15 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.2007.0025 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2008 Feb;28(2):65-72. doi: 10.1089/jir.2007.0025.,,,['R01 CA 84212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It consists of uniformly distributed osteoclastic giant cells in a background of mononuclear rounded and spindle-shaped cells. Cytogenetically, telomeric associations are the most common chromosomal aberrations, which, however, are normally almost exclusively found in high-grade malignancies. GCTB has often been regarded as a polyclonal tumour, but more recently a recurrent specific aberration was reported, which suggests a possible role for disturbed telomere maintenance. Here we further investigate telomere maintenance in GCTB using 19 samples from 19 patients. A combination of immunofluorescence and FISH was performed, applying antibodies directed against promyelocytic leukaemia body-related antigen and hTERT and using telomere peptide nucleic acid probes. The TRAP assay and telomere restriction fragment length analysis were performed for functional detection of telomerase activity and alternative telomere lengthening. Both osteoclastic giant cells and mononuclear cells showed positivity for hTERT and promyelocytic leukaemia body-related antigen. In most mononuclear cells, co-expression was present. The TRAP assay demonstrated heterogeneous telomerase activity, while telomere restriction fragment length analysis showed non-heterogeneous telomere lengths, indicating the absence of alternative telomere lengthening. Confocal microscopy showed stereometric co-localization of nucleolin with promyelocytic leukaemia body-related antigen in association with telomeres in the spindle-shaped cells. hTERT was more diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus. Our results show that GCTB demonstrates remarkable telomere maintenance of activated telomerase and inactivated alternative telomere lengthening in the presence of normal mean telomere restriction fragment lengths. These findings strongly suggest that these aggregates, while activating telomerase, are part of a structural telomere protective-capping mechanism rather than of a telomere-lengthening mechanism. Telomere maintenance could be considered an important key factor in the pathogenesis of GCTB.","['Forsyth, R G', 'De Boeck, G', 'Bekaert, S', 'De Meyer, T', 'Taminiau, A H M', 'Uyttendaele, D', 'Roels, H', 'Praet, M M', 'Hogendoorn, P C W']","['Forsyth RG', 'De Boeck G', 'Bekaert S', 'De Meyer T', 'Taminiau AH', 'Uyttendaele D', 'Roels H', 'Praet MM', 'Hogendoorn PC']","['N Goormaghtigh Institute of Pathology, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (nucleolin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Giant Cell Tumors/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.2301 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2008 Apr;214(5):555-63. doi: 10.1002/path.2301.,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2008 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Depiction of the whole body, including clinically non-apparent sites is mandatory for starting early and proper treatment, including surgical approaches in lesions near the joints. We analyzed the value of whole-body MRI in the detection of osteonecrosis, (1) in relation to conventional X-ray imaging and clinical symptoms, (2) using different MRI sequences, (3) with follow-up examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 5 patients suffering from an oncological disease, 13 to 16 years old (3 x ALL, 1 x medulloblastoma, 1 x CML), and recently developing bone pain were examined with X-ray imaging of the particular region and a whole-body MRI (T2w TIRM, T 1w TSE sequences, pre- and post-contrast GD-DTPA, including fat suppression techniques). Neck/thorax/abdomen/pelvis, and upper and lower extremities were acquired in the coronal plane, and the feet in sagittal orientation. 4 of 5 patients had at least one follow-up examination (in the mean after 10 +/- 4 months). RESULTS: None of the initial X-ray images revealed an abnormal finding. The whole-body MRI showed in 4 of 5 children bone marrow lesions compatible with osteonecrosis. The locations were around the knee joints (n = 3) and the tibiae/ankle joints (n = 4). In addition to the symptomatic sites, MRI revealed additional lesions at the following sites: humerus (n = 5), hip joints (n = 4), knee joints (n = 6), ankle joints (n = 4). The size varied from small focal lesions to lesions measuring 90 % of the whole transverse diameter of the bone. The lesions were able to be detected most easily with heavily T 2-weighted (TIRM) sequences, and the diagnosis was most easily established using the non-enhanced TSE T 1-weighted sequences. As a consequence of the results of the whole-body MRI, all patients with lesions compatible with osteonecrosis received symptomatic (n = 2) or specific (n = 2) therapy. In the follow-up examinations, a higher number of patients showed no changes in the lesions as to size and distribution. 2 patients showed partial resolution of the osteonecroses. CONCLUSION: Whole-body MR imaging allows early diagnosis of symptomatic as well as clinically non-apparent osteonecroses. It can be used in planning and monitoring surgical and pharmacological therapies.","['Beer, M', 'Stenzel, M', 'Girschick, H', 'Schlegel, P-G', 'Darge, K']","['Beer M', 'Stenzel M', 'Girschick H', 'Schlegel PG', 'Darge K']","['Institut fur Rontgendiagnostik, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Oberdurrbacher Strasse 6, Wurzburg. beer@roentgen.uni-wuerzburg.de']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Rofo,RoFo : Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Rontgenstrahlen und der Nuklearmedizin,7507497,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Contrast Media)', 'K2I13DR72L (Gadolinium DTPA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Contrast Media', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gadolinium DTPA', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/drug therapy', 'Osteonecrosis/*chemically induced/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Pain/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Radiography', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', '*Whole Body Imaging']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/04/29 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1027185 [doi]'],ppublish,Rofo. 2008 Mar;180(3):238-45. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1027185.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ganzkorper-MRT bei Kindern mit Verdacht auf Osteonekrose nach intensiver Chemotherapie: Erste Ergebnisse.,,,,

The present study aimed to identify final year students' deficiencies in conducting ward rounds in order to aid the development of appropriate teaching tools. METHODS: 45 final year students participated in a simulated ward round session with three standardised patient scenarios: (1) myocardial infarction, (2) poorly controlled diabetes, and (3) acute fever in acute myeloid leukaemia. Videotaped sessions were rated by independent raters using binary item checklists which reflected predefined learning goals in five different domains: (I) information gathering, (II) communication with patient, (III) focused physical examination, (IV) chart reviewing/ prescription/ documentation and (V) team communication. RESULTS: For the three patient scenarios, 64.3% of the domain-specific learning goals were attained for the domain ""information gathering"", 79.4% for ""communication with patient"", 62.6% for ""focused physical examination"", 48.9% for ""chart reviewing/ prescription/ documentation"" and 86.0% for the domain ""team communication"". CONCLUSION: Final year students' ward round skills appear to be insufficient with a central deficit in reviewing charts and initiating appropriate prescriptions and documentation. Ward round training which eases the transition from observing ward rounds to conducting them on one's own is urgently required.","['Nikendei, C', 'Kraus, B', 'Schrauth, M', 'Briem, S', 'Junger, J']","['Nikendei C', 'Kraus B', 'Schrauth M', 'Briem S', 'Junger J']","['Department of General Internal and Psychosomatic Medicine, University of Heidelberg Medical Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. christoph_nikendei@med.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Med Teach,Medical teacher,7909593,,IM,"['Adult', 'Clinical Clerkship/*methods', 'Clinical Competence/*standards', 'Educational Measurement', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Patient Simulation', 'Program Evaluation']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['790624326 [pii]', '10.1080/01421590701753468 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Teach. 2008 Feb;30(1):88-91. doi: 10.1080/01421590701753468.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is currently not possible to accurately predict the future clinical course in an individual patient. Angiogenesis has been recently reported as a potential prognostic factor in various hematological malignancies including CLL. The objective of the present study was to quantify plasma levels of key angiogenic activators vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in patients with CLL and determine their potential change after intensive fludarabine-based treatment. Peripheral blood EDTA plasma concentrations of bFGF and VEGF were measured using comercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 73 patients with untreated CLL (43 males, 30 females, median age, 65 years, range 31-88) and 80 healthy donors serving as control group. We found statistically significant increase in concentrations in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared to the control group (p < 0.0001 for both cytokines). No differences in angiogenic factors were noted between subgroups with low vs. intermediate vs. high-risk stage according to modified Rai staging or males vs. females. In twelve patients who achieved at least partial response after intensive fludarabine-based treatment, levels of bFGF as well as VEGF decreased significantly (bFGF, p = 0.0005; VEGF, p = 0.0068); in addition, they were no more significantly different from controls (bFGF, p = 0.524; VEGF, p = 0.728). Our data showed that key angiogenic activators bFGF and VEGF were elevated in plasma ofCLL patients. Furthemore, treatment with intensive fludarabine-containing regimens resulted in significant decrease of both cytokines. These data suggest that angiogenic cytokines may indeed play a significant role in CLL biology and that treatment with combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide +/- rituximab may exhibit antiangiogenic properties. Further studies with longer follow-up are necessary for evaluation of a possible association between angiogenic markers and progression-free survival or overall survival.","['Smolej, L', 'Andrys, C', 'Krejsek, J', 'Belada, D Z', 'Zak, P', 'Siroky, O', 'Maly, J']","['Smolej L', 'Andrys C', 'Krejsek J', 'Belada DZ', 'Zak P', 'Siroky O', 'Maly J']",['Oddeleni klinicke hematologie II. interni kliniky Lekarske fakulty UK a FN Hradec Kralovd. smolej@seznam.cz'],['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2008/02/19 09:00,2008/05/02 09:00,['2008/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2007 Nov;53(11):1171-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bazicky fibroblastovy rustovy faktor (bFGF) a cevni endotelovy rustovy faktor (VEGF) jsou zvyseny v plazme periferni krve nemocnych s chronickou lymfocytarni leukemii a klesaji po intenzivni lecbe obsahujici fludarabin.,,,,

In the latter, HTLV-1 is found in long-term persisting T-cell clones. The persistence of normal T cells is controlled by the growth-stimulating and antiapoptotic functions of costimulatory receptors, while the growth-stimulating HTLV-1 functions are mediated by the viral oncoprotein Tax. Here we analyzed the impact of Tax on costimulatory receptors in T cells with repressible Tax and found that among these receptors 4-1BB (TNFRSF9/CD137/ILA) was induced most strongly. Up-regulated 4-1BB expression was a consistent feature of all HTLV-1-infected cell lines, whether patient-derived or in vitro transformed. Tax was sufficient to induce the expression of the endogenous 4-1BB gene in uninfected T cells, and it strongly activated (45-fold) the 4-1BB promoter via a single NF-kappaB site. The ligand of 4-1BB was also found on transformed T-cell lines, opening up the possibility of autostimulation. Moreover, 4-1BB expression in patients' lymphocytes ex vivo correlated with Tax expression, strongly suggesting Tax-mediated 4-1BB activation in vivo. Thus, 4-1BB up-regulation by Tax could contribute to growth, survival, and clonal expansion of the infected cells during persistence and disease.","['Pichler, Klemens', 'Kattan, Tarek', 'Gentzsch, Juliane', 'Kress, Andrea K', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Bangham, Charles R M', 'Grassmann, Ralph']","['Pichler K', 'Kattan T', 'Gentzsch J', 'Kress AK', 'Taylor GP', 'Bangham CR', 'Grassmann R']","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080214,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNFRSF9 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clone Cells/virology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/02/16 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/02/16 09:00'],"['2008/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41165-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-10-115220 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 1;111(9):4741-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-10-115220.

Rapid down-regulation of telomerase transcription occurred during early differentiation of HL60 cells prior to G(1) arrest. Akt kinase activity was suppressed after 6 h of differentiation along with inhibition of telomerase activity, and the extent of the suppression that occurred while maintaining telomerase protein expression suggested the post-translational regulation of telomerase activity. Recombinant Akt dose-dependently increased telomerase activity, and telomerase was inhibited at the transcriptional and post-translational levels by LY294002, suggesting that PI-3K/Akt is one of the key signaling proteins involved in telomerase regulation. Each of the three differentiation agents caused a significant increase of signaling proteins (including Akt) at 3 days after the initiation of differentiation. Changes of acetyl-histone H4, which regulates transcription of the telomerase gene, were observed before the activation of Akt. This finding suggests that epigenetic control of telomerase transcription occurs before activation of Akt during the late stage of differentiation. These results indicate that telomerase activity is regulated by at least two mechanisms during granulocytic and monocytic differentiation, with one mechanism being transcriptional and the other being post-translational.","['Yamada, Osamu', 'Ozaki, Kohji', 'Nakatake, Mayuka', 'Akiyama, Masaharu', 'Kawauchi, Kiyotaka', 'Matsuoka, Rumiko']","['Yamada O', 'Ozaki K', 'Nakatake M', 'Akiyama M', 'Kawauchi K', 'Matsuoka R']","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan. yamadao@lab.twmu.ac.jp""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080214,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Chromatin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2008/02/16 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/02/16 09:00'],"['2008/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1207848 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1207848 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2008 May;83(5):1240-8. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1207848.

The spectrum of kinase domain mutations discovered to date is quite heterogeneous, consisting almost exclusively of single nucleotide substitutions affecting key amino acids that regulate drug binding or BCR-ABL function. Here, we describe an alternative kinase domain insertion/truncation mutation in three CML patients undergoing kinase inhibitor therapy. In each of these patients, direct DNA sequencing of BCR-ABL RT-PCR products revealed that the same 35 nucleotides from ABL intron 8 had been inserted at the normal exon 8 to 9 splice junction. This 35-bp intronic sequence was flanked by excellent consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences, suggesting alternative splicing as the likely mutational mechanism. The insertion created a premature translational stop codon after 10 intron-encoded amino acids (amino acid 484). This resulted in truncation of 653 C-terminal amino acids, which included part of the kinase domain and the entire ""last exon"" region. These findings demonstrate that kinase domain insertions are an alternative (and not entirely uncommon) mutational mechanism in CML patients undergoing kinase inhibitor therapy.","['Laudadio, Jennifer', 'Deininger, Michael W N', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Press, Richard D']","['Laudadio J', 'Deininger MW', 'Mauro MJ', 'Druker BJ', 'Press RD']","['Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080214,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",2008/02/16 09:00,2008/04/19 09:00,['2008/02/16 09:00'],"['2008/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-1578(10)60146-8 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2008.070128 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2008 Mar;10(2):177-80. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2008.070128.

We determined that NK levels in the peri-transplant period were inversely proportional to the dramatic rise and fall in plasma levels of the NK homeostatic cytokine IL-15, which increased more than 50-fold from pretreatment to the day of transplant during the lymphoreductive preparative regimen. Furthermore, in NK cells cultured with IL-15, we observed an up-regulation of the activating receptors NKG2D, NKp30, and NKp46, associated with an increase in anti-tumor lytic activity. Similarly, the expression of these activating receptors increased significantly during the early post-transplant period, concurrent with a rapid increase in total NK cells and a shift toward increased expression of CD56. These data suggest that the cytokine milieu of transplants, in particular elevated levels of IL-15, may contribute to anti-tumor efficacy post-transplant by enhancing the recovery of NK subsets and modulating expression of activating receptors.","['Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Memon, Sarfraz', 'Carson, Jesse', 'Allen, Kenton', 'Szczepanski, Miroslaw J', 'Vance, Barbara A', 'Dean, Robert', 'Bishop, Michael R', 'Gress, Ronald E', 'Hakim, Frances T']","['Boyiadzis M', 'Memon S', 'Carson J', 'Allen K', 'Szczepanski MJ', 'Vance BA', 'Dean R', 'Bishop MR', 'Gress RE', 'Hakim FT']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. boyiadzism@upmc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (NCR1 protein, human)', '0 (NCR3 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD56 Antigen/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/blood/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/blood/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 1', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology']",2008/02/16 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2008/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(07)00653-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.12.490 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Mar;14(3):290-300. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.12.490.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been investigated as an alternative stem cell source to suitably HLA matched related (MRD) and adult volunteer unrelated donors. We hypothesized that RIC HCT using UCB would be safe and efficacious in older patients, and compared the treatment-related mortality (TRM) and overall survival (OS) of RIC HCT in patients older than 55 years using either MRD (n = 47) or, in patients with no 5 of 6 or 6 of 6 HLA compatible related donors, UCB (n = 43). RIC regimen consisted of total-body irradiation (TBI; 200 cGy) and either cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (n = 69), or busulfan and fludarabine (n = 16) or busulfan and cladribine (n = 5). The median age of MRD and UCB cohorts was 58 (range, 55-70) and 59 (range, 55-69) years, respectively. acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) (50%) was the most common diagnosis. All MRD grafts were 6 of 6 HLA matched to the recipient. Among patients undergoing UCB HCT, 88% received 2 UCB units to optimize cell dose and 93% received 1-2 HLA mismatched grafts. The median follow-up for survivors was 27 (range: 12-61) months. The 3-year probabilities of progression-free survival (PFS; 30% versus 34%, P = .98) and OS (43% versus 34%, P = .57) were similar for recipients of MRD and UCB. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host (aGVHD) disease (42% versus 49%, P = .20) and TRM at 180-days (23% versus 28%, P = .36) were comparable. However, UCB recipients had a lower incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) at 1 year (40% versus 17%, P = .02). On multivariate analysis, graft type had no impact on TRM or survival, and the HCT comorbidity index score was the only factor independently predictive for these endpoints. Our study supports the use of HLA mismatched UCB as an alternative graft source for older patients who need a transplant but do not have an MRD. The use of RIC and UCB extends the availability of transplant therapy to older patients previously excluded on the basis of age and lack of a suitable MRD. A careful review of existing comorbidities is necessary when considering older patients for HCT.","['Majhail, Navneet S', 'Brunstein, Claudio G', 'Tomblyn, Marcie', 'Thomas, Avis J', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Kaufman, Dan S', 'Burns, Linda J', 'Slungaard, Arne', 'McGlave, Philip B', 'Wagner, John E', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J']","['Majhail NS', 'Brunstein CG', 'Tomblyn M', 'Thomas AJ', 'Miller JS', 'Arora M', 'Kaufman DS', 'Burns LJ', 'Slungaard A', 'McGlave PB', 'Wagner JE', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Divisions of Medical and Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. majha001@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],IM,"['Aged', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/administration & dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2008/02/16 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2008/02/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(07)00655-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.12.488 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Mar;14(3):282-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.12.488.,,PMC2674378,"['P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493-110009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493-120009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS41246'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are only a few serum/plasma biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase and soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha to diagnose ML. The classifications are various, and therefore the cell surface markers using flow cytometry or lymph node biopsy have been examined. It is difficult, however, to distinguish the two diseases, NHL and HL, from each other. METHODS: In order to identify the haematological malignancy-associated autoimmunoreactivity (autoantibodies) in patients' plasma, a novel proteomics-based approach using electrophoresis/mass spectrometry was applied. Solubilized proteins from a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (Raji) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting analysis, in which the plasma of individual patients with haematological malignancies was tested for primary antibodies, followed by visualization with anti-IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. RESULTS: Two proteins, L-plastin and alpha-enolase, capable of reacting with the antibodies in plasma of patients with NHL, were detected using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry. The rates of the detections of an anti L-plastin autoantibody were significantly higher: 0.84 (21/25) in patients with NHL; 0.00 (0/4) in HL; 0.38 (5/13) in autoimmune diseases; 0.20 (2/10) in leukaemia; and 0.13 (1/8) in healthy controls. In contrast, those of anti alpha-enolase antibody were not specific to NHL. CONCLUSIONS: We first identified autoantibody against L-plastin in plasma of patients with NHL, suggesting that the autoantibody can be a new diagnostic biomarker for NHL.","['Ueda, Kazuhito', 'Nakanishi, Toyofumi', 'Shimizu, Akira', 'Takubo, Takayuki', 'Matsuura, Nariaki']","['Ueda K', 'Nakanishi T', 'Shimizu A', 'Takubo T', 'Matsuura N']","['Central Clinical Laboratory, Osaka Medical College Hospital, 2-7 Daigaku-cho, Takatsuki City, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Ann Clin Biochem,Annals of clinical biochemistry,0324055,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (plastin)']",IM,"['Autoantibodies/*blood/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Phosphoproteins/*immunology', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2008/02/16 09:00,2008/04/05 09:00,['2008/02/16 09:00'],"['2008/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1258/acb.2007.006230 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Biochem. 2008 Jan;45(Pt 1):65-9. doi: 10.1258/acb.2007.006230.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This interaction reduces both spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis. The present study measured CD49d expression by flow cytometry in a cohort of untreated CLL patients previously accrued to a prospective observational study and evaluated the relationship with overall survival (OS). Among the 158 CLL patients tested, the percentage of leukaemic B cells expressing CD49d ranged from 0 to 100%. When all risk factors were treated as continuous variables, CD49d expression showed moderate correlation with expression of ZAP-70 (r = 0.54; P < 0.0001) and CD38 (r = 0.58; P < 0.0001) but not %IGHV mutation. As a continuous variable, CD49d expression strongly correlated with OS (P < 0.0001). Recursive partitioning analysis suggested the 45% threshold of CD49d expression best predicted OS. Multivariate analysis, controlling for disease stage, ZAP-70, IGHV status and fluorescent in situ hybridization defects identified CD49d as an independent predictor of OS and was a better predictor of clinical outcome than ZAP-70, IGHV, or cytogenetics. This observational cohort study suggests that CLL B-cell expression of CD49d is an easily measurable and independent predictor of OS and CD49d expression in CLL. Importantly, anti-CD49d antibodies are already approved for treatment of other human diseases. Clinical testing of anti-CD49d therapy in CLL appears warranted.","['Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Geyer, Susan M', 'Bone, Nancy D', 'Tschumper, Renee C', 'Witzig, Tom E', 'Nowakowski, Greg S', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Call, Tim G', 'Laplant, Betsy', 'Dewald, Gordon W', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Shanafelt TD', 'Geyer SM', 'Bone ND', 'Tschumper RC', 'Witzig TE', 'Nowakowski GS', 'Zent CS', 'Call TG', 'Laplant B', 'Dewald GW', 'Jelinek DF', 'Kay NE']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. shanafelt.tait@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Integrin alpha4/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/02/16 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2008/02/16 09:00'],"['2008/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6965 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06965.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Mar;140(5):537-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06965.x.,,PMC4477272,"['K23 CA113408-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K07 CA094919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 94919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA113408-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS60638'],,,,['Future Oncol. 2008 Jun;4(3):355-8.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of childhood cancer survivors. SETTING: Twenty-six academic institutions treating childhood cancer. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand six hundred forty-five survivors of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia, central nervous system tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcomas, or bone tumors diagnosed before age 21, surviving at least 5 years from diagnosis, and a 500-sibling comparison group. MEASUREMENTS: Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between survivors and siblings on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (40.8 vs 42.0, P < 0.02), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (6.1 vs 5.5, P < 0.004), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (6.2 vs 5.4, P < 0.001). Nineteen percent of survivors were in the most fatigued range, 16.7% reported disrupted sleep, and 14% increased daytime sleepiness. Survivors with a history of radiation therapy were more likely to be fatigued (odds ratio 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.3-2.3), yet without significantly different mean scores. Female sex, congestive heart failure, pulmonary fibrosis, depression, and being unmarried significantly predicted more fatigue, whereas obesity and an infant in the house predicted more daytime sleepiness. Similar sociodemographic predictors were also identified among the siblings. CONCLUSION: Because of the large sample size, we detected more objectively reported fatigue, sleep disturbance, and daytime sleepiness among adult survivors of childhood cancer. However, the clinical significance of these differences is questionable. Predictors of fatigue and poor sleep were similar in both survivors and the siblings.","['Mulrooney, Daniel A', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Whitton, John A', 'Green, Daniel M', 'Zeltzer, Lonnie K', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Mertens, Ann C']","['Mulrooney DA', 'Ness KK', 'Neglia JP', 'Whitton JA', 'Green DM', 'Zeltzer LK', 'Robison LL', 'Mertens AC']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. mulro006@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Sleep,Sleep,7809084,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disorders of Excessive Somnolence/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Fatigue/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*psychology', 'Polysomnography', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data']",2008/02/16 09:00,2008/04/03 09:00,['2008/02/16 09:00'],"['2008/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/sleep/31.2.271 [doi]'],ppublish,Sleep. 2008 Feb;31(2):271-81. doi: 10.1093/sleep/31.2.271.,,PMC2225565,"['U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA 55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, more than 160 ABO alleles have been identified by molecular investigation. Almost all ABO genotyping studies have been performed in blood donors and families and for investigation of ABO subgroups detected serologically. The aim of the present study was to perform ABO genotyping in patients with leukemia. Blood samples were collected from 108 Brazilian patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (N = 69), chronic lymphoid leukemia (N = 13), acute myeloid leukemia (N = 15), and acute lymphoid leukemia (N = 11). ABO genotyping was carried out using allele specific primer polymerase chain reaction followed by DNA sequencing. ABO*O01 was the most common allele found, followed by ABO*O22 and by ABO*A103. We identified 22 new ABO*variants in the coding region of the ABO gene in 25 individuals with leukemia (23.2%). The majority of ABO variants was detected in O alleles (15/60.0%). In 5 of 51 samples typed as blood group O (9.8%), we found non-deletional ABO*O alleles. Elucidation of the diversity of this gene in leukemia and in other diseases is important for the determination of the effect of changes in an amino acid residue on the specificity and activity of ABO glycosyltransferases and their function. In conclusion, this is the first report of a large number of patients with leukemia genotyped for ABO. The findings of this study indicate that there is a high level of recombinant activity in the ABO gene in leukemia patients, revealing new ABO variants.","['Novaretti, M C Z', 'Domingues, A E', 'Manhani, R', 'Pinto, E M', 'Dorlhiac-Llacer, P E', 'Chamone, D A F']","['Novaretti MC', 'Domingues AE', 'Manhani R', 'Pinto EM', 'Dorlhiac-Llacer PE', 'Chamone DA']","['Disciplina de Hematologia, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil. marcia@iqs.med.br']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080201,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/classification/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alleles', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/classification', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",2008/02/15 09:00,2008/03/19 09:00,['2008/02/15 09:00'],"['2008/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['gmr401 [pii]', '10.4238/vol7-1gmr401 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2008 Feb 1;7(1):87-94. doi: 10.4238/vol7-1gmr401.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The actions of NRG-1 in the adult heart have begun to be elucidated following the unexpected clinical observation that trastuzumab can cause ventricular dysfunction and increases the risk of cardiomyopathy induced by anthracyclines. Trastuzumab is an inhibitory antibody against the NRG receptor erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2) and is used in the treatment of breast cancer. In vitro studies have demonstrated that NRG-1 promotes growth and survival of isolated cardiomyocytes. Ventricular dysfunction following anti-ErbB2 treatment was initially explained by a loss of ErbB2-dependent cell survival pathways in the heart. However, in vivo studies in genetically modified mice did not uniformly confirm this finding. More recent studies have revealed that NRG-1 counterbalances the adrenergic inotropic response of the adult myocardium through an obligatory interaction with the muscarinic cholinergic system. In addition, it was demonstrated that cardiac NRG-1 synthesis and release from the cardiac endothelium, the principal source of NRG-1 in the heart, is dynamically controlled by neurohormonal and biomechanical stimuli, allowing adaptive tuning of ErbB signaling during cardiovascular stress. Cardiac NRG-1 is beginning to emerge as a cardioprotective factor implicated in the physiological regulation of myocardial performance and sympathovagal balances. Cardiac NRG-1/ErbB signaling has implications for the treatment of both cancer and heart failure. As novel ErbB inhibitors are currently being tested in broader oncological indications, there is a need to better understand their cardiovascular side effects.

We investigated whether nilotinib, a more potent BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor could target CML primitive progenitors more effectively than imatinib. CML and normal progenitor cells were cultured with nilotinib or imatinib in growth factor supplemented medium. Nilotinib inhibited BCR-ABL kinase activity at lower concentrations than imatinib. Nilotinib inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), AKT and STAT5 phosphorylation in CML CD34(+) cells in the absence of growth factors (GFs), but did not suppress AKT and STAT5 activity, and resulted in increased MAPK activity, in the presence of GFs. Nilotinib and imatinib resulted in similar suppression of CML primitive and committed progenitors in long-term culture-initiating cell and colony-forming cell assays. Inhibition of progenitor growth was related to marked reduction in proliferation, but only a modest increase in apoptosis. Nilotinib did not show increased efficacy in reducing nondividing CML progenitors compared with imatinib. These results indicate that more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors by themselves will not be more effective in eliminating CML progenitors than imatinib and that additional mechanism required for maintenance of malignant stem cells need to be identified to improve targeting of leukemia stem cells.","['Konig, H', 'Holtz, M', 'Modi, H', 'Manley, P', 'Holyoake, T L', 'Forman, S J', 'Bhatia, R']","['Konig H', 'Holtz M', 'Modi H', 'Manley P', 'Holyoake TL', 'Forman SJ', 'Bhatia R']","['Division of Hematology and HCT, Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080214,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/02/15 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/02/15 09:00'],"['2008/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405086 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405086 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Apr;22(4):748-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405086.

A recently developed small-molecule antagonist of MDM2, nutlin-3, inhibits the MDM2-p53 interaction, resulting in induction of p53 activity and apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated the cytotoxic effect of nutlin-3 on ALL cells with different p53 status and MDM2 expression, using 18 cell lines and 30 primary leukemia samples. We found that both ALL cell lines and primary ALL samples with wt-p53 are sensitive to nutlin-3. No cytotoxic effect of nutlin-3 was detected in ALL cells with either p53-mutant or -null phenotype. In wt-p53 ALL cells, there was a significant positive correlation between MDM2 expression levels and sensitivity to nutlin-3. Nutlin-3-induced cell death was mediated by p53-induced activation of proapoptotic proteins and by p53-induced repression of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin. As p53 function is inhibited by MDM2 in chemoresistant, MDM2-overexpressing ALL cells, potent killing of these cells by nutlin-3 suggests that this agent may be a novel therapeutic for refractory ALL.","['Gu, L', 'Zhu, N', 'Findley, H W', 'Zhou, M']","['Gu L', 'Zhu N', 'Findley HW', 'Zhou M']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080214,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2008/02/15 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/02/15 09:00'],"['2008/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200811 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.11 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Apr;22(4):730-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.11.

Only 1 of 10 patients with NPM1 mutations presented chromosome aberrations characteristic of therapy-related disease, and 7q-/-7, the most frequent abnormalities of t-MDS/t-AML, were not observed (P=0.002).

To understand the relationship between the expression of MPO in leukemia cells and the response to chemotherapeutic agents, we established MPO-expressing K562 leukemia cell lines and then treated them with cytosine arabinocide (AraC). Cells expressing wild-type MPO, but not mutant MPO that could not mature, died earlier of apoptosis than control K562 cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated more in leukemia cells expressing MPO, and the generation was abrogated by MPO inhibitors or antioxidants. Tyrosine nitration of cellular protein also increased more in MPO-expressing K562 cells than control cells after treatment with AraC. In clinical samples, CD34-positive AML cells from high-MPO cases showed a tendency to be sensitive to AraC in the colony-formation assay, and the generation of ROS and the nitration of protein were observed only when the percentage of MPO-expressing cells was high.

In a screen program searching for dynamic prognostic determinants, we have identified lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a most suitable follow-up parameter. PATIENTS AND METHODS: LDH levels were serially determined in 221 patients with de novo MDS (median age 70 years, range 24-94). The increase in LDH was correlated with survival and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolution. RESULTS: Confirming previous data, an elevated LDH at diagnosis was found to be associated with an increased probability of AML evolution and decreased probability of survival (P < 0.05). In the follow-up, we found that in patients who progressed (to higher IPSS category or AML), LDH levels were significantly higher in the two 3-month period preceding progression compared with the initial two 3-month period (P < 0.005). In a subgroup of patients, the increase in LDH was accompanied or followed by other signs of disease progression, such as occurrence of thrombocytopenia or appearance of circulating blasts. In multivariate analyses, the LDH increase was found to be an independent prognostic variable. CONCLUSIONS: LDH is an interesting follow-up parameter in MDS, which may assist in early recognition of disease progression and thus help in risk stratification and patient selection for interventional therapies.","['Wimazal, F', 'Sperr, W R', 'Kundi, M', 'Vales, A', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Thalhammer-Scherrer, R', 'Schwarzinger, I', 'Valent, P']","['Wimazal F', 'Sperr WR', 'Kundi M', 'Vales A', 'Fonatsch C', 'Thalhammer-Scherrer R', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080213,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/etiology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/02/15 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/02/15 09:00'],"['2008/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)41850-4 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdm595 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2008 May;19(5):970-6. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdm595.

The primary end point was objective response rate (complete response + partial response) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Secondary end points included safety, toxicity, and progression-free and overall survival.

RESULTS: Median age at transplant was 68 years (range 65-82). Thirty-six percent of patients had a hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index of >2 at the time of transplantation. The cumulative nonrelapse mortality was 8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4-17] at 26 months and the 3-year overall survival (OS) was 61% (95% CI 49-71). On multivariate analysis, disease status at transplant and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > normal were significant predictors for OS (P = 0.002). Comorbidity index of >2 did not impact OS but did predict for higher risk of developing grade 3-5 toxicity (P = 0.006). Eight patients developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia after transplantation (cumulative incidence 16%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with relapsed lymphomas who are >65 years of age should be considered transplant candidates, particularly if they have chemosensitive disease and normal LDH levels at the time of transplantation. Patients with comorbidity index of >2 can also undergo transplantation with acceptable outcomes but may be at higher risk for developing toxicity.","['Hosing, C', 'Saliba, R M', 'Okoroji, G-J', 'Popat, U', 'Couriel, D', 'Ali, T', 'De Padua Silva, L', 'Kebriaei, P', 'Alousi, A', 'De Lima, M', 'Qazilbash, M', 'Anderlini, P', 'Giralt, S', 'Champlin, R E', 'Khouri, I']","['Hosing C', 'Saliba RM', 'Okoroji GJ', 'Popat U', 'Couriel D', 'Ali T', 'De Padua Silva L', 'Kebriaei P', 'Alousi A', 'De Lima M', 'Qazilbash M', 'Anderlini P', 'Giralt S', 'Champlin RE', 'Khouri I']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

To validate the clinical relevance of EVI1-1D, as well as of the other EVI1 splice forms and the related MDS1/EVI1 (ME) gene, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed in 534 untreated adults with de novo AML. EVI1-1D was highly expressed in 6% of cases (n = 32), whereas 7.8% were EVI1(+) (n = 41) when all splice variants were taken into account. High EVI1 predicted a distinctly worse event-free survival (HR = 1.9; P = .002) and disease-free survival (HR = 2.1, P = .006) following multivariate analysis. Importantly, we distinguished a subset of EVI1(+) cases that lacked expression of ME (EVI1(+)ME(-); n = 17) from cases that were ME(+) (EVI1(+)ME(+); n = 24). The atypical EVI1(+)ME(-) expression pattern exhibited cytogenetically detectable chromosomal 3q26 breakpoints in 8 cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed 7 more EVI1(+)ME(-) cases that carried cryptic 3q26 breakpoints, which were not found in the EVI1(+)ME(+) group. EVI1(+)ME(-) expression predicts an extremely poor prognosis distinguishable from the general EVI1(+) AML patients (overall survival [OS]: P < .001 and event-free survival [EFS]: P = .002). We argue that EVI1/ME quantitative expression analysis should be implemented in the molecular diagnostic procedures of AML.","['Lugthart, Sanne', 'van Drunen, Ellen', 'van Norden, Yvette', 'van Hoven, Antoinette', 'Erpelinck, Claudia A J', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['Lugthart S', 'van Drunen E', 'van Norden Y', 'van Hoven A', 'Erpelinck CA', 'Valk PJ', 'Beverloo HB', 'Lowenberg B', 'Delwel R']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080213,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alternative Splicing/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/15 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2008/02/15 09:00'],"['2008/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)40896-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-10-119230 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 15;111(8):4329-37. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-10-119230.

During leukaemia induction chemotherapy, IFI often prohibited further curative treatment, thus predisposing for leukaemia relapse. Continuing myelosuppressive chemotherapy after diagnosis of IFI has become feasible with the now expanding arsenal of safe and effective antifungals. Secondary prophylaxis of IFI is widely administered, but reliable data on outcome and risk factors for recurrent IFI during subsequent chemotherapy are not available. This study determines risk factors for recurrent IFI in leukaemia patients. METHODS: From 25 European cancer centres, 166 consecutive patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and a recent history of proven or probable pulmonary IFI were included. Patients were followed for recurrence or breakthrough IFI during the subsequent chemotherapy cycle. RESULTS: Of the 166 patients included, 69 (41.6%) were female, the median age was 53 years (range 2-81) the and 3 (1.8%) were <16 years. Recurrent IFI occurred in 26 patients (15.7%). Multiple logistic regressions yielded predisposing factors: duration of neutropenia [per additional day; odds ratio (OR) 1.043, confidence interval (CI) 1.008-1.078], high-dose cytarabine (OR 3.920, CI 1.120-12.706), number of antibiotics (per antibiotic; OR 1.504, CI 1.089-2.086), partial response as outcome of prior IFI (OR 4.037, CI 1.301-12.524) and newly diagnosed AML (OR 3.823, CI 0.953-15.340). Usage of high efficiency particulate air filter appeared protective (OR 0.198, CI 0.036-1.089). CONCLUSIONS: Duration of neutropenia, high-dose cytarabine, prior antibiotic therapy and a partial response to the first IFI therapy were risk factors for recurrent IFI and should be considered in AML patients with prior pulmonary IFI undergoing further chemotherapy.","['Cornely, Oliver A', 'Bohme, Angelika', 'Reichert, Dietmar', 'Reuter, Stefan', 'Maschmeyer, Georg', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Buchheidt, Dieter', 'Paluszewska, Monika', 'Arenz, Dorothee', 'Bethe, Ullrich', 'Effelsberg, Jenny', 'Lovenich, Harry', 'Sieniawski, Michal', 'Haas, Antje', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Eimermacher, Hartmut', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Silling, Gerda', 'Hahn, Moritz', 'Wacker, Sidonie', 'Ullmann, Andrew J', 'Karthaus, Meinolf']","['Cornely OA', 'Bohme A', 'Reichert D', 'Reuter S', 'Maschmeyer G', 'Maertens J', 'Buchheidt D', 'Paluszewska M', 'Arenz D', 'Bethe U', 'Effelsberg J', 'Lovenich H', 'Sieniawski M', 'Haas A', 'Einsele H', 'Eimermacher H', 'Martino R', 'Silling G', 'Hahn M', 'Wacker S', 'Ullmann AJ', 'Karthaus M']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Klinikum der Universitat Koln, 50924 Koln, Germany. oliver.cornely@ctuc.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080212,England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chemoprevention', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/15 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2008/02/15 09:00'],"['2008/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['dkn027 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkn027 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2008 Apr;61(4):939-46. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkn027.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether HO-1 expression and proliferation were increased in preneoplastic lesions compared to normal and oral cancer tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was used to examine the expression patterns of HO-1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in a series of normal mucosa and mild-to-severe cases of oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) and oral squamous cell carcinoma. Both HO-1 and PCNA are expressed in the basal cells of normal oral mucosa. In patients with OED and carcinoma in situ, immunostaining for PCNA and HO-1 was more intense, and gradually extended into the superficial layers of the mucosa. HO-1 and PCNA expression was correlated with the degree of epithelial dysplasia. Oral squamous cell carcinoma also showed elevated expression of HO-1, but this level was not higher than in severe OED or carcinoma in situ. These results suggest that the up-regulation of HO-1 in premalignant oral lesions is part of an early cytoprotection mechanism against carcinogenesis in the oral mucosa.","['Lee, J', 'Lee, S-K', 'Lee, B-U', 'Lee, H-J', 'Cho, N-P', 'Yoon, J-H', 'Choi, H-R', 'Lee, S-K', 'Kim, E-C']","['Lee J', 'Lee SK', 'Lee BU', 'Lee HJ', 'Cho NP', 'Yoon JH', 'Choi HR', 'Lee SK', 'Kim EC']","['Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, College of Dentistry, Wonkwang University, Iksan, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080212,Denmark,Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg,International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery,8605826,"['0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma in Situ/enzymology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/enzymology', 'Cytoprotection/physiology', 'Epithelial Cells/enzymology', 'Female', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukoplakia, Oral/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa/*enzymology', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Precancerous Conditions/*enzymology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/02/15 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/02/15 09:00'],"['2007/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2007/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0901-5027(07)00295-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijom.2007.07.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2008 Mar;37(3):287-92. doi: 10.1016/j.ijom.2007.07.028.

Therefore, the P-gp modulators that block P-gp-mediated drug efflux have been developed, and used in combination with standard chemotherapy. In this paper, the capacity of zosuquidar, a specific P-gp modulator, to reverse chemoresistance was examined in both leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts. METHODS: The transporter protein expressions were analyzed by flow cytometry using their specific antibodies. The protein functionalities were assessed by the uptake of their fluorescence substrates in presence or absence their specific modulators. The drug cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT test. RESULTS: Zosuquidar completely or partially restored drug sensitivity in all P-gp-expressing leukemia cell lines tested and enhanced the cytotoxicity of anthracyclines (daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone) and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) in primary AML blasts with active P-gp. In addition, P-gp inhibition by zosuquidar was found to be more potent than cyclosporine A in cells with highly active P-gp. CONCLUSION: These in vitro studies suggest that zosuquidar may be an effective adjunct to cytotoxic chemotherapy for AML patients whose blasts express P-gp, especially for older patients.","['Tang, Ruoping', 'Faussat, Anne-Marie', 'Perrot, Jean-Yves', 'Marjanovic, Zora', 'Cohen, Simy', 'Storme, Thomas', 'Morjani, Hamid', 'Legrand, Ollivier', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre']","['Tang R', 'Faussat AM', 'Perrot JY', 'Marjanovic Z', 'Cohen S', 'Storme T', 'Morjani H', 'Legrand O', 'Marie JP']","['INSERM, U872 Equipe 18 Paris, F-75006 France. ruoping.tang@htd.aphp.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080213,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Dibenzocycloheptenes)', '0 (Quinolines)', '813AGY3126 (zosuquidar trihydrochloride)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dibenzocycloheptenes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2008/02/15 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2008/02/15 09:00'],"['2007/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-8-51 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-8-51 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2008 Feb 13;8:51. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-8-51.,,PMC2258302,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUNX1-related chimeras generated by the chromosomal translocations repress transcriptional activity of wild-type RUNX1 by recruiting the co-repressor/histone deacetylase complex. Thus, histone deacetylase inhibitors are expected to restore normal functions of wild-type RUNX1 and thereby affect the growth and differentiation ability of leukemic cells expressing the chimera. We investigated the in vitro effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors, trichostatin A and valproic acid, on human leukemic cell lines such as SKNO-1 and Kasumi-1 expressing RUNX1/ETO, Reh expressing TEL/RUNX1 and SKH-1 co-expressing RUNX1/EVI1 and BCR/ABL. We also employed K562 cells expressing BCR/ABL without such a chimera as a control. Treatment with each inhibitor increased acetylated histone 4 in all of these cell lines. Interestingly, proliferation of SKNO-1, Kasumi-1, SKH-1 and Reh cells was significantly suppressed after 3-day culture with trichostatin A or valproic acid, when compared to that of K562 cells. We observed cell cycle arrest and apoptotic induction in the RUNX1 chimera-expressing cells by the propidium iodide staining. Up- and downregulation of cell cycle regulator genes appeared to be the molecular basis for the former, and activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic caspases for the latter. We propose histone deacetylase inhibitors to be an attractive choice in the molecular targeting therapy of RUNX1-related leukemia.","['Sasaki, Ko', 'Yamagata, Tetsuya', 'Mitani, Kinuko']","['Sasaki K', 'Yamagata T', 'Mitani K']","['Department of Hematology, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, 880 Kitakobayashi, Mibu-machi, Shimotsuga-gun, Tochigi 321-0293, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Mutant Chimeric Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/*metabolism', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2008/02/15 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/02/15 09:00'],"['2008/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS699 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00699.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 Feb;99(2):414-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00699.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with an interstitial deletion of Chromosome 5q have a high rate of response to lenalidomide, but most MDS patients lack this deletion. Approximately 25% of patients without 5q deletions also benefit from lenalidomide therapy, but response in these patients cannot be predicted by any currently available diagnostic assays. The aim of this study was to develop a method to predict lenalidomide response in order to avoid unnecessary toxicity in patients unlikely to benefit from treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using gene expression profiling, we identified a molecular signature that predicts lenalidomide response. The signature was defined in a set of 16 pretreatment bone marrow aspirates from MDS patients without 5q deletions, and validated in an independent set of 26 samples. The response signature consisted of a cohesive set of erythroid-specific genes with decreased expression in responders, suggesting that a defect in erythroid differentiation underlies lenalidomide response. Consistent with this observation, treatment with lenalidomide promoted erythroid differentiation of primary hematopoietic progenitor cells grown in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate that lenalidomide-responsive patients have a defect in erythroid differentiation, and suggest a strategy for a clinical test to predict patients most likely to respond to the drug. The experiments further suggest that the efficacy of lenalidomide, whose mechanism of action in MDS is unknown, may be due to its ability to induce erythroid differentiation.","['Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Galili, Naomi', 'Tamayo, Pablo', 'Bosco, Jocelyn', 'Mak, Raymond', 'Pretz, Jennifer', 'Tanguturi, Shyam', 'Ladd-Acosta, Christine', 'Stone, Richard', 'Golub, Todd R', 'Raza, Azra']","['Ebert BL', 'Galili N', 'Tamayo P', 'Bosco J', 'Mak R', 'Pretz J', 'Tanguturi S', 'Ladd-Acosta C', 'Stone R', 'Golub TR', 'Raza A']","['Broad Institute of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,PLoS Med,PLoS medicine,101231360,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/drug effects/genetics', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic/methods', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Genetic Markers/drug effects/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2008/02/15 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2008/02/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['07-PLME-RA-0604 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pmed.0050035 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Med. 2008 Feb;5(2):e35. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050035.,,PMC2235894,"['K08 HL078818/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG003945/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01-HG003945-01/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08-HL078818-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['PLoS Med. 2008 Feb;5(2):e40.

However, few data are available as the treatment of elderly patients with relapsed disease is concerned. The aim of this study was of collecting data on criteria adopted for the treatment of these patients. A questionnaire was e-mailed to 32 haematologic institutions involved in the Gruppo Italiano per le Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) group. Questions to be addressed regarded: (1) per cent of relapsed elderly patients treated with aggressive salvage chemotherapy; (2) the selection criteria adopted for inclusion into intensive reinduction; (3) the specific treatment adopted; (4) the treatment given to patients not eligible for intensive salvage. Per cent of patients enrolled into aggressive salvage regimens varied from 10 to 80% (median 50%). The most frequent factor influencing the therapeutic choice was performance status (97%). Additional factors were age >70 years (44%) and duration of first CR (53%). Fludarabine including regimens were most frequently used as aggressive salvage therapy (59%), while gemtuzumab ozogamicin was adopted in various combinations at 11 out of 32 institutions (34%). For patients not eligible to aggressive therapy, the most frequent approach included hydroxyurea (59%). Low dose ARA-C (LDARA-C) was adopted at five centres: as single agent (n = 1), with 6-thioguanine (n = 1), with vitamin D3 and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (n = 2), or with ATRA alone (n = 1). The FLT3 inhibitor CEP-701 was used at one centre. We conclude that the treatment of AML in elderly relapsed patients is extremely heterogeneous. A marked selection is operated as to inclusion into aggressive salvage regimens and only a small minority of patients are offered experimental approaches.","['Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Mandelli, Franco']","['Ferrara F', 'Fazi P', 'Venditti A', 'Pagano L', 'Amadori S', 'Mandelli F']","['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Cardarelli Hospital, Napoli, Italy. felicettoferrara@katamail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/14 09:00,2008/07/30 09:00,['2008/02/14 09:00'],"['2008/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.846 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2008 Jun;26(2):104-7. doi: 10.1002/hon.846.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of a large Danish-Swedish population-based case-control study, 2,819 lymphoma patients and 1,856 controls of second-generation Danish-Swedish origin were screened for HCV infection using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a confirming recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) test. Positive samples were tested with real-time PCR for the presence of HCV RNA. The association between HCV infection and risk of malignant lymphoma was assessed by logistic regression. When intermediate RIBA test results were interpreted as positive, anti-HCV antibody positivity was associated with a nonsignificant increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) overall (odds ratio (OR) = 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-5.3; n = 20 cases), of B-cell lymphomas combined (OR = 2.4 [1.0-5.8]; n = 20) and of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (OR = 5.2 [1.0-26.4]; n = 2). No patients with T-cell or Hodgkin lymphoma were HCV-positive.

METHODS: All incident cases of leukemia and lymphoma diagnosed between 1/1/1986 and 12/31/1998 in six counties in Northern Germany were actively ascertained. Controls were selected from population registries. Use of pesticides, sources of food supply, time spent at home and work, medical and family history were assessed via face-to-face interview. This self-reported information was used in conjunction with direct environmental measurements of pesticides in household dust and electromagnetic fields (EMFs). In addition, geographical information system (GIS) data were used to derive estimates of environmental exposure to pesticides, EMFs associated with transmission lines, and ionizing radiation from routine nuclear power reactor operations. Occupational exposure assessment was based on lifetime work history. For each job, information on branch of industry, company, job description, and duration of employment were ascertained. RESULTS: Fourteen hundred thirty cases and 3041 controls were recruited. Lifetime residential and workplace histories totaled 49,628 addresses. Occupational exposure to pesticides was reported by 15% of the male participants (women: 16%). Four percent of the men (women: 8%) were occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation for >or=1 year over their lifetime. Sixty four percent of the participants had lived in the vicinity (20 km) of a nuclear power plant in operation. CONCLUSIONS: The NLL illustrates the successful application of innovative methods to simultaneously assess occupational and environmental risk factors for leukemia and lymphoma including radiological hazards, pesticides, and EMFs.","['Hoffmann, W', 'Terschueren, C', 'Heimpel, H', 'Feller, A', 'Butte, W', 'Hostrup, O', 'Richardson, D', 'Greiser, E']","['Hoffmann W', 'Terschueren C', 'Heimpel H', 'Feller A', 'Butte W', 'Hostrup O', 'Richardson D', 'Greiser E']","['Institute for Community Medicine, Section of Health Care Epidemiology and Community Health, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany. wolfgang.hoffmann@uni-greifswald.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,"['0 (Dust)', '0 (Pesticides)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dust', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Occupational Health', 'Pesticides/toxicity', 'Risk Factors']",2008/02/14 09:00,2008/06/21 09:00,['2008/02/14 09:00'],"['2008/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.20551 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2008 Apr;51(4):246-57. doi: 10.1002/ajim.20551.,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the main case series or clinical studies to identify the best indications of rituximab and the situations at substantial risks for adverse events. Refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura was the main indication. However, the long term benefit-to-risk ratio of rituximab treatment before or after splenectomy is unknown. A single 375 mg/m2 infusion may be as efficacious as the classical four infusions cycle. Rituximab is the best treatment for cold agglutinin disease. In warm agglutinin auto-immune anaemia, its efficacy has essentially been reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and in children. In CLL patients, lethal adverse events occurred in patients also receiving cyclophosphamide. Rituximab seems to have an interesting benefit-to-risk ratio in Wegener granulomatosis (excepted in granulomatous lesions), HCV-associated symptomatic cryoglobulinemia in patients unresponsive to anti-viral therapy, pemphigus and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Efficacy and safety data in lupus are difficult to interpret. Serum sickness disease is not exceptional in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), lupus and sicca syndrome patients. A substantial infectious risk has been reported in pemphigus patients and in post-renal transplant cryoglobulinemia.

The mechanism of endothelial and myeloid cell specification and differentiation is poorly understood. We have previously described the endothelial-specific zebrafish Ets1-related protein (Etsrp), which was both necessary and sufficient to initiate vasculogenesis in the zebrafish embryos. Here we identify human Etv2/ER71 and mouse ER71 proteins as functional orthologs of Etsrp. Overexpression of mouse ER71 and Etsrp caused strong expansion of hemangioblast and vascular endothelial lineages in a zebrafish embryo. In addition, we show that etsrp is also required for the formation of myeloid but not erythroid cells. In the absence of etsrp function, the number of granulocytes and macrophages is greatly reduced. Etsrp overexpression causes expansion of both myeloid and vascular endothelial lineages. Analysis of mosaic embryos indicates that etsrp functions cell autonomously in inducing myeloid lineage. We further demonstrate that the choice of endothelial versus myeloid fate depends on a combinatorial effect of etsrp, scl, and alk8 genes.","['Sumanas, Saulius', 'Gomez, Gustavo', 'Zhao, Yan', 'Park, Changwon', 'Choi, Kyunghee', 'Lin, Shuo']","['Sumanas S', 'Gomez G', 'Zhao Y', 'Park C', 'Choi K', 'Lin S']","['Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, USA. saulius.sumanas@cchmc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080212,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (ER71 protein, mouse)', '0 (Etv2 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors, Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (acvr1l protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Activin Receptors, Type I/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*physiology']",2008/02/14 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/02/14 09:00'],"['2008/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41138-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-110569 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 1;111(9):4500-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-110569.

METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) was used to detect the KIR distribution of 150 healthy people and the KIR genotype of donor and HLA genotype of allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients of 74 donor-recipient pairs, and a retrospective study was carried out to analyze the outcomes of 45 patients with various hematological malignancies who received non T-cell-depleted transplant from HLA-identical sibling donors, all the subjects being of Han nationality in north China. RESULTS: The gene frequencies of KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2, KIR2DL3, and KIR3DL1 were 100%, 20%, 100%, and 95% respectively. 96% of the allogeneic donors carried one of the 3 class I ligands of inhibitory KIR. 36 of the 45 (80%) donor-recipient HLA-identical sibling transplant pairs lacked recipient HLA ligand for donor KIR, among which 35 lacked recipient HLA ligand for donor KIR2DL1, 1 pair lacked that for KIR2DL2/2DL3, and 31 pairs lacked that for KIR3DL1. Cumulative incidence analysis of graft versus host disease (GVHD) in the patients undergoing HLA-identical sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation demonstrated that the incidence of severe acute GVHD (aGVHD) in the patients lacking HLA ligand for donor-inhibitory KIR2DL1 was 31%, significantly lower than that of the patients with HLA ligand for donor-inhibitory KIR2DL1 (70%, P = 0.029), and the incidence of severe aGVHD in the acute myeloid leukemia patients lacking HLA ligand for donor-inhibitory KIR and KIR2DL1 was 18%, significantly lower than that of the KIR compatible patients (75%, P = 0.03).

The influence of this activation on programmed cell death of human mast cells has not yet been clarified. This study evaluates the influence of IgE-dependent activation alone and in synergy with TRAIL on the expression of molecules involved in the apoptotic signal transduction. METHODS: Human cord blood derived mast cells (CBMC) were cultured with myeloma IgE followed by activation with anti-human IgE. The expression of proteins involved in apoptotic signal transduction was assessed by immunoblot analysis. To test the effect of activation on a pro-apoptotic stimulus, activated, IgE-treated and resting CBMC were incubated with TRAIL, or in a medium with suboptimal concentrations of stem cell factor (SCF). RESULTS: In accordance with a previous study of ours, it was found that IgE-dependent activation increased TRAIL-induced caspase-8 and caspase-3 cleavage. However, it did not have a significant influence on CBMC death induced by SCF withdrawal. IgE-dependent activation increased the expression of FLIP and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) anti-apoptotic molecules as well as the pro-apoptotic one, BIM. In addition, a decrease in BID expression was observed. TRAIL could reverse the increase in FLIP but did not influence the upregulation of MCL-1 and of BIM. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that IgE-dependent activation of human mast cells induces an increase in both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic molecules. We therefore hypothesized that IgE-dependent activation may regulate human mast cell apoptosis by fine-tuning anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors.","['Berent-Maoz, B', 'Salemi, S', 'Mankuta, D', 'Simon, H-U', 'Levi-Schaffer, F']","['Berent-Maoz B', 'Salemi S', 'Mankuta D', 'Simon HU', 'Levi-Schaffer F']","['Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Caspase 3/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Probability', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/02/14 09:00,2008/03/14 09:00,['2008/02/14 09:00'],"['2008/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['ALL1598 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01598.x [doi]']",ppublish,Allergy. 2008 Mar;63(3):333-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01598.x.,,,,,,,,,,,['Allergy. 2009 Apr;64(4):666'],,,,,,,

We analysed data for 16 705 BC survivors treated at the Curie Institute (1981-1997) by either chemotherapy (various regimens), radiotherapy (high-energy photons from a 60Co unit or linear accelerator) and/or hormone therapy (2-5 years of tamoxifen). We calculated age-standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for each malignancy, using data for the general French population from five regional registries. At a median follow-up 10.5 years, 709 patients had developed a second malignancy. The greatest increases in risk were for leukaemia (SIR: 2.07 (1.52-2.75)), ovarian cancer (SIR: 1.6 (1.27-2.04)) and gynaecological (cervical/endometrial) cancer (SIR: 1.6 (1.34-1.89); P<0.0001). The SIR for gastrointestinal cancer, the most common malignancy, was 0.82 (0.70-0.95; P<0.007). The increase in leukaemia was most strongly related to chemotherapy and that in gynaecological cancers to hormone therapy. Radiotherapy alone also had a significant, although lesser, effect on leukaemia and gynaecological cancer incidence. The increased risk of sarcomas and lung cancer was attributed to radiotherapy. No increased risk was observed for malignant melanoma, lymphoma, genitourinary, thyroid or head and neck cancer. There is a significantly increased risk of several kinds of second malignancy in women treated for BC, compared with the general population. This increase may be related to adjuvant treatment in some cases. However, the absolute risk is small.","['Kirova, Y M', 'De Rycke, Y', 'Gambotti, L', 'Pierga, J-Y', 'Asselain, B', 'Fourquet, A']","['Kirova YM', 'De Rycke Y', 'Gambotti L', 'Pierga JY', 'Asselain B', 'Fourquet A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France. youlia.kirova@curie.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080212,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['6604241 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6604241 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2008 Mar 11;98(5):870-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604241.

Under physiological conditions, they circulate in the blood and through the tissues to serve their functions. In certain inflammatory states, they enter the T-cell areas of lymph nodes (LNs) that drain the inflamed tissue and communicate with T cells in LNs, but the underlying mechanism that regulates their trafficking to LNs is not yet fully explored. Here, we report that a human eosinophilic leukemia cell line, EoL-1, and human peripheral blood (PB) eosinophils become reactive to the lymphoid chemokines CCL21 and CCL25 upon stimulation. METHODS: EoL-1 cells were differentiated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dEoL-1) and subsequently pulsed with IFN-gamma, IL-3 and GM-CSF. The eosinophil fraction was purified from normal human adult PB and incubated for 1 day with the same cytokine combination. RESULTS: Upon cytokine stimulation, dEoL-1 cells expressed chemokine receptors CCR7, CCR9 and CCR3 and developed chemotactic responsiveness to CCL21, CCL25 and CCL11, which bind to the respective receptors. Human PB eosinophils also showed chemotactic responsiveness to CCL21 and CCL25 upon stimulation with IFN-gamma, IL-3 and GM-CSF. In addition, the cytokine-stimulated dEoL-1 cells expressed costimulatory molecules, including CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR, and also expressed a tolerogenic and Th2-polarizing enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro observations raise the possibility that eosinophils may utilize lymphoid chemokines to enter LNs and serve antigen-presenting functions in the LN under certain inflammatory conditions.","['Jung, Yun-Jae', 'Woo, So-Youn', 'Jang, Myoung-Ho', 'Miyasaka, Masayuki', 'Ryu, Kyung-Ha', 'Park, Hae-Kyung', 'Seoh, Ju-Young']","['Jung YJ', 'Woo SY', 'Jang MH', 'Miyasaka M', 'Ryu KH', 'Park HK', 'Seoh JY']","['Department of Microbiology, Gachon Medical School, Incheon, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080211,Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (CC chemokine receptor 9)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, CCR)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Eosinophils/cytology/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/immunology/pharmacology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Microscopy, Video', 'Receptors, CCR/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, CCR7/genetics/*immunology']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['000115891 [pii]', '10.1159/000115891 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2008;146(3):227-34. doi: 10.1159/000115891.

The study of the leukaemia risk in over 14000 irradiated spondylitis patients was completed in an astonishingly short period of time in the mid-1950s. The full report of the original study has been difficult to access because it was not published in a journal but only as a Special Report of the UK Medical Research Council. To mark 50 years since this publication this full report is reproduced in this issue of the Journal. This accompanying review describes the background to the study, the principal findings and the further follow-up of the population that documented the risks of cancers in addition to leukaemia associated with the x-ray treatment. The architects of the study were a radiobiologist, Michael Court-Brown, and an epidemiologist, Richard Doll. Their very productive study of the leukaemia risk among spondylitics spawned a lifelong collaboration including further seminal studies of the carcinogenic effects of radiation exposure, which are also summarised in the review.","['Smith, Peter G']",['Smith PG'],"['London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London WC1E 7HT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20071127,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*etiology', 'Biomedical Research/history', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Spondylitis, Ankylosing/*radiotherapy']",2008/03/08 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/03/08 09:00'],"['2008/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/0952-4746/27/4B/R01 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2007 Dec;27(4B):B3-B14. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/27/4B/R01.

It plays a key role in the adhesion of both hematopoietic progenitor cells and leukemic blast cells to bone marrow stromal cells which express the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) or produce fibronectin. VLA-4 expression has been associated with bone-marrow minimal residual disease, which causes relapse after chemotherapy in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Conversely, the absence of VLA-4 reduces bone marrow retention of both hematopoietic progenitor and leukemic blast cells. We report on the downregulation of VLA-4/CD49d for various acute myelogenous leukemia cells lines, on primary cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, and on hematopoietic stem cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors on treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid, which is associated with decreased adhesion to mesenchymal stromal cells. These findings suggest that HDAC-inhibitor treatment may on the one hand impair stem cell homing, while on the other it may improve peripheral blood stem cell mobilization and significantly help to reduce minimal residual disease from acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Mahlknecht, Ulrich', 'Schonbein, Christiane']","['Mahlknecht U', 'Schonbein C']","['Saarland University Medical Center Department of Immunotherapy and Gene Therapy, Kirrberger Strasse, Bldg. 4.3, D-66424 Homburg/Saar, Germany. ulrich.mahlknecht@uks.eu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080211,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/prevention & control', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Vorinostat']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/07/04 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.11796 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11796 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Mar;93(3):443-6. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11796.

The aim of this long-term follow-up study was to determine the incidence, the time free of second tumors, and risk factors for developing secondary cancer in a homogeneous group of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated a total of 563 patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma enrolled in Gruppo Italiano Studio Linfomi trials from 1988 to 2003. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 62 months, 39 patients (6.9%) developed secondary cancer: 12 myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myeloid leukemia, and 27 solid tumors. The overall standardized incidence ratio of secondary malignancy in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was higher than the risk of malignancy in the general population. The standardized incidence ratio was elevated in male patients and in patients under 65 years old at first treatment. Overall, the cumulative incidence of secondary cancer at 12 years was 10.5%, after correction in a competing-risk model. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that older age at the time of diagnosis, male sex, and fludarabine-containing therapy had significant negative impacts on the time free of second tumors. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified subgroups of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with increased standardized incidence ratios of secondary malignancy and variables that have a negative impact on the time free of second tumors. This information could help physicians to select the most appropriate treatments. Finally, taking into account the possible occurrence of secondary neoplasia, long-term monitoring must be considered.","['Sacchi, Stefano', 'Marcheselli, Luigi', 'Bari, Alessia', 'Marcheselli, Raffaella', 'Pozzi, Samantha', 'Luminari, Stefano', 'Lombardo, Marco', 'Buda, Gabriele', 'Lazzaro, Antonio', 'Gobbi, Paolo G', 'Stelitano, Caterina', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Quarta, Giovanni', 'Brugiatelli, Maura']","['Sacchi S', 'Marcheselli L', 'Bari A', 'Marcheselli R', 'Pozzi S', 'Luminari S', 'Lombardo M', 'Buda G', 'Lazzaro A', 'Gobbi PG', 'Stelitano C', 'Morabito F', 'Quarta G', 'Brugiatelli M']","['Dipartimento di Oncologia ed Ematologia, Universita di Modena Centro Oncologico Modenese Policlinico, 41100 Modena, Italy. ssacchi@unimo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080211,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Radioimmunotherapy/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/07/04 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12120 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12120 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Mar;93(3):398-404. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12120.

Here, we report on studies performed with a novel small molecule inhibitor, PHA-739358, which selectively targets Bcr-Abl and Aurora kinases A to C. PHA-739358 exhibits strong antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity against a broad panel of human BCR-ABL-positive and -negative cell lines and against murine BaF3 cells ectopically expressing wild-type (wt) or IM-resistant BCR-ABL mutants, including T315I. Pharmacologic synergism of IM and PHA-739358 was observed in leukemia cell lines with subtotal resistance to IM. Treatment with PHA-739358 significantly decreased phosphorylation of histone H3, a marker of Aurora B activity and of CrkL, a downstream target of Bcr-Abl, suggesting that PHA-739358 acts via combined inhibition of Bcr-Abl and Aurora kinases. Moreover, strong antiproliferative effects of PHA-739358 were observed in CD34(+) cells derived from untreated CML patients and from IM-resistant individuals in chronic phase or blast crisis, including those harboring the T315I mutation. Thus, PHA-739358 represents a promising new strategy for treatment of IM-resistant BCR-ABL-positive leukemias, including those harboring the T315I mutation. Clinical trials investigating this compound in IM-resistant CML have recently been initiated.","['Gontarewicz, Artur', 'Balabanov, Stefan', 'Keller, Gunhild', 'Colombo, Riccardo', 'Graziano, Alessio', 'Pesenti, Enrico', 'Benten, Daniel', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Moll, Jurgen', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Gontarewicz A', 'Balabanov S', 'Keller G', 'Colombo R', 'Graziano A', 'Pesenti E', 'Benten D', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Fiedler W', 'Moll J', 'Brummendorf TH']","['Klinik fur Onkologie und Hamatologie, Universitares Cancer Center, Universitatsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080211,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurkb protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'M3X659D0FY (danusertib)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aurora Kinase B', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)40899-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-113175 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 15;111(8):4355-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-113175.

Diagnosis of IA has been difficult and often delayed and treatment outcome has been poor, with mortality rates up to 80%. This review summarizes recent developments in this field. There are indications that the incidence of IA may be decreasing due to multiple factors including better understanding of pathogenesis of IA, earlier diagnosis, and various prophylactic and preventive strategies. Recently posaconazole has shown to be effective in reducing the risk of IA in patients treated for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Early use of high-resolution thoracic computed tomography assisted with complimentary methods including bronchoalveolar lavage and serum galactomannan determinations are useful in early diagnosis. Our treatment armamentarium against IA has broadened significantly during the last years and there are some indications of improved outcome more recently. On the other hand, increasing use of blood progenitor grafts instead of marrow with higher risk of chronic GVHD, increasing age of SCT recipients, and wide use of donor lymphocyte infusions for treatment of minimal residual disease or relapse may affect to the opposite direction. Despite some promises and improvements, IA will continue to remain a challenge in the upcoming years.","['Jantunen, E', 'Nihtinen, A', 'Anttila, V-J']","['Jantunen E', 'Nihtinen A', 'Anttila VJ']","['Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. esa.jantunen@kuh.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080211,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Mannans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/microbiology', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Mannans/blood', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['TID301 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3062.2008.00301.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2008 Jun;10(3):156-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3062.2008.00301.x.

Neutrophils undergo spontaneous apoptosis which, if not tightly regulated, can induce the development of chronic inflammatory disease. The Bcl-2 protein family is also involved in the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis. METHODS: This study investigated the apoptosis and expression of some regulatory factors in CD patient and control polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) in suspension and in adhesion on fibronectin, an extracellular matrix protein. These 2 conditions mimic circulating neutrophils before they are recruited at the intestinal levels, and their adhesion to tissue. RESULTS: Apoptosis in CD patient PMN was delayed in suspension and accelerated in adhesion, which is the opposite of what happens in controls. Higher levels of Bax, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 proteins were registered in freshly isolated CD patient PMN, in contrast to controls, in which Bcl-2 protein was undetectable. Among the studied pro- and antiapoptotic factors, Bax levels seem to be mainly related to the difference in apoptosis between PMN of CD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time it has been demonstrated by direct experimental evidence that apoptosis in CD patient PMN is regulated differently from that of control PMN. Abnormal expression of regulating apoptosis proteins is shown in CD patient PMN. These data suggest that the defective functionality of neutrophils can be the early event responsible for the altered mucosal immune response in CD, and that neutrophil apoptosis may offer a new target for specific drugs and therapy tools.","['Catarzi, Serena', 'Marcucci, Tommaso', 'Papucci, Laura', 'Favilli, Fabio', 'Donnini, Martino', 'Tonelli, Francesco', 'Vincenzini, Maria Teresa', 'Iantomasi, Teresa']","['Catarzi S', 'Marcucci T', 'Papucci L', 'Favilli F', 'Donnini M', 'Tonelli F', 'Vincenzini MT', 'Iantomasi T']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biochimiche, Firenze, Italia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Inflamm Bowel Dis,Inflammatory bowel diseases,9508162,"['0 (BCL2L15 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Crohn Disease/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*blood', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*blood']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/09/27 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ibd.20397 [doi]'],ppublish,Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2008 Jun;14(6):819-25. doi: 10.1002/ibd.20397.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morbidity due to DKA in children with ALL has not been systematically studied. PROCEDURES: We reviewed risk factors and clinical consequences of DKA in patients undergoing therapy for ALL at SJCRH between 1991 and 2006. RESULTS: DKA occurred in 6 of 797 evaluable patients. Only older age at diagnosis of ALL was a risk factor for DKA. Four of six patients with DKA as compared to 232 of the other 791 patients were older than 10 years (P = 0.03). Race, sex, body mass index, leukemia immunophenotype, ALL risk category, white blood cell count at diagnosis, and treatment protocol were not associated with DKA. All patients were managed with intravenous fluids, dietary modification, and short-term use of insulin. Patients were hospitalized for 4-12 days, with a median ICU stay of 1 day. In two patients, correction of hyperglycemia was too rapid, and two others experienced hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy. There were no permanent complications of DKA or its treatment. No patient required long-term insulin use. No patient had recurrent DKA; only one of the six patients had a subsequent hyperglycemia episode. All six patients are alive in remission 6-13 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hyperglycemia during treatment for ALL should be screened for clinical evidence of DKA, which may require more intensive supportive care than those without ketoacidosis. The occurrence of DKA should not lead to alteration of ALL treatment.","['Roberson, Jessica R', 'Raju, Sailaja', 'Shelso, John', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Howard, Scott C']","['Roberson JR', 'Raju S', 'Shelso J', 'Pui CH', 'Howard SC']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. jessica.roberson@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis/chemically induced/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Risk Factors']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21505 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jun;50(6):1207-12. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21505.,,,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, genomic damage as a longer term consequence of radiation exposure has more recently been demonstrated due to untargeted radiation effects including delayed chromosomal instability and bystander effects. These processes, mainly studied in vitro, are characterized by un-irradiated cells demonstrating effects as though they themselves had been irradiated and have been associated with altered oxidative processes. To investigate the potential for these untargeted effects of radiation to produce delayed damaging events in vivo, we studied a well-characterized model of radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia in CBA/Ca mice. Haemopoietic tissues of irradiated CBA/Ca mice exhibit enhanced levels of p53 stabilization, increased levels of p21(waf1), and increased amounts of apoptosis, as expected, in the first few hours post-irradiation, but also at much later times: weeks and months after the initial exposure. Because these responses are seen in cells that were not themselves directly irradiated but are the descendants of irradiated cells, the data are consistent with an initial radiation exposure leading to persistently increased levels of ongoing DNA damage, analogous to radiation-induced chromosomal instability. To investigate the potential source of ongoing oxidative processes, we show increased levels of 3-nitrotyrosine, a marker of damaging nitrogen/oxygen species in macrophages. Not all animals show increased oxidative activity or p53 responses as long-term consequences of irradiation, but increased levels of p53, p21, and apoptosis are directly correlated with increased 3-nitrotyrosine in individual mice post-irradiation. The data implicate persistent activation of inflammatory-type responses in irradiated tissues as a contributory bystander mechanism for causing delayed DNA damage.","['Coates, P J', 'Robinson, J I', 'Lorimore, S A', 'Wright, E G']","['Coates PJ', 'Robinson JI', 'Lorimore SA', 'Wright EG']","['Division of Pathology and Neurosciences, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, DD1 9SY, UK. p.j.coates@dundee.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '3604-79-3 (3-nitrotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bystander Effect', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.2321 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2008 Apr;214(5):610-6. doi: 10.1002/path.2321.,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2008 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland'],,,,,,,,,,,,

There are five major medically important species of Candida with their frequency of isolation in the diminishing order namely Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei. In addition, there are numerous other species of Candida which differ in their genetic makeup, virulence properties, drug susceptibilities and sugar assimilation capabilities. In this report, an unusual Candida species was isolated from the blood of two leukaemic patients. Conventional culture and biochemical tests identified the Candida species as C. parapsilosis. Using fungal-specific oligonucleotide primers ITS1 and ITS4, we managed to amplify the ribosomal RNA gene and its internal transcribed spacer region from the genomic DNA of these isolates. The PCR products were then purified and subjected to automated DNA sequencing using BLAST and CLUSTAL sequence analysis identified these isolates to be Candida orthopsilosis. Candida orthopsilosis is a new species recently identified in 2005, being morphologically indistinguishable from C. parapsilosis and was previously classified as a subspecies of C. parapsilosis. This report highlights the importance of complementing traditional culture and biochemical-based identification methods with DNA-based molecular assays such as PCR as the latter is more superior in terms of its discriminatory power and speed.","['Yong, P V C', 'Chong, P P', 'Lau, L Y', 'Yeoh, R S C', 'Jamal, F']","['Yong PV', 'Chong PP', 'Lau LY', 'Yeoh RS', 'Jamal F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University Putra Malaysia, 43400 Serdang, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080212,Netherlands,Mycopathologia,Mycopathologia,7505689,"['0 (DNA, Ribosomal Spacer)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Candida/classification/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis/blood/microbiology', 'DNA, Ribosomal Spacer/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Ribosomal/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/05/31 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2007/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11046-007-9086-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycopathologia. 2008 Feb;165(2):81-7. doi: 10.1007/s11046-007-9086-8.

This study compares the sensitivity of PCR analysis of the T-cell receptor-gamma (TCR-gamma) gene rearrangements using conventional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PCR-PAGE) and fluorescent capillary electrophoresis (PCR-FCE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 22 paraffin blocks were analysed using PCR-PAGE and PCR-FCE. There were 17 cases of mycosis fungoides (MF), 4 cases of non-MF CTCL and 1 case of lymphoblastic leukaemia. RESULTS: Complete agreement was obtained between PCR-PAGE and PCR-FCE in 19 of the 22 cases, giving a concordance rate of 86.4%. PCR-FCE had a higher sensitivity of 77.3%, compared to 63.6% for PCR-PAGE, allowing the detection of 3 additional cases of clonal T-cell rearrangements, which had equivocal or polyclonal bands on PAGE. Two of these 3 cases were in erythrodermic MF patients. PCR-FCE also allowed the detection of matching clones in serial specimens taken from different sites and at different time intervals in patients with MF. However, matching clones from different specimens can be achieved qualitatively in PCR-PAGE by running and comparing these on the same polyacrylamide gel block. CONCLUSIONS: Both PCR-PAGE and PCR-FCE are useful in detecting T-cell clones in CTCL, with both methods being comparable in sensitivity and showing a high concordance rate of 86.4%. PCR-FCE has the added advantage of exhibiting semiquantitative properties, which may be important in early or erythrodermic MF cases, but the requirement for sophisticated and costly machinery limits its availability to high-capacity laboratories. The well-established PCR-PAGE method is a suitable alternative in routine clinical applications.","['Tang, Mark B Y', 'Chong, Tina K L', 'Tan, Eugene S T', 'Sun, Yong Jiang', 'Tan, Suat Hoon']","['Tang MB', 'Chong TK', 'Tan ES', 'Sun YJ', 'Tan SH']","['National Skin Centre, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary/*methods', '*Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Fluorescence', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis', 'Mycosis Fungoides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/09/24 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2008 Jan;37(1):27-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Department of Haematology established a new set of consensus guidelines in 2002 for antibiotic use in febrile neutropenia. The aim of our study was to audit adherence to the guidelines established for febrile neutropenia in patients treated for haematologic malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An antibiotic escalation pathway was developed by haematologists and infectious disease physicians. Adherence to the guidelines was audited. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) who had febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy were reviewed. The audit was performed by a retrospective review of casenotes. RESULTS: Forty patients with 100 episodes of febrile neutropenia were surveyed. Thirty-two had AML, 7 had ALL and 1 had undifferentiated leukaemia. In 76% of episodes, fever developed within the first 14 days of neutropenia. In 31 episodes, cefepime was started as the first-line agent; hence, compliance with the first-line agent was 31%. Fever defervesced in 13 episodes. The most common reason for switching antibiotics was persistent fever. There were clinical indications for non-compliance with the use of the first-line agent in all cases. There were 3 deaths - none related to non-compliance with or strict adherence to the guidelines. Four patients had proven fungal infections. CONCLUSIONS: Given the complex nature of the cases, compliance was reasonable, as there were valid reasons in all cases where the guidelines were not adhered to. Based on our findings, the guidelines could be simplified.","['Wong, Gee Chuan', 'Tan, Ban Hock']","['Wong GC', 'Tan BH']","['Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore. wong.gee.chuan@sgh.com.sg']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', '*Hematology', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medical Audit', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Singapore']",2008/02/13 09:00,2008/09/24 09:00,['2008/02/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2008 Jan;37(1):21-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Age groups examined were those aged 20-59 and those > or =20 years. Data on occupation was obtained from death certificates. RESULTS: From 1988-1997, annually 12-54% of women had a codeable occupation on their death certificate, leaving 3079 deaths among women 20-59 years, and 7236 in those > or =20 years for analysis.

A substantial proportion of cases exhibiting recurrent reciprocal translocations at diagnosis, such as t(8;21) or t(15;17) have been exhaustively studied and are currently employed in clinical diagnosis. However, a definitive conclusion regarding the leukaemogenic potential of defined transgenes for this disease remains elusive. While it is increasingly apparent that a number of cooperating mutations are necessary to develop a leukaemic phenotype, the number of models reflecting these synergisms remains few. Furthermore, little emphasis has been paid to the effect of chromosomal translocations other than recurrent genetic abnormalities, with no models reflecting the multiple abnormalities observed in high-risk cases of AML accounting for 8-10% of adult AML. Here we review the differing technologies employed in generation of GEM of AML. We discuss the relevance of GEM AML from embryonic stem cell-mediated (for example retinoic acid receptor-alpha fusions and AML1/ETO) models; through to the valuable retroviral-mediated gene transfer models. The latter have been used to great effect in defining the transforming properties of chromosomal translocation products such as MLL (found in 5-6% of all AML cases) and NUP98 (denoting poor prognosis in therapy-related disease) and particularly when co-transduced with bad prognostic factors such as Flt3 mutations. Finally, we comment on the emergence of newer transduction technologies, which can regulate the level of expression to defined cell lineages in both primary murine and human xenografts, and discuss how combining multiple genetic modalities, more relevant models of this complex disease are being generated.","['McCormack, E', 'Bruserud, O', 'Gjertsen, B T']","['McCormack E', 'Bruserud O', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Institute of Medicine, Haematology Section, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080211,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Models, Genetic', 'Prognosis']",2008/02/12 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc200816 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.16 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jun 19;27(27):3765-79. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.16.

Go, a member of the Go/Gi family, is the most abundant heterotrimeric G protein in the brain. Most mechanistic analyses on Go activation demonstrate that its action is mediated by the Gbetagamma dimer; downstream effectors for its alpha subunit (Goalpha) have not been clearly defined. Here, we employ the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for Goalpha-interacting partners in a cDNA library from human fetal brain. The transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) specifically bound to Goalpha. Interactions between PLZF and Goalpha were confirmed using in vitro and in vivo affinity binding assays. Activated Goalpha interacted directly with PLZF, and enhanced its function as a transcriptional and cell growth suppressor. Notably, PLZF activity was additionally promoted by the Go/ialpha-coupled cannabinoid receptor (CB) in HL60 cells endogenously expressing CB and PLZF. These results collectively suggest that Goalpha modulates the function of PLZF via direct interactions. Our novel findings provide insights into the diverse cellular roles of Goalpha and its coupled receptor.","['Won, Jung Hee', 'Park, Jung Sik', 'Ju, Hyun Hee', 'Kim, Soyeon', 'Suh-Kim, Haeyoung', 'Ghil, Sung Ho']","['Won JH', 'Park JS', 'Ju HH', 'Kim S', 'Suh-Kim H', 'Ghil SH']","['Department of Life Science, Kyonggi University, Suwon 443-760, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080112,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2008/02/12 09:00,2008/05/24 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2007/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(08)00005-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2007.12.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2008 May;20(5):884-91. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2007.12.022.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A PubMed search of English-language articles dealing with RIMG was performed, yielding 52 articles with 92 patients available for review. RESULTS: Initial tumor types treated with RT included brain tumor in 37 patients (40%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 33 (36%), benign disease in 11 (12%), and other in 11 (12%). Median time from RT to development of an RIMG was 8.75 years (range, 2.5-61 years). The RIMG occurred within 10 years after RT in 81% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, 59% of patients with brain/other, and 18% of patients with benign conditions (p = 0.002). Type of RIMG was glioblastoma in 69 (75%) and anaplastic astrocytoma in 23 (25%). One-, 2-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 29.3%, 7.3%, and 0% for patients with glioblastoma and 59.7%, 30.3%, and 20.2% for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. For the 85 patients with data regarding treatment for RIMG, 35 underwent reirradiation to a median dose of 50 Gy (range, 30-76 Gy). For patients undergoing reirradiation, 1-, 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 58.9%, 20.5%, and 6.8%. For those not undergoing reirradiation, they were 15.1%, 3%, and 0% (p = 0.0009). CONCLUSIONS: The RIMG appeared earlier in patients treated for leukemia and lymphoma and latest for those treated for a benign condition. Patients who underwent reirradiation for RIMG have longer survival times compared with those not receiving RT.","['Paulino, Arnold C', 'Mai, Wei Y', 'Chintagumpala, Murali', 'Taher, Abida', 'Teh, Bin S']","['Paulino AC', 'Mai WY', 'Chintagumpala M', 'Taher A', 'Teh BS']","['Department of Radiology, Division of Radiation Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, 6565 Fannin Street, Houston, TX 77030, USA. apaulino@tmh.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080211,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Astrocytoma/radiotherapy', 'Brain Neoplasms/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Glioblastoma/radiotherapy', 'Glioma/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*radiotherapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Retreatment', 'Survival Rate']",2008/02/12 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2007/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(07)04754-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.12.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Aug 1;71(5):1381-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.12.018.

In this work we studied response of T-lymphocyte leukemia cells MOLT-4 to ionizing radiation. We detected IRIF (ionizing radiation forming foci) containing histone gammaH2A.X, protein 53BP1, and Nbs1, which were formed around double-strand breaks of DNA. We found dose-dependent increase in foci number (colocalization of gammaH2A.X and 53BP1) and gammaH2A.X amount (integral optical density) 1h after irradiation. After the dose of 1.5 Gy the number of foci decreases with time, but 72 h after irradiation 9% of live cells still contained big foci around unrepaired DNA damage. Western blot method revealed massive phosphorylation of H2A.X during apoptosis induction, 6-24 h after irradiation by the doses 1.5 and 3 Gy. Cells with apoptotic morphology showed strong phosphorylation of H2A.X, but it was not accompanied by 53BP1. 1h after irradiation by the lethal doses 5 and 10 Gy we detected by Western blot a decrease in repair proteins Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1. While phosphorylation of H2A.X 1h after irradiation was detected by both confocal microscopy and Western blot, phosphorylation of Nbs1 on serine 343 was not detectable in MOLT-4 cells. Despite functional ATM and p53 the phosphorylation of Nbs1 on serine 343 was impaired in these cells, and might be responsible for high radiosensitivity of MOLT-4 cells.","['Rezacova, Martina', 'Tichy, Ales', 'Vavrova, Jirina', 'Vokurkova, Doris', 'Lukasova, Emilie']","['Rezacova M', 'Tichy A', 'Vavrova J', 'Vokurkova D', 'Lukasova E']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. rezacovam@lfhk.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080211,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Radiation Tolerance']",2008/02/12 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2007/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00500-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.12.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Aug;32(8):1259-67. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.12.014.

Op18 regulates tubulin monomer-polymer partitioning of the interphase microtubule system and forms complexes with tubulin heterodimers. Recent reports have shown that specific tubulin-folding cofactors and related proteins may disrupt tubulin heterodimers. We therefore investigated whether Op18 protects unpolymerized tubulin from such disruptive activities. Our approach was based on inducible overexpression of two tubulin-disrupting proteins, namely TBCE, which is required for tubulin biogenesis, and E-like, which has been proposed to regulate tubulin turnover and microtubule stability. Expression of either of these proteins was found to cause a rapid degradation of both alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin subunits of unpolymerized, but not polymeric, tubulin heterodimers. We found that depletion of Op18 by means of RNA interference increased the susceptibility of tubulin to TBCE or E-like mediated disruption, while overexpressed Op18 exerted a tubulin-protective effect. Tubulin protection was shown to depend on Op18 levels, binding affinity, and the partitioning between tubulin monomers and polymers. Hence, the present study reveals that Op18 at physiologically relevant levels functions to preserve the integrity of tubulin heterodimers, which may serve to regulate tubulin turnover rates.","['Sellin, Mikael E', 'Holmfeldt, Per', 'Stenmark, Sonja', 'Gullberg, Martin']","['Sellin ME', 'Holmfeldt P', 'Stenmark S', 'Gullberg M']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.

In addition to providing an accurate description of the karyotype, this complementary approach highlighted the relative merits of the individual techniques. Conventional cytogenetics and M-FISH indicated the location and types of the major chromosomal changes, whether balanced or unbalanced, and at the same time demonstrated the level of karyotypic evolution between cells. The aCGH profiles reflected the unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities detected by cytogenetics, providing refinement of their genomic breakpoint locations as well as the identification of novel genomic changes. Three aCGH platforms, comprising bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) or oligonucleotide templates, were available for evaluation. Sixteen CNAs were consistently detected by all three platforms. Novel submicroscopic CNAs ( approximately 0.4 Mb) were detected by the highest resolution platform only, whereas the clones from the BAC arrays provided locus-specific FISH probes for confirmation of CNA.","['Parker, Helen', 'Cheung, Kan L', 'Robinson, Hazel M', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Strefford, Jon C']","['Parker H', 'Cheung KL', 'Robinson HM', 'Harrison CJ', 'Strefford JC']","['Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton, MP822 Duthie Building, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Prognosis']",2008/02/12 09:00,2008/04/30 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2007/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(07)00699-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2007.10.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2008 Feb;181(1):40-5. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2007.10.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The success of this regimen is based mainly on natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antileukemia effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively investigated NK-cell (CD56(+)/CD3(-)) reconstitution, including expression of antileukemia effector molecules in patients undergoing HASCT. RESULTS: Although absolute NK-cell numbers rapidly increased, their phenotype notably differed compared to healthy controls. In fact, the ""effector"" CD56(dim) subset was significantly reduced, as was the NKG2D expression on ""regulatory"" CD56(bright) cells. Perforin was completely absent on NK cells in one-third of patients. The expression of Fas-ligand (Fas-L) on NK cells as well as soluble Fas-L and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) plasma levels were also significantly lower after HASCT. In contrast, expression of TRAIL on CD56(dim) cells and interleukin-15 plasma levels were upregulated. Because the death rate due to relapse or infectious complications was high in the initial phase of the trial, subsequent patients received an adoptive infusion of donor NK cells followed by interleukin-2 in vivo in order to augment NK-cell function.

Granulocyte/granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have become widely accepted alternatives to BM transplantation. T cells coexpressing natural killer cell proteins (NKT) include a CD1d-reactive subset that influences immunity by rapidly producing large amounts of Th1 and/or Th2 cytokines dependent upon microenvironment and disease. There are two types of CD1d-reactive NKT. iNKT express a semi-invariant T-cell receptor-alpha. Other noninvariant CD1d-reactive NKT from BM and liver produce large amounts of interleukin-4 or interferon-gamma, respectively, and within the intestine can be biased in either direction. Recent data suggests that NKT might contribute to clinical benefits of PBPC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address these issues, we phenotypically and functionally studied PBPC NKT. RESULTS: Similarly to BM, NKT-like cells were common in allogeneic and autologous PBPC, there were relatively few classical iNKT, but high CD1d-reactivity concentrated in NKT fractions. Significantly, PBPC CD1d-reactive cells were relatively Th1-biased and their presence was associated with better prognosis. Granulocyte CSF treatment of BM to yield PBPC in vivo as well as in vitro Th2-polarizes conventional T cells and iNKT. However, granulocyte CSF treatment of BM in vitro produced Th1-biased NKT, providing a mechanism for opposite polarization of NKT from BM vs PBPC. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest distinct Th1 CD1d-reactive NKT cells could stimulate anti-tumor responses from those previously described, which can suppress graft-vs-host disease.","['Shaulov, Angela', 'Yue, Simon', 'Wang, Ruojie', 'Joyce, Robin M', 'Balk, Steven P', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Avigan, David E', 'Uhl, Lynne', 'Sackstein, Robert', 'Exley, Mark A']","['Shaulov A', 'Yue S', 'Wang R', 'Joyce RM', 'Balk SP', 'Kim HT', 'Avigan DE', 'Uhl L', 'Sackstein R', 'Exley MA']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Mass. 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080208,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (CD1D protein, human)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD1/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD1d', 'Cell Separation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Th1 Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/12 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2006/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00707-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.12.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Apr;36(4):464-72. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.12.010.

This study aimed at the development of a more reliable approach, allowing generation and expansion of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-reactive CTLs using primary in vitro stimulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established allogeneic mini-mixed lymphocyte-leukemia cultures (mini-MLLCs) by stimulating donor CD8(+) T cells with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-matched AML blasts in microtiter plates. Before culture, CD8(+) T cells were separated into CD62L((high)+) and CD62L((low)+/neg) subsets enriched for naive/central memory and effector memory cells, respectively. RESULTS: In eight different related and unrelated donor/AML pairs, numerous CTL populations were isolated that specifically lysed myeloid leukemias in association with various HLA-A, -B, or -C alleles. These CTLs expressed T-cell receptors of single Vbeta-chain families, indicating their clonal origin. The majority of CTL clones were obtained from mini-MLLCs initiated with CD62L((high)+) cells. Using antigen-specific stimulation, multiple CTL populations were amplified to 10(8)-10(10) cells within 6 to 8 weeks. Three of four representative CTL clones were capable of completely preventing engraftment of human primary AML blasts in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune deficient IL2Rgamma(null) mice. CONCLUSION: The mini-MLLC approach allows the efficient in vitro expansion of AML-reactive CTL clones from CD8(+)CD62L((high)+) precursors of healthy donors. These CTLs can inhibit leukemia engraftment in immunodeficient mice, suggesting their potential biological relevance.","['Distler, Eva', 'Wolfel, Catherine', 'Kohler, Sylvia', 'Nonn, Marion', 'Kaus, Nina', 'Schnurer, Elke', 'Meyer, Ralf G', 'Wehler, Thomas C', 'Huber, Christoph', 'Wolfel, Thomas', 'Hartwig, Udo F', 'Herr, Wolfgang']","['Distler E', 'Wolfel C', 'Kohler S', 'Nonn M', 'Kaus N', 'Schnurer E', 'Meyer RG', 'Wehler TC', 'Huber C', 'Wolfel T', 'Hartwig UF', 'Herr W']","['Department of Medicine III-Hematology and Oncology, Johannes Gutenberg-University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080208,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/*genetics', 'L-Selectin/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Reference Standards', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/immunology/*transplantation']",2008/02/12 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00708-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.12.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Apr;36(4):451-63. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.12.011.

The RNase H domains of HIV-1 and MoMLV are structurally very similar, with functions assigned to conserved subregions like the RNase H primer grip and the connection subdomain, as well as to distinct features like the C-helix and loop in MoMLV RNase H. Like cellular RNases H, catalysis by the retroviral enzymes appears to involve a two-metal ion mechanism. Unlike cellular RNases H, the retroviral RNases H display three different modes of cleavage: internal, DNA 3' end-directed, and RNA 5' end-directed. All three modes of cleavage appear to have roles in reverse transcription. Nucleotide sequence is an important determinant of cleavage specificity with both enzymes exhibiting a preference for specific nucleotides at discrete positions flanking an internal cleavage site as well as during tRNA primer removal and plus-strand primer generation. RNA 5' end-directed and DNA 3' end-directed cleavages show similar sequence preferences at the positions closest to a cleavage site. A model for how RNase H selects cleavage sites is presented that incorporates both sequence preferences and the concept of a defined window for allowable cleavage from a recessed end. Finally, the RNase H activity of HIV-1 is considered as a target for anti-virals as well as a participant in drug resistance.","['Schultz, Sharon J', 'Champoux, James J']","['Schultz SJ', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Box 357242, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20080207,Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'HIV Infections/drug therapy/enzymology', 'HIV-1/*chemistry/drug effects/*enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/drug effects/*enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Reverse Transcription/drug effects', 'Ribonuclease H/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",2008/02/12 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2007/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-1702(07)00460-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virusres.2007.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2008 Jun;134(1-2):86-103. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2007.12.007.

However, for PCR assays detecting all bacterial groups, broad range primers, in particular the 16S rDNA targeting primers have to be used. Upcoming false signals and reduced sensitivity are a common problem as a consequence of unspecific amplification reactions with the human DNA background. Here we show that, using total DNA extracts from blood, unspecific signals occurred in general 16S rDNA PCRs as a result of the amplification of human sequences. To address this problem, we developed a protocol by which the human background DNA is removed and bacterial DNA is enriched during sample preparation, a method we termed background-free enrichment method (BFEM). In general, we aimed to exclude false signals due to the human background DNA yielded from 16S rDNA PCR, Real-Time-PCR and IGS-PCR analyses. We applied the BFEM to the analysis of blood samples from 22 patients and obtained results similar to standard blood culture methods. The BFEM allows specific and sensitive detection of pathogens in downstream PCR assays and is easy to handle due to the quick sample preparation procedure. Thus, the BFEM contributes to the generation of replicable and more reliable data in general 16S rDNA PCR assays.","['Handschur, Michael', 'Karlic, Heidrun', 'Hertel, Christian', 'Pfeilstocker, Michael', 'Haslberger, Alexander G']","['Handschur M', 'Karlic H', 'Hertel C', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Haslberger AG']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research and Hematology, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080207,England,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",7808924,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)']",IM,"['Bacteria/*isolation & purification', 'DNA, Bacterial/*blood', 'DNA, Ribosomal/*blood', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/*diagnosis/microbiology']",2008/02/12 09:00,2009/04/28 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2007/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0147-9571(07)00111-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cimid.2007.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis. 2009 May;32(3):207-19. doi: 10.1016/j.cimid.2007.10.005.

T cell depletion decreases transplant-related toxicity related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but does not improve overall survival because of increased risk for relapse and graft failure. Myeloid growth factors have been used to speed engraftment following alloBMT, but data suggest that they may also have anti-tumor properties. We treated 43 patients (median age 56) with MDS/AML with high-risk features using a myeloablative T cell depleted alloBMT followed by prolonged systemic GM-CSF. The current event-free survival at 1 and 3 years was 47% and 34%, respectively with a median follow-up of 22.8 months in surviving patients.

METHODS: Mononuclear cells in bone marrow samples were collected from 86 adult patients with newly diagnosed AML. FLT3 and NPM1 genes were amplified with genomic DNA-PCR. NPM1 exon-12 mutations were evaluated with capillary electrophoresis and FLT3-ITD mutations were determined with agarose electrophoresis. RESULTS: NPM1 gene mutations were identified in 29 of the 86 (33.7%) patients and FLT3-ITD in 15 of the 86 (17.4%) patients. In AML patients with normal karyotype, the frequencies of the two abnormalities were significantly higher than in those without (46.0% and 24.0%, P < 0.05). Both mutations were related to high peripheral white blood cell counts (P < 0.05). WBC counts in the six of the seven cases with NPM1+/FLT3-ITD+ AML were significantly higher (>50 x 10(9)/L). Compared with NPM1(-)AML patients, NPM1(+)AML patients were associated with lower expression of CD(34) (P < 0.001), higher complete remission (CR) rate after initial therapy (66.7% vs 53.3%, P > 0.05) and better overall survival (OS) (P > 0.05), but compared with FLT3-ITD(-)AML patients, FLT3-ITD+ AML patients were associated with lower CR rate (50.0% vs 58.8%; P > 0.05) and worse OS (P > 0.05). The CR rates were 66.7%, 62.5%, 50.0% and 42.9%, respectively, in NPM1+/FLT3-ITD(-), NPM1(-)/FLT3-ITD(-), NPM1+/FLT3-ITD+ and NPM1(-)/FLT3-ITD+AML groups (P > 0.05), but there was no significant differences in OS for four groups. CONCLUSIONS: NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations are common in AML patients with normal karyotype and related with the clinical characteristics and prognosis of AML.","['Wu, De-pei', 'Yan, Ling-zhi', 'Yang, Li', 'Chen, Su-ning', 'Wu, Xiao-jin', 'Liang, Jian-ying']","['Wu DP', 'Yan LZ', 'Yang L', 'Chen SN', 'Wu XJ', 'Liang JY']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, China. wudepei@medmail.com.cn']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2008/02/12 09:00,2008/08/19 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2007 Nov;46(11):907-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Of the 90 refractory/relapsed AL patients, 56 were male and 34 female, with a median age of 37 (13 - 59) years. Among them, 73 patients suffered from AL including 11 Ph+ acute lymphoid leukemia in first complete remission, 23 in second or greater complete remission, 39 in non-remission or relapse and 17 patients suffered from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-RAEB or RAEB-T) before transplant. Allo-HSCT from HLA identical siblings was performed for all the patients, of whom 27 received bone marrow transplantation (BMT), 30 peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) and 33 BMT + PBSCT. Eleven patients underwent allo-HSCT with conditioning regimen of CY/TBI and 79 with BU/CY. CsA + MTX regimen was use for prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The average follow-up was 15 months. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, 56/90 (62.2%) survived, 50/90 (55.5%) survived without leukemia and 28/90 (31.1%) relapsed. The estimated 4-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of the 90 cases was 45.5% and 34.9%. The 4-year OS and DFS were significantly higher for patients in CR (54.0%) or MDS (70.1%) than in non-remission and relapsed (28.2%) patients before allo-HSCT (P = 0.027). The outcome of grade 0-I acute GVHD was better than that of II-IV GVHD (57.6% vs 26.7%, P = 0.015). Sex, age, central nervous system leukemia, conditioning regimen and the source of stem cell were not the factors affecting OS, DFS, cumulative incidences of relapse rate and treatment related mortality. Multivariate analysis showed the most significant factor associated with high DFS was the disease state.

Complementary and alternative medicines are considered to be promising avenues for the development of such new therapies. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of many Korean plants on the IgE-mediated allergic response in mast cells and in vivo, and its mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-allergic activity was tested by evaluating effects on degranulation of mast cells in culture and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in vivo. Its mechanism of action was investigated by immunoblotting analysis, immunoprecipitation, RT-PCR, and other molecular biological approaches in mast cells. RESULTS: We screened approximately 100 natural plant extracts collected in Korea for in vitro anti-allergic activity. The leaf extract of Camellia japonica (LECJ) exhibited the most potent effect on degranulation in antigen-stimulated rodent and human mast cells. LECJ reversibly inhibited degranulation in a dose-dependent manner, with IC(50) values of approximately 50 microg/mL for the mast cells, and it also suppressed the expression and secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-4 in rat basophilic leukaemia-2H3 mast cells. In agreement with its in vitro activity, LECJ significantly inhibited mast cell-mediated PCA in an animal model. LECJ inhibited activating phosphorylation of tyrosine Y371 on Syk kinase, indicating that LECJ inhibits the activity of Src-family kinases in mast cells. In the in vitro kinase assay, LECJ directly inhibited Lyn kinase, the major Src-family kinase in the cells. It also suppressed Akt and MAP kinases, which are critical for the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines in mast cells. In high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, quercetin-3-beta-D-glucoside and eugenol were identified as the major active components. CONCLUSION: The present results strongly suggest that the anti-allergic activity of LECJ is mediated through inhibiting degranulation and allergic cytokine secretion by inhibition of Src-family kinase in mast cells and it may be useful for the treatment of mast cell-related immediate and delayed allergic diseases.","['Lee, J-H', 'Kim, J-W', 'Ko, N-Y', 'Mun, S-H', 'Kim, D-K', 'Kim, J-D', 'Kim, H-S', 'Lee, K-R', 'Kim, Y-K', 'Radinger, M', 'Her, E', 'Choi, W-S']","['Lee JH', 'Kim JW', 'Ko NY', 'Mun SH', 'Kim DK', 'Kim JD', 'Kim HS', 'Lee KR', 'Kim YK', 'Radinger M', 'Her E', 'Choi WS']","['Department of Immunology and Physiology, College of Medicine, Konkuk University, Chungju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080202,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils', 'Camellia/*chemistry', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed/drug therapy', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/drug therapy', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Korea', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/*chemistry', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Syk Kinase', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/02/12 09:00,2008/06/21 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEA2936 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2222.2008.02936.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2008 May;38(5):794-804. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2008.02936.x.

However, the molecular mechanisms underling these interactions are not well understood. In order to study these mechanisms, we have analysed the interactions of HIV-1 IN with HIV-1 RT and with two other related RTs: those of HIV-2 and MLV (murine-leukaemia virus). All three RTs inhibited HIV-1 IN, albeit to a different extent, suggesting a common site of binding that could be slightly modified for each one of the studied RTs. Using surface plasmon resonance technology, which monitors direct protein-protein interactions, we performed kinetic analyses of the binding of HIV-1 IN to these three RTs and observed interesting binding patterns. The interaction of HIV-1 RT with HIV-1 IN was unique and followed a two-state reaction model. According to this model, the initial IN-RT complex formation was followed by a conformational change in the complex that led to an elevation of the total affinity between these two proteins. In contrast, HIV-2 and MLV RTs interacted with IN in a simple bi-molecular manner, without any apparent secondary conformational changes. Interestingly, HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs were the most efficient inhibitors of HIV-1 IN activity, whereas HIV-1 and MLV RTs showed the highest affinity towards HIV-1 IN. These modes of direct protein interactions, along with the apparent rate constants calculated and the correlations of the interaction kinetics with the capacity of the RTs to inhibit IN activities, are all discussed.","['Herschhorn, Alon', 'Oz-Gleenberg, Iris', 'Hizi, Amnon']","['Herschhorn A', 'Oz-Gleenberg I', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Enzymes, Immobilized)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (HIV Integrase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'YY6481J2FF (p31 integrase protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",IM,"['DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'Enzymes, Immobilized/metabolism', 'HIV Integrase/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/genetics/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",2008/02/12 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2008/02/12 09:00'],"['2008/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20071279 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20071279 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2008 May 15;412(1):163-70. doi: 10.1042/BJ20071279.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because early diagnosis of IFI is difficult, new noninvasive, culture-independent diagnostic tools are needed to improve clinical management. Recent studies have reported that detection of 1,3-beta-D-glucan (BG) antigenemia may be useful for diagnosis of IFI. The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the usefulness of monitoring BG in patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia. METHODS: BG antigenemia was measured by a colorimetric assay twice weekly in the absence of fever and daily in the presence of fever. IFIs were classified according to the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group. RESULTS: During 190 consecutive neutropenic episodes (median duration, 22 days; range, 7-113 days) in 95 patients, 30 proven or probable IFIs (13 aspergillosis, 15 candidiasis, and 2 mixed IFIs) were diagnosed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and efficiency of 2 consecutive BG values > or =7 pg/mL for diagnosis of proven or probable IFI was 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.79), 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.89-0.98), 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.92), 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.95), and 0.89, respectively. The time interval between onset of fever as first sign of IFI and BG antigenemia was significantly shorter than the time to diagnosis of IFI by clinical, microbiological, radiological, and/or histopathological criteria (P < .001).

These methods often lack the specificity and sensitivity necessary for early, accurate diagnosis. Here we demonstrate using clinical samples the application of laser trapping Raman spectroscopy as a novel approach that provides intrinsic biochemical markers for the noninvasive detection of individual cancer cells. The Raman spectra of live, hematopoietic cells provide reliable molecular fingerprints that reflect their biochemical composition and biology. Populations of normal T and B lymphocytes from four healthy individuals and cells from three leukemia patients were analyzed, and multiple intrinsic Raman markers associated with DNA and protein vibrational modes have been identified that exhibit excellent discriminating power for cancer cell identification. A combination of two multivariate statistical methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), was used to confirm the significance of these markers for identifying cancer cells and classifying the data. The results indicate that, on average, 95% of the normal cells and 90% of the patient cells were accurately classified into their respective cell types. We also provide evidence that these markers are unique to cancer cells and not purely a function of differences in their cellular activation.","['Chan, James W', 'Taylor, Douglas S', 'Lane, Stephen M', 'Zwerdling, Theodore', 'Tuscano, Joseph', 'Huser, Thomas']","['Chan JW', 'Taylor DS', 'Lane SM', 'Zwerdling T', 'Tuscano J', 'Huser T']","['Applied Physics and Biophysics Division, Physical Sciences Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, P.O.

The activity of SCH 717454 was evaluated against the in vitro and in vivo panels of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP). PROCEDURES: SCH 717454 was tested against the PPTP in vitro panel at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 nM and was tested against the PPTP in vivo panel at a dose of 0.5 mg per mouse administered twice weekly for 4 weeks via intraperitoneal injection. RESULTS: SCH 717454 was ineffective at retarding growth of cell lines in the in vitro panel. In vivo, SCH 717454 significantly increased event-free survival in 20 of 35 (57%) solid tumor xenograft models with tumor regressions in one Ewing sarcoma model (complete response) and 2 osteosarcoma models (maintained complete responses). Using the time to event activity measure, SCH 717454 had intermediate (n = 9) or high (n = 1) activity against 31 evaluable solid tumor xenografts, including xenografts from the rhabdoid tumor, Ewing, rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and osteosarcoma panels. SCH 717454 showed little activity against the 8 xenografts of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia panel. CONCLUSIONS: SCH 717454 demonstrated broad antitumor activity against the PPTP's in vivo solid tumor panels. Further characterization of the molecular predictors of response and of the activity of combinations of SCH 717454 with other anticancer agents are anticipated.","['Kolb, E Anders', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Lock, Richard', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Maris, John M', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Kolb EA', 'Gorlick R', 'Houghton PJ', 'Morton CL', 'Lock R', 'Carol H', 'Reynolds CP', 'Maris JM', 'Keir ST', 'Billups CA', 'Smith MA']","[""Albert Einstein College of Medicine, The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, New York, USA. eakolb@nemours.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'V983921H3B (robatumumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*immunology', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/02/09 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2008/02/09 09:00'],"['2008/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21450 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jun;50(6):1190-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21450.,,,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

After Western blotting, different cell death associated proteins displayed differential activation in the two regions observed. In hippocampus, activated caspase-3 and caspase-7 resulted in subsequent cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Cytochrome c release to cytosol and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) translocation to nucleus was marginal. B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) translocation to cytosol was significant whereas Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-associated death protein (Bad) were largely located in cytosol. Further, upregulation of N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (NMDAR1), N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NMDAR2B), N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subunit 2C (NMDAR2C) and activation of calpains were observed. In frontal cortex, caspase-3 activation, cleavage of PARP-1 and nuclear translocation of AIF were more pronounced. Moreover, cytochrome c release to cytosol, Bcl-2 translocation to cytosol was evident. However, levels of Bax, Bad, NMDA receptor subunits, and calpains were unaffected. Apoptosis was further substantiated by in situ staining for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). Results of the current study revealed that frontal cortex exhibits a higher level of ethanol-induced apoptosis relative to hippocampus.

We previously defined the commonly deleted region in del(9q) AML and characterized the genes in this interval. To determine the critical lost gene(s) that might cooperate with the AML1-ETO fusion gene produced by t(8;21), we developed a set of shRNAs directed against each gene in this region. Within this library, shRNAs to TLE1 and TLE4 were the only shRNAs capable of rescuing AML1-ETO expressing U937T-A/E cells from AML1-ETO-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Knockdown of TLE1 or TLE4 levels increased the rate of cell division of the AML1-ETO-expressing Kasumi-1 cell line, whereas forced expression of either TLE1 or TLE4 caused apoptosis and cell death. Knockdown of Gro3, a TLE homolog in zebrafish, cooperated with AML1-ETO to cause an accumulation of noncirculating hematopoietic blast cells. Our data are consistent with a model in which haploinsufficiency of these TLEs overcomes the negative survival and antiproliferative effects of AML1-ETO on myeloid progenitors, allowing preleukemic stem cells to expand into AML.

The toxicity studies revealed that SQgem nanoassemblies, like gemcitabine, were toxic, and they led to dose-dependent mortality after daily i.v. injections for 1 week, irrespective of the route of administration. However, a 4- to 5-day spaced dosing schedule (injections on day 0, 4, 8, and 13) was proved to be safer in terms of weight loss and hematological and other toxicity. Using this spaced dosing schedule, SQgem nanoassemblies exhibited impressive anticancer activity in mice bearing L1210 leukemia because this treatment led to 75% long-term survivors. In contrast, at equitoxic doses, neither free gemcitabine nor cytarabine led to longterm survivors and all the mice of these groups died of the disease. Further toxicity studies performed at lethal doses by blood and serum analysis and organ weight determinations revealed that the hematological toxicity was the dose-limiting toxicity in both SQgem nanoassemblies and gemcitabine, whereas probable gastrointestinal toxicity was also associated with free gemcitabine. The SQgem nanoassemblies did not display hepatotoxicity, which is one of the clinically encountered toxicities of gemcitabine. To summarize, these preclinical studies demonstrated that the toxicological profile of new squalenoyl gemcitabine nanomedicine was not distinct from that of the parent gemcitabine, whereas it was much more potent than gemcitabine at equitoxic doses and cytarabine at clinically relevant doses. These data support the candidature of SQgem for clinical trials.","['Reddy, L Harivardhan', 'Marque, Pierre-Emmanuel', 'Dubernet, Catherine', 'Mouelhi, Sinda-Lepetre', 'Desmaele, Didier', 'Couvreur, Patrick']","['Reddy LH', 'Marque PE', 'Dubernet C', 'Mouelhi SL', 'Desmaele D', 'Couvreur P']","['Universite Paris-Sud XI, Faculte de Pharmacie, Unite Mixte de Recherche Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 8612, Institut Federatif de Recherche 141, 92296 Chatenay-Malabry Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080207,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '7QWM220FJH (Squalene)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nanomedicine', 'Nanostructures/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Squalene/*chemistry/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/09 09:00,2008/05/20 09:00,['2008/02/09 09:00'],"['2008/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.107.133751 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.107.133751 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2008 May;325(2):484-90. doi: 10.1124/jpet.107.133751.

However, the function of STAT3 in glioblastoma pathogenesis has remained unknown. Here, we report that STAT3 plays a pro-oncogenic or tumor-suppressive role depending on the mutational profile of the tumor. Deficiency of the tumor suppressor PTEN triggers a cascade that inhibits STAT3 signaling in murine astrocytes and human glioblastoma tumors. Specifically, we forge a direct link between the PTEN-Akt-FOXO axis and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor beta (LIFRbeta)-STAT3 signaling pathway. Accordingly, PTEN knockdown induces efficient malignant transformation of astrocytes upon knockout of the STAT3 gene. Remarkably, in contrast to the tumor-suppressive function of STAT3 in the PTEN pathway, STAT3 forms a complex with the oncoprotein epidermal growth factor receptor type III variant (EGFRvIII) in the nucleus and thereby mediates EGFRvIII-induced glial transformation. These findings indicate that STAT3 plays opposing roles in glial transformation depending on the genetic background of the tumor, providing the rationale for tailored therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma.","['de la Iglesia, Nuria', 'Konopka, Genevieve', 'Puram, Sidharth V', 'Chan, Jennifer A', 'Bachoo, Robert M', 'You, Mingjian J', 'Levy, David E', 'Depinho, Ronald A', 'Bonni, Azad']","['de la Iglesia N', 'Konopka G', 'Puram SV', 'Chan JA', 'Bachoo RM', 'You MJ', 'Levy DE', 'Depinho RA', 'Bonni A']","['Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080207,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (FoxO3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (epidermal growth factor receptor VIII)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Drug Combinations', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Glioblastoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/02/09 09:00,2008/04/12 09:00,['2008/02/09 09:00'],"['2008/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['gad.1606508 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.1606508 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2008 Feb 15;22(4):449-62. doi: 10.1101/gad.1606508.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 673 patients were included in two consecutive trials, SHOP-89 (1989-1993) and SHOP- 94 (1994-1998). Approximately 67% of the children diagnosed with ALL in Spain during this period were enrolled in these trials. The 250 eligible patients enrolled in the SHOP- 89 study were stratified to either a standard or a high-risk group. Therapy schedule was based on the central nervous system (CNS) therapy designed by St Jude CRH and the Children's Cancer Group, and the post-induction intensification developed by the BFM group. In the SHOP-94 study, a further high-risk group was included in the stratification of the 423 enrolled patients. The therapeutic protocol was characterised by intensification of systemic chemotherapy and the administration of cranial radiotherapy only to patients at high risk of relapse or with CNS involvement at diagnosis. RESULTS: Event-free survival (EFS) increased from 0.57+/- 0.03 at 15 years in SHOP-89, to 0.68+/-0.03 at 11 years in SHOP-94 (p=0.01). Relapse rate decreased from SHOP-89 to SHOP-94: 0.38 vs. 0.25 (p=0.01). CNS relapse rate was 9.1% in SHOP-89 and 4.6% in SHOP-94 (p=0.001). EFS in patients with T-immunophenotype was 0.40+/-0.08 in SHOP-89 and 0.44+/-0.06 in SHOP-94 (p=ns).

Liposomes containing lipophilic derivatives of folate have been shown to effectively target FR-expressing cells. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel lipophilic folate derivative, folate-polyethylene glycol-cholesterol hemisuccinate (F-PEG-CHEMS), and its evaluation as a targeting ligand for liposomal doxorubicin (L-DOX) in FR-expressing cells. Liposomes containing F-PEG-CHEMS, with a mean diameter of 120+/-20 nm, were synthesized by polycarbonate membrane extrusion and were shown to have excellent colloidal stability. The liposomes were taken up selectively by KB cells, which overexpress FR-alpha. Compared to folate-PEG-cholesterol (F-PEG-Chol), which contains a carbamate linkage, F-PEG-CHEMS better retained its FR-targeting activity during prolonged storage. In addition, F-PEG-CHEMS containing liposomes loaded with DOX (F-L-DOX) showed greater cytotoxicity (IC(50)=10.0muM) than non-targeted control L-DOX (IC(50)=57.5 microM) in KB cells. In ICR mice, both targeted and non-targeted liposomes exhibited long circulation properties, although F-L-DOX (t(1/2)=12.34 h) showed more rapid plasma clearance than L-DOX (t(1/2)=17.10h). These results suggest that F-PEG-CHEMS is effective as a novel ligand for the synthesis of FR-targeted liposomes.","['Xiang, Guangya', 'Wu, Jun', 'Lu, Yanhui', 'Liu, Zhilan', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Xiang G', 'Wu J', 'Lu Y', 'Liu Z', 'Lee RJ']","['Pharmacy School, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. gyxiang1968@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071228,Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'T3J4KS4201 (cholesteryl succinate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol/chemistry', 'Cholesterol Esters/chemistry', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/*chemistry', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'KB Cells', 'Ligands', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Particle Size', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism']",2008/02/09 09:00,2008/08/19 09:00,['2008/02/09 09:00'],"['2007/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-5173(07)01073-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.12.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2008 May 22;356(1-2):29-36. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.12.030.

Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive, nerve growth factor (NGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are considered key mediators. Their local availability or synthesis are altered by nerve damage and, in turn, they entail changes in phenotype of affected neurons. We examined the effects of LIF on capsaicin sensitivity, heat responsiveness, and galanin immunoreactivity in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons cultured for up to 6 days without supplemented NGF. Using double labeling, the proportions of heat-sensitive/galanin-immunoreactive (GAL-IR) and capsaicin-sensitive/GAL-IR neurons were compared over time in culture with galanin immunoreactivity being a marker for nociceptive neurons. The time course of the proportions of neurons responding to heat (44 degrees C) or capsaicin (1 microM) which also were GAL-IR was differently affected by LIF. In the absence of LIF, within the population of heat-sensitive neurons, the proportion of neurons also GAL-IR increased from 17% to 32% between 6h and 1 day in culture to stay at this level. For the capsaicin-sensitive neurons, the proportion of neurons also GAL-IR increased from 10% after 6h to 18% at day 2 and then decreased to 4% at day 4. In contrast, LIF prevented the increase in the proportion of heat-sensitive/GAL-IR neurons and the decrease of capsaicin-sensitive/GAL-IR neurons. The results suggest that LIF partially prevents TRPV-1 downregulation in NGF-deprived nociceptive galaninergic DRG neurons. Furthermore, there is evidence that LIF regulates the expression of a heat receptor distinct from TRPV-1.","['Engert, Sabine', 'Wendland, Jens R', 'Schwab, Albrecht', 'Petersen, Marlen']","['Engert S', 'Wendland JR', 'Schwab A', 'Petersen M']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Wurzburg, 97080 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080206,Netherlands,Neuropeptides,Neuropeptides,8103156,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Sensory System Agents)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (Trpv1 protein, rat)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capsaicin/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Galanin/metabolism', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*cytology', '*Hot Temperature', 'Hyperalgesia/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Nerve Growth Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Neurons, Afferent/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sensory System Agents/*pharmacology', 'TRPV Cation Channels/metabolism']",2008/02/09 09:00,2008/06/10 09:00,['2008/02/09 09:00'],"['2007/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0143-4179(08)00004-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.npep.2007.12.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuropeptides. 2008 Apr;42(2):193-7. doi: 10.1016/j.npep.2007.12.005.

Fallopian tubes were evaluated from specimens taken during tubal ligation in normal pregnancies and non-pregnant fertile women or at operation for tubal surgery in ectopic pregnancies. Biopsies were assayed by immunohistochemistry. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemical reaction scores (IRS) were used for immunohistochemical analyses. Immunolabeling of LIF was detected in the surface epithelium and stroma of fallopian tubes in all subjects. IRS score in the epithelium and stroma of non-pregnant women and women with intrauterine pregnancy were similar (p>0.05). However, women with ectopic pregnancy had significantly increased labeling of LIF compared to others (p<0.05). Immunohistochemical labeling of LIF in the fallopian tube was found to be increased in ectopic pregnancies compared to non-pregnant and healthy pregnant controls.

Not associated with FeLV outcome were the genetic heritage of the panthers (pure Florida vs. Texas/Florida crosses) and co-infection with feline immunodeficiency virus. Genetic analysis of panther FeLV, designated FeLV-Pco, determined that the outbreak likely came from 1 cross-species transmission from a domestic cat. The FeLV-Pco virus was closely related to the domestic cat exogenous FeLV-A subgroup in lacking recombinant segments derived from endogenous FeLV. FeLV-Pco sequences were most similar to the well-characterized FeLV-945 strain, which is highly virulent and strongly pathogenic in domestic cats because of unique long terminal repeat and envelope sequences. These unique features may also account for the severity of the outbreak after cross-species transmission to the panther.","['Brown, Meredith A', 'Cunningham, Mark W', 'Roca, Alfred L', 'Troyer, Jennifer L', 'Johnson, Warren E', ""O'Brien, Stephen J""]","['Brown MA', 'Cunningham MW', 'Roca AL', 'Troyer JL', 'Johnson WE', ""O'Brien SJ""]","['National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Emerg Infect Dis,Emerging infectious diseases,9508155,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Domestic', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Cat Diseases/transmission/virology', 'Cats', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Feline/*epidemiology/transmission/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Puma/*virology', 'Sequence Alignment']",2008/02/09 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/02/09 09:00'],"['2008/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3201/eid1402.070981 [doi]'],ppublish,Emerg Infect Dis. 2008 Feb;14(2):252-9. doi: 10.3201/eid1402.070981.,,PMC2600209,"['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,"['GENBANK/EU189489', 'GENBANK/EU189490', 'GENBANK/EU189491', 'GENBANK/EU189492', 'GENBANK/EU189493', 'GENBANK/EU189494', 'GENBANK/EU189495', 'GENBANK/EU189496', 'GENBANK/EU189497', 'GENBANK/EU189498']",,,,,,,,

The 5-year survival rates for patients with favorable, intermediate, and adverse karyotypes were 63.4, 39.1, and 0.0%, respectively, and 35.5% for those with 11q23 abnormalities (P < 0.0001). Overall survival (OS) did not significantly differ between nine patients with t(9;11) and 23 with other 11q23 abnormalities (P = 0.22).

The immune-mediated effect of NK and cytotoxic T cells against residual tumor cells was shown to prevent relapse and reinduce remission after bone marrow transplantation. We expanded CD34+ and T and NK cells ex vivo in cord blood with different cytokines combination and transplanted into leukemic BALB/C nude mouse. The results showed significant expansion of MNCs and CD34+ cells. The CD3+ T cells increased in the groups containing cytokines cocktail, especially in the group with IL-7 or IL-2. CD56+ NK cells number increased significantly only in a medium containing IL-2. Of the 20 engrafted BALB/C nude mice, 14 survived after 6 weeks transplantation, and the numbers in each group were from 3 to 4. Human CD3+ cells in the bone marrow of the survived mice were analyzed by flow cytometry and showed existing evidences. RT-PCR was used to detect leukemic fusion bcr/abl gene; all mice that experienced expanded cord blood transplantation could not be found to have expression of fusion bcr/abl gene. These suggest that T, NK cells as well as CD34+ cells could be expanded from CB MNCs in the same medium with the combination of cytokines. The expanded CB MNCs could reconstitute hematopoiesis and eliminate minimal residue leukemia disease in transplanted mice.","['Wei, Yaming', 'Huang, Yinfeng', 'Zhang, Yinze', 'Zhou, Huayou', 'Cao, Qiong', 'Meng, Qingbao', 'Lan, Juncai', 'Chen, Longhua']","['Wei Y', 'Huang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhou H', 'Cao Q', 'Meng Q', 'Lan J', 'Chen L']","[""Clinic Medicine Institute of Guangzhou, Guangzhou First Municipal People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical College, 510180, Guangzhou, China. weiyaming@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First Municipal People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical College, 510180, Guangzhou, China. weiyaming@163.com."", ""Clinic Medicine Institute of Guangzhou, Guangzhou First Municipal People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical College, 510180, Guangzhou, China."", 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510180, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510180, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510180, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510180, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510180, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Irradiation Therapy, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510180, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080208,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured/transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/*transplantation', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation']",2008/02/08 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0028-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0028-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Mar;87(2):217-224. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0028-0.

Several lines of evidence suggest that epigenomic events, especially promoter DNA methylation, are involved in this silencing of many B-cell-associated genes. Here, we show that DNA demethylation alone or in conjunction with histone acetylation is not able to reconstitute the B-cell-gene expression program in cultured HRS cells. Instead, combined DNA demethylation and histone acetylation of B-cell lines induce an almost complete extinction of their B-cell-expression program and a tremendous upregulation of numerous Hodgkin-characteristic genes, including key players such as Id2 known to be involved in the suppression of the B-cell phenotype. Since the upregulation of Hodgkin-characteristic genes and the extinction of the B-cell-expression program occurred simultaneously, epigenetic changes may also be responsible for the malignant transformation of cHL. The epigenetic upregulation of Hodgkin-characteristic genes thus plays--in addition to promoter DNA hypermethylation of B-cell-associated genes--a pivotal role for the reprogramming of HRS cells and explains why DNA demethylation alone is unable to reconstitute the B-cell-expression program in HRS cells.","['Ehlers, A', 'Oker, E', 'Bentink, S', 'Lenze, D', 'Stein, H', 'Hummel, M']","['Ehlers A', 'Oker E', 'Bentink S', 'Lenze D', 'Stein H', 'Hummel M']","['Institute of Pathology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite-Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080207,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Histones)'],IM,"['Acetylation', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/*pathology', 'Phenotype']",2008/02/08 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/02/08 09:00'],"['2008/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu200812 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.12 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Apr;22(4):835-41. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.12.

PCI-34051 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in cell lines derived from T-cell lymphomas or leukemias, but not in other hematopoietic or solid tumor lines. Unlike broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors, PCI-34051 does not cause detectable histone or tubulin acetylation. Cells defective in T-cell receptor signaling were still sensitive to PCI-34051-induced apoptosis, whereas a phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLCgamma1)-defective line was resistant. Jurkat cells showed a dose-dependent decrease in PCI-34051-induced apoptosis upon treatment with a PLC inhibitor U73122, but not with an inactive analog. We found that rapid intracellular calcium mobilization from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and later cytochrome c release from mitochondria are essential for the apoptotic mechanism. The rapid Ca(2+) flux was dependent on PCI-34051 concentration, and was blocked by the PLC inhibitor U73122. Further, apoptosis was blocked by Ca(2+) chelators (BAPTA) and enhanced by Ca(2+) effectors (thapsigargin), supporting this model. These studies show that HDAC8-selective inhibitors have a unique mechanism of action involving PLCgamma1 activation and calcium-induced apoptosis, and could offer benefits including a greater therapeutic index for treating T-cell malignancies.","['Balasubramanian, S', 'Ramos, J', 'Luo, W', 'Sirisawad, M', 'Verner, E', 'Buggy, J J']","['Balasubramanian S', 'Ramos J', 'Luo W', 'Sirisawad M', 'Verner E', 'Buggy JJ']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Pharmacyclics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA. sriram@pcyc.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080207,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (PCI 34051)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phospholipase C gamma/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/02/08 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/02/08 09:00'],"['2008/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu20089 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 May;22(5):1026-34. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.9.

The overall mean (+/- SD, CV%) steady-state C(min) for imatinib and CGP74588 were 979 ng/mL (+/- 530 ng/mL, 54.1%) and 242 ng/mL (+/- 106 ng/mL, 43.6%), respectively. Cumulative estimated complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) rates differed among the quartiles of imatinib trough levels (P = .01 for CCyR, P = .02 for MMR). C(min) of imatinib was significantly higher in patients who achieved CCyR (1009 +/- 544 ng/mL vs 812 +/- 409 ng/mL, P = .01). Patients with high imatinib exposure had better rates of CCyR and MMR and EFS. An exploratory analysis demonstrated that imatinib trough levels were predictive of higher CCyR independently of Sokal risk group. AE rates were similar among the imatinib quartile categories except fluid retention, rash, myalgia, and anemia, which were more common at higher imatinib concentrations. These results suggest that an adequate plasma concentration of imatinib is important for a good clinical response.

However, it is unclear whether it functions in tissue stem cells other than blood.

Runx1 disruption affects hair follicle stem cell activation, but not their maintenance, proliferation or differentiation potential. Adult mutant mice exhibit impaired de novo production of hair shafts and all temporary hair cell lineages, owing to a prolonged quiescent phase of the first hair cycle. The lag of stem cell activity is reversed by skin injury.

In Japan, the number of HTLV-1 carriers is estimated to be 1.2 million and more than 700 cases of ATL have been diagnosed every year. Considering the poor prognosis and lack of curative therapy of ATL, it seems mandatory to establish an effective strategy for the treatment of ATL. In this study, we attempted to identify the cell surface molecules that will become suitable targets of antibodies for anti-ATL therapy. The expression levels of approximately 40,000 host genes of three human T-cell lines carrying HTLV-1 genomes were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray and compared with the expression levels of the genes in an HTLV-1-negative T-cell line. The HTLV-1-carrying T-cell lines used for experiments had totally different expression patterns of viral genome. Among the genes evaluated, the expression levels of 108 genes were found to be enhanced more than 10-fold in all of the T-cell lines examined and 11 of the 108 genes were considered to generate the proteins expressed on the cell surface. In particular, the CD70 gene was upregulated more than 1,000-fold and the enhanced expression of the CD70 molecule was confirmed by laser flow cytometry for various HTLV-1-carrying T-cell lines and primary CD4(+) T cells isolated from acute-type ATL patients. Such expression was not observed for primary CD4(+) T cells isolated from healthy donors. Since CD70 expression is strictly restricted in normal tissues, such as highly activated T and B cells, CD70 appears to be a potential target for effective antibody therapy against ATL.","['Baba, Masanori', 'Okamoto, Mika', 'Hamasaki, Takayuki', 'Horai, Sawako', 'Wang, Xin', 'Ito, Yuji', 'Suda, Yasuo', 'Arima, Naomichi']","['Baba M', 'Okamoto M', 'Hamasaki T', 'Horai S', 'Wang X', 'Ito Y', 'Suda Y', 'Arima N']","['Division of Antiviral Chemotherapy, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, 8-35-1, Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima 890-8544, Japan. m-baba@vanilla.ocn.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080206,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis', 'CD27 Ligand/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/virology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/*virology', '*Up-Regulation', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis']",2008/02/08 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2008/02/08 09:00'],"['2008/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02013-07 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02013-07 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Apr;82(8):3843-52. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02013-07.

These include genes that directly affect the replication of retroviruses in target cells and those that control the host immune responses to the viral antigens. Host genetic factors that affect retroviral replication and immune responses to the viral antigens have been best studied in mouse models of Friend leukemia virus (FV) infection. Several genes located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), along with a separate gene not linked to the MHC, influence the host immune responses to FV antigens. The latter, the Rfv3, regulates the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies, and thus affects the duration of viremia. T-cell responses to the viral epitopes are controlled by MHC class I and class II genotypes, and both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cells are required for spontaneous immune resistance to FV infection. When CD4(+) T-helper cells are efficiently primed with a viral epitope, however, CD8(+) T-cells are not required for immune protection against FV infection, while B cells are absolutely required. There are individuals who possess human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-reactive IgA antibodies in their mucosal secretions and show strong T-cell responses to HIV-1 antigens, even though they are negative for HIV-1 genome and HIV-1-reactive serum IgG. These HIV-1-exposed but uninfected individuals rarely possess resistance-associated alleles at known AIDS-restricting loci such as CCR5Delta32. Recent genetic analyses have indicated that a large proportion of such exposed but uninfected individuals may share a common genetic background.","['Miyazawa, Masaaki', 'Tsuji-Kawahara, Sachiyo', 'Kanari, Yasuyoshi']","['Miyazawa M', 'Tsuji-Kawahara S', 'Kanari Y']","['Department of Immunology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka 589-0023, Japan. masaaki@med.kindai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080122,Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,['0 (HIV Antibodies)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology/*physiology', 'HIV Antibodies/immunology', 'HIV Infections/genetics/immunology', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV-1/immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*immunology', 'Virus Replication']",2008/02/08 09:00,2008/08/16 09:00,['2008/02/08 09:00'],"['2007/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0264-410X(08)00038-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 2008 Jun 6;26(24):2981-96. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.01.004.

The concentration of Aspergillus fumigatus was high along the corridor between the two haematology wards (2.98 CFU m(-3)), lower in the non-neutropenic patients' rooms and outside the hospital building (1.53 and 1.42 CFU m(-3), respectively), very low in the neutropenic patients' rooms (0.09 CFU m(-3)). During this period, three proven cases (A. fumigatus), two probable ones and two possible cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were documented in 97 patients with acute leukaemia (7%). The three cases of proven aspergillosis coincided with the period of renovation work and with the period in which we have found the maximum concentration of A. fumigatus along the corridor.

To describe the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of IA in children, retrospective review of the medical records of proven and probable IA between January 1986 and December 2000 was used. Twenty-four patients with IA were identified (10 proven and 14 probable) with a median age of 8.5 years. The incidence of IA was particularly high in acute myeloblastic leukaemia (5.35%) and leukaemia relapse (4%). Twenty-two patients presented with lung involvement. Broncho-alveolar lavage led to a diagnosis in 11 cases, but diagnosis was difficult and repeated invasive explorations were required. Antifungal therapy mainly consisted of amphotericin B. Eight patients underwent open-thorax surgery without any complication. Nine patients (37.5%) were cured of IA and three are still alive. The mortality was 87.5%.

PROCEDURE: We investigated the utility of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) for detection of chromosomal abnormalities compared to standard clinical evaluation with karyotype and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Fifty pediatric ALL diagnostic bone marrows were analyzed by bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array and findings compared to standard clinical evaluation. RESULTS: Sensitivity of aCGH was 79% to detect karyotypic findings other than balanced translocations, which cannot be detected by aCGH because they involve no copy number change. aCGH also missed abnormalities occurring in subclones constituting less than 25% of cells. aCGH detected 44 additional abnormalities undetected or misidentified by karyotype with 21 subsequently validated by FISH, including abnormalities in 4 of 10 cases with uninformative cytogenetics. aCGH detected concurrent terminal deletions of both 9p and 20q in three cases, in two of which the 20q deletion was undetected by karyotype. A narrow region of loss at 7p21 was detected in two cases. CONCLUSIONS: aCGH detects the majority of karyotypic findings other than balanced translocations, and may provide key prognostic information in the approximately 35% of cases with uninformative cytogenetics.","['Rabin, Karen R', 'Man, Tsz-Kwong', 'Yu, Alexander', 'Folsom, Matthew R', 'Zhao, Yi-Jue', 'Rao, Pulivarthi H', 'Plon, Sharon E', 'Naeem, Rizwan C']","['Rabin KR', 'Man TK', 'Yu A', 'Folsom MR', 'Zhao YJ', 'Rao PH', 'Plon SE', 'Naeem RC']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. krrabin@txccc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diploidy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2008/02/07 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/02/07 09:00'],"['2008/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21488 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Aug;51(2):171-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21488.,,PMC4063297,"['K12 CA090433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90433-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS570929'],,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Aug;51(2):153-4.

One of the major toxic effects of MTX is intestinal injury and enterocolitis .The mechanism of gastrointestinal toxicity of methotrexate has not been investigated completely. Therefore cancer chemotherapy has to be accompanied by symptomatic therapy such as antibiotics and anti-diarrheal drugs. It is important to investigate the mechanism by which methotrexate induces intestinal damage in order to perform cancer chemotherapy effectively by preventing the side effects. This study aimed at investigating whether nitrosative stress plays a role in methotrexate induced small intestinal damage using a rat model. Adult male rats were administered methotrexate at the dose of 7 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally for 3 consecutive days and sacrificed 12 or 24 h after the final dose of methotrexate. Vehicle treated rats served as control. The intestinal tissue was used for light microscopic studies and markers of nitrosative stress including tissue nitrite level and nitrotyrosine. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration was also measured in intestinal homogenates. The villi were damaged at 12 h and the damage progressed and became severe at 24 h after the final dose of MTX. Biochemically, tissue nitrate was elevated fivefold at 12 h and fourfold at 24 h after the final dose of MTX as compared with control. Nitrotyrosine, measured immunohistochemically was detected in all the parts of the small intestine. Duodenum stained the most for nitrotyrosine, followed by ileum and then jejunum. The staining for nitrotyrosine was more intense at 24 h as compared with 12 h after the final dose of methotrexate. There was marked neutrophil infiltration as evidenced by increase in MPO activity in the small intestines. In conclusion, the results of the present study reveal that nitrosative stress may play a critical role in methotrexate induced small intestinal damage. Intervention studies using nitric oxide synthase inhibitors is being carried out in order to confirm the role of nitrosative stress in methotrexate induced small intestinal damage.","['Kolli, Viswa Kalyan', 'Abraham, Premila', 'Rabi, Suganthy']","['Kolli VK', 'Abraham P', 'Rabi S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Christian Medical College, Bagayam, Vellore 632002, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080206,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (Reactive Nitrogen Species)', '3604-79-3 (3-nitrotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Duodenum/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ileum/drug effects/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Intestine, Small/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Jejunum/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Neutrophil Infiltration/drug effects', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/enzymology', 'Nitrites/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reactive Nitrogen Species/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",2008/02/07 09:00,2008/12/25 09:00,['2008/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00204-008-0287-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2008 Oct;82(10):763-70. doi: 10.1007/s00204-008-0287-9.

The incidences according to fusion partners in AML were: t(9;11), 31.3%; t(11;19), 27.4%; t(6;11), 21.5%. The incidence of patients with t(11;19) was higher than those in the US and Europe, and the incidence of t(4;11) was lower than that in childhood. The results indicated the poor prognosis of AML with 11q23 abnormalities regardless of the fusion partners. AML patients with 11q23 aged <60 years in the first CR who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) showed a more favorable outcome than those treated without allo-HSCT, although the differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.322 for DFS, P = 0.138 for OS). This result suggests that treatment strategies including allo-HSCT may be considered in the first CR in cases of AML with 11q23 abnormalities.

'Population-mixing' measures, used as surrogates for quantity and diversity of infections entering the community, were calculated from census data on the origins and destinations of migrants in the year before the census. Incidence at ages 1-4 years tended independently to be higher in rural wards, to increase with the diversity of origin wards from which in-migrants had moved during the year before the census, and to be lower in the most deprived areas as categorised by the Carstairs index. This last association was much weaker when urban/rural status and in-migrants' diversity were allowed for. There was no evidence of association with population mixing or deprivation for ALL diagnosed at ages 0 or 5-14 years. The apparent specificity to the young childhood age group suggests that these associations are particularly marked for precursor B-cell ALL, with the disease more likely to occur when delayed exposure to infection leads to increased immunological stress, as predicted by Greaves. The association with diversity of incomers, especially in rural areas, is also consistent with the higher incidence of leukaemia predicted by Kinlen, where population mixing results in below average herd immunity to an infectious agent.","['Stiller, C A', 'Kroll, M E', 'Boyle, P J', 'Feng, Z']","['Stiller CA', 'Kroll ME', 'Boyle PJ', 'Feng Z']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, Oxford OX2 6HJUK, UK. charles.stiller@ccrg.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080205,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Wales/epidemiology']",2008/02/07 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2008/02/07 09:00'],"['2008/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['6604237 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6604237 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2008 Mar 11;98(5):1006-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604237.

We found evidence for dicentric chromosome formation in 21 of 24 unbalanced translocations containing chromosome 20 and that were studied in more detail. Subsequent loss of one of the centromeres had occurred in eight of these 24 cases, and was more frequent than centromere inactivation as a means of resolving the inherent instability of a dicentric chromosome. In the three cases with dicentric chromosomes from which proximal 20q had been excised along with the 20 centromere, the excised segment was retained, and in two of these it was amplified. Proximal 20q was clearly retained in all but three cases, and present in three or more copies in 17 of 41 cases. The retention and amplification of proximal 20q provides support for the hypothesis that there is an oncogene located in this region of 20q that is activated in cases of MDS/AML with del(20q). Apparent monosomy 20 in MDS/AML should be treated as evidence of unidentified chromosome 20 abnormalities, and familiarity with the typical G-banded morphology of these derivatives can help with their identification. The reported incidence of dicentric chromosomes is clearly an under-estimate but is increasing in myeloid disorders as more cases are studied with methods allowing their detection.","['Mackinnon, R N', 'Campbell, L J']","['Mackinnon RN', 'Campbell LJ']","[""Victorian Cancer Cytogenetics Service, St Vincent's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia. ruth.mackinnon@svhm.org.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080201,Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,,IM,"['Centromere', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Monosomy/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Polyploidy']",2008/02/07 09:00,2008/02/22 09:00,['2008/02/07 09:00'],"['2007/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['000112063 [pii]', '10.1159/000112063 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2007;119(3-4):211-20. doi: 10.1159/000112063.

In the present study, our data showed that isoflavones aglycones AglyMax, genistein, and equol, but not daidzein, within the range of plasma concentration, displayed bioavailability in regulating the secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in Ishikawa cells, which was blocked by an estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182 780, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)1/2 inhibitor PD98059, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB203580. We also found that AglyMax and genistein increased in cyclic AMP release and the expression of glycodelin protein in Ishikawa cells assayed using western blot and immunochemical staining. The MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and the protein kinase A inhibitor H89, but not SB203580, attenuated this glycoprotein expression. Moreover, isoflavone aglycones AglyMax stimulated LIF, and TGF-beta secretion, and glycodelin expression in separate primary endometrial epithelial cells in the follicular phase or luteal phase from healthy subject donors. Overall, our findings suggest that isoflavones may alter the uterine expression of estrogen-responsive genes.","['Xu, Jin-Wen', 'Yasui, Naomi', 'Ikeda, Katsumi', 'Pan, Wei-Jun', 'Watanabe, June', 'Shiotani, Masahide', 'Yanaihara, Atsushi', 'Miki, Tomohiro', 'Yamori, Yukio']","['Xu JW', 'Yasui N', 'Ikeda K', 'Pan WJ', 'Watanabe J', 'Shiotani M', 'Yanaihara A', 'Miki T', 'Yamori Y']","[""Section of Pathophysiology, Department of Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mukogawa Women's University, Nishinomiya 663-8179, Japan. jwxu@mukogawa-u.ac.jp""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glycodelin)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (PAEP protein, human)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Endometrium/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Glycodelin', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2008/02/07 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2008/02/07 09:00'],"['2008/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['196/2/425 [pii]', '10.1677/JOE-07-0416 [doi]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol. 2008 Feb;196(2):425-33. doi: 10.1677/JOE-07-0416.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that overexpression of Cdx4 enhances hematopoietic potential from murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here we compare the effect of ectopic Cdx1, Cdx2, and Cdx4 on the differentiation of murine ESC-derived hematopoietic progenitors. The 3 Cdx genes differentially influence the formation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors within a CD41(+)c-kit(+) population of embryoid body (EB)-derived cells. Cdx1 and Cdx4 enhance, whereas Cdx2 strongly inhibits, the hematopoietic potential of CD41(+)ckit(+) EB-derived cells, changes that are reflected by effects on hematopoietic lineage-specific and Hox gene expression. When we subject stromal cell and colony assay cultures of EB-derived hematopoietic progenitors to ectopic expression of Cdx genes, Cdx4 dramatically enhances, whereas Cdx1 and Cdx2 both inhibit hematopoietic activity, probably by blocking progenitor differentiation. These data demonstrate distinct effects of Cdx genes on hematopoietic progenitor formation and differentiation, insights that we are using to facilitate efforts at in vitro culture of hematopoietic progenitors from ESC. The behavior of Cdx genes in vitro suggests how derangement of these developmental regulators might contribute to leukemogenesis.","['McKinney-Freeman, Shannon L', 'Lengerke, Claudia', 'Jang, Il-Ho', 'Schmitt, Sabine', 'Wang, Yuan', 'Philitas, Marsha', 'Shea, Jessica', 'Daley, George Q']","['McKinney-Freeman SL', 'Lengerke C', 'Jang IH', 'Schmitt S', 'Wang Y', 'Philitas M', 'Shea J', 'Daley GQ']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080205,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Cdx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdx4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CDX2 Transcription Factor', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Mice', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",2008/02/07 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/02/07 09:00'],"['2008/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)47177-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-124644 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 15;111(10):4944-53. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-124644.

The screen identified 30 nonsynonymous sequence variations in 22 different kinases not previously reported in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases. These included a novel FLT3 activating allele and a previously described activating mutation in MET (METT1010I). The majority of novel sequence variants were stably expressed in factor-dependent Ba/F3 cells. Apart from one FLT3 allele, none of the novel variants showed constitutive phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis and none transformed Ba/F3 cells to factor-independent growth. These findings indicate the majority of these alleles are not potent tyrosine kinase activators in this cellular context and that a significant proportion of nonsynonymous sequence variants identified in HT DNA sequencing screens may not have functional significance. Although some sequence variants may represent SNPs, these data are consistent with recent reports that a significant fraction of such sequence variants are ""passenger"" rather than ""driver"" alleles and underscore the importance of functional assessment of candidate disease alleles.","['Loriaux, Marc M', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Scholl, Claudia', 'Stoffregen, Eric P', 'Wernig, Gerlinde', 'Erickson, Heidi', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Berger, Roland', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Griffin, James D', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Lee, Benjamin', 'Meyerson, Matthew', 'Heinrich, Michael C', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Druker, Brian J']","['Loriaux MM', 'Levine RL', 'Tyner JW', 'Frohling S', 'Scholl C', 'Stoffregen EP', 'Wernig G', 'Erickson H', 'Eide CA', 'Berger R', 'Bernard OA', 'Griffin JD', 'Stone RM', 'Lee B', 'Meyerson M', 'Heinrich MC', 'Deininger MW', 'Gilliland DG', 'Druker BJ']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Cancer Institute, Portland, OR 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080205,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/etiology', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2008/02/07 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/02/07 09:00'],"['2008/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41170-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-101394 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 1;111(9):4788-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-101394.

The purpose of this study was to report the cases of five paediatric patients treated with voriconazole, in which plasma levels were used to monitor therapy. METHODS: Five children treated with voriconazole were included in this case series. Voriconazole plasma levels were determined using either a bioassay or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The patients' ages ranged from 2 to 10 years old (mean 6.2 years). Three patients had acute leukaemia and two had suffered severe burn injuries. Doses administered varied from 3.4 mg/kg every 12 h to 8.1 mg/kg every 8 h. Plasma voriconazole concentrations were unpredictable for these paediatric patients. Subtherapeutic levels were frequently observed, despite progressive increments in dosage. For others, voriconazole levels markedly increased after a small increment in dosage. Phenobarbitone caused important drug interactions with voriconazole for one [corrected] of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The dose administered did not correlate with exposure as measured by plasma levels of voriconazole. While the optimal dosage for voriconazole in children is still unknown, drug monitoring seems warranted to ensure adequate exposure, and after dose increments to prevent excessive exposure.

ALV-J seems to have been eradicated from elite breeding stock produced by most primary breeders, albeit ALV-J still circulates in some commercial poultry. This study was undertaken to examine the molecular epidemiology and evolution of ALV-J detected in breeding stock and broiler chickens representing eight primary breeding companies over a period of approximately 20 yr (1988-2007). The redundant transmembrane region of the envelope gene has been deleted in some isolates, suggesting that this region is dispensable for viral fitness. Within the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), the direct repeat 1 was present in 100% of the ALV-J isolates studied. In contrast, the E element has undergone substantial deletions in >50% of the ALV-J proviruses studied. Overall, the unique region 3 was the least conserved within the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR), albeit the transcriptional regulatory elements typical of avian retroviruses (CAAT, CArG, PRE, TATA, and Y boxes) were highly conserved. The direct repeat region of the LTR was identical in all of the proviruses, and the 3' unique region 5 was relatively well conserved. Thus, the 3' UTR of ALV-J has evolved rapidly, reflecting significant instability of this region. Some of the mutations in the 3' UTR have resulted in the emergence of moderately distinct genetic lineages representing each primary breeding company from which ALV-J was isolated.","['Zavala, G', 'Cheng, S', 'Jackwood, M W']","['Zavala G', 'Cheng S', 'Jackwood MW']","['Poultry Diagnostic and Research Center, Department of Population Health, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA. gzavala@uga.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)""]",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Chickens', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Phylogeny', 'Poultry Diseases/*epidemiology/virology']",2008/02/07 09:00,2008/02/28 09:00,['2008/02/07 09:00'],"['2008/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1637/0005-2086(2007)51[942:MEOALV]2.0.CO;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Avian Dis. 2007 Dec;51(4):942-53. doi: 10.1637/0005-2086(2007)51[942:MEOALV]2.0.CO;2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blockade of the Fas-mediated apoptotic signal leads to abusive lymphoproliferation, auto-immunity, and an increased risk of developing lymphoma and leukemia. Fas engagement drives the formation of a complex termed DISC (death-inducing signaling complex), which contains the adaptor molecule Fas-associated protein, two members of the caspase family caspase-8 and -10, and a pseudo-caspase termed c-FLIP. According to different authors, DISC formation relies either on the redistribution of Fas into the lipid rafts or the recruitment of the actin cytoskeleton and receptor endocytosis or the production of ceramide. However, the accurate molecular ordering upstream from the formation of DISC remains very puzzling and is highly debated.

Depending on the tissues involved such symptoms include itching, sneezing, irritation, vasodilation, and reflex secretions. In the present study, we hypothesize that sensory neuroactive mediators released from mast cells may include agonists of recently discovered orphan receptors referred to as sensory nerve specific receptors or products of mas related genes. HEK-293 cells expressing MrgC11 receptors and wild-type HEK-293 cells were loaded with the calcium indicator Fura-2. A known stimulant of MrgC11 receptors the RF-amide, neuropeptide FF, evoked a rapid increase in cytosolic calcium in the MrgC11 expressing cells but not in the wild-type HEK-293 cells. IgE-dependent stimulation of either rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells (RBL-2H3 cells) or mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells, released a substance(s) that stimulated increases in cytosolic calcium in the MrgC11 expressing cells that far exceeded that seen in control cells. RT-PCR revealed that both mouse mast cells and RBL-2H3 cells express the RF-amide precursor gene proneuropeptide FF (A). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated RF-amide immunoreactivity in mouse skin mast cells in situ and in mast cells isolated from mouse skin.

To further elucidate the potential of endogenous LIF in modulating neuroinflammation, we studied myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in LIF knockout mice (LIF(-/-) mice). In the late phase of active myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, LIF(-/-) mice exhibited a markedly milder disease course. The inflammatory infiltrate in LIF(-/-) mice was characterized by an increase in neutrophilic granulocytes early and fewer infiltrating macrophages associated with less demyelination later in the disease. In good correlation with an effect of endogenous LIF on the immune response, we found an Ag-specific T cell-priming defect with impaired IFN-gamma production in LIF(-/-) mice. On the molecular level, the altered recruitment of inflammatory cells is associated with distinct patterns of chemokine production in LIF(-/-) mice with an increase of CXCL1 early and a decrease of CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL10 later in the disease. These data reveal that endogenous LIF is an immunologically active molecule in neuroinflammation.

To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of progression to BC, we screened DNA samples from CML patients during blast transformation for mutations in a number of transcription factor genes that are critical for myeloid-lymphoid development. In 85 cases of CML blast transformation, we identified two new mutations in the coding region of GATA-2, a negative regulator of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell differentiation. A L359V substitution within zinc finger domain (ZF) 2 of GATA-2 was found in eight cases with myelomonoblastic features, whereas an in-frame deletion of 6 aa (delta341-346) spanning the C-terminal border of ZF1 was detected in one patient at myeloid BC with eosinophilia. Further studies indicated that L359V not only increased transactivation activity of GATA-2 but also enhanced its inhibitory effects on the activity of PU.1, a major regulator of myelopoiesis. Consistent with the myelomonoblastic features of CML transformation with the GATA-2 L359V mutant, transduction of the GATA-2 L359V mutant into HL-60 cells or BCR/ABL-harboring murine cells disturbed myelomonocytic differentiation/proliferation in vitro and in vivo, respectively.

CONCLUSION: INFalpha and 5-AZA-CdR can induce Xaf1 mRNA expressions in HL-60 and K562 cells, and the effect of 5-AZA-CdR was dose-dependent. 5-AZA-CdR and EGCG induces apoptosis of leukemia cells in vitro, and they exhibits obvious synergetic effects.","['Huang, Yun-yan', 'Xia, Yan', 'Guo, Hai-xia', 'Li, Wen-yi']","['Huang YY', 'Xia Y', 'Guo HX', 'Li WY']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Clinical Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China. yyhuang586@126.com']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XAF1 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'K562 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2008/02/06 09:00,2010/06/02 06:00,['2008/02/06 09:00'],"['2008/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2008 Feb;28(2):204-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: CD34 expression on acute myelogenous leukemia KG1a cells was detected by flow cytometry. KG1a cells were co-cultured at different effector-to-target (E:T) ratios with NK cells isolated from 5 healthy individuals using magnetic cell sorting. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay was employed to examine the cytolysis of KG1a cells in the co-culture, and the inhibition rate of the KG1a cell colony formation in methylcellulose was determined with K562 cells sensitive to NK cells as the control. RESULTS: A expression rate as much as (98.0-/+1.1)% was detected for CD34 antigen on KG1a cells, and the isolated NK cells (CD3(-)CD16+CD56+ cells) had a purity of (93.2-/+3.7)% after magnetic cell sorting. Allogenetic NK cells exhibited obvious cytotoxicity and colony inhibition in vitro against KG1a cells at different E:T ratios, and the effects were significantly enhanced as the E:T ratios increased (P<0.05). At the same E:T ratio, the cytotoxicity and colony inhibition rate of allogenetic NK cells against KG1a cells was lower than those against K562 cells (P<0.05).

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a potentially curative therapy for patients with CLL. Polyclonal antithymocyte (or anti-T-cell) globulins (ATGs) are used for conditioning in allogeneic SCT mainly due to their anti-T-cell activity. ATGs however, contain antibodies targeting antigens expressed on various hematopoietic cells including B cells. METHODS: We assessed anti-CLL activity of two commercially available ATG preparations at clinically relevant concentrations (10-100 microg/ml) in CLL samples from 16 patients. Cytotoxicity was determined by staining with 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD), annexin V and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Both ATG preparations induced marked complement-independent dose-dependent cytotoxicity in all samples. Addition of complement strongly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of both ATG preparations significantly. ATG-induced complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was at least as high as that observed with Alemtuzumab. Both ATGs enhanced the cytotoxic effect of Fludarabine. CONCLUSION: ATG is an effective agent against CLL in vitro. We suggest that this potential be taken into consideration when developing stem cell transplantation protocols for patients with CLL.","['Ayuk, Francis A', 'Atassi, Nabil', 'Schuch, Gunther', 'Mina, Sormeh', 'Fang, Lubin', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Fehse, Boris', 'Zander, Axel R', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Ayuk FA', 'Atassi N', 'Schuch G', 'Mina S', 'Fang L', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Fehse B', 'Zander AR', 'Kroger N']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. ayuketan@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080204,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/pharmacology', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Complement System Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy']",2008/02/06 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00505-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.12.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Aug;32(8):1200-6. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.12.011.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC), including >90% AML blasts and 1% to 3% T cells, were seeded in limiting dilution culture in which AML blasts were induced to undergo dendritic cell (DC) differentiation. T cells were primed and activated with the addition of a cytokine combination. RESULTS: Highly reactive anti-AML T-cell lines (both CD4(+) and CD8(+)) were generated, selected, and expanded. The estimated average frequency of AML-reactive T cells or precursors was 6 +/- 3/1,000,000 AML peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 11). Robust intracellular interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release from T-cell lines was demonstrated by flow cytometry after stimulation by autologous AML cells, but not an autologous B-lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). These T-cell lines caused specific lysis of autologous AML cells, but not autologous LCL or allogeneic AML cells, and they depleted autologous AML colony-forming cells (CFC), but not normal CFC. Most CD4(+) T-cell lines exerted strong proapoptotic effects on AML cells. AML cell apoptosis by CD4(+) T-cell lines correlated with IFN-gamma secretion. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a methodology for generating large numbers of AML-reactive cytotoxic T cell lines (either class I or II restricted) that may be useful clinically in adoptive immunotherapy. This study also provides estimates of AML-reactive T-cell frequency in patients with AML.","['Zhong, Rui-Kun', 'Lane, Thomas A', 'Ball, Edward D']","['Zhong RK', 'Lane TA', 'Ball ED']","['Departments of Medicine and the Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, Calif. 92093-0960, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080130,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2008/02/06 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00668-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Apr;36(4):486-94. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.012.

We investigated the expression and activity of ABC transporters in patient total blasts and subpopulations along the leukemic stem cell hierarchy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we measured expression of the ABC transporter superfamily in the blast cells from AML patients prior to chemotherapy. In addition, we measured ex vivo daunorubicin resistance of subpopulations with or without ABC inhibitors. RESULTS: In the total blasts, no consistent difference was observed in 18 patients achieving complete remission (CR) and 13 patients who were refractory to induction chemotherapy (NR). However, among the subpopulation of CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cells (candidate ""leukemic stem cells""), elevated expression of MDR1 and/or BCRP1, two ABC transporters associated with drug resistance, was found in 8 of 10 NR patients as compared to 0 of 7 CR patients. No such association was observed in the more differentiated CD34(+)CD38(+) or CD34(-) subpopulations. There was no significant difference in MRP1 expression between CR and NR patient samples in any of the subpopulations examined. The increased expression of MDR1 and BCRP1 in leukemic cells correlated with increased cellular daunorubicin resistance, which could be reversed by the ABC transporter inhibitors verapamil and PSC-833. CONCLUSION: Expression of MDR1 and BCRP1 in leukemic stem cells correlates with chemotherapy response both at the cellular level and in AML patients.","['Ho, Maria M', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'Ling, Victor']","['Ho MM', 'Hogge DE', 'Ling V']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080130,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/drug effects/*metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/02/06 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00689-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Apr;36(4):433-42. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.014.

Recently, it has been proposed that macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) is the clinical hallmark of hypercalcemia in ATL. In this study, we investigated the effect of extracellular calcium on MIP-1alpha secretion in ATL cells and the role of Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CaM-K) cascade in transcriptional activation of MIP-1alpha. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MIP-1alpha protein levels in the culture supernatant collected from ATL cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reporter plasmid containing the MIP-1alpha promoter was transfected to ATL cells, and the promoter activity was measured by luciferase assay. RESULTS: The addition of calcium to the culture medium enhanced the secretion of MIP-1alpha from ATL cells, which was inhibited by the CaM-KK inhibitor. The transfection of CaM-KIV stimulated MIP-1alpha promoter activity, and the upstream kinase CaM-KK enhanced the stimulatory effect of CaM-KIV on the promoter activity. Mutation in the cyclic adenosine 5' monophosphate response element (CRE) within the MIP-1alpha promoter significantly reduced the effect of CaM-KIV, and CRE mutant promoter activity was not significantly enhanced by the addition of calcium to the culture medium as compared to wild-type promoter activity. CONCLUSION: Hypercalcemia enhances MIP-1alpha secretion in ATL cells, and this mechanism requires the involvement of CaM-KK/CaM-KIV cascade through the CRE. These findings raise a possibility that the inhibitory effect of CaM-KK/CaM-KIV cascade may be a potential therapeutic target for ATL.","['Matsumoto, Kensuke', 'Murao, Koji', 'Imachi, Hitomi', 'Nishiuchi, Takamasa', 'Cao, Wenming', 'Yu, Xiao', 'Li, Junhua', 'Ahmed, Rania A M', 'Iwama, Hisakazu', 'Kobayashi, Ryoji', 'Tokumitsu, Hiroshi', 'Ishida, Toshihiko']","['Matsumoto K', 'Murao K', 'Imachi H', 'Nishiuchi T', 'Cao W', 'Yu X', 'Li J', 'Ahmed RA', 'Iwama H', 'Kobayashi R', 'Tokumitsu H', 'Ishida T']","['Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan. matsumot@med.kagawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080130,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Naphthalimides)', '0 (STO 609)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Naphthalimides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2008/02/06 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/02/06 09:00'],"['2007/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00688-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Apr;36(4):390-400. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.013.

He then accepted a faculty position at St. Jude and remained there for 20 years, ultimately becoming the Chair of the Experimental Oncology Department. In June 1999, he joined the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, as Vice-Chair for Research in Pediatric Oncology and Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Work in Dr. Look's laboratory focuses on the molecular pathogenesis of leukemia. His group has been credited with the identification and functional analysis of several chimeric oncogenes activated by chromosomal translocations, including the E2A-HLF transcription factor, which was shown to act through an evolutionarily conserved genetic pathway to promote leukemia cell survival. Their efforts in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia have revealed key multistep mutational pathways that drive the pathogenesis of this disease and demonstrated that NOTCH1 receptors are mutationally activated in a majority of these cases. More recently, Dr. Look's laboratory developed the first transgenic model of leukemia in the zebrafish, opening the way for chemical and genome-wide genetic modifier screens in a vertebrate disease model.","['Look, A Thomas']",['Look AT'],,['eng'],['Interview'],,United States,Zebrafish,Zebrafish,101225070,,,,2008/02/06 09:00,2008/02/06 09:01,['2008/02/06 09:00'],"['2008/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:01 [medline]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/zeb.2005.2.231 [doi]'],ppublish,Zebrafish. 2005;2(4):231-6. doi: 10.1089/zeb.2005.2.231.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While TRIM11 and 31 inhibited HIV entry, TRIM11 enhanced N-MLV entry by interfering with Ref1 restriction. Strikingly, many TRIM proteins affected late stages of the viral life cycle. Gene silencing of endogenously expressed TRIM 25, 31, and 62 inhibited viral release indicating that they play an important role at late stages of the viral life cycle.

In this work it is shown that deregulated expression of either mycER or mycERtrade mark variants also blocked terminal myeloid differentiation but failed to induce the apoptotic response, demonstrating that c-myc can block differentiation independent of the apoptotic response. The failure of the mycERtrade mark transgene to cause the apoptotic response is associated with reduced levels of RIP1 expression, increased Mcl-1 expression and activation of both NF-kB and Akt. In addition, deregulating expression of RIP1 in M1mycERtrade mark cells restored the apoptotic response. Thus altering c-Myc or its downstream effectors can influence the balance between apoptosis and survival, and ultimately the oncogenic potential of the c-myc oncogene. This knowledge can be exploited to manipulate the downstream effectors, such as RIP1, to promote apoptosis and drive the death of cancer cells.","[""D'Angelo, Santo"", 'Liebermann, Dan', 'Hoffman, Barbara']","[""D'Angelo S"", 'Liebermann D', 'Hoffman B']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '17197F0KYM (afimoxifene)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tamoxifen/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', '*Transgenes', 'fas Receptor/genetics/metabolism']",2008/02/06 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/02/06 09:00'],"['2008/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.21383 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2008 Jul;216(1):120-7. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21383.,,,['R01 CA081168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite improvements in survival with the addition of temozolomide to radiation in the adjuvant setting, the prognosis of patients affected by these tumors remains relatively poor. One approach to improve outcomes in these patients is to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR-targeted therapy is a rational approach since EGFR overexpression and mutant EGFRvIII expression occur in approximately 50% of patients with GBM. Unfortunately, monotherapy with anti-EGFR agents in malignant gliomas has not provided the dramatic results sometimes seen with other targeted therapies, such as imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Anti-EGFR agents currently being studied in malignant gliomas include the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), monoclonal antibodies (MAb), and anti-EGFR vaccines. Of all these agents, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors-which include erlotinib and gefitinib-have been the most extensively tested in clinical trials. Retrospective analyses have highlighted co-expression of EGFRvIII and wild-type PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10) as a significant predictor of EGFR TKI response in patients with GBM. As the EGFR signaling pathway is exceptionally complex, newer approaches targeting multiple points in the pathway are being developed to improve treatment efficacy.","['Voelzke, Will R', 'Petty, W Jeffery', 'Lesser, Glenn J']","['Voelzke WR', 'Petty WJ', 'Lesser GJ']","['Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, Medical Center Blvd, Winston Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080205,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Astrocytoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",2008/02/06 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/02/06 09:00'],"['2008/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11864-008-0053-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2008 Feb;9(1):23-31. doi: 10.1007/s11864-008-0053-5.

The introduction of nucleoside analogs such as fludarabine and monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab (Rituxan) markedly changed the initial therapy of CLL, particularly in the United States. Fludarabine and combination regimens such as fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (FC) have achieved higher complete response (CR) rates and progression-free survival (PFS) than chlorambucil in previously untreated CLL, but long-term overall survival has not improved, due to concurrent improvement in salvage therapy of relapsed CLL patients. Upfront chemoimmunotherapy regimens such as fludarabine/rituximab (FR) and fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab (FCR) have similarly improved CR rates and PFS in previously untreated CLL patients, but it is unclear whether overall survival is improved. Advances in cytogenetic analysis and other biologic prognostic factors have greatly enhanced clinicians' ability to risk-stratify newly diagnosed CLL patients, and knowledge of such prognostic factors is necessary to properly interpret results of clinical treatment studies. The choice of initial therapy for an individual patient should depend upon the patient's age and medical condition, cytogenetic and other prognostic factors, and whether the goal of therapy is maximization of CR and PFS or palliation of symptoms with minimal toxicity.","['Lin, Thomas S']",['Lin TS'],"['The Ohio State University, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA. thomas.lin@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",2008/02/06 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2008/02/06 09:00'],"['2008/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['169733 [pii]'],ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 2007 Dec;21(14):1641-9; discussion 1649-54, 1659, 1662.",55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may serve as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and might be a potential novel anti-leukemia agent.","['Huang, Yi-Qun', 'Ma, Xu-Dong', 'Zhen, Rui-Ji', 'Chiao, Jen-Wei', 'Liu, De-Long']","['Huang YQ', 'Ma XD', 'Zhen RJ', 'Chiao JW', 'Liu DL']","['Department of Hematology, Zhangzhou Municipal Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou 363000, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '133920-06-6 (6-phenylhexyl isothiocyanate)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Methylation/drug effects']",2008/02/06 09:00,2009/10/06 06:00,['2008/02/06 09:00'],"['2008/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Sep;28(9):612-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty-two patients with low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma consisting of 19 primary one and 13 relapsed or refractory were treated with fludarabine-containing regimens, which included FMD (fludarabine, mitoxantrone and dexamethasone); FMC (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone) and FC ( fludarabine and cyclophosphamide). RESULTS: The average course completed in these 32 patients was 4.1 with a complete response rate (CR), partial response rate (PR) and overall response rate (OR) of 65.6%, 18.8% and 84.4% , respectively. There were no significant difference in CR, PR and OR between primary and relapsed or refractory group (71.4%, 21.0%, 92.4% vs. 46.2%, 13.1%, 59.3%, respectively). Myelotoxicity and immunotoxicity was the dominating adverse effects. Ill to IV grade granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 31.3% (10/32) and 9.4% (3/32) of these patients respectively. Infection developed in 7 patients, and two of them died of pulmonary infection. The median follow-up period was 16 months (1-30 months) with 2-year overall-survival rate (OS) and progression-free survival rate (PFS) of 93.8% and 84.4%, respectively.

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genomic array (SNP-chip) is a new tool that can detect copy number changes and uniparental disomy (UPD) over the entire genome with very high resolution. METHODS: The authors performed SNP-chip analysis on 56 samples from patients with early-stage, untreated CLL. To validate the SNP-chip data, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed at selected sites. Expression levels of ZAP-70 and the mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene also were examined. RESULTS: SNP-chip analysis easily detected nearly all changes that were identified by FISH, including trisomy 12, deletion of TP53 (17p13), deletion of ATM (11q22), and deletion of 13q14. Only 10 of 56 CLL samples (18%) had no genomic abnormalities. Excluding the 4 common abnormalities mentioned above, 25 CLL samples (45%) had a total of 45 copy number changes detected by SNP-chip analysis. Four samples had 6q deletion at 6q21 that involved the AIM1 gene. UPD was detected in 4 samples; 2 samples involved whole chromosome 13 resulting in homozygous deletion of micro-RNA-15a (miR-15a)/miR-16-1. CLL samples with deletion of 13q14 and trisomy 12 were mutually exclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic abnormalities, including whole chromosome 13 UPD, are very common events in early-stage CLL. SNP-chip analysis can detect small genetic abnormalities in CLL and may be able to support or even supplant FISH and cytogenetics.","['Lehmann, Soren', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Raynaud, Sophie D', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Ticchioni, Michel', 'Bastard, Christian', 'Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Lehmann S', 'Ogawa S', 'Raynaud SD', 'Sanada M', 'Nannya Y', 'Ticchioni M', 'Bastard C', 'Kawamata N', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23270 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Mar 15;112(6):1296-305. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23270.,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to limited non-hematological toxicity, treosulfan might be a promising compound in myeloablative therapy for hematopoietic transplantation in children. Since in vitro data regarding the activity of treosulfan against childhood leukemic cells are limited, we compared the effect of treosulfan and busulfan against pediatric leukemic and non-malignant cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Both agents were tested alone and in combination with fludarabine by means of the MTT and/or a five color-flow cytometric assay. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis by treosulfan was investigated via regulation of the proteinase caspase 3. RESULTS: Treosulfan was more active against leukemic cells of 20 children as well as against 3 leukemia-derived cell lines than busulfan, with increasing IC50 values from initial diagnosis to relapse. Overall purified stem cells were most sensitive, followed by CD56+CD3- NK and CD3+ T cells. The combination of treosulfan with fludarabine resulted in a synergistic effect against leukemic cells. In malignant cells, treosulfan induced rapid cell apoptosis measured by the activation of the centrally proteinase caspase 3. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that treosulfan has activity against pediatric leukemic cells, myeloablative potential and immunosuppressive properties suitable for conditioning regimen in childhood malignancies.","['Munkelt, Doreen', 'Koehl, Ulrike', 'Kloess, Stephan', 'Zimmermann, Stefanie-Yvonne', 'Kalaaoui, Rabia El', 'Wehner, Sibylle', 'Schwabe, Dirk', 'Lehrnbecher, Thomas', 'Schubert, Ralf', 'Kreuter, Joerg', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Esser, Ruth']","['Munkelt D', 'Koehl U', 'Kloess S', 'Zimmermann SY', 'Kalaaoui RE', 'Wehner S', 'Schwabe D', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'Schubert R', 'Kreuter J', 'Klingebiel T', 'Esser R']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, 60596, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080202,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'CO61ER3EPI (treosulfan)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Busulfan/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2007/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-007-0669-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2008 Oct;62(5):821-30. doi: 10.1007/s00280-007-0669-3.

The epidemiological evidence suggests that acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) associated with chronic occupational benzene exposure can be best described by sigmoid dose-response relationships. A review of the molecular toxicology and kinetics of benzene points to the existence of threshold mechanisms in the induction of leukemia. The toxicological and epidemiological literature on chronic exposure to unleaded gasoline indicates that the benzene exposures required to induce a measurable carcinogenic response are substantially greater than exposures likely to be encountered from exposure to gasoline at contaminated properties. Thus, assuming that theoretical cancer risks associated with exposure to benzene from gasoline reflect actual health risks associated with such environmental exposures to gasoline and using these theoretical cancer risks and cancer potency factors for benzene to dictate soil and groundwater clean up of gasoline are not scientifically defensible.","['Jamall, Ijaz S', 'Willhite, Calvin C']","['Jamall IS', 'Willhite CC']","['Risk-Based Decisions, Inc., 2033 Howe Avenue, Suite 240, Sacramento, CA 95825, USA. ijamall@riskbaseddecisions.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20071221,England,J Environ Monit,Journal of environmental monitoring : JEM,100968688,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Gasoline)', '0 (Soil Pollutants)', '0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*poisoning/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*poisoning/*toxicity', 'Gasoline/*poisoning/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Soil Pollutants/poisoning/toxicity', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical/poisoning/toxicity']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/b712987d [doi]'],ppublish,J Environ Monit. 2008 Feb;10(2):176-87. doi: 10.1039/b712987d.

Development of a block in myeloid differentiation is associated with progression of MPD to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and portends poor prognosis. Identifying molecular markers of this transition may suggest targets for therapeutic intervention. Interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP, also known as IRF8) is an interferon-regulatory transcription factor that functions as a leukemia tumor suppressor. In mice, ICSBP deficiency induces an MPD that progresses to AML over time, suggesting that ICSBP deficiency is sufficient for myeloproliferation, but additional genetic lesions are necessary for AML. Since activity of ICSBP is influenced by tyrosine phosphorylation state, we hypothesized that mutations in molecular pathways that regulate this process might synergize with ICSBP deficiency for progression to AML. Consistent with this, we found that constitutive activation of SHP2 protein tyrosine phosphatase synergized with ICSBP haploinsufficiency to facilitate cytokine-induced myeloproliferation, apoptosis resistance, and rapid progression to AML in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. Constitutive SHP2 activation cooperated with ICSBP deficiency to increase the number of progenitors in the bone marrow and myeloid blasts in circulation, indicating a block in differentiation. Since SHP2 activation and ICSBP deficiency may coexist in human myeloid malignancies, our studies have identified a molecular mechanism potentially involved in disease progression in such diseases.","['Konieczna, Iwona', 'Horvath, Elizabeth', 'Wang, Hao', 'Lindsey, Stephan', 'Saberwal, Gurveen', 'Bei, Ling', 'Huang, Weiqi', 'Platanias, Leonidas', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Konieczna I', 'Horvath E', 'Wang H', 'Lindsey S', 'Saberwal G', 'Bei L', 'Huang W', 'Platanias L', 'Eklund EA']","['Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/chemistry/deficiency/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2007/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI33742 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2008 Mar;118(3):853-67. doi: 10.1172/JCI33742.,,PMC2214847,"['R01 CA095266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL088747/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA095266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This requires the release of p53 from the constraints of its negative regulators Mdm2 and Mdm4. A key event in this dissociation is the phosphorylation of p53 at threonine residue (Thr18) within the Mdm2/4-binding domain. Casein kinase 1 (CK1) plays a major role in this phosphorylation. The promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) regulates certain modifications of p53 in response to DNA damage. Here, we investigated the role of PML in the regulation of Thr18 phosphorylation. We found that PML enhances Thr18 phosphorylation of endogenous p53 in response to stress. On DNA damage, CK1 accumulates in the cell, with a proportion concentrated in the nucleus together with p53 and PML. Furthermore, CK1 interacts with endogenous p53 and PML, and this interaction is enhanced by genotoxic stress. Inhibition of CK1 impairs the protection of p53 by PML from Mdm2-mediated degradation. Our findings support a role for PML in the regulation of p53 by CK1. We propose that following DNA damage, PML facilitates Thr18 phosphorylation by recruiting p53 and CK1 into PML nuclear bodies, thereby protecting p53 from inhibition by Mdm2, leading to p53 activation.","['Alsheich-Bartok, O', 'Haupt, S', 'Alkalay-Snir, I', 'Saito, S', 'Appella, E', 'Haupt, Y']","['Alsheich-Bartok O', 'Haupt S', 'Alkalay-Snir I', 'Saito S', 'Appella E', 'Haupt Y']","['Department of Immunology, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080204,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase I)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Casein Kinase I/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/physiology', 'Threonine/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/07/02 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1211036 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1211036 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jun 12;27(26):3653-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1211036.

One such fusion partner is promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger gene (PLZF), a member of the POK (POZ and Kruppel) family of transcriptional repressors that is a key developmental regulator, stem cell maintenance factor and tumor suppressor. Overexpression of PLZF has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest at the G(1) to S transition and repress the expression of key pro-proliferative genes such as CCNA2 and MYC. However, given this data suggesting an important growth inhibitory role for PLZF, relatively little is known regarding regulation of its activity. Here we show that the main cyclin-dependent kinase involved at the G(1) to S transition (CDK2) phosphorylates PLZF at two consensus sites found within PEST domains present in the hinge region of the protein. This phosphorylation triggers the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PLZF, which impairs PLZF transcriptional repression ability and antagonizes its growth inhibitory effects. This critical mechanism of PLZF regulation may thus be relevant for cell cycle progression during the development and the pathogenesis of human cancer.","['Costoya, J A', 'Hobbs, R M', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Costoya JA', 'Hobbs RM', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Department of Pathology, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080204,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/enzymology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Zinc Fingers/*drug effects']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc20087 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.7 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jun 19;27(27):3789-96. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.7.

Over time patients become resistant to treatment and progress to blast crisis, an event that is driven by additional genetic and epigenetic aberrations. Recently, we showed that Riz1 expression decreases in blast crisis and that re-expression of Riz1 inhibits IGF-1 expression. IGF-1 signaling is required in many stages of hematopoiesis and inappropriate activation of autocrine IGF-1 signaling may facilitate transformation to blast crisis. We observed that in 8 out of 11 matched CML patient biopsies the IGF-1 expression is elevated in blast crisis. We examined mechanisms used by CML blast crisis cell lines to activate IGF-1 expression. We found that Bcr-Abl activates autocrine IGF-1 signaling using Hck and Stat5b. Inhibition of these signaling components using small molecule drugs or shRNA decreases proliferation and enhances apoptosis. Together, our study suggests that aberrant IGF-1 signaling is an important event in blast crisis transformation and it provides a mechanism to explain the activity of IGF-1R and Hck inhibitors in blocking CML blast crisis phenotypes.","['Lakshmikuttyamma, A', 'Pastural, E', 'Takahashi, N', 'Sawada, K', 'Sheridan, D P', 'DeCoteau, J F', 'Geyer, C R']","['Lakshmikuttyamma A', 'Pastural E', 'Takahashi N', 'Sawada K', 'Sheridan DP', 'DeCoteau JF', 'Geyer CR']","['Genomic Medicine and Pathobiology Research Group, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080204,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc20088 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.8 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jun 19;27(27):3831-44. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.8.

In the patient group with lumbar puncture, subdurals were diagnosed earlier after HCT (median 25 days versus 5 months in the patient group without lumbar puncture) and were more often hygromas (37.5 versus 0%). These results support the suggestion of lumbar puncture or intrathecal therapy as a risk factor for subdurals.

However, wide application of this procedure is limited by availability of suitable human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched adult donors. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been increasingly used as an alternative HSC source for patients lacking matched-HSC donors. The clinical experience of using UCB transplantation to treat pediatric acute leukemias has already shown that higher-level HLA-mismatched UCB can be equally as good as or even better than matched HSC. Recently, large registries and multiple single institutional studies conclusively demonstrated that UCB is an acceptable source of HSCs for adult acute leukemia patients who lack HLA-matched donors. These studies will impact the future clinical allogeneic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is the most common acute leukemia in adults. UCB has unique advantages of easy procurement, absence of risk to donors, low risk of transmitting infections, immediate availability, greater tolerance of HLA disparity and lower-than-expected incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease. These features of UCB permit successful transplantation available to almost every patient who needs it. We anticipate that using UCB as a HSC source for allogeneic transplantation for adult AML will increase dramatically over the next 5 years, by expanding the available allogeneic donor pool. Clinical studies are needed with focus on disease-specific UCB transplantation outcomes, including AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and lymphoma.","['Tse, W W', 'Zang, S L', 'Bunting, K D', 'Laughlin, M J']","['Tse WW', 'Zang SL', 'Bunting KD', 'Laughlin MJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Abraham J. and Phyllis Katz Cord Blood Foundation, Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106-7284, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080204,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Banks', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Fetal Blood/physiology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705994 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705994 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Mar;41(5):465-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705994.

Thus, our studies show a previously unappreciated complexity of A20 substrate recognition and inactivation whereby TAX1BP1 and Itch function as essential subunits of an A20 ubiquitin-editing complex.","['Shembade, Noula', 'Harhaj, Nicole S', 'Parvatiyar, Kislay', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Matesic, Lydia E', 'Harhaj, Edward W']","['Shembade N', 'Harhaj NS', 'Parvatiyar K', 'Copeland NG', 'Jenkins NA', 'Matesic LE', 'Harhaj EW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080203,United States,Nat Immunol,Nature immunology,100941354,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TAX1BP1 protein, human)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (ITCH protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation/*immunology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*physiology']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/03/19 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2007/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['ni1563 [pii]', '10.1038/ni1563 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Immunol. 2008 Mar;9(3):254-62. doi: 10.1038/ni1563.

We analyzed the expression of FOXP3, a key molecule of regulatory T cells, in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and its association with clinicopathological features. Of 169 adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cases examined, 60 (36%) showed FOXP3 expression in lymphoma cells. Morphologically, 22 cases were classified as anaplastic large cell variant and 147 as pleomorphic cell variant. Only 1 (5%) of the anaplastic large cell variant cases and 59/147 (40%) of the pleomorphic cell variant cases expressed FOXP3. Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells were significantly more frequently found in FOXP3(+) cases (23/60; 38%) than in FOXP3(-) cases (12/109; 11%) (P<0.0001). Cytogenetic analysis showed that FOXP3(+) cases had simpler chromosomal abnormalities than FOXP3(-) cases. Clinically, FOXP3(+) and FOXP3(-) cases did not differ significantly in age distribution, clinical stage, lactate dehydrogenase and calcium in serum and overall survival. However, 8 of 34 FOXP3(+) cases suffered a severe infectious state, an indication of immunosuppression, while only 2 of 62 FOXP3(-) cases did so (P<0.005).

This group of drugs mediates cell death by damaging DNA and therefore, understandably, cellular DNA repair mechanisms can influence both their antitumour efficacy and their dose-limiting toxicities. SOURCES OF DATA: This review focuses on the mechanism of action of the DNA repair protein, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and its exploitation in cancer therapy and reviews the current literature. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: MGMT can provide resistance to alkylating agents by DNA damage reversal. Inhibition of tumour MGMT by pseudosubstrates to overcome tumour resistance is under clinical evaluation. In addition, MGMT overexpression in haematopoietic stem cells has been shown in animal models to protect normal cells against the myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy: this strategy has also entered clinical trials. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: MGMT inhibitors enhance the myelotoxic effect of O(6)-alkylating drugs and therefore reduce the maximum-tolerated dose of these agents. Retroviral vectors used for chemoprotective gene therapy are associated with insertional mutagenesis and leukaemia development. GROWING POINTS: The results of ongoing preclinical and clinical research involving various aspects of MGMT modulation should provide new prospects for the treatment of glioma, melanoma and other cancer types. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Tissue- and tumour-specific approaches to the modulation of MGMT together with other DNA repair functions and in combination with immuno- or radiotherapy are promising strategies to improve alkylating agent therapy.","['Verbeek, Barbara', 'Southgate, Thomas D', 'Gilham, David E', 'Margison, Geoffrey P']","['Verbeek B', 'Southgate TD', 'Gilham DE', 'Margison GP']","['Cancer Research UK Carcinogenesis Group, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4BX, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080201,England,Br Med Bull,British medical bulletin,0376542,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/10/25 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['ldm036 [pii]', '10.1093/bmb/ldm036 [doi]']",ppublish,Br Med Bull. 2008;85:17-33. doi: 10.1093/bmb/ldm036.

Noninvasive visualization of alpha4beta1 integrin in vivo will facilitate the understanding of its involvement in disease progression and development of targeted therapies. Due to the lack of high-affinity targeting ligands, molecular imaging of alpha4beta1 integrin is much less explored than that of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins. We have recently reported using the one bead-one compound combinatorial library method to identify a peptidomimetic, LLP2A, that preferentially binds to activated alpha4beta1 integrin. Here, we described the use of LLP2A-Cy5.5 conjugate as an in vivo optical imaging probe in a human lymphoma xenograft model. This univalent LLP2A-Cy5.5 conjugate retained the binding activity and specificity to alpha4beta1 integrin as shown by cell binding assays using alpha4beta1-positive Molt-4 T-leukemia cells. The subcutaneous Molt-4 tumor was clearly visualized from 1 to 24 h after tail vein injection of the conjugate. Direct imaging and confocal microscopic examination of excised tumors and organs confirmed the accumulation of LLP2A in tumors and revealed very little or no uptake in normal organs except for lymph nodes. Kidney uptake was high when the whole organ was scanned but it was negative when examined microscopically, suggesting that LLP2A bound to the renal tubules loosely. Tumor uptake of LLP2A-Cy5.5 conjugate was blocked by excess unlabeled LLP2A. This study showed that the combinatorial chemical library-derived peptidomimetic LLP2A can be easily developed into an optical imaging probe for noninvasively monitoring of activated alpha4beta1 integrin in vivo.","['Peng, Li', 'Liu, Ruiwu', 'Andrei, Mirela', 'Xiao, Wenwu', 'Lam, Kit S']","['Peng L', 'Liu R', 'Andrei M', 'Xiao W', 'Lam KS']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California Davis Cancer Center, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080201,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (CY5.5 cyanine dye)', '0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Peptide Library)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomimetics/methods', 'Carbocyanines', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*analysis/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Peptide Library', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tomography, Optical/*methods', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Whole Body Imaging/methods']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-07-0575 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0575 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 Feb;7(2):432-7. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0575.

Expression of BCR-ABL allows myeloid cells to grow in the absence of the growth factors interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL constitutively activates signaling pathways associated with Ras and its downstream effectors and with the Jak/STAT pathway. Additionally, we reported previously that BCR-ABL activates the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in a manner dependent on Ras and that inhibition of NF-kappaB by expression of a modified form of IkappaBalpha blocked BCR-ABL-driven tumor growth in a xenograft model. Here, we show that a highly specific inhibitor of IkappaB kinase beta, a key upstream regulator of the NF-kappaB pathway, induces growth suppression and death in cells expressing wild-type, Imatinib-resistant, or the T315I Imatinib/Dasatinib-resistant forms of BCR-ABL. Cell cycle variables were not affected by this compound. These data indicate that blockage of BCR-ABL-induced NF-kappaB activation via IkappaB kinase beta inhibition represents a potential new approach for treatment of Imatinib- or Dasatinib-resistant forms of chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Duncan, Elizabeth A', 'Goetz, Christine A', 'Stein, Sarah J', 'Mayo, Katie J', 'Skaggs, Brian J', 'Ziegelbauer, Karl', 'Sawyers, Charles L', 'Baldwin, Albert S']","['Duncan EA', 'Goetz CA', 'Stein SJ', 'Mayo KJ', 'Skaggs BJ', 'Ziegelbauer K', 'Sawyers CL', 'Baldwin AS']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7295, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080201,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-07-0305 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0305 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 Feb;7(2):391-7. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0305.

To investigate the role FLT3/ITD mutations play in the development of leukemia, we generated a FLT3/ITD knock-in mouse model by inserting an ITD mutation into the juxtamembrane domain of murine Flt3. FLT3wt/ITD mice developed myeloproliferative disease, characterized by splenomegaly, leukocytosis, and myeloid hypercellularity, which progressed to mortality by 6 to 20 months. Bone marrow (BM) and spleen from FLT3wt/ITD mice had an increased fraction of granulocytes/monocytes and dendritic cells, and a decreased fraction of B-lymphocytes. No sign of acute leukemia was observed over the lifetime of these mice. BM from FLT3wt/ITD mice showed enhanced potential to generate myeloid colonies in vitro. BM from FLT3wt/ITD mice also produced more spleen colonies in the in vivo colony-forming unit (CFU)-spleen assay. In the long-term competitive repopulation assay, BM cells from FLT3wt/ITD mice outgrew the wild-type competitor cells and showed increased myeloid and reduced lymphoid expansion activity. In summary, our data indicate that expression of FLT3/ITD mutations alone is capable of conferring normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) with enhanced myeloid expansion. It also appears to suppress B lymphoid maturation. Additional cooperative events appear to be required to progress to acute leukemia.","['Li, Li', 'Piloto, Obdulio', 'Nguyen, Ho Bao', 'Greenberg, Kathleen', 'Takamiya, Kogo', 'Racke, Frederick', 'Huso, David', 'Small, Donald']","['Li L', 'Piloto O', 'Nguyen HB', 'Greenberg K', 'Takamiya K', 'Racke F', 'Huso D', 'Small D']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080201,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Membrane/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', '*Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)43109-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-08-109942 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 1;111(7):3849-58. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-08-109942.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In primary AML cells from pediatric patients, VEGFA and VEGFC mRNA expression and in vitro cellular resistance to nine cytotoxic drugs were studied. As in vivo equivalents for in vitro drug resistance, in vivo AML blast reduction upon drug exposure, measured as blast cell reduction on day 15 in the bone marrow and as time in days from diagnosis to complete remission (CR) were used. RESULTS: Increased endogenous VEGFC levels significantly correlated with increased in vitro resistance for six typical AML drugs in primary AML cells from pediatric patients. Patients with >5% blasts on day 15 showed a 12.9-fold increase in the median VEGFC level compared with patients with < or =5% blasts (P = 0.002). Time to reach CR was studied using linear regression analysis with VEGFC, age at diagnosis, sex, treatment protocol, FAB type, cytogenetic risk profile, and WBC counts as variables. There was a significant positive independent association between VEGFC levels and time to CR (b = 6.02, SE = 1.58, P < or = 0.0001, n = 72). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest for the first time that higher endogenous VEGFC levels of AML cells are related to decreased in vitro and in vivo drug responsiveness.","['de Jonge, Hendrik J M', 'Weidenaar, Alida C', 'Ter Elst, Arja', 'Boezen, H Marike', 'Scherpen, Frank J G', 'Bouma-Ter Steege, Jessica C A', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Goemans, Bianca F', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Kamps, Willem A', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M']","['de Jonge HJ', 'Weidenaar AC', 'Ter Elst A', 'Boezen HM', 'Scherpen FJ', 'Bouma-Ter Steege JC', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Goemans BF', 'Creutzig U', 'Zimmermann M', 'Kamps WA', 'de Bont ES']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C/*genetics']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/3/924 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1821 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Feb 1;14(3):924-30. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1821.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, histone deacetylase inhibitors may induce the reexpression or repression of genes critical for normal hematopoiesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxicity, pharmacokinetic profile, and selected pharmacodynamic properties of the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Depsipeptide was administered to MDS or AML patients at a (solid tumor) phase I dose of 18 mg/m(2) i.v. on days 1 and 5 every 3 weeks. Toxicities and clinical activity were monitored and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were done. RESULTS: Twelve patients (nine with AML, three with MDS) received one to five cycles of depsipeptide. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were febrile neutropenia/infection (five patients), neutropenia/thrombocytopenia (nine patients), nausea (nine patients), and asymptomatic hypophosphatemia (three patients). No clinically significant cardiac toxicity was observed. The best response of 11 assessed patients was one complete remission in a patient with AML, stable disease in six patients, and progression of disease in four patients. Exploratory laboratory studies showed modest but rapid increases in apoptosis and changes in myeloid maturation marker expression. Histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels were evaluated in five patients; no consistent changes were observed. CONCLUSION: Depsipeptide therapy can be administered with acceptable short-term toxicity. However, gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue seem to be treatment-limiting after multiple cycles. Depsipeptide monotherapy has limited clinical activity in unselected AML/MDS patients.","['Klimek, Virginia M', 'Fircanis, Sophia', 'Maslak, Peter', 'Guernah, Ilhem', 'Baum, Michael', 'Wu, Nian', 'Panageas, Katherine', 'Wright, John J', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Klimek VM', 'Fircanis S', 'Maslak P', 'Guernah I', 'Baum M', 'Wu N', 'Panageas K', 'Wright JJ', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Nimer SD']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. klimekv@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aromatase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Aromatase/genetics', 'Depsipeptides/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/3/826 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0318 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Feb 1;14(3):826-32. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0318.,,,['P01 CA 05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no effective JAK2 inhibitors are currently available for clinical use. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the activity of (E)-3(6-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-cyano-N-(S0-1phenylethyl)acrylamide (WP1066), a novel analogue of the JAK2 inhibitor AG490, in JAK2 V617F-positive erythroleukemia HEL cells and in blood cells from patients with polycythemia vera. RESULTS: We found that WP1066 significantly inhibited JAK2 and its downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, signal transducer and activator of transcription-5, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 pathways in a dose- and time-dependent manner. As a result, WP1066 concentrations in the low micromolar range induced time- and dose-dependent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in HEL cells. As expected, WP1066 inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitors of patients with polycythemia vera carrying the JAK2 V617F mutation in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that WP1066 is active both in vitro and ex vivo and should be further developed for the treatment of neoplasms expressing the JAK2 V617F mutation.","['Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Harris, David', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Priebe, Waldemar', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Verstovsek S', 'Manshouri T', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Harris D', 'Cortes J', 'Giles FJ', 'Kantarjian H', 'Priebe W', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Multivariate analyses were used to examine the effect of pretreatment serum beta2M levels on clinical outcomes in patients with AML. beta2M was associated with poorer survival in older but not younger patients. We thus fit separate Cox survival models in patients above and below age 60 years treated with remission induction therapy containing high-dose cytarabine (n = 1,280). In each age group, 50% of the patients were used to develop the model, which was tested in the other 50%. Resampling methods were also used to validate the independent prognostic significance of covariates. RESULTS: In patients 60 years or older (n = 591), poorer risk cytogenetics; poorer performance status; and higher levels of beta2M, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase were each found to independently predict shorter survival and formed the basis of a scoring system. A similar approach was used in patients younger than 60 years (n = 589), with poorer risk cytogenetics, poorer performance status, older age, higher hemoglobin level, and higher leukocyte count predicting a shorter survival and forming the basis of the scoring system. Higher beta2M levels were an adverse independent factor for response, survival, relapse-free survival, and event-free survival in older but not in younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Serum beta2M levels can help predict outcome in patients > or =60 years with untreated AML, and their use is strongly encouraged.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia-Maria', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Wen, Sijin', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Wierda, William G', 'Koller, Charles', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Brandt, Mark', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Estey, Elihu H']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Wen S', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Wierda WG', 'Koller C', 'Pierce S', 'Brandt M', 'Freireich EJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Estey EH']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Their oncogenic pathways and prognostic variables are not clear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We undertook a retrospective study of 41 cytoplasmic CD3+ T-LBL (nine cases aged <16 years) by assessing stage of maturation arrest based on T cell receptor (TCR) immunogenotyping, immunohistochemistry, and quantification of the oncogenes thought to be important in immature T cell malignancies. RESULTS: Application of a TCR-based immunogenetic classification allowed the identification of three subcategories: 11 immature IM0/D-LBL showed no TCR or only incomplete TCRD DJ rearrangement and corresponded to cytoplasmic CD3+ precursors of uncertain lineage. Sixteen mature TCRD(del)-LBL showed biallelic TCRD deletion and both TCRG and TCRB rearrangement, consistent with TCRalphabeta lineage restriction. Fourteen intermediate LBL (Int-LBL) showed complete TCRD VDJ and TCRG VJ rearrangement, with TCRB VDJ rearrangement in the majority. All Int-LBL expressed HOX11/TLX1 or HOXA9 transcripts and a proportion of the latter were associated with CALM-AF10 or NUP214-ABL fusion transcripts. IM0/D-LBL were restricted to adults with extrathymic disease and bone marrow involvement, whereas Int-LBL and TCRD(del)-LBL were found in children and adults with predominantly thymic disease. In adults, the Int-LBL subgroup was associated with a significantly superior clinical outcome. This subgroup can be identified either by TCR immunogenotyping or HOXA9/TLX1 transcript quantification. CONCLUSION: Application of this molecular classification will allow the prospective evaluation of prognostic effects within pediatric and adult protocols.","['Baleydier, Frederic', 'Decouvelaere, Anne-Valerie', 'Bergeron, Julie', 'Gaulard, Philippe', 'Canioni, Danielle', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Petit, Barbara', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Beldjord, Kheira', 'Molina, Thierry', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth']","['Baleydier F', 'Decouvelaere AV', 'Bergeron J', 'Gaulard P', 'Canioni D', 'Bertrand Y', 'Lepretre S', 'Petit B', 'Dombret H', 'Beldjord K', 'Molina T', 'Asnafi V', 'Macintyre E']","['INSERM EMI0210, and Universite Paris V, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pleural Effusion/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/06/20 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/3/692 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1927 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Feb 1;14(3):692-700. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1927.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microarray analysis to identify transformation-impacting genes regulated by NF-kappaB's oncogenic v-Rel and c-Rel proteins uncovered that Rel protein expression leads to transcriptional repression of key B-cell receptor (BCR) components and signaling molecules like B-cell linker (BLNK), the B-cell adaptor for phosphoinositide 3-kinase (BCAP) and immunoglobulin lambda light chain (Ig lambda), and is accompanied by a block in BCR-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Akt, and c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase in response to anti-IgM. The BLNK and BCAP proteins were also down-regulated in lymphoid cells expressing a transformation-competent chimeric RelA/v-Rel protein, suggesting a correlation with the capacity of Rel proteins to transform lymphocytes. DNA-binding studies identified functional NF-kappaB-binding sites, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data showed binding of Rel to the endogenous blnk and bcap promoters in vivo. Importantly, restoration of either BLNK or BCAP expression strongly inhibited transformation of primary chicken lymphocytes by the potent NF-kappaB oncoprotein v-Rel. These findings are interesting because blnk and other BCR components and signaling molecules are down-regulated in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin's lymphomas, which depend on c-Rel for survival, and are consistent with the tumor suppressor function of BLNK. Overall, our results indicate that down-regulation of BLNK and BCAP is an important contributing factor to the malignant transformation of lymphocytes by Rel and suggest that gene repression may be as important as transcriptional activation for Rel's transforming activity.","['Gupta, Nupur', 'Delrow, Jeffrey', 'Drawid, Amar', 'Sengupta, Anirvan M', 'Fan, Gaofeng', 'Gelinas, Celine']","['Gupta N', 'Delrow J', 'Drawid A', 'Sengupta AM', 'Fan G', 'Gelinas C']","['Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-rel)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*immunology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Chickens', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins v-rel/genetics/*immunology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel/genetics/*immunology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/*immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/3/808 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-3169 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Feb 1;68(3):808-14. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-3169.,,PMC2267479,"['R01 HG003470-02/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA054999/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG003470/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'HG03470/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG003470-01A2/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA054999/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS40427'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of BCP-ALL cell extravasation is not fully understood. In the present study, we have investigated the major carrier of carbohydrate selectin ligands in the BCP-ALL cell line NALL-1 and its possible role in the extravascular infiltration of the leukemic cells. B-precursor ALL cell lines and clinical samples from patients with BCP-ALL essentially exhibited positive flow cytometric reactivity with E-selectin, and the reactivity was significantly diminished by O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase treatment in NALL-1 cells. B-precursor ALL cell lines adhered well to E-selectin but only very weakly to P-selectin with low-shear-force cell adhesion assay. Although BCP-ALL cell lines did not express the well-known core protein P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a major proportion of the carbohydrate selectin ligand was carried by a sialomucin, CD43, in NALL-1 cells. Most clinical samples from patients with BCP-ALL exhibited a PSGL-1(neg/low)/CD43(high) phenotype. NALL-1 cells rolled well on E-selectin, but knockdown of CD43 on NALL-1 cells resulted in reduced rolling activity on E-selectin. In addition, the CD43 knockdown NALL-1 cells showed decreased tissue engraftment compared with the control cells when introduced into gamma-irradiated immunodeficient mice. These results strongly suggest that CD43 but not PSGL-1 plays an important role in the extravascular infiltration of NALL-1 cells and that the degree of tissue engraftment of B-precursor ALL cells may be controlled by manipulating CD43 expression.","['Nonomura, Chizu', 'Kikuchi, Jiro', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Ozaki, Hidenori', 'Mitsunaga, Kanae', 'Ando, Hidenobu', 'Kanamori, Akiko', 'Kannagi, Reiji', 'Fujimoto, Junichiro', 'Muroi, Kazuo', 'Furukawa, Yusuke', 'Nakamura, Mitsuru']","['Nonomura C', 'Kikuchi J', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Ozaki H', 'Mitsunaga K', 'Ando H', 'Kanamori A', 'Kannagi R', 'Fujimoto J', 'Muroi K', 'Furukawa Y', 'Nakamura M']","['Cell Regulation Analysis Team, Research Center for Medical Glycoscience, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (P-selectin ligand protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialomucins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Down-Regulation', 'E-Selectin/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukosialin/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'P-Selectin/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Sialomucins/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/3/790 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1459 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Feb 1;68(3):790-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1459.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In untreated leukemic clam hemocytes, p53 is complexed throughout the cytoplasm with overexpressed variants for both clam homologues (full-length variant, 1,200-fold and truncated variant, 620-fold above normal clam hemocytes) of human mortalin, an Hsp70 family protein. In vitro treatment with etoposide only and in vivo treatment with either etoposide or mitoxantrone induces DNA damage, elevates expression (600-fold) and promotes nuclear translocation of p53, and results in apoptosis of leukemic clam hemocytes. Pretreatment with wheat germ agglutinin followed by etoposide treatment induces DNA damage and elevates p53 expression (893-fold) but does not overcome cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 or induce apoptosis. We show that leukemic clam hemocytes have an intact p53 pathway, and that maintenance of this tumor phenotype requires nuclear absence of p53, resulting from its localization in the cytoplasm of leukemic clam hemocytes. The effects of these topoisomerase II poisons may result as mortalin-based cytoplasmic tethering is overwhelmed by de novo expression of p53 protein after DNA damage induced by genotoxic stress. Soft shell clam leukemia provides excellent in vivo and in vitro models for developing genotoxic and nongenotoxic cancer therapies for reactivating p53 transcription in human and other animal cancers displaying mortalin-based cytoplasmic sequestration of the p53 tumor suppressor, such as colorectal cancers and primary and secondary glioblastomas, though not apparently leukemias or lymphomas.","['Bottger, Stefanie', 'Jerszyk, Emily', 'Low, Ben', 'Walker, Charles']","['Bottger S', 'Jerszyk E', 'Low B', 'Walker C']","['Department of Zoology, Center for Marine Biology and Marine Biomedical Research Group, University of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire 03824, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'Hemocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mya/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis/metabolism']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/3/777 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0968 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Feb 1;68(3):777-82. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0968.,,,"['CA104112-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71008-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We designed a retrospective study examining the experience with respiratory syncytial virus infection in pediatric patients with underlying malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients seen between 1997 and 2005. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from patient records, and independent predictors of disease severity were investigated. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients met the study criteria. Twenty-three patients (40%) had underlying diagnoses of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 11 (19%) had solid tumors, and 24 (41%) were hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, had acute myeloid leukemia, or had severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome. Seventeen patients (29%) were < 2 years of age. Overall, 16 patients (28%) developed lower respiratory tract infections. The frequency of lower respiratory tract infections was highest in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplants, acute myeloid leukemia, or severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (42%). Independent predictors of lower respiratory tract infections were profound lymphopenia, with absolute lymphocyte counts of < 100 cells per mm3, and age of < or = 2 years. Of all patients with lower respiratory tract infections, 31% died as a result of respiratory syncytial virus infection. The overall mortality rate was low (5 of 58 patients; 8.6%). All deaths occurred in patients with lower respiratory tract infections who were before or after hematopoietic stem cell transplants or were < 2 years of age and receiving treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. Neutropenia was not a predictor of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection or death. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified profound lymphopenia and young age as independent predictors of respiratory syncytial virus-related lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised children. No association between neutropenia and respiratory syncytial virus-related morbidity or death was found. These findings can guide interventions for respiratory syncytial virus infection in high risk hosts.","['El Saleeby, Chadi M', 'Somes, Grant W', 'DeVincenzo, John P', 'Gaur, Aditya H']","['El Saleeby CM', 'Somes GW', 'DeVincenzo JP', 'Gaur AH']","[""Department of Infectious Diseases, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N.

In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of action of resveratrol in imatinib-sensitive (IM-S) and -resistant (IM-R) CML cell lines. Resveratrol induced loss of viability and apoptosis in IM-S and IM-R in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Inhibition of cell viability was detected for concentrations of resveratrol as low as 5 microM, and the IC(50) values for viability, clonogenic assays, apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation were in the 10-25 microM range. The effect of imatinib and resveratrol was additive in IM-S but not in IM-R clones in which the resveratrol effect was already maximal. The effect of resveratrol on apoptosis was partially rescued by zVAD-fmk, suggesting a caspase-independent contribution. Resveratrol action was independent of BCR-ABL expression and phosphorylation, and in agreement was additive to BCR-ABL silencing. Finally, phytoalexin inhibited the growth of BaF3 cells expressing mutant BCR-ABL proteins found in resistant patients, including the multiresistant T315I mutation. Our findings show that resveratrol induces apoptosis, caspase-independent death, and differentiation that collectively contribute to the specific elimination of CML cells.

The information currently available about dendritic cells (DCs) in patients with different types of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) is limited and frequently controversial. In the present study, we analyzed the ex vivo distribution as well as the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood (PB) DCs from different types of MG. Methods. For this purpose, 61 untreated patients in total with MG were analyzed-MG of undetermined significance (MGUS), 29 cases; multiple myeloma (MM), 28 cases; and plasma cell leukemia (PCL), 4 cases-in comparison with a group of 10 healthy controls. Results. Our results show an absolute overall higher number of all subsets of PB DCs in PCL, together with lower numbers of myeloid DCs in MM patients. From a phenotypic point of view, PB DC subsets from all types of MG expressed significantly higher levels of HLA molecules and altered patterns of expression of the CD2, CD11c, CD16, CD22, CD62L, and CD86 molecules, in association with altered patterns of secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion. In summary, we show the existence of significant abnormalities in the distribution, phenotype, and pattern of secretion of inflammatory cytokines by different subsets of PB DCs from patients with MGs, which could reflect a potentially altered homing of DCs, together with a greater in vivo activation and lower responsiveness of PB DCs, which are already detectable in MGUS patients.","['Martin-Ayuso, Marta', 'Almeida, Julia', 'Perez-Andres, Martin', 'Cuello, Rebeca', 'Galende, Josefina', 'Gonzalez-Fraile, Maria Isabel', 'Martin-Nunez, Guillermo', 'Ortega, Fernando', 'Rodriguez, Maria Jesus', 'San Miguel, Jesus F', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Martin-Ayuso M', 'Almeida J', 'Perez-Andres M', 'Cuello R', 'Galende J', 'Gonzalez-Fraile MI', 'Martin-Nunez G', 'Ortega F', 'Rodriguez MJ', 'San Miguel JF', 'Orfao A']","['Servicio de Citometria & Departamento de Medicina, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Dendritic Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/blood/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/physiopathology', 'Paraproteinemias/blood/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Phenotype']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/04/17 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/1/82 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2007-0127 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2008 Jan;13(1):82-92. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2007-0127.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They can, however, have important consequences for individual susceptibility to disease and reactions to medical treatment. Also, genetics of the human phenotype variation could be understood by knowing the functions of these SNPs. Currently, a vast literature exists reporting possible associations between SNPs and diseases. It is still a major challenge to identify the functional SNPs in a disease related gene. In this work, we have analyzed the genetic variation that can alter the expression and the function in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by ABL1 gene through computational methods. Out of the total 827 SNPs, 18 were found to be non-synonymous (nsSNPs). Among the 30 SNPs in the untranslated region, 3 SNPs were found in 5' and 27 SNPs were found in 3' untranslated regions (UTR). It was found that 16.7% nsSNPs were found to be damaging by both SIFT and PolyPhen server. UTR resource tool suggested that 6 out of 27 SNPs in the 3' UTR region were functionally significant. The two major mutations that occurred in the native protein (1OPL) coded by ABL1 gene were at positions 159 (L-->P) and 178 (G-->S). Val (6), Ala (7) and Trp (344) were found to be stabilizing residues in the native protein (1OPL) coded by ABL1 gene. Even though all the three residues were found in the mutant protein 178 (G-->S), only two of them Val (6) and Ala (7) were acting as stabilizing residue in another mutant 159 (L-->P). We propose from the overall results obtained in this work that, both the mutations 159 (L-->P) and 178 (G-->S) should be considered important in the chronic myeloid leukemia caused by ABL1 gene. Our results on this computational study will find good application with the cancer biologist working on experimental protocols.","['George Priya Doss, C', 'Sudandiradoss, C', 'Rajasekaran, R', 'Purohit, Rituraj', 'Ramanathan, K', 'Sethumadhavan, Rao']","['George Priya Doss C', 'Sudandiradoss C', 'Rajasekaran R', 'Purohit R', 'Ramanathan K', 'Sethumadhavan R']","['School of Biotechnology, Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology University, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071231,United States,J Biomed Inform,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,['EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/09/24 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2007/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1532-0464(07)00150-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbi.2007.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Inform. 2008 Aug;41(4):607-12. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2007.12.004.

Most genes important for erythroid maturation are regulated by the Gata family of DNA-binding proteins. Previously, we identified three novel genes kelch-repeat containing protein (krcp), kiaa0650, and testhymin/glucocorticoid inducible transcript 1 (glcci1) to be expressed in erythroid cells in a Gata-independent manner, and we sought to further understand how these transcripts are regulated during zebrafish hematopoiesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed a loss-of-function approach, using combinations of antisense morpholinos to hematopoietic transcription factors and assayed for changes in gene expression in zebrafish embryos. RESULTS: Upon examination of embryos deficient for Gata1, Gata2, Biklf, and/or Scl, we found distinct gene combinations were required for expression of the novel genes. While krcp expression was dependent upon Gata1 and Biklf, kiaa0650 expression was greatly reduced and glcci1 was maintained in Gata1/Gata2/Biklf-deficient embryos. As with the gata1 gene, kiaa0650 and krcp required Scl for blood expression. Although reduced, glcci1 was expressed in posterior blood precursors in the absence of Scl and Gata2. CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies glcci1 as having Scl-independent expression in the posterior hematopoietic mesoderm, suggesting that its posterior expression is activated by factors upstream or parallel to Scl and Gata2. Additionally, these studies establish that blood gene expression programs are regulated by transcription factors acting in combination during erythroid maturation.","['Galloway, Jenna L', 'Wingert, Rebecca A', 'Thisse, Christine', 'Thisse, Bernard', 'Zon, Leonard I']","['Galloway JL', 'Wingert RA', 'Thisse C', 'Thisse B', 'Zon LI']","[""Stem Cell Program and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Mass., USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080204,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2a protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (P2RY14 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2Y)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (gata1a protein, zebrafish)', '0 (klf4 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Erythroid Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00691-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Apr;36(4):424-32. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.015.

Here, we show that CD84, a member of the CD150 family of leukocyte receptors, inhibits Fc epsilon RI-mediated mast cell degranulation in CD84-transfected rat basophilic leukaemia-2H3 mast cell line cells (RBL-2H3) through homophilic interaction. There was no reduction in overall protein phosphorylation following IgE triggering in CD84 RBL-2H3 cells. Indeed, phosphorylation of Dok-1 and c-Cbl increased in CD84 RBL-2H3, suggesting that inhibition is mediated by these molecules. MAP kinase phosphorylation (ERK1/2, JNK and p38) and cytokine synthesis were impaired in CD84 RBL-2H3. This inhibitory mechanism was independent of SAP and SHP-2 recruitment. Interestingly, CD84 mutants in tyrosines (Y279F and DeltaY324) reversed this inhibitory profile. These data suggest that CD84 may play a role in modulating Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling in mast cells. Thus, CD84 could play a protective role against undesired allergic and inflammatory responses.","['Oliver-Vila, Irene', 'Saborit-Villarroya, Ifigenia', 'Engel, Pablo', 'Martin, Margarita']","['Oliver-Vila I', 'Saborit-Villarroya I', 'Engel P', 'Martin M']","[""Grup Immunoreceptors, Institut d'Investigacio August Pi i Sunyer, Department de Biologia Cellular i Anatomia Patologica, Facultat Medicina, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080219,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD84 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (SH2D1A protein, human)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Associated Protein)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/chemistry/*immunology', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Degranulation/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/immunology', 'Mast Cells/immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Associated Protein', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/06/06 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2007/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-5890(07)00889-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2007.12.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2008 Apr;45(8):2138-49. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2007.12.006.

After 150 passages, double minute chromosomes (dmins) found in early-passaged cells are replaced by large extrachromosomal elements (LEEs). In a DNA library derived from a purified fraction of LEEs, 12.6% (23/183) of clones were assigned to 8q24 and 9.2% (17/183) were assigned to 14q11 in the human genome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a small aberrant chromosome, which had not been found in early-passaged cells, in addition to the purified LEEs. We determined that each LEE consisted of six discontinuous segments in a region that extended for 4.4Mb over the 8q24 locus. Five genes, namely, Myc (a proto-oncogene), NSMCE2 (for a SUMO ligase), CCDC26 (for a retinoic acid-dependent modulator of myeloid differentiation), TRIB1 (for a regulator of MAPK kinase) and LOC389637 (for a protein of unknown function), were encoded by the amplicon. Breaks in the chromosomal DNA within the amplicon were found in the NSMCE2 and CCDC26 genes. The discontinuous structure of the amplicon unit of the LEEs was identical with that of dmins in HL-60 early-passaged cells. The difference between them seemed, predominantly, to be the number (10-15 copies per LEE versus 2 or 3 copies per dmin) of constituent units. Expression of the Myc, NSMCE2, CCDC26 and LOC389637 and TRIB1 genes was constitutive in all lines of HL-60 cells and that of the first four genes was repressed during the terminal differentiation of early-passaged HL-60 cells. We also detected abnormal transcripts of CCDC26. Our results suggest that these genes were selected during the development of amplicons. They might be amplified and, sometimes, truncated to contribute to the maintenance of HL-60 cells in an undifferentiated state.","['Hirano, Tetsuo', 'Ike, Fumio', 'Murata, Takehide', 'Obata, Yuichi', 'Utiyama, Hiroyasu', 'Yokoyama, Kazunari K']","['Hirano T', 'Ike F', 'Murata T', 'Obata Y', 'Utiyama H', 'Yokoyama KK']","['Life Science Group, Graduate School of Integrated Arts and Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-7-1 Kagamiyama, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 739-8521, Japan. thirano@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071228,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,,IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', '*Extrachromosomal Inheritance', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Library', 'Genomic Instability', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Models, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Tagged Sites']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/05/30 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2007/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0027-5107(07)00431-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2007.12.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2008 Apr 2;640(1-2):97-106. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2007.12.008.

A more sensible approach to this sequence is the selection of the TKI best suited to overcome the resistance conferred by BCR-ABL1 mutations detected at each time-point.

This compound has been shown to induce apoptosis in several cell types either via activation of adenosine receptors or via intracellular metabolism. However, the molecular mechanisms of 2-CAdo-induced apoptosis are unclear. Here, we analyzed the effects of 2-CAdo in the leukemia cell line EHEB. 2-CAdo was found to induce apoptosis in EHEB cells, as shown by caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and phosphatidylserine exposure. Cytotoxicity of 2-CAdo was completely suppressed by 5-iodotubercidin, an adenosine kinase inhibitor, indicating that apoptosis induced by 2-CAdo was the result of its intracellular metabolism. Accordingly, we found that 2-CAdo was efficiently converted into 2-chloroATP. In parallel, a decrease of intracellular ATP concentration as well as a general inhibition of macromolecular synthesis, involving DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, was observed. Moreover, 2-CAdo induced cytochrome c release into the cytosol, indicating activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. This was found associated with a decline in Mcl-1 protein level and p53-independent. Inhibition of AMP deaminase by coformycin markedly prevented ATP depletion, and also significantly reduced 2-CAdo cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation. In conclusion, our data show that intracellular metabolism of 2-CAdo can lead to activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and that ATP depletion, in addition to the accumulation of the triphosphate analogue, contributes to 2-CAdo-induced apoptosis.","['Bastin-Coyette, Laurent', 'Smal, Caroline', 'Cardoen, Sabine', 'Saussoy, Pascale', 'Van den Neste, Eric', 'Bontemps, Francoise']","['Bastin-Coyette L', 'Smal C', 'Cardoen S', 'Saussoy P', 'Van den Neste E', 'Bontemps F']","['de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071227,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,['146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)'],IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2007/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(07)00820-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2007.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Apr 1;75(7):1451-60. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2007.12.007.

Non-thermal (low-intensity) biological effects have not been considered for regulation of microwave exposure, although numerous scientific reports indicate such effects. The BioInitiative Report is based on an international research and public policy initiative to give an overview of what is known of biological effects that occur at low-intensity electromagnetic fields (EMFs) exposure. Health endpoints reported to be associated with ELF and/or RF include childhood leukaemia, brain tumours, genotoxic effects, neurological effects and neurodegenerative diseases, immune system deregulation, allergic and inflammatory responses, breast cancer, miscarriage and some cardiovascular effects. The BioInitiative Report concluded that a reasonable suspicion of risk exists based on clear evidence of bioeffects at environmentally relevant levels, which, with prolonged exposures may reasonably be presumed to result in health impacts. Regarding ELF a new lower public safety limit for habitable space adjacent to all new or upgraded power lines and for all other new constructions should be applied. A new lower limit should also be used for existing habitable space for children and/or women who are pregnant. A precautionary limit should be adopted for outdoor, cumulative RF exposure and for cumulative indoor RF fields with considerably lower limits than existing guidelines, see the BioInitiative Report. The current guidelines for the US and European microwave exposure from mobile phones, for the brain are 1.6 W/Kg and 2 W/Kg, respectively. Since use of mobile phones is associated with an increased risk for brain tumour after 10 years, a new biologically based guideline is warranted.

To determine if altering RA metabolism affects embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, we disrupted both alleles of Cyp26a1 by homologous recombination. CYP26a1(-/-) ES cells had a 11.0+/-3.2-fold higher intracellular RA concentration than Wt ES cells after RA treatment for 48 h. RA-treated CYP26A1(-/-) ES cells exhibited 2-3 fold higher mRNA levels of Hoxa1, a primary RA target gene, than Wt ES cells. Despite increased intracellular RA levels, CYP26a1(-/-) ES cells were more resistant than Wt ES cells to RA-induced proliferation arrest. Transcripts for parietal endodermal differentiation markers, including laminin, J6(Hsp 47), and J31(SPARC, osteonectin) were expressed at lower levels in RA-treated CYP26a1(-/-) ES cells, indicating that the lack of CYP26A1 activity inhibits RA-associated differentiation. Microarray analyses revealed that RA-treated CYP26A1(-/-) ES cells exhibited lower mRNA levels than Wt ES cells for genes involved in differentiation, particularly in neural (Epha4, Pmp22, Nrp1, Gap43, Ndn) and smooth muscle differentiation (Madh3, Nrp1, Tagln Calponin, Caldesmon1). In contrast, genes involved in the stress response (e.g. Tlr2, Stk2, Fcgr2b, Bnip3, Pdk1) were expressed at higher levels in CYP26A1(-/-) than in Wt ES cells without RA. Collectively, our results show that CYP26A1 activity regulates intracellular RA levels, cell proliferation, transcriptional regulation of primary RA target genes, and ES cell differentiation to parietal endoderm.","['Langton, Simne', 'Gudas, Lorraine J']","['Langton S', 'Gudas LJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College, 1300 York Avenue, Rm.

Particularly, binding of the lectin from Griffonia (Bandeiraea) simplicifolia was specific to the glandular epithelium close to the luminal epithelium. Succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which has specificity for oligosaccharides recognized by WGA without sialic acid residues, showed weaker binding to the uterine luminal epithelium (LE) and the stroma than WGA, suggesting that terminal residues of glyco-conjugates on these tissues may be modified by sialic acids. Lectin binding to the glandular and luminal epithelium was not influenced by LIF. However, three lectins including a lectin from Dolichos biflorus showed specificity for stromal vessels 6h after LIF injection.

However, almost no suppressive effects could be detected in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes or mouse macrophage cell line RAW-264.7. RAE was also found to induce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in K-562 cells at 200microg/ml when incubated overnight. The increased ROS generation may cause apoptosis, which was observed in AnnexinV-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) staining of cells treated with RAE for 72h in K-562 cells. Moreover, RAE arrested cell cycle progression in G2/M phase in early and late period of exposure. The anti-cancer activity of RAE was also confirmed by increased NK cell cytotoxicity.

To date, the replication of these viruses has only been investigated during the chronic phase of the infection when they mainly spread through the clonal expansion of their host cells, vary through a somatic mutation process without evidence for reverse transcriptase (RT)-associated substitution. Primary infection of a new organism necessary involves allogenic cell infection and thus reverse transcription. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that the primary experimental bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection of sheep displays an early and intense burst of horizontal replicative dissemination of the virus generating frequent RT-associated substitutions that account for 69% of the in vivo BLV genetic variability during the first 8 months of the infection. During this period, evidence has been found of a cell-to-cell passage of a mutated sequence and of a sequence having undergone both RT-associated and somatic mutations. The detection of RT-dependent proviral substitution was restricted to a narrow window encompassing the first 250 days following seroconversion. CONCLUSION: In contrast to lentiviruses, deltaretroviruses display two time-dependent mechanisms of genetic variation that parallel their two-step nature of replication in vivo. We propose that the early and transient RT-based horizontal replication helps the virus escape the first wave of host immune response whereas somatic-dependent genetic variability during persistent clonal expansion helps infected clones escape the persistent and intense immune pressure that characterizes the chronic phase of deltaretrovirus infection.","['Pomier, Carole', 'Alcaraz, Maria T Sanchez', 'Debacq, Christophe', 'Lancon, Agnes', 'Kerkhofs, Pierre', 'Willems, Lucas', 'Wattel, Eric', 'Mortreux, Franck']","['Pomier C', 'Alcaraz MT', 'Debacq C', 'Lancon A', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Willems L', 'Wattel E', 'Mortreux F']","['CNRS FRE3011-Universite Claude Bernard, Oncovirologie et Biotherapies, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France. ptepoms@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080201,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*virology', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mutation', 'Proviruses/genetics', '*Reverse Transcription', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/*virology', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Replication']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-5-16 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-16 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2008 Feb 1;5:16. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-5-16.,,PMC2270868,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Achatinin-H, a lectin, has selective affinity towards terminal 9-O-acetylated sialic acids-alpha2-6-Nacetylated galactosamine. Exploring this affinity, enhanced expression of OAcSGP was observed, at the onset of disease, followed by its decrease with chemotherapy and reappearance with relapse. In spite of treatment, patients retain the diseased cells referred to as minimal residual disease (MRD) responsible for relapse. Our aim was to select a suitable template by using the differential expression of OAcSGP along with other known CD antigens to monitor MRD in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of Indian patients with B- or T-ALL during treatment and correlate it with the disease status. METHODS: A two-year longitudinal follow-up study was done with 109 patients from the onset of the disease till the end of chemotherapy, treated under MCP841protocol. Paired samples of PB (n = 1667) and BM (n = 999) were monitored by flow cytometry. Three templates selected for this investigation were OAcSGP+CD10+CD19+ or OAcSGP+CD34+CD19+ for B-ALL and OAcSGP+CD7+CD3+ for T-ALL. RESULTS: Using each template the level of MRD detection reached 0.01% for a patient in clinical remission (CR). 81.65% of the patients were in CR during these two years while the remaining relapsed. Failure in early clearance of lymphoblasts, as indicated by higher MRD, implied an elevated risk of relapse. Soaring MRD during the chemotherapeutic regimen predicted clinical relapse, at least a month before medical manifestation. Irrespective of B- or T-lineage ALL, the MRD in PB and BM correlated well. CONCLUSION: A range of MRD values can be predicted for the patients in CR, irrespective of their lineage, being 0.03 +/- 0.01% (PB) and 0.05 +/- 0.015% (BM). These patients may not be stated as normal with respect to the presence of MRD. Hence, MRD study beyond two-years follow-up is necessary to investigate further reduction in MRD, thereby ensuring their disease-free survival. Therefore, we suggest use of these templates for MRD detection, during and post-chemotherapy for proper patient management strategies, thereby helping in personalizing the treatment.","['Chowdhury, Suchandra', 'Bandyopadhyay, Suman', 'Mandal, Chandan', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Chowdhury S', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Mandal C', 'Chandra S', 'Mandal C']","['Immunobiology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4, Raja S, C, Mullick Road, Kolkata 700032, Kothari Medical Centre 8/3, Alipore Road, Kolkata 700027, India. suchandra_chowdhury@rediffmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080201,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2007/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-8-40 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-8-40 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2008 Feb 1;8:40. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-8-40.,,PMC2268943,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have retrospectively collected 679 ALLs with known ETV6/RUNX1 status, as ascertained by fluorescence in situ hybridization or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, treated according to the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology -ALL-1992 protocol. The assigned risk groups/treatment modalities for the 171 (25%) patients with t(12;21)-positive ALLs were 74 (43%) standard risk, 71 (42%) intermediate risk and 26 (15%) high risk.

Of all relapses after 6 years, 80% occurred in the t(12;21)-positive group. The overall survival was 94% at 5 years and 88% at 10 years; thus, the treatment of patients in second or later remission is usually successful.

We found that the extent of stimulation of her neutrophil functions by G-CSF and GM-CSF was greatly reduced compared to healthy donars neutrophils. We showed that CNL neutrophils have intact expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSFR). This suggests that failure of enhancement by G-CSF and GM-CSF in CNL neutrophil functions might be due to disturbances in the intracellular domains of G-CSFR and GM-CSFR, regardless of external cytokine stimulation. However, the patient's neutrophils did not show any mutations in the G-CSFR and GM-CSFR intracellular critical regions. We also showed that stat3 and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by G-CSF or GM-CSF in the patient's neutrophils were significantly lower than those in healthy donor neutrophils. These results suggest that deficiency of CNL neutrophil function might be due to insufficiency of some inflammatory cytokine-specific signaling. Hence, we are the first to show that CNL neutrophils have partially insufficiency in some cytokine-specific signaling. Further studies are needed to elucidate the signal transduction pathways relating to functional defects in CNL neutrophils.","['Uemura, Y', 'Taguchi, T', 'Kubota, T', 'Saito, T', 'Bandobashi, K', 'Yokoyama, A']","['Uemura Y', 'Taguchi T', 'Kubota T', 'Saito T', 'Bandobashi K', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kochi University of Medicine, Nankoku, Kochi, Japan. uemuray@kochi-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080130,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/physiology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2008/02/05 09:00,2009/03/14 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLH1000 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.01000.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2009 Feb;31(1):36-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.01000.x.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SAMPLE POPULATION: 41 cats with histologically confirmed low-grade lymphocytic lymphoma. PROCEDURES: Medical records and biopsy specimens of cats with histologically confirmed low-grade lymphocytic lymphoma of various organ systems treated with prednisone and chlorambucil between 1995 and 2005 were reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate remission duration and survival. Factors potentially associated with prognosis were compared. RESULTS: Common clinical signs were weight loss (83%), vomiting (73%), anorexia (66%), and diarrhea (58%). Seventy-eight percent of cats tested had low serum cobalamin concentrations. Lymphoma was confined to the gastrointestinal tract in 68% of cats. Fifty-six percent of cats achieved a complete response to treatment, and 39% achieved a partial response. Five percent of cats had no response. No association was found between any risk factors (including anatomic site) and response to treatment. Partial response was associated with shorter remission duration, compared with complete response; median remission duration was 428 days for cats achieving a partial response, compared with 897 days for cats achieving a complete response. No other factors were associated with remission duration. Overall median survival time was 704 days. No factors were significantly associated with survival time. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Most cats with lymphocytic lymphoma responded to treatment with prednisone and chlorambucil, and most factors evaluated were not associated with outcome.","['Kiselow, Michael A', 'Rassnick, Kenneth M', 'McDonough, Sean P', 'Goldstein, Richard E', 'Simpson, Kenneth W', 'Weinkle, Tristan K', 'Erb, Hollis N']","['Kiselow MA', 'Rassnick KM', 'McDonough SP', 'Goldstein RE', 'Simpson KW', 'Weinkle TK', 'Erb HN']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Cat Diseases/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Cats', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', '*Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/03/25 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/javma.232.3.405 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2008 Feb 1;232(3):405-10. doi: 10.2460/javma.232.3.405.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We analysed the effect of DSB on the assembly of HIV-1 Gag precursor (Pr55Gag(HIV)) into membrane-enveloped virus-like particles (VLP) in baculovirus-infected cells expressing Pr55Gag(HIV), in a cellular context devoid of viral PR. RESULTS: DSB showed a dose-dependent negative effect on VLP assembly, with an IC50 approximately 10 microM. The DSB inhibitory effect was p6-independent and was also observed for intracellular assembly of non-N-myristoylated Gag core-like particles. HIV-1 VLP assembled in the presence of DSB exhibited a lower stability of their inner cores upon membrane delipidation compared with control VLP, suggesting weaker Gag-Gag interactions. DSB also inhibited the assembly of simian immunodeficiency virus SLVmac251 VLP, although with a twofold lower efficacy (IC50 approximately 20 microM). No detectable inhibitory activity was observed for murine leukaemia virus (MLV) VLP; however, fusion of the SP1-NC-p6 domains from HIV-1 to the matrix (MA)-CA domains from MLV conferred DSB sensitivity to the chimaeric Gag precursor Pr72Gag(MLV-HIV) (IC50 = 30 microM). This observation suggested that the main DSB target on Pr55Gag was the SP1 domain, but the higher degree of DSB resistance for Pr72Gag(MLV-HIV) compared with Pr55Gag(HIV) implied that other upstream Gag region(s) might contribute to DSB reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Sequence alignment and three-dimensional modelling by homology of the CA-SP1-NC junction in HIV-1, SLVmac251 and Pr72Gag(MLV-HIV) suggested that a higher hydrophilic character of the CA region immediately upstream to the HIV-1 CA-SP1 junction, as occurred in Pr72Gag(MLV-HIV), correlated with a lower DSB sensitivity.","['DaFonseca, Sandrina', 'Blommaert, Armand', 'Coric, Pascale', 'Hong, Saw See', 'Bouaziz, Serge', 'Boulanger, Pierre']","['DaFonseca S', 'Blommaert A', 'Coric P', 'Hong SS', 'Bouaziz S', 'Boulanger P']","['Laboratoire de Virologie et Pathologie Humaine, Universite de Lyon I and CNRS FRE-3011, Faculte de Medecine Laennec, 69372 Lyon 08, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Antivir Ther,Antiviral therapy,9815705,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Succinates)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (p55 gag precursor protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', 'S125DW66N8 (bevirimat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology', 'Baculoviridae/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HIV-1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Precursors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Spodoptera', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Succinates/*pharmacology', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Virus Assembly/*drug effects']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/03/13 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Antivir Ther. 2007;12(8):1185-203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the overall cure-rate is high with conventional chemotherapy. However, selected patients with a high-risk of relapse are often treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in first remission (CR1). Patients with a bone-marrow relapse who attain a second remission frequently receive HSCT. High minimal residual disease (MRD) levels directly prior to HSCT determines the relapse risk. Therefore, MRD positive patients are eligible for more experimental approaches such as intensified or experimental chemotherapy pre-HSCT, as well as immune modulation post-HSCT. In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) the role of allo-HSCT in CR1 is declining, due to better outcome with modern multi-agent chemotherapy. In relapsed AML patients, allo-HSCT still seems indispensable. Targeted therapy may change the role of HSCT, in particular in chronic myeloid leukemia, where the role of allografting is changing in the imatinib era. In MDS, patients are usually transplanted immediately without prior cytoreduction. New developments in HSCT, such as the role of alternative conditioning regimens, and innovative stem cell sources such as peripheral blood and cord blood, will also be addressed.","['Bierings, Marc', 'Nachman, James B', 'Zwaan, C Michel']","['Bierings M', 'Nachman JB', 'Zwaan CM']","['Dept. of Pediatric Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*trends']",2008/02/05 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2008/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/157488807779317035 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2007 Jan;2(1):53-63. doi: 10.2174/157488807779317035.,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Thirteen patients received sevelamer during the study period. Their median age was 13 years (range 2.7-17.9) and eight were boys. Nine children had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, one had acute myeloid leukemia and 3 had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The most frequently used dose of sevelamer was 400 mg orally twice daily. The median duration of sevelamer therapy was 2 days (range 1-7). Two children were excluded from the efficacy analysis due to concurrent use of dialysis. Mean serum phosphate levels decreased after sevelamer administration, in eleven patients, from a baseline 2.2 mmol/L +/- 0.4 (95% CI, 1.7-3.1) to 1.1 mmol/L +/- 0.2 at hour 72 (95%CI, 0.6-1.5). The only toxicity attributed to sevelamer was mild vomiting in three patients. CONCLUSIONS: Sevelamer appears to be effective and tolerable for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia associated with tumor lysis syndrome.","['Abdullah, Shaker', 'Diezi, Manuel', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Dupuis, L Lee', 'Geary, Denis', 'Abla, Oussama']","['Abdullah S', 'Diezi M', 'Sung L', 'Dupuis LL', 'Geary D', 'Abla O']","['Divisions of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Calcium Phosphates)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Polyamines)', '97Z1WI3NDX (calcium phosphate)', '9YCX42I8IU (Sevelamer)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Calcium Phosphates/blood', 'Chelating Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperphosphatemia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Male', 'Phosphates/blood', 'Polyamines/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sevelamer', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*complications/drug therapy', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",2008/02/02 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/02/02 09:00'],"['2008/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21478 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jul;51(1):59-61. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21478.,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present work the loss of a vector's capacity to perform reverse transcription was studied as a possible explanation for the low stability of retroviral vectors from the production stage to the target cell gene transfer event. METHODS: Inactivation studies were performed with murine leukemia virus vectors at 37 degrees C and several residual activities were tested, including viral infectivity, reverse transcription capacity, reverse transcriptase (RT) activities and viral RNA stability. RESULTS: The results indicate a high correlation between loss of infectivity and the capacity of the virus to perform the initial steps of reverse transcription. To further understand the thermosensitivity of the reverse transcription process, the two enzyme activities of RT were investigated. The results indicate that, although the inactivation rate of the DNA polymerase is faster than that of RNase H, the decline of these two enzyme activities is significantly slower than that of reverse transcription. Also, viral RNA stability is not implicated in the loss of the virus capacity to perform reverse transcription as the rate of viral RNA degradation was very slow. Furthermore, it was observed that the amount of viral RNA that entered the cells decreased slowly due to viral inactivation at 37 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: The reverse transcription process is thermolabile and this sensitivity determines the rate of retroviral inactivation. Strategies targeting stabilization of the reverse transcription complex should be pursued to improve the applicability of retroviral vectors in gene therapy studies.","['Carmo, M', 'Panet, A', 'Carrondo, M J T', 'Alves, P M', 'Cruz, P E']","['Carmo M', 'Panet A', 'Carrondo MJ', 'Alves PM', 'Cruz PE']","['IBET/ITQB, Oeiras, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*physiology', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', '*Reverse Transcription', 'Ribonuclease H/genetics', '*Virus Inactivation']",2008/02/02 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/02/02 09:00'],"['2008/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.1163 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2008 Apr;10(4):383-91. doi: 10.1002/jgm.1163.,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, another two members, interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, together with ciliary neurotrophic factor were tested their roles in the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts derived from the adult human skeletal muscles, in order to confirm that these cytokines might be a new type of regulatory factors on the myoblasts. The results showed that the effects of interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor on the proliferation and differentiation of adult human myoblasts were different. Leukemia inhibitory factor in the dose of 10 ng/ml could accelerate the cell proliferation. Leukemia inhibitory factor in the dose of 10 or 50 ng/ml and ciliary neurotrophic factor in the dose of 10 or 50 ng/ml could inhibit the myoblast differentiation. The inhibition mechanism might be that leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor inhibited the expressions of transcription factor MyoD/myf5, which could regulate the myoblast differentiation.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the spectrum of CT findings in children with renal leukemic involvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve children were identified retrospectively as having renal leukemic involvement by contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen. Contrast-enhanced CT images through the kidneys of each patient were reviewed by two pediatric radiologists. Pertinent imaging findings and renal lengths were documented. The electronic medical record was accessed to obtain relevant clinical and pathologic information. RESULTS: Five patients with renal leukemic involvement presented with multiple bilateral low-attenuation masses, while three patients demonstrated large areas of wedge-shaped and geographic low attenuation. Four other patients presented with unique imaging findings, including a solitary unilateral low-attenuation mass, solitary bilateral low-attenuation masses, multiple bilateral low-attenuation masses including unilateral large conglomerate masses, and bilateral areas of ill-defined parenchymal low attenuation. Two patients showed unilateral nephromegaly, while eight other patients showed bilateral nephromegaly. Two patients had normal size kidneys. Two patients had elevated serum creatinine concentrations at the time of imaging. CONCLUSION: Renal leukemic involvement in children can present with a variety of CT imaging findings. Focal renal abnormalities as well as nephromegaly are frequently observed. Most commonly, renal leukemic involvement does not appear to impair renal function.","['Hilmes, Melissa A', 'Dillman, Jonathan R', 'Mody, Rajen J', 'Strouse, Peter J']","['Hilmes MA', 'Dillman JR', 'Mody RJ', 'Strouse PJ']","[""Section of Pediatric Radiology, University of Michigan Health System, C.S.

We have previously reported the interaction of C/EBPalpha with other proteins (utilizing mass spectrometry) in transcriptional regulation. In the present study, we characterized the association of the MYST domain histone acetyltransferase Tat-interactive protein (TIP) 60 (HTATIP) with C/EBPalpha. We show in pull-down and co-precipitation experiments that C/EBPalpha and HTATIP interact. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and a confirmatory Re-ChIP assay revealed in vivo occupancy of the C/EBPalpha and GCSF-R promoter by HTATIP. Reporter gene assays showed that HTATIP is a co-activator of C/EBPalpha. The co-activator function of HTATIP is dependent on its intact histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain and on the C/EBPalpha DNA-binding domain. The resulting balance between histone acetylation and deacetylation at the C/EBPalpha promoter might represent an important mechanism of C/EBPalpha action. We observed a lower expression of HTATIP mRNA in undifferentiated U937 cells compared to retinoic acid-induced differentiated U937 cells, and correlated expression of CEBPA and HTATIP mRNA levels were observed in leukemia samples. These findings point to a functional synergism between C/EBPalpha and HTATIP in myeloid differentiation and suggest that HTATIP might be an important player in leukemogenesis.","['Bararia, D', 'Trivedi, A K', 'Zada, A A Peer', 'Greif, P A', 'Mulaw, M A', 'Christopeit, M', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Bohlander, S K', 'Behre, G']","['Bararia D', 'Trivedi AK', 'Zada AA', 'Greif PA', 'Mulaw MA', 'Christopeit M', 'Hiddemann W', 'Bohlander SK', 'Behre G']","['Department of Medicine III, University of Munich and Clinical Cooperative Group, HelmholtzZentrum German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080131,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Lysine Acetyltransferase 5)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine Acetyltransferase 5', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proteomics/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2008/02/02 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/02/02 09:00'],"['2008/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405101 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405101 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Apr;22(4):800-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405101.

However, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) induce apoptosis primarily through the Bak/Mcl-1/Noxa and Bim pathways without decreasing Mcl-1. To investigate this discrepancy, we examined the role of Mcl-1 on HDACi-mediated apoptosis. Inhibition of either class I or class II HDAC by selective HDACi caused an upregulation of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein. Downregulation of Mcl-1 by three structurally unrelated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors potentiated HDACi-mediated apoptosis in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemic (CLL) cells and K562 cells. Sensitivity to HDACi-induced apoptosis was increased approximately 10-fold by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Nanomolar concentrations of HDACi, approximately 300-fold lower than that required to induce apoptosis alone, sensitized cells to TRAIL, emphasizing that the mechanism(s) whereby HDACi induce apoptosis is clearly distinct from those by which they sensitize to TRAIL. Furthermore, knockdown of Mcl-1-potentiated HDACi-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells. Thus, HDACi-mediated Mcl-1 upregulation plays an important antiapoptotic regulatory role in limiting the efficacy of HDACi-induced apoptosis, which can be overcome by combination with an agent that downregulates Mcl-1. Thus, a clinical trial in some cancers is warranted using a combination of an HDACi with agents that downregulate Mcl-1.","['Inoue, S', 'Walewska, R', 'Dyer, M J S', 'Cohen, G M']","['Inoue S', 'Walewska R', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080131,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/*genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2008/02/02 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/02/02 09:00'],"['2008/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu20081 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Apr;22(4):819-25. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.1.

To gain an understanding of the normal and pathologic roles of these transcriptional regulators, both gain- and loss-of-function mutations have been examined in the context of steady-state hematopoiesis. These studies have identified a remarkable number of genes whose loss-of-function phenotype includes a perturbation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation. As more of these models are generated and analyzed using commonly available tools, the regulatory pathways that control HSC quiescence and proliferation are becoming clearer. An emerging theme is that leukemia-associated transcriptional regulators coordinate the balance of proliferation and quiescence within the HSC pool by modulating the number and frequency of cells transiting the cell cycle. Uncoupling proliferation from differentiation by the aberrant generation of chimeric oncogenes that retain some, but not all of the attributes of the original transcription factor is likely to be an important step during leukemogenesis.","['Jude, Craig D', 'Gaudet, Justin J', 'Speck, Nancy A', 'Ernst, Patricia']","['Jude CD', 'Gaudet JJ', 'Speck NA', 'Ernst P']","['Department of Genetics, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20080101,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mutation/genetics']",2008/02/02 09:00,2008/04/25 09:00,['2008/02/02 09:00'],"['2008/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['5549 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.7.5.5549 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2008 Mar 1;7(5):586-91. doi: 10.4161/cc.7.5.5549.

The present study examined the effect of LIF on Ihh and Ihh-related factors in the uterine luminal epithelium during the implantation period using a DNA microarray. Expression of Ihh mRNA reached its peak on the forth day of pregnancy, and progesterone receptor (Pgr) mRNA decreased on the fifth day of pregnancy in wildtype mice. On the other hand, these changes in expression were not seen in LIF-/- mice. Ihh and Pgr mRNA were upregulated by LIF injection in delayed implantation mice. This up-regulation of Pgr was transient and preceded an increase of Ihh mRNA. Ihh mRNA also increased after E2 injection in delayed implantation mice of the LIF-/- genotype. E2 did not affect transcription of Pgr mRNA in the uterine luminal epithelium of delayed implantation LIF-/- mice. Using an antibody against the C-terminal epitope of Ihh, unprocessed Ihh proteins, but not C-terminal peptides, by autoproteolytic cleavage of Ihh were detected by western blot analysis. Unprocessed Ihh did not show quantitative changes between the wildtype and LIF-/- mice during the implantation period. Transcription of hedgehog acyltransferase was not influenced by LIF and E2 injection. In conclusion, LIF, which has a crucial role in E2 action for initiation of implantation, caused transient induction of Pgr mRNA and subsequent upregulation of Ihh mRNA, which mediates progesterone-Pgr actions for successful implantation.","['Wakitani, Shoichi', 'Hondo, Eiichi', 'Phichitraslip, Thanmaporn', 'Stewart, Colin Lawson', 'Kiso, Yasuo']","['Wakitani S', 'Hondo E', 'Phichitraslip T', 'Stewart CL', 'Kiso Y']","['Department of Veterinary Anatomy, Faculty of Agriculture, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080130,Japan,J Reprod Dev,The Journal of reproduction and development,9438792,"['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (ihh protein, mouse)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Estradiol/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genotype', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",2008/02/02 09:00,2008/07/10 09:00,['2008/02/02 09:00'],"['2008/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jrd/19120 [pii]', '10.1262/jrd.19120 [doi]']",ppublish,J Reprod Dev. 2008 Apr;54(2):113-6. doi: 10.1262/jrd.19120.

Active thyroid hormone T(3) affects expression of genes that encode for angiogenic proteins like adrenomedullin or vascular endothelial growth factor and erythropoietin, as well as for glucose transporters and phospho fructokinase that determine glucose use. Interestingly, those target genes are also hypoxia inducible and under the control of the oxygen-dependent transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1). We and others have reported that T(3) stimulates HIF-1 activation, which intimately links T(3) and HIF-1 induced gene expression. Here, we studied intracellular pathways that mediate HIF-1alpha regulation by T(3). We found that T(3)-dependent HIF-1 activation is not limited to hepatoma cells but is also observed in primary human hepatocytes, kidney and lung carcinoma cells. T(3) increased the HIF-1alpha subunit mRNA and protein within a few hours through activation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta retinoid X receptor alpha heterodimer because knockdown of each of the partners abrogated the stimulation by T(3). However, T(3) had no direct effect on transcription of HIF-1alpha, but activation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta/retinoid X receptor alpha heterodimer by T(3) stimulated expression of the hepatic leukemia factor, which increases HIF-1alpha gene expression.","['Otto, Teresa', 'Fandrey, Joachim']","['Otto T', 'Fandrey J']","['Institut fur Physiologie, Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, D-45122 Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080131,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptor alpha)', '0 (Thyroid Hormone Receptors beta)', '06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Retinoid X Receptor alpha/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thyroid Hormone Receptors beta/metabolism/*physiology', 'Triiodothyronine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/02/02 09:00,2008/06/11 09:00,['2008/02/02 09:00'],"['2008/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2007-1238 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2007-1238 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2008 May;149(5):2241-50. doi: 10.1210/en.2007-1238.

Although prior IPA is not a contraindication for subsequent allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), its management during granulocytopenia and immunosuppression remains challenging. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the absence of an evidence-based approach, 11 adolescents (11-18 years) with acute leukaemia and a history of antecedent possible (4) or probable (7) IPA received liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB; 1 mg/kg once a day) from the start of the conditioning regimen until engraftment and ability to take oral medication, followed by oral voriconazole (200 mg twice a day) until the end of the at-risk period. Nine patients had a good partial response (>50% reduction in pulmonary infiltrates) and two had a complete response prior to HSCT. RESULTS: The median duration of intravenous treatment with LAMB was 30 days (range, 19-36), followed by a median of 152 days (range, 19-210) of oral voriconazole. LAMB was discontinued early in one patient and voriconazole was transiently or permanently discontinued due to adverse events/new contraindications in two and two patients, respectively. At +180 days post-transplant, eight patients were alive, six with complete, and one each with near complete and ongoing resolution of pulmonary infiltrates; all but one were in continuing haematological remission. Three patients had succumbed either to recurrent leukaemia (two) or refractory graft failure (one); whereas one of these patients had maintained a complete response, two died with secondary possible (one) or probable (one) IPA. Both patients had discontinued voriconazole early and developed IPA in lung areas involved during the primary episode. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective paediatric series supports the notion that secondary antifungal prophylaxis for possible or probable IPA can be safely achieved in allogeneic HSCT. In the absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease, breakthrough infection appeared to be associated with recurrent leukaemia/graft failure and shorter duration of post-engraftment prophylaxis.","['Allinson, Katherine', 'Kolve, Hedwig', 'Gumbinger, Hans G', 'Vormoor, H Josef', 'Ehlert, Karoline', 'Groll, Andreas H']","['Allinson K', 'Kolve H', 'Gumbinger HG', 'Vormoor HJ', 'Ehlert K', 'Groll AH']","['Infectious Disease Research Program, Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, University Childrens Hospital Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080131,England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary/drug therapy/microbiology/surgery', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/02/02 09:00,2008/04/18 09:00,['2008/02/02 09:00'],"['2008/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['dkm521 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkm521 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2008 Mar;61(3):734-42. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkm521.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A population-based study was conducted. We quantified standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and cumulative incidence of second cancers among 23 639 individuals with initial diagnoses of NPC. RESULTS: We found a 24% increased risk of second cancers in NPC patients compared with the general population [SIR = 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.15-1.33]. Elevated SIRs were observed in the following second primary cancers: oral/pharyngeal, salivary gland, sarcoma, skin and leukemia/lymphoma. The cumulative incidence >10 years was 3.26%. The risk was higher in younger patients, especially those <40 years old. After diagnosis of second cancers, the median survival time was 1.7 years. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest population-based study to date from a high-incidence area. We found that NPC is associated with an increased risk of second malignancies, which had a negative impact on the survival of patients who survived NPC.","['Chen, M-C', 'Feng, I-J', 'Lu, C-H', 'Chen, C-C', 'Lin, J-T', 'Huang, S-H', 'Lee, K-D']","['Chen MC', 'Feng IJ', 'Lu CH', 'Chen CC', 'Lin JT', 'Huang SH', 'Lee KD']","['Department of Public Health and Biostatistics Consulting Center, School of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080130,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",2008/02/02 09:00,2008/07/22 09:00,['2008/02/02 09:00'],"['2008/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)41592-5 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdn003 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2008 Jun;19(6):1180-6. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdn003.

Results from the clone formation assay and flow cytometry indicated that the mixture of octadecenoic acids resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the number of tumour cells and significantly inhibited cell proliferation, with induced apoptosis and G(0)/G(1) phase cell cycle arrest. Also, the octadecenoic acids could not only cause cell apoptosis/necrosis but also functionally and structurally damage the tumour cell membrane and cell ultra-structures.

HL-37, a novel anthracene derivative, exhibited potent anti-cancer activity in both drug-sensitive (K562) and multidrug-resistant (K562/DOX) leukaemia cells. Mechanistically, we found that HL-37 was neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and could overcome apoptotic resistance via up-regulation of p53 protein and down-regulation of Bcl-xL protein. In addition, HL-37 also induced K562/DOX cell apoptosis and a decrease in G(0)/G(1) phase. Moreover, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and an increased expression of cleaved protein fragment of caspase-3, caspase-9 and caspase-8 were also observed.

The virally encoded Tax protein is thought to be necessary and sufficient for T-cell leukemogenesis. Tax promotes inappropriate cellular proliferation, represses multiple DNA repair mechanisms, deregulates cell cycle checkpoints, and induces genomic instability. All of these Tax effects are thought to cooperate in the development of ATLL. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that histone protein levels are reduced in HTLV-1 infected T-cell lines (HuT102, SLB-1 and C81) relative to uninfected T-cell lines (CEM, Jurkat and Molt4), while the relative amount of DNA per haploid complement is unaffected. In addition, we show that replication-dependent core and linker histone transcript levels are reduced in HTLV-1 infected T-cell lines. Furthermore, we show that Tax expression in Jurkat cells is sufficient for reduction of replication-dependent histone transcript levels. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that Tax disrupts the proper regulation of replication-dependent histone gene expression. Further, our findings suggest that HTLV-1 infection uncouples replication-dependent histone gene expression and DNA replication, allowing the depletion of histone proteins with cell division. Histone proteins are involved in the regulation of all metabolic processes involving DNA including transcription, replication, repair and recombination. This study provides a previously unidentified mechanism by which Tax may directly induce chromosomal instability and deregulate gene expression through reduced histone levels.","['Bogenberger, James M', 'Laybourn, Paul J']","['Bogenberger JM', 'Laybourn PJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. jimbog@simla.colostate.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080131,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Histones/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Transfection']",2008/02/02 09:00,2008/04/16 09:00,['2008/02/02 09:00'],"['2007/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-5-9 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-9 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2008 Jan 31;5:9. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-5-9.,,PMC2276518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age at diagnosis is 55 to 60 years with less than 10% of patients younger 20 years. Incidence of CML in children in the Czech Republic is 0.106 cases/100 thousands per year. Here we report outcome of 38 pediatric patients (median age 12.5 years; range 1.8 - 17.3) with Ph-positive CML diagnosed between years 1989 to 2006. Primarily chronic phase of the disease was diagnosed in 32 (84%) patients. 32 (84.2%) patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with the median age at transplantation of 14.9 years (range 6.9 - 20.5 years). Out of transplanted patients 16 (50%) obtained graft from unrelated donor, 13 (41%) from matched sibling donor, 2 from haploidentical family donor and autologous transplantation has been performed in one case. 6 patients were not transplanted, 4 of them died (median 1.2 years from diagnosis), 2 are alive 0.6 and 17.8 years from the diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) in 25 patients after HSCT at our department during the whole period is 66.7% with 15/16 being in stable continuous molecular-genetic remission (94%). During the period of time results of transplantations have been significantly improved (p=0.0071). OS after HSCT until year 1997 is 25% while from year 1998 until now is 87.5%. All centers OS of patients after HSCT is 71%. Results of HSCT in children with CML obtained from the year 1998 at our center are fully comparable with results achieved in large and experienced centers. HSCT remains the only proven and effective method for the treatment of CML.

Data on all eligible childhood leukemia deaths were obtained from the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Health. The control group consisted of children who died from causes other than neoplasms or diseases that were not associated with respiratory problems. The controls were pair matched to the cases by sex, year of birth, and year of death. Each matched control was selected randomly from the set of possible controls for each case. The proportion of a municipality's total population employed in the petrochemical industry in a municipality was used as an indicator of a resident's exposure to air emissions from the petrochemical industry. The subjects were divided into three levels (< or =25th percentile; 25th-75th percentile; > 75th percentile) according to the levels of the index just described. After controlling for possible confounders, results showed that children who lived in the group of municipalities characterized by the highest levels of petrochemical air pollution had a statistically significant higher risk of developing leukemia than the group that lived in municipalities with the lowest petrochemical air pollution levels. The results of this study shed important light on the relationship between the Taiwan petrochemical industry and human health risks.","['Weng, Hsu-Huei', 'Tsai, Shang-Shyue', 'Chiu, Hui-Fen', 'Wu, Trong-Neng', 'Yang, Chun-Yuh']","['Weng HH', 'Tsai SS', 'Chiu HF', 'Wu TN', 'Yang CY']","['Graduate Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, College of Health Science, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Inhal Toxicol,Inhalation toxicology,8910739,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Air Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Petroleum/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",2008/02/01 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2008/02/01 09:00'],"['2008/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['790161820 [pii]', '10.1080/08958370701758734 [doi]']",ppublish,Inhal Toxicol. 2008 Jan;20(1):31-6. doi: 10.1080/08958370701758734.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our studies in mouse models of human T-ALL/lymphoma shows that persistent activation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling is pro-oncogenic in vivo and can be efficiently targeted by well-characterized calcineurin inhibitors.

MLL is the human orthologue of Drosophila trithorax (trx)-the founding member of trithorax group proteins, Trx-G. Leukemogenic11q23 translocations fuse the common MLL N-terminal 1400aa in-frame with a wide variety of fusion partners that share no structural or functional homology. The 500 kD precursor MLL undergoes evolutionarily conserved site-specific cleavage mediated by Taspase1, generating the mature MLL(N320/C180) heterodimer which methylates histone H3 at lysine 4 with its carboxy-terminal SET domain. Extensive biochemical and genetic studies on MLL/trx have established its critical role in maintaining the expression of Hox/homeotic genes. By contrast, the involvement of MLL in many other essential cellular processes remains unclear. Recent reports including ours began to elucidate the intricate interplay between MLL and the cell cycle machinery, which ensures proper cell cycle phase transitions. Thus, this review will focus on this novel activity of MLL and discuss the implications of its deregulation in MLL leukemias.","['Liu, Han', 'Takeda, Shugaku', 'Cheng, Emily H-Y', 'Hsieh, James J-D']","['Liu H', 'Takeda S', 'Cheng EH', 'Hsieh JJ']","['Molecular Oncology, Department of Medicine, Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20071206,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (taspase1, human)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2008/02/01 09:00,2008/06/17 09:00,['2008/02/01 09:00'],"['2008/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['5426 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.7.4.5426 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2008 Feb 15;7(4):428-35. doi: 10.4161/cc.7.4.5426.

To facilitate using overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) as an endpoint for future phase II trials, we evaluated historical data from cooperative group phase II trials to attempt to develop benchmarks for OS and PFS as reference points for future phase II trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual-level and trial-level data were obtained for patients enrolled onto 42 phase II trials (70 trial arms) that completed accrual in the years 1975 through 2005 and conducted by Southwest Oncology Group, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, Cancer and Leukemia Group B, North Central Cancer Treatment Group, and the Clinical Trials Group of the National Cancer Institute of Canada. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic variables, and between-trial(-arm) variability in 1-year OS rates and 6-month PFS rates were examined. RESULTS: Statistically significant individual-level and trial-level prognostic factors found in a multivariate survival analysis for OS were performance status, presence of visceral disease, sex, and whether the trial excluded patients with brain metastases. Performance status, sex, and age were statistically significant prognostic factors for PFS. Controlling for these prognostic variables essentially eliminated between-trial variability in 1-year OS rates but not in 6-month PFS rates. CONCLUSION: Benchmarks are provided for 1-year OS or OS curves that make use of the distribution of prognostic factors of the patients in the phase II trial. A similar benchmark for 6-month PFS is provided, but its use is more problematic because of residual between-trial variation in this endpoint.","['Korn, Edward L', 'Liu, Ping-Yu', 'Lee, Sandra J', 'Chapman, Judith-Anne W', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Suman, Vera J', 'Moon, James', 'Sondak, Vernon K', 'Atkins, Michael B', 'Eisenhauer, Elizabeth A', 'Parulekar, Wendy', 'Markovic, Svetomir N', 'Saxman, Scott', 'Kirkwood, John M']","['Korn EL', 'Liu PY', 'Lee SJ', 'Chapman JA', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Suman VJ', 'Moon J', 'Sondak VK', 'Atkins MB', 'Eisenhauer EA', 'Parulekar W', 'Markovic SN', 'Saxman S', 'Kirkwood JM']","['Biometric Research Branch, EPN-8129, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. korne@ctep.nci.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Benchmarking', 'Brain Neoplasms/secondary', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic/methods/*standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*mortality/*secondary/*therapy', '*Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Research Design/statistics & numerical data', 'Sample Size', 'Skin Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",2008/02/01 09:00,2008/02/20 09:00,['2008/02/01 09:00'],"['2008/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/4/527 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.12.7837 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Feb 1;26(4):527-34. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.12.7837.,,,['UL1 TR000005/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2008 Feb 1;26(4):517-8.

In patients who fail imatinib therapy but have no detectable BCR-ABL kinase mutation, we detected persistently activated Lyn kinase. In imatinib-resistant CML cells and patients, Lyn activation is BCR-ABL independent, it is complexed with the Gab2 and c-Cbl adapter/scaffold proteins, and it mediates persistent Gab2 and BCR-ABL tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence or absence of imatinib. Lyn silencing or inhibition is necessary to suppress Gab2 and BCR-ABL phosphorylation and to recover imatinib activity. Lyn also negatively regulates c-Cbl stability, whereas c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by BCR-ABL. These results suggest that Lyn exists as a component of the BCR-ABL signaling complex and, in cells with high Lyn expression or activation, BCR-ABL kinase inhibition alone (imatinib) is not sufficient to fully disengage BCR-ABL-mediated signaling and suggests that BCR-ABL and Lyn kinase inhibition are needed to prevent or treat this form of imatinib resistance.","['Wu, Ji', 'Meng, Feng', 'Lu, Henry', 'Kong, Ling', 'Bornmann, William', 'Peng, Zhenghong', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Donato, Nicholas J']","['Wu J', 'Meng F', 'Lu H', 'Kong L', 'Bornmann W', 'Peng Z', 'Talpaz M', 'Donato NJ']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas, M.

However, the mechanisms contributing to their resistance are not completely understood, and it is still unclear whether antiapoptotic Bcl-2-related family proteins play a role in this resistance. In this study, we report that treatment of Fas-resistant melanoma cell lines with cycloheximide, a general inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis, sensitizes them to anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (mAb)-induced apoptosis. The cycloheximide-induced sensitization to Fas-induced apoptosis is associated with a rapid down-regulation of Mcl-1 protein levels, but not that of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Targeting Mcl-1 in these melanoma cell lines with specific small interfering RNA was sufficient to sensitize them to both anti-Fas mAb-induced apoptosis and activation of caspase-9. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Mcl-1 in a Fas-sensitive melanoma cell line rescues the cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis. Our results further show that the expression of Mcl-1 in melanoma cells is regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and not by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway. Inhibition of ERK signaling with the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase-1 inhibitor or by expressing a dominant negative form of mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase-1 also sensitizes resistant melanoma cells to anti-Fas mAb-induced apoptosis. Thus, our study identifies mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK/Mcl-1 as an important survival signaling pathway in the resistance of melanoma cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis and suggests that its targeting may contribute to the elimination of melanoma tumors by the immune system.","['Chetoui, Nizar', 'Sylla, Khaoussou', 'Gagnon-Houde, Jean-Vincent', 'Alcaide-Loridan, Catherine', 'Charron, Dominique', 'Al-Daccak, Reem', 'Aoudjit, Fawzi']","['Chetoui N', 'Sylla K', 'Gagnon-Houde JV', 'Alcaide-Loridan C', 'Charron D', 'Al-Daccak R', 'Aoudjit F']","['Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie et Immunologie, CHUQ Pavillon CHUL, Ste-Foy, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (U 0126)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/*genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Melanoma/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2008/02/01 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/02/01 09:00'],"['2008/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/1/42 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0080 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2008 Jan;6(1):42-52. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oxygen exposure may be an additional cause of brain injury in these infants. In this study, we investigated pathways of maturation-dependent oligodendrocyte (OL) death induced by hyperoxia in vitro and in vivo. Developing and mature OLs were subjected to 80% oxygen (0-24 h). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was used to assess cell viability. Furthermore, 3-, 6-, and 10-d-old rat pups were subjected to 80% oxygen (24 h), and their brains were processed for myelin basic protein staining. Significant cell death was detected after 6-24 h incubation in 80% oxygen in pre-OLs (O4+,O1-), but not in mature OLs (MBP+). Cell death was executed by a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway and could be blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. Overexpression of BCL2 (Homo sapiens B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2) significantly reduced apoptosis. Accumulation of superoxide and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected after 2 h of oxygen exposure. Lipoxygenase inhibitors 2,3,5-trimethyl-6-(12-hydroxy-5-10-dodecadiynyl-1,4-benzoquinone and N-benzyl-N-hydroxy-5-phenylpentamide fully protected the cells from oxidative injury. Overexpression of superoxide dismutase (SOD1) dramatically increased injury to pre-OLs but not to mature OLs. We extended these studies by testing the effects of hyperoxia on neonatal white matter. Postnatal day 3 (P3) and P6 rats, but not P10 pups, showed bilateral reduction in MBP (myelin basic protein) expression with 24 h exposure to 80% oxygen. Hyperoxia causes oxidative stress and triggers maturation-dependent apoptosis in pre-OLs, which involves the generation of ROS and caspase activation, and leads to white matter injury in the neonatal rat brain. These observations may be relevant to white matter injury observed in premature infants.","['Gerstner, Bettina', 'DeSilva, Tara M', 'Genz, Kerstin', 'Armstrong, Amy', 'Brehmer, Felix', 'Neve, Rachael L', 'Felderhoff-Mueser, Ursula', 'Volpe, Joseph J', 'Rosenberg, Paul A']","['Gerstner B', 'DeSilva TM', 'Genz K', 'Armstrong A', 'Brehmer F', 'Neve RL', 'Felderhoff-Mueser U', 'Volpe JJ', 'Rosenberg PA']","[""Department of Neurology and the F.

In this paper we compare NMF and PCA for dimension reduction. The reduced data is used for visualization, and clustering analysis via k-means on 11 real gene expression datasets. Before the clustering analysis, we apply NMF and PCA for reduction in visualization. The results on one leukemia dataset show that NMF can discover natural clusters and clearly detect one mislabeled sample while PCA cannot. For clustering analysis via k-means, NMF most typically outperforms PCA.

A secondary aim was to assess if a higher dose (10 mcg/kg/day) of G-CSF is more efficacious than the conventional dose (5 mcg/kg/day) in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Female patients with early-stage, node-positive invasive breast cancer were eligible for this multicenter, cooperative group feasibility trial that was designed as the pilot study for a larger randomized clinical trial. The protocol treatment comprised five cycles of dose-intensified AC (75 and 2000 mg/m(2)/cycle, respectively, intravenously every three weeks) with G-CSF support, followed by an additional four cycles of T (175 mg/m(2) by 3h intravenous infusion, every three weeks). Patients were randomized to receive one of two dose levels of G-CSF (5 vs. 10 mcg/kg/day) during AC chemotherapy. Data on both short-term toxicity and long-term survival were collected. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy two node-positive patients with operable primary breast cancer were accrued to this trial between February 1993 and April 1994. 130 of the 172 patients (76%) completed all protocol-specified therapy. Of the 42 early study withdrawals, 23 were due to unacceptable acute treatment-related toxicity. No differences in toxicities or clinical outcomes were noted between the two different dose levels of G-CSF support. At 6.8 years median follow-up, relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for all patients are 70% and 78%, respectively. Ten patients developed second malignancies during follow-up, including three cases with a hematologic malignancy (2% incidence). CONCLUSION: The delivery of dose-intensified AC followed by T was feasible in this large-scale pilot trial, although significant acute toxicities were commonly encountered. The data confirmed the acceptable tolerability of T after aggressive myelotoxic therapy in the adjuvant setting, leading to a larger randomized clinical trial comparing three dose levels of doxorubicin in AC with or without the addition of T (CALGB 9344). Supportive care using twice the conventional dose of G-CSF did not significantly improve the tolerability or change the toxicities of this regimen, and the occurrence of secondary malignancies is consistent with the emerging risk profile of dose-intensive regimens with growth factor support. With long-term follow-up, the clinical outcomes remain relatively favorable and correlate with such expected prognostic factors as the number of involved nodes and hormone receptor status.","['Liu, Minetta C', 'Demetri, George D', 'Berry, Donald A', 'Norton, Larry', 'Broadwater, Gloria', 'Robert, Nicholas J', 'Duggan, David', 'Hayes, Daniel F', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Lyss, Alan', 'Hopkins, Judith', 'Kaufman, Peter A', 'Marcom, P Kelly', 'Younger, Jerry', 'Lin, Nancy', 'Tkaczuk, Katherine', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Hudis, Clifford A']","['Liu MC', 'Demetri GD', 'Berry DA', 'Norton L', 'Broadwater G', 'Robert NJ', 'Duggan D', 'Hayes DF', 'Henderson IC', 'Lyss A', 'Hopkins J', 'Kaufman PA', 'Marcom PK', 'Younger J', 'Lin N', 'Tkaczuk K', 'Winer EP', 'Hudis CA']","['Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, 3800 Reservoir Road NW, Washington, DC 20007-2198, USA. liumc@georgetown.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080130,Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2008/02/01 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/02/01 09:00'],"['2007/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0305-7372(07)00185-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctrv.2007.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2008 May;34(3):223-30. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2007.11.004.

The role of NRP-1 in the growth and progression of leukemia is unknown. Here we studied the mRNA expression and effect of NRP-1 in leukemic cells. Our results showed that NRP-1 mRNA was expressed in six of seven leukemic cell lines and primary leukemias derived from all 24 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Reduced NRP-1 expression by RNA interference led to a decrease of VEGF-mediated mitogenic and migration responses in acute myeloid leukemic cell line HEL. Increased NRP-1 expression was directly correlated with the blast percentage in both peripheral blood and bone marrow of AML patients. Our data demonstrated that a higher level of NRP-1 mRNA was expressed in leukemias and NRP-1 promoted proliferation and chemotaxis of leukemic cells in response to VEGF.

The time and concentration dependence of HL60 and U937 cells was determined and showed that cell death was delayed. IC(50) values and IC(90) values determined on day 6 suggested that the sensitivity of AML cells to statins may occur at lower concentrations than previously reported. After 72 h, mevalonate did not rescue AML cells from cytotoxic concentrations of statins, suggesting that, although cell death was delayed, lovastatin induced lethal effects within 72 h.

CD56 expression intensity was determined by measurement of antigen molecules on the cell defined as Antibodies Bound per Cell (ABC) and calculation of Relative Fluorescence Intensity (RFI). CD56 expression was found in 66% of MM and 54% of PCL cases. The RFI values for individual MM patients ranged from 7.6 to 27.4 while ABC values on MM plasma cells from 2255 to 58469. There was a correlation between the proportion of all bone marrow CD38(++)/CD138(+) cells with CD56 expression and ABC and RFI indices. With regard to CD56 expression positive patients, the CD56(-) MM patients presented lower frequency of osteolysis (p = 0.01). The median survival was 48 months in CD56(+) patients and 43 months (p = 0.84) in CD56(-) cases. In conclusion, CD56 expression carries no distinct adverse prognosis and the lack of CD56 expression does not define a unique clinicopathological or prognostic entity in MM. A remarkable heterogeneity of CD56 expression intensity in CD56(+) patients imposes the necessity of determining CD56 expression intensity in candidates to antibody-based therapy.","['Kraj, Maria', 'Sokolowska, Urszula', 'Kopec-Szlezak, Joanna', 'Poglod, Ryszard', 'Kruk, Barbara', 'Wozniak, Jolanta', 'Szpila, Tomasz']","['Kraj M', 'Sokolowska U', 'Kopec-Szlezak J', 'Poglod R', 'Kruk B', 'Wozniak J', 'Szpila T']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland. mkraj@ihit.waw.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD56 Antigen/*analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Osteolysis', 'Plasma Cells/*chemistry/pathology', 'Survival Rate']",2008/01/31 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2008/01/31 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['790036838 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701760532 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Feb;49(2):298-305. doi: 10.1080/10428190701760532.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have addressed cumulative dose, dose intensity and exposure to specific agents of preceding cytotoxic therapy in relation to the risk of developing such leukemia. Since only a small percentage of patients exposed to cytotoxic therapy develop t-MDS/AML, it has been suggested that some genetic predisposition may be involved, specifically associated to polymorphisms in certain genes involved in chemotherapy/radiotherapy response - fundamentally genes intervening in drug detoxification and DNA synthesis and repair. A review is made of the genetic studies related to t-MDS/AML predisposition, focusing on the mechanistic findings of how specific chemotherapeutic drug exposure produces DNA damage and induces the chromosomal abnormalities characteristic of t-MDS/AML, the molecular pathways involved in repairing such drug induced damage, and the way in which they influence t-MDS/AML genesis. Specific issues are (a) the interaction of topoisomerase II inhibitors, alkylators and antimetabolite drugs with DNA repair mechanisms and their impact on t-MDS/AML leukemogenicity and (b) the influence of DNA polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA repair, drug metabolization and nucleotide synthesis, paying special attention to the relevance of folate metabolism.

In an effort to diminish this risk, several studies have assessed the utility of prophylactic antibiotics during the neutropenic period. While prophylactic antibiotics have been associated with a decrease in the incidence of fever and bacterial infection, no placebo-controlled randomized trial has found a decrease in mortality. In addition, delayed adverse consequences associated with prophylaxis have emerged including increases in both colonization and infection with antimicrobial-resistant and unusual pathogens like quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli. To determine who would benefit most from prophylaxis, the immediate benefits including reduction in fever and infection must be balanced with the potential for emergence of resistant pathogens in this population.","['Hammond, Sarah P', 'Baden, Lindsey R']","['Hammond SP', 'Baden LR']","[""Division of Infectious Diseases, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. shammond2@partners.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*therapy', 'Opportunistic Infections/*prevention & control', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/01/31 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2008/01/31 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['790039325 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701769673 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Feb;49(2):183-93. doi: 10.1080/10428190701769673.,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kinase inhibitor sorafenib induces growth arrest and apoptosis at much lower concentrations in AML cell lines that harbor FLT3-ITD mutations than in AML cell lines with wild-type FLT3. METHODS: The antileukemic activity of sorafenib was investigated in isogenic murine Ba/F3 AML cell lines that expressed mutant (ITD, D835G, and D835Y) or wild-type human FLT3, in primary human AML cells, and in a mouse leukemia xenograft model. Effects of sorafenib on apoptosis and signaling in AML cell lines were investigated by flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis, respectively, and the in vivo effects were determined by monitoring the survival of leukemia xenograft-bearing mice treated with sorafenib (groups of 15 mice). In a phase 1 clinical trial, 16 patients with refractory or relapsed AML were treated with sorafenib on different dose schedules. We determined their FLT3 mutation status by a polymerase chain reaction assay and analyzed clinical responses by standard criteria. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Sorafenib was 1000- to 3000-fold more effective in inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells with FLT3-ITD or D835G mutations than in Ba/F3 cells with FLT3-D835Y mutant or wild-type FLT3 and inhibited the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in ITD mutant but not wild-type FLT3 protein. In a mouse model, sorafenib decreased the leukemia burden and prolonged survival (median survival in the sorafenib-treated group vs the vehicle-treated group = 36.5 vs 16 days, difference = 20.5 days, 95% confidence interval = 20.3 to 21.3 days; P = .0018). Sorafenib reduced the percentage of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of AML patients with FLT3-ITD (median percentages before and after sorafenib: 81% vs 7.5% [P = .016] and 75.5% vs 34% [P = .05], respectively) but not in patients without this mutation. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib may have therapeutic efficacy in AML patients whose cells harbor FLT3-ITD mutations.","['Zhang, Weiguo', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Shi, Yue-xi', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Harris, David', 'Ling, Xiaoyang', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Small, Donald', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Zhang W', 'Konopleva M', 'Shi YX', 'McQueen T', 'Harris D', 'Ling X', 'Estrov Z', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Small D', 'Cortes J', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

RESULTS: We adapted a bifunctional rosette-based antibody cocktail for negative selection of B-cells for isolating CLL cells from peripheral blood (PB). PB samples from CLL patients were split into aliquots. One aliquot of each sample was enriched by density gradient centrifugation (DGC), while the other aliquot of each sample was incubated with an antibody cocktail for B-cell enrichment prior to DGC (RS+DGC). The purity of CLL cells after DGC averaged 74.1% (range: 15.9 - 97.4%). Using RS+DGC, the purity averaged 93.8% (range: 80.4 - 99.4%) with 23 of 29 (79%) samples showing CLL purities above 90%. RNA extracted from enriched CLL cells was of appropriately high quality for microarray analysis. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the use of a bifunctional rosette-based antibody cocktail as an effective method for the purification of CLL cells from peripheral blood.","['Essakali, Salim', 'Carney, Dennis', 'Westerman, David', 'Gambell, Peter', 'Seymour, John F', 'Dobrovic, Alexander']","['Essakali S', 'Carney D', 'Westerman D', 'Gambell P', 'Seymour JF', 'Dobrovic A']","['Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St Andrews Place, Melbourne, Victoria 3002, Australia. salim.essakali@qiagen.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080129,England,BMC Biotechnol,BMC biotechnology,101088663,['0 (Antibodies)'],IM,"['Antibodies/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*diagnosis']",2008/01/31 09:00,2008/04/01 09:00,['2008/01/31 09:00'],"['2007/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['1472-6750-8-6 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6750-8-6 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Biotechnol. 2008 Jan 29;8:6. doi: 10.1186/1472-6750-8-6.,,PMC2254389,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: During a 14-month study in 2 intensive care units, weekly environmental and twice-weekly patient surveillance cultures were obtained. VRE acquisition was defined as a positive culture result >48 h after admission. To determine risk factors for VRE acquisition, Cox proportional hazards models using time-dependent covariates for colonization pressure and antibiotic exposure were examined. RESULTS: Of 1330 intensive care unit admissions, 638 patients were at risk for acquisition, and 50 patients (8%) acquired VRE. Factors associated with VRE acquisition included average colonization pressure (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4 per 10% increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.8), mean number of antibiotics (HR, 1.7 per additional antibiotic; 95% CI, 1.2-2.5), leukemia (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2-7.8), a VRE-colonized prior room occupant (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.6-5.8), any VRE-colonized room occupants within the previous 2 weeks (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-4.8), and previous positive room culture results (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.2-9.6). In separate multivariable analyses, a VRE-colonized prior room occupant (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0-7.4), any VRE-colonized room occupants within the previous 2 weeks (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-5.3), and previous positive room culture results (HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.5-12.8) remained independent predictors of VRE acquisition, adjusted for colonization pressure and antibiotic exposure. CONCLUSIONS: We found that prior room contamination, whether measured via environmental cultures or prior room occupancy by VRE-colonized patients, was highly predictive of VRE acquisition. Increased attention to environmental disinfection is warranted.","['Drees, Marci', 'Snydman, David R', 'Schmid, Christopher H', 'Barefoot, Laurie', 'Hansjosten, Karen', 'Vue, Padade M', 'Cronin, Michael', 'Nasraway, Stanley A', 'Golan, Yoav']","['Drees M', 'Snydman DR', 'Schmid CH', 'Barefoot L', 'Hansjosten K', 'Vue PM', 'Cronin M', 'Nasraway SA', 'Golan Y']","['Tufts-New England Medical Center, Boston Massachusetts, USA. mdrees@christianacare.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology/*microbiology/*transmission', 'Enterococcus/*drug effects/isolation & purification', '*Environmental Microbiology', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Risk Factors', '*Vancomycin Resistance']",2008/01/31 09:00,2008/03/01 09:00,['2008/01/31 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1086/527394 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2008 Mar 1;46(5):678-85. doi: 10.1086/527394.,,,['5 T32 HS 000060-13/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States'],,,,,['Clin Infect Dis. 2008 Mar 1;46(5):686-8.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to document the efficacy and tolerance of corticosteroid therapy (CST) in patients with symptomatic CDC, including those who experienced fever and abdominal pain despite ongoing antifungal therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, multicenter study involving 10 pediatric and adult patients who experienced ongoing symptomatic CDC despite receipt of appropriate antifungal therapy for whom adjuvant oral CST was initiated. RESULTS: All cases of CDC were proven or probable, as determined on the basis of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Mycosis Study Group definition criteria, and occurred in patients with leukemia. CDC-attributable clinical symptoms resolved with CST, which was started a mean of 33.8 days after antifungal therapy had been initiated. Fever and abdominal pain disappeared a median of 4-5 days, and serum fibrinogen and C-reactive protein levels returned to normal values within 14-30 days. The median duration of hospitalization after CST initiation was 8.8 days. Hepatosplenic microabscesses decreased or disappeared within a mean period of 107 days (range, 30-210 days). No relapses of CDC were observed during a median duration of follow-up of 6.5 years (range, 4-9 years). CONCLUSIONS: In children and adults who experience persistently symptomatic CDC despite ongoing receipt of antifungal therapy, CST involving a prednisone equivalent at a dosage of > or =0.5 mg/kg per day for at least 3 weeks is associated with a prompt resolution of symptoms and of inflammatory response. These findings support the pathophysiological hypothesis that CDC belongs to the spectrum of fungus-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.","['Legrand, Faezeh', 'Lecuit, Marc', 'Dupont, Bertrand', 'Bellaton, Erianna', 'Huerre, Michel', 'Rohrlich, Pierre-Simon', 'Lortholary, Olivier']","['Legrand F', 'Lecuit M', 'Dupont B', 'Bellaton E', 'Huerre M', 'Rohrlich PS', 'Lortholary O']","[""Universite Paris-7, Service d'Hematologie-Pediatrique, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Abdominal Pain/microbiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Candidiasis/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/microbiology', 'Fibrinogen/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome/drug therapy/microbiology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Liver Abscess/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Time Factors']",2008/01/31 09:00,2008/03/01 09:00,['2008/01/31 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1086/527390 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2008 Mar 1;46(5):696-702. doi: 10.1086/527390.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined where cancer patient visits occurred (physicians' offices or hospital clinics), and whether anticancer therapy is administered or prescribed. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey (NAMCS/NHAMCS) data to characterize ambulatory cancer patient visits from 2001-2003. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with where a cancer patient went for care (office practice versus hospital clinic) and anticancer therapy received. RESULTS: Thirteen percent of patients visited hospital clinics, with the remainder visiting office-based settings. Younger cancer patients and those with Medicaid were more likely to visit hospital clinics compared to older and privately insured cancer patients. Cancer patients with <6 visits in the last year were less likely to be seen in the office setting. Patients with lung cancer, lymphoma/leukemia and melanoma were less likely to have anticancer therapy administered or prescribed compared to breast cancer patients. The uninsured were less likely to have anticancer administered or prescribed compared with the privately insured. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients with Medicaid were more likely to visit hospital clinics than privately insured patients. Treatment was associated with cancer type, not where care occurred and health insurance type, though there was a trend for the uninsured and those insured by Medicaid to be less likely to be administered or be prescribed anticancer therapy.","['Richardson, Lisa C', 'Tangka, Florence K']","['Richardson LC', 'Tangka FK']","['Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. lrichardson@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Natl Med Assoc,Journal of the National Medical Association,7503090,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Ambulatory Care', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', '*Insurance, Health', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*epidemiology/therapy', '*Office Visits', '*Outpatient Clinics, Hospital', ""*Physicians' Offices"", 'United States/epidemiology']",2008/01/31 09:00,2008/02/29 09:00,['2008/01/31 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Med Assoc. 2007 Dec;99(12):1350-8.,,PMC2575934,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In normal cells, methylation of CpG dinucleotides is extensively found across the genome. However, specific DNA regions known as the CpG islands, short CpG dinucleotide-rich stretches (500 bp - 2000bp), are commonly unmethylated. During tumorigenesis, on the other hand, global de-methylation and CpG island hypermethylation are widely observed. De novo hypermethylation at CpG dinucleotides is typically associated with loss of expression of flanking genes, thus it is believed to be an alternative to mutation and deletion in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. In this paper, we report that sequences flanking CpG sites can be used for predicting DNA methylation levels. DNA methylation levels were measured by utilizing a new high throughput sequencing technology (454) to sequence bisulfite treated DNA from four types of primary leukemia and lymphoma cells and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. After measuring methylation levels at each CpG site, we used 30 bp flanking sequences to characterize methylation susceptibility in terms of character compositions and built predictive models for DNA methylation susceptibility, achieving up to 75% prediction accuracy in 10-fold cross validation tests. Our study is first of its kind to build predictive models for methylation susceptibility by utilizing CpG site specific methylation levels.","['Kim, S', 'Li, M', 'Paik, H', 'Nephew, K', 'Shi, H', 'Kramer, R', 'Xu, D', 'Huang, T H']","['Kim S', 'Li M', 'Paik H', 'Nephew K', 'Shi H', 'Kramer R', 'Xu D', 'Huang TH']","['School of Informatics, 2 Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics, 3 Medical Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47408, USA. sunkim2@indiana.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pac Symp Biocomput,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

This case belongs to the group of 'early' erythroblastic leukaemias where a subset of progenitor cells present with erythroid-megakaryocyte bipotentiality or are blocked at an early BFU-E (burst-forming unit erythrocyte)-like stage of erythroid differentiation (11, 12, 13).","['Daniels, L', 'Guerti, K', 'Vermeulen, K', 'De Raeve, H', 'Van Assche, E', 'Van de Velde, A L', 'Berneman, Z N', 'Van Der Planken, M']","['Daniels L', 'Guerti K', 'Vermeulen K', 'De Raeve H', 'Van Assche E', 'Van de Velde AL', 'Berneman ZN', 'Van Der Planken M']","['Laboratory of Haematology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium. danielslies@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Acta Clin Belg,Acta clinica Belgica,0370306,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male']",2008/01/31 09:00,2008/02/29 09:00,['2008/01/31 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/acb.2007.047 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Clin Belg. 2007 Sep-Oct;62(5):308-14. doi: 10.1179/acb.2007.047.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The selective toxicity of hyperthermia toward malignant hematopoietic progenitors compared with normal bone marrow cells has been utilized in purging protocols. The underlying mechanism for this selective toxicity has remained unclear. By using normal and leukemic cell line models, we searched for molecular mechanisms underlying this selective toxicity. We found that the differential heat sensitivity could not be explained by differences in the expression or inducibility of Hsp and also not by the overall chaperone capacity of the cells. Despite an apparent similarity in initial heat-induced damage, the leukemic cells underwent heat-induced apoptosis more readily than normal hematopoietic cells. The differences in apoptosis initiation were found at or upstream of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Sensitivity to staurosporine-induced apoptosis was similar in all cell lines tested, indicating that the apoptotic pathways were equally functional. The higher sensitivity to heat-induced apoptosis correlated with the level of Bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, stable overexpression of Bcl-2 protected the most heat sensitive leukemic cells against heat-induced apoptosis. Our data indicate that leukemic cells have a specifically lower threshold for heat damage to initiate and execute apoptosis, which is due to an imbalance in the expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins in favor of the proapoptotic family members.","['Setroikromo, R', 'Wierenga, P K', 'van Waarde, M A W H', 'Brunsting, J F', 'Vellenga, E', 'Kampinga, H H']","['Setroikromo R', 'Wierenga PK', 'van Waarde MA', 'Brunsting JF', 'Vellenga E', 'Kampinga HH']","['Department of Cell Biology, Radiation and Stress Cell Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', '*Heat-Shock Response', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/enzymology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",2008/01/31 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2008/01/31 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1379/csc-279.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2007 Winter;12(4):320-30. doi: 10.1379/csc-279.1.,,PMC2134794,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen patients had abnormal karyotypes including eight complex abnormalities, various complications, and 7 of 21 had a poor performance status (PS) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 3-4. All patients completed induction therapy without severe adverse events. Seven achieved complete remission (CR), and two achieved partial remission (PR). Uni- and multivariate analyses demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between the results of therapy (CR +/- PR) and overall survival. The plasma concentrations of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) in some cases were higher than those previously reported, indicating the accumulation of ara-C with increasing numbers of days of SPAC administration.

In five out of nine cases, CD34+ cells were less sensitive to spontaneous apoptosis and had from 1.2- to 5.0-fold higher expression levels of Bcl-2 (eight of ten) and from 1.5- to 28.7-fold higher expression levels of MDR1 (eight of ten).

In all M4 cases, the expression levels of LRP were higher in the CD34- subpopulation. Significant differences in the patterns of genes expression between patients do not allow us to conclude that the CD34+ fractions have more resistant phenotype than the CD34- subpopulations.

We analyse the overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS) and prognostic factors in our 16 years experience of treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. METHODS: We performed univariate and multivariate analyses of the prognostic factors we considered most significant in our serie of patients. RESULTS: From January 1989 to December 2005, 50 cases of ALL were reported in 58 patients with LA. We analysed a subgroup of 41 patients with LLA as they were included in standard protocols. In this group the EFS was 78% and OS 87.8%. Inmunophenotype is a predictor of prognosis when we compare Common with Others, with a HR of 13.82 (CI95%: 1.019-166.008) p<0.05; Protocol of Treatment of the Paediatric Haematology Oncology Society (SHOP) (94-99/89) with HR of 0.065 (CI95%: 0.005-0.008) p<0.02; and Age (>120 months/12-120 months) with a HR of 13.82 (CI95%: 0.58-329.48) p=0.1.

Despite therapeutic regimens that lead to complete remission, the vast majority of patients undergo relapse. The molecular mechanisms underlying AML development and relapse remain incompletely defined. To explore whether loss of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) function is involved in AML, we screened two key MMR genes, MSH2 and MLH1, for mutations and promoter hypermethylation in leukemia specimens from 53 AML patients and blood from 17 non-cancer controls. We show here that whereas no amino acid alteration or promoter hypermethylation was detected in all control samples, 18 AML patients exhibited either mutations in MMR genes or hypermethylation in the MLH1 promoter. In vitro functional MMR analysis revealed that almost all the mutations analyzed resulted in loss of MMR function.

Adverse events observed during the X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency gene therapy trial revealed a significant risk of genotoxicity related to retrovirus vector integration and activation of adjacent proto-oncogenes, with several cases of T-cell leukemia linked to vector activation of the LMO2 gene. In patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), rhesus macaques, and mice receiving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with retrovirus vectors, a highly non-random pattern of vector integration has been reported. The most striking finding has been overrepresentation of integrations in one specific genomic locus, a complex containing the MDS1 and the EVI1 genes. Most evidence suggests that this overrepresentation is primarily due to a modification of primitive myeloid cell behavior by overexpression of EVI1 or MDS1-EVI1, as opposed to a specific predilection for integration at this site. Three different proteins can be produced from this complex locus: MDS1, MDS1-EVI1, and EVI1. This review will summarize current knowledge regarding this locus and its gene products, with specific focus on issues with relevance to gene therapy, leukemogenesis, and hematopoiesis. Insights into the mechanisms that result in altered hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis when this locus is dysregulated could improve the safety of gene therapy in the future.","['Metais, Jean-Yves', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E']","['Metais JY', 'Dunbar CE']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080129,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/adverse effects/*methods/trends', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(16)31415-0 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.mt.6300372 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2008 Mar;16(3):439-49. doi: 10.1038/sj.mt.6300372.

In order to test whether this system can be used for genetically modifying both PB T cells and umbilical cord blood (UCB) T cells as graft-versus-leukemia effector cells, an SB transposon was constructed to coexpress a single-chain chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) for human CD19 and CD20. PB and UCB were nucleofected with the transposon and a transposase plasmid, activated and then expanded in culture using anti-CD3/CD28 beads. Stable dual-gene expression was confirmed in both T-cell types, permitting enrichment by positive selection with Rituxan. The engineered CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells both exhibited specific cytotoxicity against CD19(+) leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, as well as against CD19 transfectants, and produced high-levels of antigen-dependent Th1 (but not Th2) cytokines. The in vivo adoptive transfer of genetically engineered T cells significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged the survival of the animal. Taken together, these data indicate that T cells from PB and UCB can be stably modified using a non-viral DNA transfer system, and that such modified T cells may be useful in the treatment of refractory leukemia and lymphoma.","['Huang, Xin', 'Guo, Hongfeng', 'Kang, Johnthomas', 'Choi, Suet', 'Zhou, Tom C', 'Tammana, Syam', 'Lees, Christopher J', 'Li, Zhong-Ze', 'Milone, Michael', 'Levine, Bruce L', 'Tolar, Jakub', 'June, Carl H', 'Scott McIvor, R', 'Wagner, John E', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Zhou, Xianzheng']","['Huang X', 'Guo H', 'Kang J', 'Choi S', 'Zhou TC', 'Tammana S', 'Lees CJ', 'Li ZZ', 'Milone M', 'Levine BL', 'Tolar J', 'June CH', 'Scott McIvor R', 'Wagner JE', 'Blazar BR', 'Zhou X']","['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080129,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Retroelements)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD19/*genetics', 'Antigens, CD20/genetics', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Models, Genetic', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Rituximab', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transfection/methods']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(16)31433-2 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.mt.6300404 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2008 Mar;16(3):580-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.mt.6300404.

There is a high sensitivity of combined DBA.44/TRAP-positivity (+) in confirming HCL. A previous study of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma showed DBA.44+ in 10%, TRAP+ in 29%, and DBA.44+/TRAP+ in 5%. OBJECTIVE: We now study nodal MZL (NMZL) and HC-V. DESIGN: Two HCL, 2 HC-V, 3 MZL of bone marrow (BM), 2 MZL versus B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (BCL, NOS) of BM, and 4 NMZL and 5 extranodal MZL (EMZL) were stained with DBA.44 and TRAP and reviewed for staining pattern/intensity. RESULTS: DBA.44 intensely stained all cells in 2/2 HCL, 1/2 HC-V, and 1 EMZL; intensely stained >20% of neoplastic cells (NCs) in 7 MZLs (1 BM, 3 NMZL, and 3 EMZL); and was negative/stained <10% of NCs in 1/2 HC-V, the remaining MZLs (2 BM, 1 NMZL, and 1 EMZL), and 2/2 MZL versus BCL, NOS-BM. TRAP intensely stained all cells in 2/2 HCL, the DBA.44+ HC-V, and 1 MZL versus BCL, NOS-BM; intensely stained >20% of NCs in 1 MZL versus BCL, NOS-BM, 1 MZL-BM, and 1 EMZL; and was negative in the remainder (1 HC-V, 2 MZL-BM, 1 MZL vs. BCL, NOS-BM, the 4 NMZL, 3 EMZL) in which it was able to be performed. There was combined DBA.44+/TRAP+ in 2/2 HCL, 1/2 HCV, 1/3 MZL-BM, and 1/5 EMZL. Only 1 case (MZL vs. BCL, NOS-BM) was TRAP+/DBA.44-. CONCLUSIONS: Although combined intense, diffuse TRAP+/DBA.44+ is highly sensitive for HCL, it is not entirely specific, and may be observed in HC-V and EMZL, further supporting a histogenetic relationship between these entities.","['Dunphy, Cherie H']",['Dunphy CH'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7525, USA. cdunphy@unch.unc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (ribosomal protein S19)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/*diagnosis', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*analysis', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PAI.0b013e3180471fd4 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2008 Mar;16(2):135-9. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0b013e3180471fd4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have partly unveiled DEK's cellular functions including apoptosis inhibition in primary cells as well as cancer cells, determination of 3' splice site of transcribed RNA, and suppression of transcription initiation by polymerase II. It has been previously shown that the N-terminal region of DEK, spanning residues 68-226, confers important in vitro and in vivo functions of DEK, which include double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) binding, introduction of constrained positive supercoils into closed dsDNA, and apoptosis inhibition. In this paper, we describe the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain of DEK (DEKntd) as determined using solution NMR. The C-terminal part of DEKntd, which contains a putative DNA-binding motif (SAF/SAP motif), folds into a helix-loop-helix structure. Interestingly, the N-terminal part of DEKntd shows a very similar structure to the C-terminal part, although the N-terminal and the C-terminal part differ distinctively in their amino acid sequences. As a consequence, the structure of DEKntd has a pseudo twofold plane symmetry. In addition, we tested dsDNA binding of DEKntd by monitoring changes of NMR chemical shifts upon addition of dsDNAs. We found that not only the C-terminal part containing the SAF/SAP motif but the N-terminal part is also involved in DEKntd's dsDNA binding. Our study illustrates a new structural variant and reveals novel dsDNA-binding properties for proteins containing the SAP/SAF motif.","['Devany, Matthew', 'Kappes, Ferdinand', 'Chen, Kuan-Ming', 'Markovitz, David M', 'Matsuo, Hiroshi']","['Devany M', 'Kappes F', 'Chen KM', 'Markovitz DM', 'Matsuo H']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['17/2/205 [pii]', '10.1110/ps.073244108 [doi]']",ppublish,Protein Sci. 2008 Feb;17(2):205-15. doi: 10.1110/ps.073244108.,,PMC2222715,,,,,,,,['PDB/2JX3'],,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of B cells and MM cells with the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) induces strong migration and activation of the Ras-like GTPase Ral. Inhibition of Ral, by expression of the dominant negative RalN28 mutant or of RalBPDeltaGAP, a Ral effector mutant that sequesters active Ral, results in impaired SDF-1-induced migration of B cells and MM cells. Of the 2 Ral isoforms, RalA and RalB, RalB was found to mediate SDF-1-induced migration. We have recently shown that Btk, PLCgamma2, and Lyn/Syk mediate SDF-1-controlled B-cell migration; however, SDF-1-induced Ral activation is not affected in B cells deficient in these proteins. In addition, treatment with pharmacological inhibitors against PI3K and PLC or expression of dominant-negative Ras did not impair SDF-1-induced Ral activation. Taken together, these results reveal a novel function for Ral, that is, regulation of SDF-1-induced migration of B cells and MM cells, thereby providing new insights into the control of B-cell homeostasis, trafficking, and function, as well as into the pathogenesis of MM.","['de Gorter, David J J', 'Reijmers, Rogier M', 'Beuling, Esther A', 'Naber, Hildegonda P H', 'Kuil, Annemieke', 'Kersten, Marie Jose', 'Pals, Steven T', 'Spaargaren, Marcel']","['de Gorter DJ', 'Reijmers RM', 'Beuling EA', 'Naber HP', 'Kuil A', 'Kersten MJ', 'Pals ST', 'Spaargaren M']","['Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080128,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Ralb protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (RALA protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ral GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement/drug effects/genetics', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chickens', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, Dominant/genetics', 'Homeostasis/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Syk Kinase', 'ral GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)43053-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-08-106583 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 1;111(7):3364-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-08-106583.

Targeting of c-Myb by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides has suggested that myeloid leukemia blasts (including chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML]-blast crisis cells) rely on c-Myb expression more than normal progenitors, but a genetic approach to assess the requirement of c-Myb by p210(BCR/ABL)-transformed hematopoietic progenitors has not been taken. We show here that loss of a c-Myb allele had modest effects (20%-28% decrease) on colony formation of nontransduced progenitors, while the effect on p210(BCR/ABL)-expressing Lin(-) Sca-1(+) and Lin(-) Sca-1(+)Kit(+) cells was more pronounced (50%-80% decrease). Using a model of CML-blast crisis, mice (n = 14) injected with p210(BCR/ABL)-transduced p53(-/-)c-Myb(w/w) marrow cells developed leukemia rapidly and had a median survival of 26 days, while only 67% of mice (n = 12) injected with p210(BCR/ABL)-transduced p53(-/-)c-Myb(w/d) marrow cells died of leukemia with a median survival of 96 days. p210(BCR/ABL)-transduced c-Myb(w/w) and c-Myb(w/d) marrow progenitors expressed similar levels of the c-Myb-regulated genes c-Myc and cyclin B1, while those of Bcl-2 were reduced.

However, all cases showed higher basal NF-kappaB than normal B cells. Subunit analysis revealed DNA binding of p50, Rel A, and c-Rel in primary CLL cells, and Rel A DNA binding was associated with in vitro survival (P = .01) with high white cell count (P = .01) and shorter lymphocyte doubling time (P = .01). NF-kappaB induction after in vitro stimulation with anti-IgM was associated with increased in vitro survival (P < .001) and expression of the signaling molecule ZAP-70 (P = .003). Prompted by these data, we evaluated the novel parthenolide analog, LC-1, in 54 CLL patient samples. LC-1 induced apoptosis in all the samples tested with a mean LD(50) of 2.8 microM after 24 hours; normal B and T cells were significantly more resistant to its apoptotic effects (P < .001). Apoptosis was preceded by a marked loss of NF-kappaB DNA binding and sensitivity to LC-1 correlated with basal Rel A DNA binding (P = .03, r(2) = 0.15). Furthermore, Rel A DNA binding was inversely correlated with sensitivity to fludarabine (P = .001, r(2) = 0.3), implicating Rel A in fludarabine resistance. Taken together, these data indicate that Rel A represents an excellent therapeutic target for this incurable disease.","['Hewamana, Saman', 'Alghazal, Suhair', 'Lin, Thet Thet', 'Clement, Matthew', 'Jenkins, Chris', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Neelakantan, Sundar', 'Crooks, Peter A', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Rowntree, Clare', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Pepper, Chris']","['Hewamana S', 'Alghazal S', 'Lin TT', 'Clement M', 'Jenkins C', 'Guzman ML', 'Jordan CT', 'Neelakantan S', 'Crooks PA', 'Burnett AK', 'Pratt G', 'Fegan C', 'Rowntree C', 'Brennan P', 'Pepper C']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080128,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factor RelA/analysis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41158-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-125278 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 May 1;111(9):4681-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-125278.

In this study, we report that the loss of Cbl-b selectively results in aberrant activation of NF-kappaB upon T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligation, which is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt and protein kinase C-theta (PKC-theta). TCR-induced hyperactivation of Akt in the absence of Cbl-b may potentiate the formation of caspase recruitment domain-containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein 1 (CARMA1)-B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10)-mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue 1(MALT1) (CBM) complex, which appears to be independent of PKC-theta. Cbl-b associates with PKC-theta upon TCR stimulation and regulates TCR-induced PKC-theta activation via Vav-1, which couples PKC-theta to PI3-K and allows it to be phosphorylated. PKC-theta then couples IkappaB kinases (IKKs) to the CBM complex, resulting in the activation of the IKK complex. Therefore, our data provide the first evidence to demonstrate that the down-regulation of TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation by Cbl-b is mediated coordinately by both Akt-dependent and PKC-theta-dependent signaling pathways in primary T cells.","['Qiao, Guilin', 'Li, Zhenping', 'Molinero, Luciana', 'Alegre, Maria-Luisa', 'Ying, Haiyan', 'Sun, Zuoming', 'Penninger, Josef M', 'Zhang, Jian']","['Qiao G', 'Li Z', 'Molinero L', 'Alegre ML', 'Ying H', 'Sun Z', 'Penninger JM', 'Zhang J']","['Section of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, 5841 S.

DCs transfected with hTERT-IL18 acquired stronger telomerase activity and were able to elicit an hTERT-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte CTL response in vitro. METHODS: hIL-18 gene fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and TA cloned. The hIL-18 gene was then subcloned into eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) containing human TERT via a linker. The sequence of gene fusion was confirmed using both restrictive enzyme digestion and DNA sequencer. The expression vector with gene fusion was transfected into 3T3 cell line with Lipofectamine 2000. ELISA, Western blot, immunofluorescence stain were performed to determine the expression properties of hTERT-hIL18 in 3T3 cells. Its biological effect on the anti-apoptosis was measured by Flow cytometry and its effect on INF-gamma expression was determined using ELISA. After preparation of dendritic cells, hTERT-hIL18, hTERT, hIL-18 expression vectors were transfected into DCs respectively by electroporation to generate hTERT-specific DCs lines. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs were stimulated with different DCs lines to create specific CTL. The response of target cell (leukemia cell line-K562 cell) to hTERT-specific CTL was evaluated by LDH release assay. RESULTS: The human IL-18 gene fragment was amplified from the human mononuclear cells and was inserted into pcDNA3.1(+)/hTERT vector successfully. The correct sequence was proved by both restrictive enzyme digestion and sequencing. The correct open reading frame was also verified. Fusion protein of hTERT-hIL18 was effectively expressed in eukaryotic cells, which was detected by both Western-blotting and immunofluorescence stain. The expressed recombinant fusion protein induced similar levels of INF-gamma to that of native IL-18 protein. FCM assay showed that the transfected fusion protein inhibited the apoptosis, which was consistent with the effects of hTERT as a universal tumor associated antigen. CTL assay shows that hTERT- hIL18 and hTERT gene-transfected DCs stimulated T-cell responses that recognized and lysed tumor target cells of high hTERT expression, whereas DCs transfected with hIL-18 gene didn't induced the response of tumor targets lyses. CONCLUSION: The Recombinant hTERT- hIL18 fusion protein had both biological activity of hTERT and hIL-18, indicating that this rationally designed protein can be further developed as novel tumor therapeutics. DCs transfected with hTERT-IL18 gene were capable of eliciting a stronger hTERT-specific CTL response in vitro.","['Tong, X M', 'Zheng, S E', 'Bader, A', 'Yao, H P', 'Wu, N P', 'Altmeyer, P', 'Brockmeyer, N H', 'Jin, Jie']","['Tong XM', 'Zheng SE', 'Bader A', 'Yao HP', 'Wu NP', 'Altmeyer P', 'Brockmeyer NH', 'Jin J']","['The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Qinchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cancer Vaccines/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-18/*genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/04/25 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Med Res. 2008 Jan 23;13(1):7-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viral recognition determinants in intrinsic immunity genes are expected to evolve rapidly as host genes adapt to changing viruses, resulting in a signature of adaptive evolution. Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) from rats was discovered to be an intrinsic immunity gene that can restrict murine leukemia virus, and certain alphaviruses and filoviruses. Here, we used an approach combining molecular evolution and cellular infectivity assays to address whether ZAP also acts as a restriction factor in primates, and to pinpoint which protein domains may directly interact with the virus. We find that ZAP has evolved under positive selection throughout primate evolution. Recurrent positive selection is only found in the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-like domain present in a longer human ZAP isoform. This PARP-like domain was not present in the previously identified and tested rat ZAP gene. Using infectivity assays, we found that the longer isoform of ZAP that contains the PARP-like domain is a stronger suppressor of murine leukemia virus expression and Semliki forest virus infection. Our study thus finds that human ZAP encodes a potent antiviral activity against alphaviruses. The striking congruence between our evolutionary predictions and cellular infectivity assays strongly validates such a combined approach to study intrinsic immunity genes.","['Kerns, Julie A', 'Emerman, Michael', 'Malik, Harmit S']","['Kerns JA', 'Emerman M', 'Malik HS']","['Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ZC3HAV1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Alphavirus Infections/virology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Primates', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Rats', '*Selection, Genetic', 'Semliki forest virus', 'Species Specificity']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/03/25 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['07-PLGE-RA-0915 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pgen.0040021 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2008 Jan;4(1):e21. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.0040021.,,PMC2213710,"['T32 CA009229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA09229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI30937/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Competing interests.

Action of the Franco-African childhood cancer group].,497-504,,"The childhood cancer survival rate is currently 75% in industrialized countries. Rates in developing countries are much lower. The Franco-African Childhood Cancer Group (French acronym, GFAOP) was founded in 2000 with aim of reducing this unfavorable situation in Africa. The GFAOP has developed two forms of action. The main form consists of organizing two- to twelve-month training sessions for physicians and nurses in France and Morocco. The other form involves assessing the feasibility of modern treatment protocols for various cancers in Africa. The first feasibility trials were carried out on nephroblastoma and Burkitt's lymphoma in 12 pilot units in North Africa, West Africa, and Madagascar. In the first study from 2001 to 2005 we treated 306 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma using French LMB protocols adapted to the African setting and achieved a survival rate of 61%. A second study started in 2005 using Endoxan alone achieved a highly satisfactory survival rate of 73% for neuroblastoma in all stages except bilateral. Altogether from 2001 to 2007 more than 1000 cases of nephroblastoma and Burkitt's lymphoma were treated in African hospitals by African doctors and nurses. No patients were transferred to Europe. The GFAOP supplied drugs when necessary and took care of most travel expenses. African and French doctors worked together on protocol design, trial management, and data analysis. These promising results show that the latest therapeutic techniques can be used to treat childhood cancer in Africa by adapting the protocol to conditions in developing countries. Sanofi-Aventis Laboratories in association with the International Union against Cancer has launched a major campaign to improve Pediatric Oncology in developing countries. Projects in four GFAOP units are being financed through this campaign. In 2006 the GFAOP began assessment of two new treatment protocols, i.e., one for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the other for Hodgkin's disease. Two other projects are being planned, i.e., one for treatment of retinoblastoma and the other for treatment of some types of brain tumors.","['Lemerle, J', 'Barsaoui, S', 'Harif, M', 'Hireche, K', 'Ladjadj, Y', 'Moreira, C', 'Andoh, J', 'Doumbe, P', 'Togo, B', 'Kam, L', 'Rafaramino, F', 'Patte, C', 'Tournade, M F', 'Raphael, M', 'Boccon-Gibod, L', 'Mallon, B', 'Raquin, M A', 'Msefer Alaoui, F']","['Lemerle J', 'Barsaoui S', 'Harif M', 'Hireche K', 'Ladjadj Y', 'Moreira C', 'Andoh J', 'Doumbe P', 'Togo B', 'Kam L', 'Rafaramino F', 'Patte C', 'Tournade MF', 'Raphael M', 'Boccon-Gibod L', 'Mallon B', 'Raquin MA', 'Msefer Alaoui F']","['GFAOP, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France. lemerle@igr.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Med Trop (Mars),Medecine tropicale : revue du Corps de sante colonial,8710146,,IM,"['Africa', 'Child', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Developing Countries', 'France', 'Humans', '*International Cooperation', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/03/29 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Trop (Mars). 2007 Oct;67(5):497-504.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Le traitement des cancers de l'enfant en Afrique.

METHODS: Multiple human leukemia cell lines were evaluated for mRNA expression of an immunomodulatory protein called the progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF) that suppresses natural killer (NK) cell activity during normal pregnancy. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of progesterone (P) and mifepristone in PIBF protein expression. Finally, the effect of mifepristone treatment of mice with advanced leukemia was evaluated. RESULTS: All tumor cell lines evaluated were found to express mRNA for PIBF and some were found to even express the PIBF protein. The addition of P to the media increased the expression of PIBF and mifepristone downregulated its expression. Treatment of mice with spontaneous leukemia when they already had extensive disease seemed to increase the length and quality of their life. CONCLUSIONS: These data and other experience with mice with lung cancer and some anecdotal human cancer experience suggest that various cancers may utilize similar mechanisms used by the fetus to escape NK cell surveillance. Mifepristone and other progesterone receptor antagonists may deserve a clinical trial in human cancer even where there is no knowledge of the presence of progesterone receptors.","['Check, J H', 'Sansoucie, L', 'Chern, J', 'Amadi, N', 'Srivastava, M', 'Larece, K']","['Check JH', 'Sansoucie L', 'Chern J', 'Amadi N', 'Srivastava M', 'Larece K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Singapore,Clin Exp Obstet Gynecol,Clinical and experimental obstetrics & gynecology,7802110,"['0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '0 (PIBF1 protein, human)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hormone Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mifepristone/*pharmacology', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Progesterone/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'Receptors, Progesterone/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Suppressor Factors, Immunologic']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Obstet Gynecol. 2007;34(4):207-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Within the observation period, the susceptibility of the B-CLL cells towards the apoptosis-inducing potential of the VA-E significantly decreased. This effect could be due to the presence of physiologically-induced anti-mistletoe lectin antibodies which may block the effects of cytotoxic mistletoe lectins. No significant induction of Ki-67 was observed, but an increase of non-specific binding, even in untreated medium controls, did occur within the last months.

These data suggest that appropriate chemical descriptors should be selected to estimate the cytotoxicity of phenoxazines, depending on the target cells.","['Ishihara, Mariko', 'Kawase, Masami', 'Westman, Gunnar', 'Samuelsson, Kristin', 'Motohashi, Noboru', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi']","['Ishihara M', 'Kawase M', 'Westman G', 'Samuelsson K', 'Motohashi N', 'Sakagami H']","['Division of Basic Chemistry, Department of Oral Biology and Tissue Engineering, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan. mariko@dent.meikai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxazines)', 'C2ZWT499SG (phenoxazine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Oxazines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 Nov-Dec;27(6B):4053-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: The aim of the study was the analysis of in vitro drug resistance to bortezomib and other anticancer drugs in de novo and relapsed adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The leukemic cells of 46 adult patients with AML were tested for the in vitro drug resistance profile. The group included 20 de novo and 26 relapsed AML patients, among whom, 12 relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and 4 after autologous HSCT. The MTT assay was performed for 21 drugs. Expression of P-glycoprotein (PGP), multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP1) and lung resistance protein (LRP) proteins was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: No significant differences in drug resistance were found for all tested drugs between de novo and relapsed AML samples, while expression of PGP, MRP1 and LRP was higher in relapsed patients. Patients with refractory or relapsed disease, had higher resistance of myeloblasts to cyclophosphamide (RR = 2.4, p = 0.050), and better sensitivity to busulfan (RR = 0.4, p = 0.054) and topotecan (RR = 0.4, p = 0.031). Those who have died due to refractory/relapsed disease (n = 16) had better sensitivity to bortezomib (RR = 0.6, p = 0.046) and treosulfan (RR = 0.1, p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: In vitro drug resistance in relapsed adult AML is comparable to that in de novo disease.

Besides their well-known ability to replicate as undifferentiated cells and to differentiate into diverse lineages of mesenchymal tissues, they were recently suggested to also give rise to haematopoietic and leukaemic/cancer stem cells. In this study, the relationship between MSCs and leukemic stem cells in patients with either chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) or the more primitive variant, Ph+ bi-phenotypic leukaemia was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cultured MSCs from 5 patients with CML and 3 patients with bi-phenotypic Ph+ leukaemia, all of them positive for BCP-ABL, were analysed with conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of t(9;22) and BCR-ABL. MSCs were characterised phenotypically with surface markers (+CD73, +CD90, +CD105, -CD34, -CD45) and functionally through their potential to differentiate into both adipocytes and osteoblasts. RESULTS: MSCs could be cultivated from seven patients. These cells were BCR-ABL negative when analysed with conventional cytogenetics and FISH. Further cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal set of chromosomes without any aberrations. Two patients were BCR-ABL-positive when analysed with PCR, probably as a result of MSC contamination with macrophages. CONCLUSION: MSCs in patients with CML or Ph+ bi-phenotypic leukaemia are not related to the malignant cell clone.","['Wohrer, S', 'Rabitsch, W', 'Shehata, M', 'Kondo, R', 'Esterbauer, H', 'Streubel, B', 'Sillaber, C', 'Raderer, M', 'Jaeger, U', 'Zielinski, C', 'Valent, P']","['Wohrer S', 'Rabitsch W', 'Shehata M', 'Kondo R', 'Esterbauer H', 'Streubel B', 'Sillaber C', 'Raderer M', 'Jaeger U', 'Zielinski C', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine 1, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. swoehrer@bccrc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 Nov-Dec;27(6B):3837-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: IMB-10 therapy inhibited the growth of both leukemia and lymphoma xenografts and significantly prolonged the survival of the mice with lymphoma. Interestingly, IMB-10 also reduced host leukocyte infiltration in tumors and affected the invasion potential of squamous cell carcinomas. CONCLUSION: IMB-10 has potential as a therapy for leukocytic malignancies, particularly for lymphomas. Since it also inhibited HSC-3 carcinoma invasion, most likely by blockage of the tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, we suggest that the host inflammation process may affect tumor progression also in a T-cell independent manner.","['Suojanen, Juho', 'Salo, Tuula', 'Sorsa, Timo', 'Koivunen, Erkki']","['Suojanen J', 'Salo T', 'Sorsa T', 'Koivunen E']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Diseases, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Institute of Dentistry, University of Helsinki, FI-00014, Finland. juho.suojanen@helsinki.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (IMB 10)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gelatinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*drug effects/immunology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Tongue Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 Nov-Dec;27(6B):3775-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical, hematologic and histomorphometric data were compared in the 2 groups of CML patients. RESULTS: The percentage of bone marrow promyelocytes was significantly increased in group I. On morphometry, the number of blasts per square millimeter, the area of reticulin fibers per square millimeter and the percentage area occupied by reticulin fibers were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: There seems to be grounds for hope for predicting prognosis of CML patients at initial diagnosis based on histomorphometric findings. The percentage area of reticulin fibers and the number of blasts per square millimeter are important prognostic predictors in histomorphometry data.","['Lamba, Amit', 'Dey, Pranab', 'Kumari, Savita', 'Marwaha, Neelam']","['Lamba A', 'Dey P', 'Kumari S', 'Marwaha N']","['Department of Pathology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Anal Quant Cytol Histol,Analytical and quantitative cytology and histology,8506819,['0 (Reticulin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy/instrumentation/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Erythroblasts/pathology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Image Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/classification/*diagnosis/*pathology/surgery', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Reticulin/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/01/30 09:00,2008/02/13 09:00,['2008/01/30 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol Histol. 2007 Dec;29(6):370-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors measured proteasome peptidase activity levels in plasma samples from 225 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and correlated the results with clinical behavior. By using fluorogenic kinetic assays, the enzymatic activity levels of 3 proteasomes were measured: chymotrypsin-like (Ch-L), trypsin-like (Tr-L), and caspase-like (Cas-L). RESULTS: All activity levels were significantly higher in patients who had CLL compared with the levels in a control group of healthy volunteers (P<.001). Rai stage was correlated with Ch-L activity (P<.001) but not with Cas-L or Tr-L activity. Levels of beta2 microglobulin (B2M) were correlated with Ch-L activity (correlation coefficient [R]=0.4; P<.001) and with Cas-L activity (R=0.25; P=.001) but not with Tr-L activity. Cas-L activity as a continuous variable was a strong predictor of survival. Ch-L and Cas-L activity levels as categorical variables both were strong predictors of survival; Cas-L activity was independent of B2M level but not of immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene (IgVH) mutation status. However, the combination of elevated B2M levels (>3.2 mg/L) and Cas-L activity (>1.32 pmoL/second/mL plasma) was associated with significantly shorter survival independent of IgVH mutation status. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that measuring plasma proteasome activity has prognostic value in CLL that, when combined with B2M, can be independent of IgVH mutation status.","['Ma, Wanlong', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Jilani, Iman', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Keating, Michael', 'Giles, Francis', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Ma W', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Jilani I', 'Zhang X', 'Estrov Z', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Keating M', 'Giles F', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, California 92675, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspases/*blood', 'Chymotrypsin/*blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/blood/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*blood', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Trypsin/*blood', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/blood']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23301 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Mar 15;112(6):1306-12. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23301.,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the rarity in children, paediatric meningiomas are often treated according to the adult practice. This may lead to inappropriate treatment considerations since paediatric meningiomas exhibit peculiarities that distinguish them from their adult counterpart. Striking the balance between late toxicities of adjuvant radiotherapy on the growing brain versus the risk of repeated recurrences necessitating surgical interventions in young patients is of importance and will require a clinical decision making process in the paediatric neuro-oncological/neurosurgical MDT tailored to each patient's age and clinical setting. The paediatric literature is based on small, single institution retrospective studies over extensive time periods during which the imaging facilities, pathological criteria and surgical advances have led to shifts in definitions of disease making comparison of results difficult to interpret. These guidelines have been developed following a comprehensive appraisal of the literature. Primary treatment is surgical resection. Careful pathological review and multidisciplinary discussions should be undertaken before considering postoperative treatment, such as radiotherapy for histologically anaplastic or clinically aggressive, relapsing meningioma.","['Traunecker, H', 'Mallucci, C', 'Grundy, R', 'Pizer, B', 'Saran, F']","['Traunecker H', 'Mallucci C', 'Grundy R', 'Pizer B', 'Saran F']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff CF14 4XW, UK.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of cytochromes P450 (CYP450) 1A1*2C and Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) (T1 and M1) gene polymorphisms in susceptibility to chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). METHODS: The frequency of CYP1A1 Ile/Val alleles and of GSTT1 and GSTM1 homozygous deletions was examined in 107 patients with CML and 132 healthy controls by PCR and/or PCRRFLP methods using blood samples. RESULTS: The frequency of CYP1A1 Val allele was found to be 19.2% in CML patients and 4.4% for controls, indicating that persons carrying this allele had an increased risk of CML (OR = 5.10, 95% CI: 2.60-9.97). The frequency of individuals carrying the GSTT1 null genotype was higher among CML patients (40.2%) compared to controls (19.2%) (OR = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.58-5.05; p <0.001). Therefore, GSTT1 present genotype may be a protective factor for CML. Although GSTM1 null genotype frequency was slightly higher in the patient group (44.9%) than in the controls (42.3%), this difference was not statistically significant (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.66-1.86; p = 0.693). Individuals with GSTM1 null genotypes without the T allele have a 5.981 higher risk for CML than those who have the T allele.

Although prophylactic antifungal therapy with fluconazole (FLCZ) has become the standard care for these patients, there remains a need for more effective and cost-beneficial alternative drugs. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the usefulness of the administration of micafungin (MCFG) as a prophylactic antifungal therapy for patients undergoing allogeneic SCT. The results were compared with previous data for patients who had received FLCZ. A total of 44 patients who underwent allogeneic SCT were enrolled in the study. Data from 29 patients who received allogeneic SCT using prophylactic FLCZ before this study were used as historical control data. Underlying diseases included acute leukemia (n = 16), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 11), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 6), and others (n = 11) in the MCFG group and acute leukemia (n = 18), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 6), and others (n = 5) in the FLCZ group. The median durations of administration of MCFG and FLCZ were 36 and 34 days, respectively. Prophylactic success, defined as the absence of proven, probable, and possible invasive fungal infection (IFI) until the end of prophylactic therapy was achieved in 36 (87.8%) of the 41 evaluated patients in the MCFG group and in 65.5% of the patients in the FLCZ group (P = 0.038). No patients in the MCFG group showed proven or probable IFI, whereas proven or probable IFI was observed in three patients in the FLCZ group. Four patients in the MCFG group required dose escalation due to febrile neutropenia. Although one patient in the MCFG group required the discontinuation of MCFG due to allergic skin eruption (grade 2), none of the other patients in either group required dose reduction due to adverse effects. Although the study design was not a prospective randomized trial, our results indicate that the administration of MCFG at a daily dose of 100 mg is promising for prophylactic antifungal therapy in patients undergoing allogeneic SCT.","['Hashino, Satoshi', 'Morita, Lena', 'Takahata, Mutsumi', 'Onozawa, Masahiro', 'Nakagawa, Masao', 'Kawamura, Takahito', 'Fujisawa, Fumie', 'Kahata, Kaoru', 'Izumiyama, Koh', 'Yonezumi, Masakatsu', 'Chiba, Koji', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Asaka, Masahiro']","['Hashino S', 'Morita L', 'Takahata M', 'Onozawa M', 'Nakagawa M', 'Kawamura T', 'Fujisawa F', 'Kahata K', 'Izumiyama K', 'Yonezumi M', 'Chiba K', 'Kondo T', 'Asaka M']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-8638, Japan. shashino@med.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20071211,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Echinocandins/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lipopeptides', 'Lipoproteins/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Micafungin', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12185-007-0011-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Jan;87(1):91-7. doi: 10.1007/s12185-007-0011-1.

SiRNA treatment significantly knocked down Gfi-1B expression with an efficiency of nearly 90%. Analysis of the siRNA silencing protocol by colony-forming units ensured that it was not cytotoxic. Samples from Gfi-1B overexpressing cells and cells with knocked-down Gfi-1B were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray technology and based upon rigorous statistical analysis of the data; relevant genes were chosen for confirmation by reserve transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, including MYC/MYCBP and CDKN1A. Interestingly, transcripts within components of the signalling cascade of immune cells (PLD1, LAMP1, HSP90, IL6ST), of the tyrosine kinase pathway (TPR, RAC3) and of the transcription factors (RAC3, CEP290, JEM-1, ATR, MYC, SMC3, RARA, RBBP6) were found to be differentially expressed in Gfi-1B overexpressing cells compared to controls. Individual genes such as ZDHHC17, DMXL1, ZNF292 were found to be upregulated in Gfi-1B overexpressing cells. In addition, down-regulated transcripts showed cell signaling transcripts for several chemokine gene members including GNAL, CXCL5, GNL3L, GPR65, TMEM30, BCL11B and transcription factors (GTF2H3, ATXN3). In conclusion, several essential cell signalling factors, as well as transcriptional and post-translational regulation genes were differentially expressed in cells that overexpressed Gfi-1B compared to control cells with knocked-down Gfi-1B. Our data indicate that Gfi-1B signalling is important for commitment and maturation of hematopoietic cell populations.","['Koldehoff, Michael', 'Zakrzewski, Johannes L', 'Klein-Hitpass, Ludger', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Elmaagacli, Ahmet H']","['Koldehoff M', 'Zakrzewski JL', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Beelen DW', 'Elmaagacli AH']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. michael.koldehoff@uni-duisburg-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071206,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (GFI1B protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12185-007-0013-z [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Jan;87(1):39-47. doi: 10.1007/s12185-007-0013-z.

Recently this system has been proved to be supported by epigenetic transcription regulation. PcG products comprise two distinct complexes, PcG complex 1 and 2. First PcG complex 2 silences chromatin and encodes a histone code by methylating histone H3 at lysine 27. PcG complex 1 is, then, recruited by recognizing the histone code, and ubiquitinates histone H2A and/or inhibits chromatin remodeling to maintain the silenced states of the locus. Biologically, PcG-deficient mice provided biological evidence that PcG are essential for sustaining stem cell activity. More recently PcG were reported to be correlated with cancer progression and prognosis as well as with cancer stem cell activity. PcG may thus play a crucial part in sustaining the activities of malignant as well as normal stem cells. Although PcG were initially seen to maintain stem cell activity through repression of the INK4a locus, they now appear to perform more diverse functions in supporting stem cells. This paper summarizes current information on the molecular roles of PcG in normal and malignant stem cells and discusses the implications in future cancer therapy and regenerative medicine.","['Takihara, Yoshihiro']",['Takihara Y'],"['Department of Stem Cell Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan. takihara@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071130,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Pcl protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Histone Code/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/physiopathology', 'Mice', '*Repressor Proteins/genetics/physiology']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12185-007-0006-y [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Jan;87(1):25-34. doi: 10.1007/s12185-007-0006-y.

This study was preformed to determine the prevalence and predictors of HBP and HTN in newly diagnosed acute leukemia and lymphoma patients. Retrospectively, blood pressure (BP) values were followed from admission until normalization in 102 children. HBP and HTN were defined as either a systolic or diastolic value > or = the 90th and 95th percentile BP measurement, respectively. HBP and HTN were identified in 68.6% and 52.9% of children prior to chemotherapy and 78.4% and 67.3% postchemotherapy, respectively. Mean time to BP normalization was 54 days. Only ten children (15% of HTN patients) received antihypertensive therapy. Logistic regression determined that the only predictor for HBP and HTN was the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the time of admission -- every 10 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) increase led to a 16% and 14% decrease in the odds of postchemotherapy HBP (p = 0.02) and HTN (p = 0.03), respectively. A surprisingly high prevalence of BP abnormalities was identified and lower eGFR predicted HBP and HTN in children with newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies. Better recognition and serious consideration for treatment should be given to this cardiovascular abnormality.","['Louis, Chrystal U', 'Butani, Lavjay']","['Louis CU', 'Butani L']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA. culouis@txccc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080126,Germany,Pediatr Nephrol,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",8708728,['0 (Antihypertensive Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blood Pressure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/06/27 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00467-007-0720-y [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Nephrol. 2008 Apr;23(4):603-9. doi: 10.1007/s00467-007-0720-y.

The FA/BRCA pathway includes 8 members of a core complex and 5 downstream gene products closely linked with BRCA1 or BRCA2. Precancerous lesions are believed to trigger the DNA damage response (DDR), and we focused on the DDR in FA and its putative role as a checkpoint barrier to cancer. In primary fibroblasts with mutations in the core complex FANCA protein, we discovered that basal expression and phosphorylation of ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and p53 induced by irradiation (IR) or mitomycin C (MMC) were upregulated. This heightened response appeared to be due to increased basal levels of ATM in cultured FANCA-mutant cells, highlighting the new observation that ATM can be regulated at the transcriptional level in addition to its well-established activation by autophosphorylation. Functional analysis of this response using gamma-H2AX foci as markers of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) demonstrated abnormal persistence of only MMC- and not IR-induced foci. Thus, we describe a processing defect that leads to general DDR upregulation but specific persistence of DNA crosslinker-induced damage response foci. Underscoring the significance of these findings, we found resistance to DNA crosslinker-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a TP53-mutant, patient-derived HNSCC cell line, whereas a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from this same individual was not mutated at TP53 and retained DNA crosslinker sensitivity. Our results suggest that cancer in FA may arise from selection for cells that escape from a chronically activated DDR checkpoint.","['Yamamoto, Kazuhiko', 'Nihrane, Abdallah', 'Aglipay, Jason', 'Sironi, Juan', 'Arkin, Steven', 'Lipton, Jeffrey M', 'Ouchi, Toru', 'Liu, Johnson M']","['Yamamoto K', 'Nihrane A', 'Aglipay J', 'Sironi J', 'Arkin S', 'Lipton JM', 'Ouchi T', 'Liu JM']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FANCA protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', '*DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Fanconi Anemia/complications/genetics/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/etiology/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2119/2007-00122.Yamamoto [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med. 2008 Mar-Apr;14(3-4):167-74. doi: 10.2119/2007-00122.Yamamoto.,,PMC2213892,"['U01 CA090631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA79892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA079892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacodynamic effects of DAC and 5-azacitidine outside their known activity as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) require further investigation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of DAC on the expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1), a gene with a putative CpG island surrounding its promoter region. Promoter methylation analysis of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in leukemia cells revealed the absence of CpG methylation. However, DAC upregulated p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression in a dose-dependent manner (ED(50)=103.34 nM) and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in leukemia cells. Sequential application of DAC followed by different histone deacetylase inhibitors induced expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) synergistically. Upregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) paralleled DAC-induced apoptosis (ED(50)=153 nM). Low doses of DAC induced gamma-H2AX expression (ED(50)=16.5 nM) and upregulated p21(WAF1/CIP1) in congenic HCT 116 colon cancer cells in a DNMT-independent and p53-dependent fashion. Inhibition of p53 transactivation by pifithrin-alpha or the kinase activity of ATM by either the specific ATM inhibitor KU-5593 or caffeine abrogated p21(WAF1/CIP1) upregulation, indicating that DAC upregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) was p53- and ATM-dependent in leukemia cells. In conclusion, DAC upregulates p21(WAF1/CIP1) in DNMT-independent manner via the DNA damage/ATM/p53 axis.","['Jiemjit, A', 'Fandy, T E', 'Carraway, H', 'Bailey, K A', 'Baylin, S', 'Herman, J G', 'Gore, S D']","['Jiemjit A', 'Fandy TE', 'Carraway H', 'Bailey KA', 'Baylin S', 'Herman JG', 'Gore SD']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080128,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '4040-10-2 (5-azacytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)']",IM,"['Caffeine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['1211018 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1211018 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jun 5;27(25):3615-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1211018.

Gain-of-function mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes SHP-2, have been found in the leukemia-prone developmental disorder Noonan syndrome as well as sporadic childhood leukemias, indicating that SHP-2 is a bona fide human oncoprotein. However, the role of SHP-2 mutations in non-hematological malignancies remains obscure. Here, we screened for PTPN11 mutations in primary solid tumors and identified a 1520C>A mutation that causes threonine-507 to lysine (T507K) substitution in the phosphatase domain of SHP-2 in a case of hepatocellular carcinoma. T507K SHP-2 exhibited altered substrate specificity with slightly elevated basal phosphatase activity. Upon expression in NIH3T3 cells, T507K SHP-2 induced transformed foci, which was not observed with wild type, Noonan-specific or leukemia-specific SHP-2. Furthermore, NIH3T3 cells transformed by T507K SHP-2 showed anchorage-independent growth and developed tumors in nude mice. These results indicate that quantitative and/or qualitative alteration in phosphatase activity determines the transforming potential as well as target cell/tissue spectrum of individual SHP-2 mutants as oncoproteins. Although rare in solid tumors, the identified T507K SHP-2 represents a distinct class of SHP-2 mutants with oncogenic RAS-like transforming activity, which could contribute to the development of solid tumors.","['Miyamoto, D', 'Miyamoto, M', 'Takahashi, A', 'Yomogita, Y', 'Higashi, H', 'Kondo, S', 'Hatakeyama, M']","['Miyamoto D', 'Miyamoto M', 'Takahashi A', 'Yomogita Y', 'Higashi H', 'Kondo S', 'Hatakeyama M']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080128,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*genetics/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['1211019 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1211019 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jun 5;27(25):3508-15. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1211019.

Interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP) is a tumor suppressor, whose downregulation cooperates with BCR-ABL and NUP98-TOP1 gene products to accelerate leukemia induction in mouse models. Similarly, Meis1 synergizes with HoxA9 or NUP98-HOX (but not NUP98-TOP1) fusion genes to promote the early onset of leukemia. To investigate whether Icsbp deficiency interacts with Meis1 or its family member Meis3, we transplanted Icsbp(-/-) bone marrow (BM) cells after transduction with Meis1 or Meis3 retroviral vectors. Here, we show that enforced expression of Meis1 or Meis3 in Icsbp(-/-) BM cells induces a fatal, invasive myeloproliferative disease. Secondary mutations, such as activation of Mn1, led to the progression to acute myeloid leukemia in a few mice. Interestingly, expression of endogenous Meis1 and Meis3 mRNAs was repressed in the granulocytic progenitor population of Icsbp(-/-) mice. These results reveal a novel collaboration between Icsbp deficiency and Meis1/Meis3 in the acceleration of chronic myeloid leukemia-like disease.","['Hara, T', 'Schwieger, M', 'Kazama, R', 'Okamoto, S', 'Minehata, K', 'Ziegler, M', 'Lohler, J', 'Stocking, C']","['Hara T', 'Schwieger M', 'Kazama R', 'Okamoto S', 'Minehata K', 'Ziegler M', 'Lohler J', 'Stocking C']","['Stem Cell Project Group, The Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Organization for Medical Research, Tokyo, Japan. thara@rinshoken.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080128,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Meis3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['1211043 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1211043 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jun 19;27(27):3865-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1211043.

Here we examine the functional interactions of Nanog with the Stat3 and NFkappaB pathways. Nanog and Stat3 were found to bind to and synergistically activate Stat3-dependent promoters. We also found that Nanog binds to NFkappaB proteins; however, Nanog binding inhibited transcriptional activity of NFkappaB proteins. Endogenous NFkappaB activity and target-gene expression increased during differentiation of ES cells. Overexpression of NFkappaB proteins promoted differentiation, whereas inhibition of NFkappaB signalling, either by genetic ablation of the Ikbkg gene or overexpression of the IkappaBalpha super-repressor, increased expression of pluripotency markers. We conclude that Nanog represses the pro-differentiation activities of NFkappaB and cooperates with Stat3 to maintain pluripotency.","['Torres, Josema', 'Watt, Fiona M']","['Torres J', 'Watt FM']","['Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QR, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080127,England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/04/30 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncb1680 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb1680 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2008 Feb;10(2):194-201. doi: 10.1038/ncb1680.

Specifically, these studies show an elevated incidence of reproductive tumors in the female offspring of prenatally-exposed mice. METHODS: We assessed cancer and benign pathology diagnoses occurring in the offspring of women whose prenatal exposure to DES (or lack of exposure) was verified by medical record. Our data arose from 2 sources: the mothers' reports of cancers occurring in 8216 sons and daughters, and pathology-confirmed cancers and benign diagnoses self-reported by a subset of 793 daughters. RESULTS: Although statistical power is limited, our data are consistent with no overall increase of cancer in the sons or daughters of women exposed in utero to DES. Based on pathology-confirmed diagnoses reported by the daughters, we saw no association between DES and risk of benign breast disease or reproductive tract conditions. Based on 3 cases, the incidence of ovarian cancer was higher than expected in the daughters of women exposed prenatally to DES.

DESIGN AND METHODS: An optimized method for direct detection of ZAP-70 in flow cytometry was tested in a multicenter fashion. Adapted for frozen cells, this method includes a normalization step by addition of B cells from a pool of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from normal donors. ZAP-70 expression levels were assessed for 153 patients with typical B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Results were expressed as the ratio of ZAP-70 mean fluorescence intensity between B-CLL cells and normal B cells. RESULTS: The statistically optimized cut-off of ZAP-70 positivity was a ratio of 1.4. Concordance between ZAP-70 and CD38 expression was 67%. Concordance between the mutational status of IgVH genes and ZAP-70 or CD38 expression was 87% and 65%, respectively. ZAP-70 was significantly expressed in 28%, 54% and 61% of patients with Binet stages A, B and C B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, respectively (p=0.008). The absence of ZAP-70 expression was associated with isolated del(13q14), a cytogenetic abnormality with a good prognosis, while most patients with the del(17p13) poor prognosis cytogenetic marker expressed ZAP-70 (p<10(-5)). ZAP-70 expression was not related to the other poor prognosis cytogenetic abnormality del(11q22.3) nor to trisomy 12. CONCLUSIONS: This new technique provides highly reliable results well correlated with the mutational status of IgVH genes, CD38 expression, Binet stage and cytogenetic abnormalities. This robust discriminative technique appears of particular interest for routine diagnosis and assessment of ZAP-70 expression in large, prospective, multicenter therapeutic trials.","['Gachard, Nathalie', 'Salviat, Aurelie', 'Boutet, Catherine', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Durrieu, Francoise', 'Lenormand, Bernard', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Olschwang, Sylviane', 'Jardin, Fabrice', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Penther, Dominique', 'Sainty, Danielle', 'Reminieras, Liliane', 'Feuillard, Jean', 'Bene, Marie C']","['Gachard N', 'Salviat A', 'Boutet C', 'Arnoulet C', 'Durrieu F', 'Lenormand B', 'Lepretre S', 'Olschwang S', 'Jardin F', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Penther D', 'Sainty D', 'Reminieras L', 'Feuillard J', 'Bene MC']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Dupuytren, Faculte de Medecine de Limoges, Universite de Limoges, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique, UMR CNRS 6101, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080126,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Blood Donors', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry/standards', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Trisomy', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/04/02 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.11622 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11622 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Feb;93(2):215-23. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11622.

Here we present the setting up of the International Scale conversion factors for a national laboratory by performing both a cross-analysis of a set of standard samples from a reference laboratory and an analysis of bone marrow and peripheral blood samples at diagnosis (from 32 and 27 patients, respectively). DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 222 bone marrow and 173 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 96 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia were analyzed with RQ-PCR according to Europe Against Cancer protocols. Additionally, 291 bone marrow samples were analyzed with high mitotic index metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (metaphase FISH). RESULTS: Major molecular response according to the International Scale in BCR-ABL/GUS transcript levels corresponded to a ratio of 0.035% in peripheral blood and 0.034% in bone marrow, yielding the same conversion factor of 2.86 for both types of sample. Based on metaphase FISH, values of 10%/-1.0 log, 1%/-2.0 log and 0.1%/-3.0 log on the International Scale, corresponded to 13%, 2%, and 0.3% of Philadelphia chromosome positive cells in bone marrow, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, conversion factors can be determined either by cross-analyzing a number of samples with a laboratory that has already established the International Scale or utilizing sufficient numbers of reference samples from chronic myeloid leukemia patients at diagnosis, or using the upcoming international standards.","['Lundan, Tuija', 'Juvonen, Vesa', 'Mueller, Martin C', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Lakkala, Taina', 'Kairisto, Veli', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Knuutila, Sakari', 'Porkka, Kimmo']","['Lundan T', 'Juvonen V', 'Mueller MC', 'Mustjoki S', 'Lakkala T', 'Kairisto V', 'Hochhaus A', 'Knuutila S', 'Porkka K']","['Department of Pathology, Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Haartman Institute and HUSLAB, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080126,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Metaphase', '*Mitotic Index', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/04/02 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.11910 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.11910 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Feb;93(2):178-85. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11910.

We sought to improve the diagnostic armamentarium by screening and to analyze the dynamics of mutated clones in chronic myeloid leukemia patients who experienced hematologic or cytogenetic relapse. DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-five patients who relapsed during imatinib therapy were screened for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations using sensitive denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC) and direct sequencing. To investigate the dynamics of mutated clones D-HPLC was applied to 453 cDNA samples tracking back from relapse towards the start of imatinib therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-two different point mutations affecting 18 amino acids were detectable in 46/79 (58%) and in 7/16 patients (44%) with hematologic or cytogenetic relapse, respectively. A deletion of 81 nucleotides (del248-274) of ABL exon 4 was observed in two patients. Three patients had exclusively single nucleotide polymorphisms (K247R, T315T, E499E, n=1 each) within the BCR-ABL kinase domain. In patients harboring mutations, hematologic relapse occurred after a median of 12.9 months (range, 0.9-44.2), and BCR-ABL mutations first became detectable at a median of 5.8 months (range, 0-30.5) after starting imatinib therapy (p<0.0001). Nine patients showed evidence of BCR-ABL mutations prior to imatinib therapy (T315I, n=4; M351T, n=3; M244V and Y253H, n=1 each). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that: (i) D-HPLC is a sensitive method for screening for BCR-ABL mutations before and during therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors; (ii) the occurrence of BCR-ABL mutations during imatinib therapy is predictive of relapse; (iii) mutations may be detectable several months before relapse, and (iv) the sensitive detection of small numbers of mutated clones could provide clinical benefit by triggering early therapeutic interventions.","['Ernst, Thomas', 'Erben, Philipp', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Schenk, Thomas', 'Hoffmann, Jana', 'Kreil, Sebastian', 'La Rosee, Paul', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Ernst T', 'Erben P', 'Muller MC', 'Paschka P', 'Schenk T', 'Hoffmann J', 'Kreil S', 'La Rosee P', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A']","['III.

Herein, we have developed an in vitro signaling assay to analyze IKK complex activation by recombinant Tax. Using this assay in combination with reporter assays, we demonstrate that Tax-mediated activation of IKK is independent of phosphatases. We show that sustained activation of the Tax-mediated activation of the NFkappaB pathway is dependent on an intact Hsp90-IKK complex. By acetylating and thereby preventing activation of the IKK complex by the Yersinia effector YopJ, we demonstrate that Tax-mediated activation of the IKK complex requires a phosphorylation step. Our characterization of an in vitro signaling assay system for the mechanism of Tax-mediated activation of the IKK complex with a variety of mutants and inhibitors results in a working model for the biochemical mechanism of Tax-induced activation.","['Mukherjee, Sohini', 'Negi, Veera S', 'Keitany, Gladys', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Orth, Kim']","['Mukherjee S', 'Negi VS', 'Keitany G', 'Tanaka Y', 'Orth K']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080126,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (YopP protein, Yersinia)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Bacterial Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/07/18 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)71533-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M704831200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 May 30;283(22):15127-33. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M704831200.

We describe generation and utilization of cell lines that stably express CD52 both in vitro and in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: By limiting dilution, we have established several clones of Raji-Burkitt's lymphoma cell line that express surface CD52. Immunophenotype and cytogenetic characterization of these clones was done. In vivo usefulness of the CD52(high) cell line to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of CD52-directed antibody was investigated using a SCID mouse xenograft model. RESULTS: Stable expression of CD52 was confirmed in cells cultured in vitro up to 52 weeks of continuous growth. The functional integrity of the expressed CD52 molecule was shown using alemtuzumab, which induced cytotoxic effects in vitro in the CD52(high) but not the CD52(low) clone. Compared with control antibody, alemtuzumab treatment in CD52(high) inoculated mice resulted in significantly increased median survival. Comparable levels of CD52-targeted direct cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and anti-CD52 immunoliposome-mediated delivery of synthetic oligodeoxyribo nucleotides in CD52(high) clone and primary B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells implicated potential in vivo application of this model for evaluation of CD52-targeted antibody and immunoliposomes encapsulating therapeutic agents. CONCLUSIONS: These results show the in vitro utility of the cloned Raji cell lines that stably express high levels CD52. The disseminated leukemia-lymphoma mouse model described herein using these stable cell lines can serve as an excellent system for in vivo therapeutic and mechanistic evaluation of existing and novel antibodies directed against CD52 molecule.","['Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Zhao, Xiaobin', 'Triantafillou, Georgia', 'Yu, Bo', 'Jin, Yan', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Cheney, Carolyn', 'Heerema, Nyla', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Lee, L James', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Lee, Robert J', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Byrd, John C']","['Lapalombella R', 'Zhao X', 'Triantafillou G', 'Yu B', 'Jin Y', 'Lozanski G', 'Cheney C', 'Heerema N', 'Jarjoura D', 'Lehman A', 'Lee LJ', 'Marcucci G', 'Lee RJ', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Muthusamy N', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Liposomes)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genes, p53', 'Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Liposomes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Rituximab', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/2/569 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1006 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jan 15;14(2):569-78. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1006.,,,"['P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary and cultured (JVM-3 and MEC-2) CLL cells were exposed to agents alone or in combination, after which cell death was determined by 7-aminoactinomycin D staining/flow cytometry. Acetylation of target proteins, activation of caspase cascades, and expression of apoptosis-regulatory proteins were monitored by Western blot analysis. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity was determined by luciferase reporter assay. Cells were transiently transfected with wild-type and acetylation site-mutated (inactive) RelA(p65) (e.g., K221R, K310R, or K281/221/310R) and assessed for HDACI sensitivity. RESULTS: Combined exposure to very low concentrations of romidepsin or belinostat (i.e., low nanomolar and submicromolar, respectively) in combination with low nanomolar concentrations of bortezomib synergistically induced cell death in primary and cultured CLL cells. These events were likely associated with prevention of HDACI-mediated RelA acetylation and NF-kappaB activation by bortezomib, down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins (i.e., Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and XIAP), as well as up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein Bim, resulting in activation of caspase cascade. Finally, CLL cells transfected with inactive RelA displayed a significant increase in HDACI lethality. CONCLUSIONS: Coadministration of the clinically relevant HDACIs romidepsin or belinostat with bortezomib synergistically induces cell death in CLL cells, likely through mechanisms involving, among other factors, NF-kappaB inactivation and perturbation in the expression of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins. A strategy combining HDAC with proteasome inhibition warrants further attention in CLL.","['Dai, Yun', 'Chen, Shuang', 'Kramer, Lora B', 'Funk, Vanessa L', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dai Y', 'Chen S', 'Kramer LB', 'Funk VL', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'F4H96P17NZ (belinostat)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Depsipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/2/549 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1934 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jan 15;14(2):549-58. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1934.,,,"['CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA88906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the suitability of ROR1 as a cell surface antigen for targeted therapy of B-CLL, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of ROR1 protein expression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, sera, and other adult tissues from B-CLL patients and healthy donors were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively for ROR1 protein expression by flow cytometry, cell surface biotinylation, Western blotting, and ELISA. RESULTS: ROR1 protein is selectively expressed on the surface of B-CLL cells, whereas normal B cells, other normal blood cells, and normal adult tissues do not express cell surface ROR1. Moreover, cell surface expression of ROR1 is uniform and constitutive, i.e., independent of anatomic niches, independent of biological and clinical heterogeneity of B-CLL, independent of B-cell activation, and found at similar levels in all B-CLL samples tested. The antibody binding capacity of B-CLL cell surface ROR1 was determined to be in the range of 10(3) to 10(4) molecules per cell. A portion of B-CLL cell surface ROR1 was actively internalized upon antibody binding. Soluble ROR1 protein was detectable in sera of <25% of B-CLL patients and a similar fraction of healthy donors at concentrations below 200 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The restricted, uniform, and constitutive cell surface expression of ROR1 protein in B-CLL provides a strong incentive for the development of targeted therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies.","['Baskar, Sivasubramanian', 'Kwong, Ka Yin', 'Hofer, Thomas', 'Levy, Jessica M', 'Kennedy, Michael G', 'Lee, Elinor', 'Staudt, Louis M', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Rader, Christoph']","['Baskar S', 'Kwong KY', 'Hofer T', 'Levy JM', 'Kennedy MG', 'Lee E', 'Staudt LM', 'Wilson WH', 'Wiestner A', 'Rader C']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch and Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, and Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-1203, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blood Cells/enzymology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/enzymology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/blood/*metabolism', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/2/396 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1823 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jan 15;14(2):396-404. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1823.,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This summary reviews the database supporting this approval. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Four single-arm multicenter studies supported the efficacy and safety of dasatinib. The primary efficacy end point in chronic phase CML was major cytogenetic response. The primary end point in accelerated phase, myeloid phase, and lymphoid blast phase CML, and Ph(+) ALL was major hematologic response. RESULTS: The four studies combined enrolled 445 patients. In patients with chronic phase CML, the major cytogenetic response rate was 45% with a complete cytogenetic response rate of 33%. Major hematologic response rates in patients with accelerated phase CML, myeloid CML, lymphoid blast CML, and Ph(+) ALL were 59%, 32%, 31%, and 42%, respectively. Median response durations in chronic phase, accelerated phase, and myeloid phase CML had not been reached. The median durations of major hematologic response were 3.7 months in lymphoid blast CML and 4.8 months in Ph(+) ALL. Common toxicities with dasatinib included myelosuppression, bleeding, and fluid retention. CONCLUSIONS: This report describes the Food and Drug Administration review supporting the approval of dasatinib for CML and Ph(+) ALL based on the rates and durability of cytogenetic and hematologic responses.","['Brave, Michael', 'Goodman, Vicki', 'Kaminskas, Edvardas', 'Farrell, Ann', 'Timmer, William', 'Pope, Sarah', 'Harapanhalli, Ravi', 'Saber, Haleh', 'Morse, David', 'Bullock, Julie', 'Men, Angela', 'Noory, Carol', 'Ramchandani, Roshni', 'Kenna, Leslie', 'Booth, Brian', 'Gobburu, Joga', 'Jiang, Xiaoping', 'Sridhara, Rajeshwari', 'Justice, Robert', 'Pazdur, Richard']","['Brave M', 'Goodman V', 'Kaminskas E', 'Farrell A', 'Timmer W', 'Pope S', 'Harapanhalli R', 'Saber H', 'Morse D', 'Bullock J', 'Men A', 'Noory C', 'Ramchandani R', 'Kenna L', 'Booth B', 'Gobburu J', 'Jiang X', 'Sridhara R', 'Justice R', 'Pazdur R']","['Office of Oncology Drug Products, Office of New Drugs, Office of Translational Sciences, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD 20993, USA. michael.brave@fda.hhs.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/2/352 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4175 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jan 15;14(2):352-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4175.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In MHC-mismatched mouse models, these contacts were not required for GVHD. However, this conclusion may not apply to MHC-matched, multiple minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched alloSCT, the most common type performed clinically. To address this, we used wild-type (wt)-->MHCI-/- or wt-->MHCII-/- bone marrow chimeras as recipients in GVHD experiments. For GVL experiments, we used MHCI-/- or MHCII-/- chronic-phase CML cells created by expressing the BCR-ABL cDNA in bone marrow from MHCI-/- or MHCII-/- mice. TCR/MHCI contact was obligatory for both CD8-mediated GVHD and GVL. In contrast, CD4 cells induced GVHD in wt-->MHCII-/- chimeras, whereas MHCII-/- mCP-CML was GVL-resistant. Donor CD4 cells infiltrated affected skin and bowel in wt-->MHCII-/- recipients, indicating that they mediated GVHD by acting locally. Thus, CD4 cells use distinct effector mechanisms in GVHD and GVL: direct cytolytic action is required for GVL but not for GVHD. If these noncytolytic pathways can be inhibited, then GVHD might be ameliorated while preserving GVL.","['Matte-Martone, Catherine', 'Liu, Jinli', 'Jain, Dhanpat', 'McNiff, Jennifer', 'Shlomchik, Warren D']","['Matte-Martone C', 'Liu J', 'Jain D', 'McNiff J', 'Shlomchik WD']","['Section of Medical Oncology, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080125,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Chimera/genetics/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)43115-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-125294 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 1;111(7):3884-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-125294.

These antigens included cytoskeletal proteins vimentin, filamin B, and cofilin-1, but also phosphorylcholine-containing antigens (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharides and oxidized low-density lipoprotein [oxLDL]). Additional new antigens identified were cardiolipin and proline-rich acidic protein-1. Remarkably, these antigens represent molecular motifs exposed on apoptotic cells/blebs and bacteria, and several CLL Igs bound to apoptotic Jurkat cells. In conclusion, these intriguing data, showing a limited target structure recognition, indicate that CD5+ CLL B cells are derived from a cell compartment that produces ""natural antibodies,"" which may be instrumental in elimination and scavenging of apoptotic cells and pathogenic bacteria.","['Lanemo Myhrinder, Anna', 'Hellqvist, Eva', 'Sidorova, Ekaterina', 'Soderberg, Anita', 'Baxendale, Helen', 'Dahle, Charlotte', 'Willander, Kerstin', 'Tobin, Gerard', 'Backman, Eva', 'Soderberg, Ola', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Horkko, Sohvi', 'Rosen, Anders']","['Lanemo Myhrinder A', 'Hellqvist E', 'Sidorova E', 'Soderberg A', 'Baxendale H', 'Dahle C', 'Willander K', 'Tobin G', 'Backman E', 'Soderberg O', 'Rosenquist R', 'Horkko S', 'Rosen A']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080125,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Antigens, Bacterial/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*immunology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/immunology']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)43108-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-125450 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 1;111(7):3838-48. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-125450.

Interactions between Gag molecules control key events at several stages in the cycle of infection. In particular, the capsid (CA) domain of Gag mediates many of the protein-protein interactions that drive retrovirus assembly, maturation and disassembly. Moreover, in murine leukaemia virus (MLV), sequence variation in CA confers N and B tropism that determines susceptibility to the intracellular restriction factors Fv1n and Fv1b. We have determined the structure of the N-terminal domain (NtD) of CA from B-tropic MLV. A comparison of this structure with that of the NtD of CA from N-tropic MLV reveals that although the crystals belong to different space groups, CA monomers are packed with the same P6 hexagonal arrangement. Moreover, interhexamer crystal contacts between residues located at the periphery of the discs are conserved, indicating that switching of tropism does not result in large differences in the backbone conformation, nor does it alter the quaternary arrangement of the disc. We have also examined crystals of the N-tropic MLV CA containing both N- and C-terminal domains. In this case, the NtD hexamer is still present; however, the interhexamer spacing is increased and the conserved interhexamer contacts are absent. Investigation into the effects of mutation of residues that mediate interhexamer contacts reveals that amino acid substitutions at these positions cause severe defects in viral assembly, budding and Gag processing. Based on our crystal structures and mutational analysis, we propose that in MLV, interactions between the NtDs of CA are required for packing of Gag molecules in the early part of immature particle assembly. Moreover, we present a model where proteolytic cleavage at maturation results in migration of CA C-terminal domains into interstitial spaces between NtD hexamers. As a result, NtD-mediated interhexamer contacts present in the immature particle are displaced and the less densely packed lattice with increased hexamer-hexamer spacing characteristic of the viral core is produced.","['Mortuza, Gulnahar B', 'Dodding, Mark P', 'Goldstone, David C', 'Haire, Lesley F', 'Stoye, Jonathan P', 'Taylor, Ian A']","['Mortuza GB', 'Dodding MP', 'Goldstone DC', 'Haire LF', 'Stoye JP', 'Taylor IA']","['Division of Molecular Structure, National Institute for Medical Research, Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071228,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Capsid Proteins/*chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sequence Alignment']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/03/15 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(07)01672-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2007.12.043 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2008 Mar 7;376(5):1493-508. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2007.12.043.

DESIGN: Prospective animal and human study. SETTING: Serono laboratories and IVF clinic. PATIENT(S): Healthy women volunteers and 8-week-old female mice. INTERVENTION(S): Cumulus compacted human and mice oocytes were matured in IVM media with and without recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and with and without LIF. Mice IVM oocytes with and without 0.2 IU/mL of recombinant FSH; or with and without recombinant FSH + LIF (0.1, 1.0, 1000.0 ng/mL) and ovulated oocytes were in vitro fertilized and cultured. We transferred 395 blastocysts to the uterine horn of 2.5-day pseudopregnant female mice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cumulus expansion in human and mice oocytes, and two-cell rate, blastocyst rate, and delivered rate of live pups in mice. RESULT(S): In human and mouse oocytes, LIF induced cumulus expansion. When 1000 ng/mL of LIF was added in combination with recombinant FSH, a statistically significant increase in cleavage rate, embryo development rate, and birth rate was observed when compared with oocytes matured with FSH alone. CONCLUSION(S): Leukemia inhibitory factor induced cumulus expansion similarly in human and mouse cumulus-oocyte complexes, and recombinant FSH plus LIF supplementation during mouse IVM significantly improved oocyte competence as measured by cleavage rate, blastocyst development, and birth rate.","['De Matos, Daniel G', 'Miller, Kathleen', 'Scott, Richard', 'Tran, Cam Anh', 'Kagan, David', 'Nataraja, Selva G', 'Clark, Ann', 'Palmer, Stephen']","['De Matos DG', 'Miller K', 'Scott R', 'Tran CA', 'Kagan D', 'Nataraja SG', 'Clark A', 'Palmer S']","['EMD Serono Research Institute, Rockland, Massachusetts 02370, USA. dematosdg@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080128,United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Fertility Agents, Female)', '0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone, Human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cleavage Stage, Ovum/*drug effects', 'Cumulus Cells/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Embryo Culture Techniques', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Female', 'Fertility Agents, Female/*pharmacology', '*Fertilization in Vitro', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone, Human/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oocytes/*drug effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/12/24 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0015-0282(07)03947-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.10.061 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2008 Dec;90(6):2367-75. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.10.061.

We examined the role of the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain (598-616) of the MoMuLV Env in the Env-mediated membrane fusion and incorporation. The Env truncated at 616 exhibits maximum fusogenicity in cell-to-cell fusion assay. By comparison, full tail Env (632) and the Env truncated to residue 601 mediated fusion at 40%. The Envs truncated to residues 598 or 595 are not fusogenic. Progressive cytoplasmic tail truncation correlated with decreased Env incorporation into virions. Substitution of the domain 598-616 with an amphiphilic alpha-helix from melittin results in maximally fusogenic Envs that efficiently incorporated into transduction competent virions. However, substitution of the domain 598-616 with random or hydrophilic sequences caused loss of the Env fusogenicity and titer while retaining incorporation. Further, a secondary structure prediction analysis of 27 unrelated Env cytoplasmic tails indicates a common (23/27) propensity for an amphiphilic alpha-helical domain at immediate proximity to the viral membrane. These results support the suggestion that viral fusion is enhanced by a membrane-proximal cytoplasmic amphiphilic alpha-helix in Env tail.

The inhibitory effects of esculetin on cell viability were found to be associated with a G1 arrest in cell cycle progression that was concomitant with an inhibition of cyclin E and an induction of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21/WAF1/CIP1 in a p53-independent manner. Cells that were treated with esculetin showed increased binding of p21 with Cdk2 and Cdk4 that was paralleled by a marked decrease in the Cdk2 and Cdk4 kinase activities with no change in their expression. We also observed that down-regulation of the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) by this compound was associated with enhanced binding of pRB and the transcription factor E2F-1. Further investigation showed that inhibition of the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway reduced the induction of p21 and the inhibition of pRB phosphorylation and cyclin E expression by esculetin, which in turn overcame the G1 arrest and growth inhibition that was induced by esculetin. These data demonstrate that the ERK pathway participates in p21 induction and subsequently leads to a decrease in the kinase activity of Cdks and inhibition of pRB phosphorylation in esculetin-mediated G1 arrest of U937 cells.","['Lee, Shin Hwa', 'Park, Cheol', 'Jin, Cheng-Yun', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Moon, Sung-Kwon', 'Hyun, Jin Won', 'Lee, Won Ho', 'Choi, Byung Tae', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu', 'Yoo, Young Hyun', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Lee SH', 'Park C', 'Jin CY', 'Kim GY', 'Moon SK', 'Hyun JW', 'Lee WH', 'Choi BT', 'Kwon TK', 'Yoo YH', 'Choi YH']","['Korea Science Academy, Busan 614-822, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071228,France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Umbelliferones)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'SM2XD6V944 (esculetin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin E/biosynthesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/biosynthesis', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', '*G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells', 'Umbelliferones/*pharmacology']",2008/01/29 09:00,2009/01/20 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0753-3322(07)00279-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2007.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2008 Dec;62(10):723-9. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2007.12.001.

This work supports a crucial role for SOCS1 in regulation of dendritic cell-directed generation of memory T-cell responses.","['Aldrich, Melissa', 'Sanders, Denise', 'Lapteva, Natasha', 'Huang, Xue F', 'Chen, Si-Yi']","['Aldrich M', 'Sanders D', 'Lapteva N', 'Huang XF', 'Chen SY']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071207,Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-15 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', '*Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Interleukin-15 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Ovalbumin/immunology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*biosynthesis/*immunology']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/04/11 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0264-410X(07)01308-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.11.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 2008 Feb 20;26(8):1128-35. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.11.020.

In addition, SNPExpress allows concurrent interpretation of these items with Hidden-Markov Model (HMM) inferred Loss-of-Heterozygosity (LOH)- and copy number regions. CONCLUSION: The combined analyses with the easily accessible software tool SNPExpress will not only facilitate the recognition of recurrent genetic lesions, but also the identification of critical pathogenic genes.","['Sanders, Mathijs A', 'Verhaak, Roel G W', 'Geertsma-Kleinekoort, Wendy M C', 'Abbas, Saman', 'Horsman, Sebastiaan', 'van der Spek, Peter J', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Valk, Peter J M']","['Sanders MA', 'Verhaak RG', 'Geertsma-Kleinekoort WM', 'Abbas S', 'Horsman S', 'van der Spek PJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'Valk PJ']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. m.sanders@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080125,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Computer Simulation', '*Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/genetics', 'Markov Chains', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', '*Software']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2164-9-41 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-9-41 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2008 Jan 25;9:41. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-9-41.,,PMC2235842,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study patients were selected from an institutional database of 1061 patients with either ET (n = 603) or PV (n = 458). In both instances, three distinct groups were delineated and their presenting features compared; group A included patients who have remained AML/MDS/MF free after a minimum follow-up of 20 yr; groups B and C included patients who developed either AML/MDS or MF, respectively, in the first decade of their disease. RESULTS: The respective number of patients who fulfilled the above-mentioned criteria for inclusion in groups A, B and C were 40, 12 and 8 for ET and 23, 18 and 12 for PV. In ET, compared with both groups B and C, group A displayed significantly fewer patients with less than normal hemoglobin level (P < 0.0001 and =0.02) or male sex (P = 0.005 and 0.05), respectively. On multivariable analysis, only anemia sustained its significance. A similar analysis in PV revealed an association between group B and leukocytosis using a leukocyte count threshold of either 10 or 15 x 10(9)/L (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The current study identifies PV patients with leukocytosis and ET patients with anemia as the most likely to undergo leukemic or fibrotic transformation.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Wolanskyj, Alexandra P', 'Schwager, Susan', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Lasho, Terra L', 'Mesa, Ruben', 'McClure, Rebecca F', 'Li, Chin-Yang', 'Hanson, Curtis A']","['Tefferi A', 'Gangat N', 'Wolanskyj AP', 'Schwager S', 'Pardanani A', 'Lasho TL', 'Mesa R', 'McClure RF', 'Li CY', 'Hanson CA']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080123,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Fibrosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/04/29 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1038 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01038.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 May;80(5):386-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01038.x.

Fluconazole prophylaxis might increase the number of bacteraemias and cause outbreaks of non-albicans yeast infections. A retrospective single-centre study was conducted to investigate the effect of fluconazole prophylaxis on the incidence and the species of invasive candida infections and on the number of bacteraemias. METHODS: All 1089 adult acute leukaemia patients treated with chemotherapy in 1978-2004 at Helsinki University Central Hospital were included. Data of positive blood cultures, histological samples, and fungal cultures was collected from the patient charts and the microbiology laboratory database. Fluconazole prophylaxis was used in all patients from 2000 on. RESULTS: Invasive candida infection was diagnosed in 74 out of 847 patients (8.7%) treated without fluconazole prophylaxis and in four out of 242 patients (1.6%) receiving the prophylaxis (P < 0.001). The incidence of non-albicans infections did not increase in the fluconazole prophylaxis group. A larger proportion of patients developed bacteraemias in the prophylaxis group (65%) compared to the non-prophylaxis group (52%) (P < 0.001). A trend towards more gram-positive bacteraemias was seen in the prophylaxis group. Invasive candida infections were more common in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia than those with acute myeloid leukaemia, 10.5% vs. 5.9% (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Fluconazole prophylaxis was effective in preventing invasive candida infections in patients with acute leukaemia without increasing non-albicans infections. The risk of bacteraemias, however, increased.","['Nihtinen, Anne', 'Anttila, Veli-Jukka', 'Elonen, Erkki', 'Juvonen, Eeva', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Ruutu, Tapani']","['Nihtinen A', 'Anttila VJ', 'Elonen E', 'Juvonen E', 'Volin L', 'Ruutu T']","['Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. anne.nihtinen@hus.fi']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080123,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bacteremia/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Candidiasis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Fluconazole/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/04/29 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1041 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01041.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 May;80(5):391-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01041.x.

However, together with the widespread use of central venous lines, they are also considered the main risk factors for the growing number of thromboembolic complications in this population. The rate of thrombosis that was observed in 17 prospective studies was 5.2%. Due to the high survival rate, it is relevant to apply strategies to the long term survivors who overcome the disease but who experience thromboembolic complications. Specific treatment includes anticoagulants, especially unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins, and thrombolytic drugs in few cases. Guidelines for the treatment of thrombosis in childhood only became available recently, but they do not include specific clinical subsets such as children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The problems involved in scheduling thrombosis treatment in children with malignancy have recently been discussed, however the paper does not provide practical diagnostic schemes or treatment schedules. Some important questions regarding optimal prevention and treatment are still unanswered. Moreover, antithrombotic therapy in these patients is quite challenging owing to the higher risk of bleeding.

They are essentially required for the hematopoietic homeostasis. In this context HSC do not only need to replenish peripheral blood cells of all lineages, but also have to keep their pool relatively constant. Since disruption of the underlying control mechanisms can lead to degeneration or expansion of the HSC-pool as it occurs after irradiation or in leukemia, it is an important concern to unveil mechanisms that govern the decision of self-renewal versus differentiation in HSC-biology. There is good evidence that certain extrinsic cues provided in a special environment, the HSC-niches, essentially take part in regulating the HSC-pool in vivo and might also be involved in leukemogenesis. Apart from that, asymmetric cell divisions seem to be another control instance in hematopoietic homeostasis. It has been shown that siblings of primitive hematopoietic cells often adopt different cell fates, and very recently we identified four proteins that segregate asymmetrically in a proportion of dividing primitive hematopoietic cells. Whether asymmetric cell division participates in leukemogenesis, remains to be investigated. However, on the example of neural stem cells of the Drosophila larvae, the neuroblasts, asymmetrically segregating molecules have been identified, i.e. the tumor suppressor protein Brat and the transcription factor Prospero, that are required to suppress self-renewal in one of the arising daughter cells and whose loss of function results in tumor formation. These findings provide an attractive model of how defects in the process of asymmetric cell divisions might transform normal HSC/HPC into leukemic cells.","['Giebel, Bernd', 'Bruns, Ingmar']","['Giebel B', 'Bruns I']","['Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Heinrich-Heine-University, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany. giebel@itz.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Drosophila/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Stem Cells/*physiology']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/157488808783489444 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2008 Jan;3(1):9-16. doi: 10.2174/157488808783489444.,126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These diseases harbour a pathological bone marrow stem cell which overwhelms normal stem cells due to sustained and uncontrolled proliferation. By clonal evolution, acute leukaemia or bone marrow fibrosis evolve in a proportion of cases with as yet unknown underlying mechanisms. Previously, groundbreaking investigations in Ph(-) CMPD detected an acquired mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) in the majority of patients with polycythaemia vera (PV) and in up to 50% of patients with essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF). Unlike the stem cell defect in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia only a subfraction of clonally proliferating haematopoiesis may be affected by the JAK2 mutation. More recently, another mutation in the juxtamembrane domain of the thrombopoietin receptor Mpl was discovered in about 5% of patients with CIMF and ET. In accordance with the uncontrolled Abl kinase activity in Ph(+) chronic myloid leukaemia these mutations in Ph(-) CMPD apparently represent a key to unlock some of the as yet unknown basic molecular defects and this raises hope for an upcoming efficient targeted therapy. However, neither the JAK2(V617F) nor the Mpl(W515L/K) provide the initiating molecular events. Moreover, apart from distinction between reactive and neoplastic lesions, detection of these mutations does not allow a clear-cut discrimination between the particular subtypes.

Primary bone marrow failure syndromes are a heterogeneous group of diseases with specific pathogenic mechanisms, which share a profound impairment of the hematopoietic stem cell pool resulting in global or selective marrow aplasia. Constitutional marrow failure syndromes are conditions caused by intrinsic defects of HSCs; they are due to inherited germline mutations accounting for specific phenotypes, and often involve also organs and systems other than hematopoiesis. By contrast, in acquired marrow failure syndromes hematopoietic stem cells are thought to be intrinsically normal, but subjected to an extrinsic damage affecting their hematopoietic function. Direct toxicity by chemicals or radiation, as well as association with viruses and other infectious agents, can be sometimes demonstrated. In idiopathic Aplastic Anemia (AA) immunological mechanisms play a pivotal role in damaging the hematopoietic compartment, resulting in a depletion of the hematopoietic stem cell pool. Clinical and experimental evidences support the presence of a T cell-mediated immune attack, as confirmed by clonally expanded lymphocytes, even if the target antigens are still undefined. However, this simple model has to be integrated with recent data showing that, even in presence of an extrinsic damage, preexisting mutations or polymorphisms of genes may constitute a genetic propensity to develop marrow failure. Other recent data suggest that similar antigen-driven immune mechanisms may be involved in marrow failure associated with lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disorders characterized by clonal expansion of T lymphocytes, such as Large Granular Lymphocyte leukemia. In this wide spectrum, a unique and intriguing condition is Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH); even in presence of a somatic mutation of the PIG-A gene carried by one or more HSCs and their progeny, the typical marrow failure in PNH is likely due to pathogenic mechanisms similar to those involved in AA, and not to the intrinsic abnormality conferred to the clonal population by the PIG-A mutation. The study of hematopoietic stem cell function in marrow failure syndromes provides hints for specific molecular pathways disturbed in many diseases of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic stem cells. Beyond the specific interest of investigators involved in the field of these rare diseases, marrow failure syndromes represent a model that provides intriguing insight into quantity and function of normal hematopoietic stem cells, improving our knowledge on stem cell biology.","['Risitano, Antonio M', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Selleri, Carmine', 'Rotoli, Bruno']","['Risitano AM', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Selleri C', 'Rotoli B']","['Division of Hematology, Federico II University of Naples, Via Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy. amrisita@unina.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/pathology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/pathology', 'Syndrome']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/157488807779316982 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2007 Jan;2(1):39-52. doi: 10.2174/157488807779316982.,146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It controls the intracellular levels of short-lived and regulatory proteins, which are important for a variety of basic cellular processes. The pathway involves an enzymatic cascade through which multiple 76-amino acid ubiquitin monomers are covalently attached via a three-step process to the protein substrate, which is then degraded by the 26S proteasome complex. The proteasome is a cylindrical organelle that recognizes ubiquitinated proteins, degrades a large proportion of intracellular proteins, and recycles ubiquitin. Alterations in the proteasome proteolytic pathway have been thought to contribute to protein alterations associated with aging and, in fact, dysregulation of the UPS has been linked to several disease states including neurodegenerative diseases, malignancies, and inflammatory-related disorders. Strong preclinical data now exist supporting the use of reversible proteasome inhibitors to treat a variety of disease states including cancer, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, myocardial infarction, and ischemic brain injury. Bortezomib (Velcade) has recently been licensed for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and is also undergoing further evaluation for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and a variety of solid tumors.

Apoptosis and necrosis were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy using the chromatin stain Hoechst 33258, agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA, and determination of caspase 3 enzymatic activity. The 1H-NMR experiments revealed that the spectra of both samples containing apoptotic cells were characterized by the same trend of several important metabolites. Specifically, an increase in CH2 and CH3 mobile lipids, principally of CH2, decreases in glutamine and glutamate, choline-containing metabolites, taurine and reduced glutathione were observed. By contrast, the sample containing necrotic cells presented a completely different profile of 1H-NMR metabolites since it was characterized by a significant increase in all the metabolites examined, with the exception of CH2 mobile lipids, which remain unchanged, and reduced glutathione, which decreased. The results suggest that variations in 1H-NMR metabolites are specific to apoptosis independent of the physical or chemical nature of the stimulus used to induce this mode of cell death, while cells dying from necrosis are characterized by a completely different behavior of the same metabolites.","['Rainaldi, Gabriella', 'Romano, Rocco', 'Indovina, Paola', 'Ferrante, Antonella', 'Motta, Andrea', 'Indovina, Pietro Luigi', 'Santini, Maria Teresa']","['Rainaldi G', 'Romano R', 'Indovina P', 'Ferrante A', 'Motta A', 'Indovina PL', 'Santini MT']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia, Oncologia e Medicina Molecolare, Instituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Protons)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cytotoxins/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods', 'Necrosis/*metabolism', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dosage']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/03/29 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2007/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['RR0958 [pii]', '10.1667/RR0958.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2008 Feb;169(2):170-80. doi: 10.1667/RR0958.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, a variety of techniques such as microarray has evolved to monitor the transcript abundance for all of the organism's genes rapidly and efficiently. Behind the massive numbers produced by these techniques, which amount to hundreds of data points for thousands or tens of thousands of genes, there hides an immense amount of biological information. The importance of microarray data analysis lies in presenting functional annotations and classifications. The process of the functional classifications is conducted as follows. The first step is to cluster gene expression data. Cluster 3.0 and Java Treeview are widely used open-source programs to group together genes with similar pattern of expressions, and to provide a computational and graphical environment for analyzing data from DNA microarray experiments, or other genomic datasets. Clustered genes can later be decoded by Bulk Gene Searching Systems in Java (BGSSJ). BGSSJ is an XML-based Java application that systemizes lists of interesting genes and proteins for biological interpretation in the context of the gene ontology. Gene ontology gathers information for molecular function, biological processes, and cellular components with a number of different organisms. In this chapter, in terms of how to use Cluster 3.0 and Java Treeview for microarray data clustering, and BGSSJ for functional classification are explained in detail.","['Juan, Hsueh-Fen', 'Huang, Hsuan-Cheng']","['Juan HF', 'Huang HC']","['Department of Life Science, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, National Taiwan University, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/*methods', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Software', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2008/01/29 09:00,2008/03/12 09:00,['2008/01/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-304-2_25 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2007;382:405-16. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-304-2_25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2000-2007 a prospective clinicoepidemiological trial was made to detect markers of HBV infection among 303 patients 15 to 76 years of age treated in the department of acute leukemia chemotherapy of N.N. Burdenko Military Hospital for acute lymphoid and myeloblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia in a blastic crisis, myelodysplastic syndrome in blast transformation, lymphoproliferative diseases with bone marrow affection.

METHODS: Retrospective study between January 2003 and April 2007 was carried out in the PICU. Every child with a laboratory-confirmed viral infection was included. RESULTS: 54 viruses were identified in 49 children (27 M, 22 F) over a 52-month period. The three respiratory virus species, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 17), influenza (n = 13) and parainfluenza (n = 12), accounted for 86% of these 49 cases. PICU admissions due to influenza A (n = 10) were more common than influenza B (n = 3), whereas parainfluenza type 3 (n = 7) was the commonest subtype of parainfluenza infection. Comparing these three common viruses, the mean age of children admitted with RSV was lower than with influenza or parainfluenza (1.2 years vs. 5.6 years vs. 2.4 years, P = 0.003). Pre-existing conditions such as prematurity and chronic lung disease were only present in children with RSV infection. These respiratory viruses caused both upper (croup) and lower respiratory tract diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia). Extrapulmonary presentations were less prevalent and included encephalitis, seizures, cardiac arrest, coexisting diabetes ketoacidosis and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One patient with RSV and another with influenza A died during their PICU stay. Nearly half of these patients required ventilatory support or received systemic corticosteroids, and 88% received initial broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. Approximately one in five of them had nebulised adrenaline, airway endoscopies or bacterial co-infections. Adenovirus was isolated in four patients and two (both with adenovirus type 3) died during the PICU stay.

Many of these molecules are expressed in other cell types (principally B cells), but the adaptor protein CD2AP was essentially restricted to pDCs, and is therefore a novel immunohistologic marker for use in tissue biopsies. We found little evidence for activation-associated morphologic or phenotypic changes in conditions where pDCs are greatly increased (eg, Kikuchi disease).

A better understanding of the financial burden that cancer places on Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) is important for helping policy makers to plan under scarce healthcare resources. This study attempts to estimate lifetime health expenditure for patients with 17 types of major cancers. METHODS: A total of 425,294 patients, each of whom was registered in Taiwan during 1990 to 2001 as having one of 17 major types of cancers, were included. All of them were followed until the end of 2004. Monte Carlo simulation was used to extrapolate survival for up to 600 months to derive the life expectancy or lifetime survival function after diagnosis for different cancers. The average annual health expenditure per case for each cancer type was calculated by using data from the NHI's reimbursement database. The lifetime health expenditure per case was estimated by multiplying the monthly survival probability by the average monthly health expenditure, adjusting for the annual discount rate and the medical care inflation rate. By incorporating the number of annual incidence cases, the total lifetime health expenditure can also be estimated. RESULTS: Of the 17 cancers studied, it was found that leukemia had the highest average annual health expenditure per case (207,000 TWD) as well as the highest lifetime health expenditure per case (2,404,000 TWD, without discounting adjustment). Breast cancer had the highest total lifetime health expenditure (5046 million TWD) because of the longer life expectancy and chronic morbidity. Furthermore, colorectal cancer had the second highest total lifetime health expenditure (4995 million TWD) due to its high incidence. CONCLUSION: The proposed method is a feasible way of estimating lifetime health expenditure for cancer patients even under high censoring rates. This would be helpful for cost-effectiveness assessment of cancer prevention programs and for policy planning.","['Chu, Po-Ching', 'Hwang, Jing-Shiang', 'Wang, Jung-Der', 'Chang, Yu-Yin']","['Chu PC', 'Hwang JS', 'Wang JD', 'Chang YY']","['Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,,IM,"['*Health Expenditures', 'Humans', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'National Health Programs/*economics', 'Neoplasms/*economics/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Survival Analysis', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",2008/01/26 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/01/26 09:00'],"['2008/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0929-6646(08)60008-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0929-6646(08)60008-X [doi]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2008 Jan;107(1):54-63. doi: 10.1016/S0929-6646(08)60008-X.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taken together, the results suggest that DHMEQ may be useful for treatment of inflammatory diseases, including graft-versus-host disease after allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Nishioka, Chie', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Jing, Yang', 'Umezawa, Kazuo', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Nishioka C', 'Ikezoe T', 'Jing Y', 'Umezawa K', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Kochi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080123,England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclohexanones)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclohexanones/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Phytohemagglutinins/immunology', 'Th1 Cells/drug effects/immunology']",2008/01/26 09:00,2008/06/10 09:00,['2008/01/26 09:00'],"['2008/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['IMM2755 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02755.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2008 Jun;124(2):198-205. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02755.x.

On immunohistochemistry with an anti-NPBC antibody, the nuclei were positively stained in 22 and 18 of AML and MDS specimens, respectively. Staining of nuclear NPBC was associated with AML subtypes (M6 and M7), low complete remission (CR) rate, and poor prognosis. Nuclear NPBC was also associated with a high score when using the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for MDS and with -7/-7q and complex karyotypes.

One of the most important of them is cardiac hypertrophy. The knowledge, which factors contribute to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy caused by physical exercise is still incomplete. Interleukin 6 (IL6) secreted by contracting skeletal muscles may affect cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of IL6 in exercise induced cardiac hypertrophy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Female mice lacking functional IL6 gene C57BL6/J(IL6-/-tm1Kopf) (IL6KO) and age and sex matched controls C57BL6/J (WT) were subjected to 6 week swimming regime. Twenty-four hours after the last training session the mice were sacrificed, hearts were excised and weighed. Two other groups of sex and strain matched mice (9 in each group) not subjected to physical training, were sacrificed and served as controls. Weights of the heart and the left ventricle were related independently to the body weight and the tibia length as measures of hypertrophy. Statistical analysis was performed using multifactorial ANOVA and the Fisher test. RESULTS: There was significantly higher heart/body weight ratio in both groups of mice which were trained as compared to the respective sedentary animals [F(3,30) = 31.085 p < 0.001] There were, however, no significant differences between respective WT and IL6KO groups. Similar relations were found for the left ventricle and also when the weights of the heart and the LV were related to the tibia length. CONCLUSION: IL6 is not necessary for cardiac hypertrophy induced by prolonged moderate physical exercise in mice. Additional study is warranted to elucidate this phenomenon.","['Kaminski, K A', 'Oledzka, E', 'Bialobrzewska, K', 'Kozuch, M', 'Musial, W J', 'Winnicka, M M']","['Kaminski KA', 'Oledzka E', 'Bialobrzewska K', 'Kozuch M', 'Musial WJ', 'Winnicka MM']","['Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Bialystok, ul.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: PMNs were isolated from 20 patients with B-CLL. Total nitrite was measured in cell supernatants and serum by Griess method. The generation of superoxide anion radical by cells was estimated using cytochrom-c reduction test. The cGMP level in cell supernatants and plasma was assessed by ELISA kit whereas serum MDA level using a spectrophotometric assay by Guege and Aus. RESULTS: The PMNs in B-CLL patients were characterised by impaired NO generation and enhanced cGMP production. Contrary to the control group, no significant effect was found of rhlL-15 and rhIL-18 on the release of these mediators by PMNs. Superoxide anion radical release by PMNs was decrease. Serum MDA and plasma cGMP levels were elevated in B-CLL patients as compared to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced production of nitric oxide and superoxide anion radicals by PMNs in B-CLL may impair the cytotoxic effect of neutrophils on leukaemic B cells. Low secretion of nitric oxide by PMNs and high levels of cGMP in PMN supernatants suggest that activation of guanyl cyclase (sGC) in these patients may occur in the presence of agents other than nitric oxide. Moreover, the findings indicate the enhancement of lipid peroxidation with the progression of the neoplastic process in B-CLL patients.","['Jablonska, E', 'Kiersnowska-Rogowska, B', 'Ratajczak, W', 'Rogowski, F', 'Sawicka-Powierza, J']","['Jablonska E', 'Kiersnowska-Rogowska B', 'Ratajczak W', 'Rogowski F', 'Sawicka-Powierza J']","['Department of Immunology, Medical University of Bialystok, ul.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 43 children suffering from ALL, we observed 7 cases of relapse. We studied the serum levels IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-2 (expressed in SDS) in a subgroup with relapse (A) and in a subgroup without relapse (B) at diagnosis (1), after induction of remission (2) and after intensive chemotherapy (3). All comparisons were made with age-and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: It was found that in subgroup A, the values of IGFBP-2 remained high at each stage of the investigation: 3.92 +/- 2.50 (1) 3.68 +/- 0.99 (2) 3.52 +/- 1.26 (3), whereas in the subgroup B they underwent a significant reduction from 3.87 +/- 1.86 (1) 3.45 +/- 1.25 (2) 2.15 +/- 1.84 (3), p = 0.02. In comparison to a control group, the correlations between IGF-I and IGFBP-3, and IGF-1 and IGFBP-2 were disturbed for the whole group of children at each stage of the investigation. However, at diagnosis we obserwed a negative correlation between IGFBP-2 and hemoglobin (r = -0.57 p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Increased values of IGFBP-2 after intensive chemotherapy in children who subsequently underwent a relapse of the disease, suggest that IGFBP-2 levels might constitute a prognosis factor. However, this requires verification with a larger group of children. The negative correlation between values of hemoglobin and IGFBP-2 observed at diagnosis might further suggest the involvement of this protein in the process of leukemogenesis in children.","['Kitszel, A', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, M']","['Kitszel A', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Medical University of Bialystok, ul.

The primary objective of the study was to establish the maximum tolerated dose of 3-AP when given in combination with a fixed dose of cytarabine. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-five patients with relapsed or refractory myeloid leukemia were enrolled to three dose levels of 3-AP. Cytarabine was administered as a 2 h infusion at a fixed dose of 1,000 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days. Escalating doses of 3-AP as a 2 h infusion were administered on days 2 through 5. The 3-AP infusion preceded the start of the cytarabine infusion by 4 h. RESULTS: In general, the toxicities observed with the combination were similar to the expected toxicity profile for cytarabine when utilized as a single agent at this dose and schedule. However, two of three patients developed dose-limiting methemoglobinemia at the highest 3-AP dose studied (100 mg/m2). Transient reversible methemoglobinemia was documented in 11 of 15 patients enrolled at the 75 mg/ m2 dose level. Objective evidence of clinical activity was observed in four patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 3-AP and cytarabine given on this schedule is feasible in advanced myeloid leukemia. The recommended Phase II dose is 75 mg/m2/day of 3-AP on days 2-5 given prior to cytarabine administered at a dose of 1,000 mg/m2/day over 5 consecutive days. Methemoglobinemia is a common toxicity of this combination and requires close monitoring.","['Odenike, Olatoyosi M', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Gajria, Devika', 'Dolan, M Eileen', 'Delaney, Shannon M', 'Karrison, Theodore G', 'Ratain, Mark J', 'Stock, Wendy']","['Odenike OM', 'Larson RA', 'Gajria D', 'Dolan ME', 'Delaney SM', 'Karrison TG', 'Ratain MJ', 'Stock W']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, 5841 S.

The receptors of these four neuropeptides are known to be over expressed in various cancers. We have found the presence of native neuropeptides in the culture supernatant of the primary tumor cells of human colon adenocarcinomas. It was further demonstrated by receptor-ligand assays that not only do these tumor cells synthesize and secrete four peptide hormones but also possess specific high affinity receptors on their surface. Screening a large panel of analogs to the four peptide hormones on tumor cell proliferation led to the identification of four cytotoxic analogs, the combination of which was code-named DRF7295. The design and synthesis of the peptide analogs have been described in this paper. In vitro anticancer activity of DRF7295 was studied in a large panel of human tumor cells. Gastrointestinal tumor cells of the colon, pancreas and duodenum were found to be most sensitive to DRF7295 with moderate activity seen in glioblastoma, prostate, leukemia and those of oral cancer cells. Efficacy studies in xenograft models of colon and duodenum resulted in T/C% of less than 40%, which is indicative of strong tumor regressing potential of DRF7295 in gastrointestinal cancers. Acute and long-term toxicity studies as well as safety pharmacology studies conducted indicate the safety of the drug upon systemic administration with no significant adverse pharmacological effects.","['Jaggi, Manu', 'Prasad, Sudhanand', 'Singh, Anu T', 'Praveen, R', 'Dutt, Sarjana', 'Mathur, Archana', 'Sharma, Rajan', 'Gupta, Neena', 'Ahuja, Rinku', 'Mukherjee, Rama', 'Burman, Anand C']","['Jaggi M', 'Prasad S', 'Singh AT', 'Praveen R', 'Dutt S', 'Mathur A', 'Sharma R', 'Gupta N', 'Ahuja R', 'Mukherjee R', 'Burman AC']","['Dabur Research Foundation, 22 Site IV, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, 201010, India. jaggim@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080124,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DRF 7295)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Bombesin)', '0 (Receptors, Neurokinin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Somatostatin)', '0 (Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', 'PX9AZU7QPK (Bombesin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Bombesin/analogs & derivatives', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Combinations', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Peptides/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Bombesin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Neurokinin-1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Somatostatin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/drug effects/metabolism', 'Somatostatin/analogs & derivatives', 'Substance P/analogs & derivatives', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/analogs & derivatives', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/01/25 09:00,2009/01/27 09:00,['2008/01/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10637-008-9117-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2008 Dec;26(6):489-504. doi: 10.1007/s10637-008-9117-4.

It is only recently that the interactions between platelets and AML cells have been characterized in detail, and studies show that; i) platelets and AML blasts can affect functional characteristic of each other, ii) chemotherapeutic drugs frequently used in AML therapy can alter several platelet functions, iii) the systemic levels of various cytokines are enhanced during AML chemotherapy, including cytokines known to affect both leukemic blasts and platelet activation, and iv) platelet secretion of growth factors are clearly detected in peripheral blood stem cells autografts.

Bone marrow-derived DNA from 199 patients with PMF was subjected to qualitative (n=199) and quantitative (n=129) analysis for V617F. Mutational frequency was 58% and median mutant allele burden ratio in V617F-positive patients was 29% (range, 1-74%). Multivariable analysis identified older age, platelet count > or =100 x 10(9) l(-1) and peripheral blood blast percentage <3% as being associated with a positive mutational status. The mere presence of the mutation did not affect the incidence of thrombosis (P=0.78), overall survival (P=0.22) or leukemia-free survival (P=0.5). The 129 patients with allele burden information were divided into four groups: V617F-negative (n=53) and V617F-positive with mutant allele burden in the lower quartile (n=19), middle quartiles (n=38) or upper quartile (n=19) range. Kaplan-Meier plots revealed significantly shortened overall (P=0.0008) and leukemia-free (P=0.01) survival for the lower quartile, but not for upper quartile allele burden group; independent prognostic relevance was validated by multivariable analysis.

This sequential treatment can lead to BCR-ABL mutations conferring broad resistance to kinase inhibitors. To model the evolution of resistance, we exposed the mouse DA1-3b BCR-ABL(+) leukemic cell line to imatinib for several months, and obtained resistant cells carrying the E255K mutation. We then exposed these cells to dasatinib, and obtained dasatinib-resistant cells with composite E255K+T315I mutations. Subcloning isolated a minor clone also carrying V299L. In co-culture, mutated cells were able to spread resistance to non-mutated cells through overexpression of interleukin 3, activation of MEK/ERK and JAK2/STAT5 pathways, and downregulation of Bim. Even the presence of less than 10% of mutated cells was sufficient to protect non-mutated cells. Blocking JAK2 and MEK1/2 inhibited the protective effect of co-culture. Mutated cells were also sensitive to JAK2 inhibition, but blocking MEK1/2 alone, or in association with kinase inhibitors, had little effect. These data indicate that sequential Abl kinase inhibitor therapy can generate sub-populations of mutated cells, which may coexist with non-mutated cells and protect them through a paracrine mechanism. Targeting JAK2 could eliminate both populations.","['Liu, J', 'Joha, S', 'Idziorek, T', 'Corm, S', 'Hetuin, D', 'Philippe, N', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Quesnel, B']","['Liu J', 'Joha S', 'Idziorek T', 'Corm S', 'Hetuin D', 'Philippe N', 'Preudhomme C', 'Quesnel B']","['INSERM, Unite 837, Equipe 3, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080124,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dasatinib', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-3', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Models, Animal', '*Mutation, Missense', '*Paracrine Communication', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2008/01/25 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/01/25 09:00'],"['2008/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu20083 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Apr;22(4):791-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.3.

Ph+ leukemia cells are highly resistant to apoptosis, and evidence from cell lines and primary cells suggest Bcl-xL as a critical mediator of resistance to apoptosis: however, this concept has never been rigorously tested in an animal model. To clarify the role of Bcl-xL in Ph+ B-ALL, we generated 2 mouse models. In the first model, Ph+ B-ALL and loss of Bcl-xL expression are coinduced; in the second model, leukemia is induced with expression of Bcl-xL protein well above the levels found in wild-type lymphoblasts. Deletion of Bcl-xL did not inhibit leukemogenesis or affect apoptosis, but increased cellular proliferation. Consistent with this result, overexpression of Bcl-xL led to decreased cellular proliferation.

The current study investigated the role of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 in the chemotactic transmigration of ATRA-treated NB4 (ATRA-NB4) APL cells toward A549 alveolar epithelial cells. NB4 and A549 cells were separately cultured with ATRA and/or dexamethasone (DEX). ATRA-NB4 cells were then placed in an upper insert and co-incubated with A549 cells or their conditioned medium (CM) located in a lower plate to test their transmigration activity. ATRA stimulated NB4 cells to transmigrate toward the A549 cells. The secretion of MCP-1 was enhanced by ATRA treatment in both A549 and NB4 cells. The binding assay demonstrated that ATRA-NB4 cells bound MCP-1. Pre-treatment of both CM-A549 cells with antibodies against MCP-1 and of ATRA-NB4 cells with antibodies against MCP-1 receptors reduced ATRA-NB4 cell transmigration. DEX did not suppress MCP-1 secretion and transmigration in ATRA-NB4 cells, although when applied to A549 cells, MCP-1 secretion was suppressed and ATRA-NB4 cell transmigration was attenuated. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 secreted from alveolar epithelial cells plays an important role in the cell-cell interaction involved in the chemotactic transmigration of all-trans retinoic acid-treated acute promyelocytic leukaemia cells toward alveolar epithelial cells.","['Tsai, W-H', 'Shih, C-H', 'Lin, C-C', 'Ho, C-K', 'Hsu, F-C', 'Hsu, H-C']","['Tsai WH', 'Shih CH', 'Lin CC', 'Ho CK', 'Hsu FC', 'Hsu HC']","['Dept of Physiology, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080123,England,Eur Respir J,The European respiratory journal,8803460,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Receptors, CCR2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis/*drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Epithelial Cells/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/cytology/drug effects', 'Receptors, CCR2', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects']",2008/01/25 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/01/25 09:00'],"['2008/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['09031936.00135707 [pii]', '10.1183/09031936.00135707 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Respir J. 2008 May;31(5):957-62. doi: 10.1183/09031936.00135707.

Outcomes of 118 patients receiving HCT and reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research were compared with 132 similar patients receiving chemotherapy selected from 8 German AML Intergroup multicenter trials. Characteristics of the cohorts were similar except that chemotherapy recipients were significantly older. To adjust for time to treatment bias, outcomes were compared using left-truncated Cox regression models. Transplants were associated with higher treatment-related mortality (TRM; relative risk [RR] 6.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.95-15.45, P < .001), lower relapse (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.25-0.85, P = .01), and similar relapse-free survival (P = .2). Loss of sex chromosomes (LOS) in addition to t(8;21) had a negative impact on overall survival (OS) in patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients without LOS experienced shorter survival after HCT comparing to chemotherapy (RR 3.05, P = .02), whereas patients with LOS had similar survival regardless of postremission therapy. In both cohorts, white blood cell count (WBC) at diagnosis >25 x 10(9)/L was associated with a higher relapse risk (RR = 2.09, P = .03), lower relapse-free (RR = 1.9, P = .008), and OS (RR = 1.91, P = .01). In this cohort of patients with t(8;21) AML, HCT did not improve OS, because reduction of relapse was offset by high TRM. In the group without LOS, survival after chemotherapy was far superior to HCT. These results suggest that patients with t(8;21) AML without poor prognostic factors have higher rates of survival after chemotherapy as a post remission therapy compared to HCT.","['Schlenk, Richard F', 'Pasquini, Marcelo C', 'Perez, Waleska S', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Bolwell, Brian J', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Copelan, Edward A', 'Cutler, Corey S', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Ilhan, Osman', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Liesveld, Jane L', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Marks, David I', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'McCarthy, Philip L', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Ganser, Arnold']","['Schlenk RF', 'Pasquini MC', 'Perez WS', 'Zhang MJ', 'Krauter J', 'Antin JH', 'Bashey A', 'Bolwell BJ', 'Buchner T', 'Cahn JY', 'Cairo MS', 'Copelan EA', 'Cutler CS', 'Dohner H', 'Gale RP', 'Ilhan O', 'Lazarus HM', 'Liesveld JL', 'Litzow MR', 'Marks DI', 'Maziarz RT', 'McCarthy PL', 'Nimer SD', 'Sierra J', 'Tallman MS', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Horowitz MM', 'Ganser A']","['University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20071220,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Siblings', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/01/25 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/01/25 09:00'],"['2007/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(07)00528-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.10.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Feb;14(2):187-96. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.10.006.

We analyzed the outcome of RIC HSCT in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients over the age of 40 years. Forty-three AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients were treated with a fludarabine and low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI)-based pretransplantation regimen. Donors were HLA-compatible sibling (68%) or unrelated volunteers (34%). All but 2 AML patients were in complete remission (CR) at the time of transplantation. Seventy-six percent of patients had a poor risk profile. Hematologic recovery was fast, and primary graft failure occurred in 1 patient. Two patients with active disease at the time of HSCT experienced ongoing relapse. Infections were diagnosed in 9 patients (21%), and 6 patients (14%) were treated for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. Sixty percent of patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), which was grade II in 40% and grade III in 12%. The cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) was 33% at 1 and at 2 years. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was low (9%), total nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 19%.

In vitro, dasatinib is 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type BCR-ABL. The efficacy and tolerability of oral dasatinib has been established in the START phase II trials in adults with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL) who were intolerant or resistant to imatinib, and optimal dasatinib dosage regimens were identified in phase III randomized trials. In patients with chronic phase CML, the major cytogenetic response rate in the START-C trial (median follow-up 15.2 months) was 59% with dasatinib, and in the randomized START-R trial (median follow-up 15 months), was greater with dasatinib than with high-dose imatinib (52% vs 33%). Major hematologic response rates with dasatinib were 63% in patients with accelerated phase CML (follow-up > or =9 months; START-A trial), 34% in patients with myeloid blast phase CML and 35% in those with lymphoid blast phase CML (follow-up > or =12 months; START-B and START-L trials), and 41% in patients with Ph-positive ALL (follow-up > or =12 months; START-L trial). Based on phase III results, a once-daily dasatinib regimen is considered optimal in chronic phase CML (starting dosage 100 mg once daily), while a twice-daily regimen continues to be recommended in accelerated phase, myeloid blast phase or lymphoid blast phase CML and Ph-positive ALL (starting dosage 70 mg twice daily).

Except the lethal effect of acute nickel poison, chronic nickel exposure is also harmful to humans, but the mechanism of chronic nickel-induced cytotoxicity remains unclear. Here, we found that long-term exposure of Ni(2+) led to significant DNA fragmentation, cell death, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in human leukemia HL-60 cells. Induction of Ni(2+) on DNA fragmentation and cell death could be prevented by the antioxidants ascorbic acid (ASA) or N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), or enhanced by H(2)O(2), indicating the involvement of ROS generation in the chronic nickel cytotoxicity in cells. Long-term exposure of mice to low Ni(2+) also led to a significant increase in both the ROS generation in the serum and the DNA fragmentation in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), while coadministration of ASA with Ni(2+) together significantly decreased both the DNA fragmentation and the ROS generation. Collectively, these results proved that ROS generation is at least one mechanism of the cytotoxicity of chronic nickel exposure, while ASA is probably useful for people to prevent the chronic nickel cytotoxicity, especially for those who work or live near a mining area or a factory related with nickel.","['Jia, Jie', 'Chen, Jie']","['Jia J', 'Chen J']","['Shanxi Vocational Poly-tech College, Taiyuan 030006, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Environ Toxicol,Environmental toxicology,100885357,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '7OV03QG267 (Nickel)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death', '*DNA Fragmentation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nickel/*toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2008/01/25 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/01/25 09:00'],"['2008/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tox.20346 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Toxicol. 2008 Jun;23(3):401-6. doi: 10.1002/tox.20346.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we tested whether T cells were required for antitumor effects of agonistic anti-CD40 mAb (alphaCD40) against immunogenic versus poorly immunogenic tumors. Treatment of mice bearing poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma and its more immunogenic variant, B16-hsp72.1, with alphaCD40 resulted in a similar level of tumor growth suppression. Depletion of T cells did not reduce the antitumor effects in these 2 tumor models. To generate antitumor T cell responses, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with irradiated B16-hsp72.1. Treatment of these vaccinated mice challenged with a high dose of B16-hsp72.1 tumor cells with alphaCD40 induced tumor growth suppression, which was reduced by T-cell depletion, demonstrating that T cells were involved in the antitumor effect of alphaCD40. However, immunized mice depleted of T cells and treated with alphaCD40 were still able to suppress tumor growth as compared to tumor growth in immunized, T cell-depleted mice not treated with alphaCD40, suggesting that T cells were not required for the antitumor effect of alphaCD40. To confirm a lack of correlation between tumor immunogenicity and T-cell requirement in antitumor effects of CD40 ligation, we found that alphaCD40 induced tumor growth suppression in nude and SCID/beige mice bearing highly immunogenic tumors such as Meth A sarcoma, suggesting that macrophages may play a role. Indeed, both poorly immunogenic and highly immunogenic tumors were sensitive to in vitro growth inhibition by macrophages from alphaCD40-treated mice. Taken together, our results indicate that antitumor effects induced by alphaCD40, even against immunogenic tumors, can be observed in the absence of T cells and may involve macrophages.","['Rakhmilevich, Alexander L', 'Buhtoiarov, Ilia N', 'Malkovsky, Miroslav', 'Sondel, Paul M']","['Rakhmilevich AL', 'Buhtoiarov IN', 'Malkovsky M', 'Sondel PM']","['The Department of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin, K4/413 Clinical Science Center, 600 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI 53792, USA. rakhmil@humonc.wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080124,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', '*Immunotherapy', 'Kidney Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2008/01/25 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/01/25 09:00'],"['2007/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-007-0447-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2008 Aug;57(8):1151-60. doi: 10.1007/s00262-007-0447-4.

Eight pediatric oncology units from Algeria, Cameroon, Madagascar, Morocco, Tunisia, and Senegal have been involved. METHODS: Patients less than 18 years with cytology or histology proven B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma were included. Two LMB89 modified regimens were proposed (MAT and GFA). RESULTS: From April 2001 to April 2004, 343 cases were registered. Thirty seven patients were excluded. Thirteen patients were stage I, 26 stage II, 209 stage III and 50 stage IV including 8 L3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL3) cases. Three year OS of the whole population of patients is 61%. In GFA group 36 months OS is 63.6% in stages I/II, 51.6% in stage III and 35.8% in stage IV. In MAT group, the OS is 84.4% in stages I/II, 76.2% in stage III and 55.6% in stage IV. Seventy one patients died during treatment, 32 at pre-induction phase, 27 at induction and 12 at consolidation. Treatment related mortality decreased during the 3-year inclusion period (first year: 25.7%, second year: 19.1%, third year: 11.6%). The improvement of supportive care translated into an increase of the overall survival rates from 54% in the first year to 73% in the third year. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the feasibility of prospective multicentric studies in Africa. An improvement of quality of care has been noticed during the 3 first years.","['Harif, Mhamed', 'Barsaoui, Sihem', 'Benchekroun, Said', 'Bouhas, Rachid', 'Doumbe, Pierre', 'Khattab, Mohammed', 'Ladjaj, Yasmina', 'Moreira, Claude', 'Msefer-Alaoui, Fouzia', 'Patte, Catherine', 'Rakotonirina, Gervais', 'Raphael, Martine', 'Raquin, Marie-Anne', 'Lemerle, Jean']","['Harif M', 'Barsaoui S', 'Benchekroun S', 'Bouhas R', 'Doumbe P', 'Khattab M', 'Ladjaj Y', 'Moreira C', 'Msefer-Alaoui F', 'Patte C', 'Rakotonirina G', 'Raphael M', 'Raquin MA', 'Lemerle J']","[""Service d'Hematologie et Oncologie Pediatrique, Hopital 20 Aout 1953, Casablanca, Morocco. m.harif@menara.ma""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'MACHO protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Africa, Northern/epidemiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/05/07 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21452 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jun;50(6):1138-42. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21452.,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jun;50(6):1125-6.

METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted in which incident cases of high-malignancy NHL (NHL(high)), low-malignancy NHL (NHL(low)), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were ascertained during the period 1986-1998 among men and women aged 15-75 years residing in six German counties; controls were drawn from population registries. Occupational histories were collected and agent-specific exposures were estimated via a job-exposure-matrix. Odds ratios were estimated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 858 cases were included in these analyses. Agricultural workers [odds ratio (OR) = 2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99, 7.21) and farmers (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 0.98, 3.98] had elevated risk of NHL(high). Risk of NHL(low) was elevated among agricultural workers (OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.17, 5.16), and among blacksmiths, toolmakers, and machine tool operators (OR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.31, 7.47). Workers in sales and construction had elevated risks of NHL(high) and NHL(low). Exposure to arsenic compounds, chlorophenols, diesel fuel, herbicides, nitrites/nitrates/nitrosamines, and organic dusts were associated with NHL(high) and NHL(low), while exhibiting little association with CLL. A positive monotonic trend in NHL(low) risk across tertiles of cumulative diesel fuel exposure was observed [P-value for test of linear trend (P) = 0.03]. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide insights into several potential occupational risk factors for NHL and suggest some specific occupational agents for further investigation.","['Richardson, David B', 'Terschuren, Claudia', 'Hoffmann, Wolfgang']","['Richardson DB', 'Terschuren C', 'Hoffmann W']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA. david.richardson@unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Occupational Health', 'Odds Ratio', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/06/21 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.20552 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2008 Apr;51(4):258-68. doi: 10.1002/ajim.20552.,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

As several cancers are characterized by the aberrant activity of oncogenic kinases, it was not surprising that a phosphatase like PP2A has progressively been considered as a potential tumor suppressor. Indeed, multiple solid tumors (e.g. melanomas, colorectal carcinomas, lung and breast cancers) present with genetic and/or functional inactivation of different PP2A subunits and, therefore, loss of PP2A phosphatase activity towards certain substrates. Likewise, impaired PP2A phosphatase activity has been linked to B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia. Remarkably, drugs such as forskolin, 1,9-dideoxy-forskolin and FTY720 which lead to PP2A activation effectively antagonize leukemogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models of these cancers. Thus, PP2A is now in the spotlight as a highly promising drugable target for the development of a new series of anticancer agents potentially capable of overcoming drug-resistance induced in patients by continuous exposure to kinase inhibitor monotherapy. Herein, we review current knowledge of PP2A biology and function with particular emphasis on its tumor suppressor activity and possible therapeutic implications in cancer.","['Perrotti, Danilo', 'Neviani, Paolo']","['Perrotti D', 'Neviani P']","['Human Cancer Genetics Program, Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. danilo.perrotti@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activators/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10555-008-9119-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008 Jun;27(2):159-68. doi: 10.1007/s10555-008-9119-x.,92,,"['R01 CA095512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 095512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the mechanism of this chemoresistance, we compared the ability of immature CD34+ versus mature CD34- AML cell lines (KG1a and U937, respectively) to recover from a DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint in G2. Here, we report that KG1a cells have a more stringent G2/M checkpoint response than U937 cells. We show that in both cell types, the CDC25B phosphatase participates in the G2/M checkpoint recovery and that its expression is upregulated. Furthermore, we show that CHK1 inhibition by UCN-01 in immature KG1a cells allows checkpoint exit and induces sensitivity to genotoxic agents. Similarly, UCN-01 treatment potentializes genotoxic-induced inhibition of colony formation efficiency of primary leukemic cells from AML patients. Altogether, our results demonstrate that checkpoint stringency varies during the maturation process and indicate that targeting checkpoint mechanisms might represent an attractive therapeutic opportunity for chemoresistant immature AML cells.","['Didier, C', 'Cavelier, C', 'Quaranta, M', 'Galcera, M-O', 'Demur, C', 'Laurent, G', 'Manenti, S', 'Ducommun, B']","['Didier C', 'Cavelier C', 'Quaranta M', 'Galcera MO', 'Demur C', 'Laurent G', 'Manenti S', 'Ducommun B']","[""LBCMCP-CNRS UMR5088-IFR109 Institut d'Exploration Fonctionnelle des Genomes, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080121,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', '*Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'U937 Cells', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/metabolism']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1211041 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1211041 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jun 19;27(27):3811-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1211041.

Lectins are proteins or glycoproteins from plants or animals that recognize oligossacharides on the cell surface and have been used to characterize the structural changes of oligosaccharides in leukemias. In this study, we used the lectin from the freshwater prawn Macrobrachium (M. rosenbergii), specific for acetyl groups in sialylated glycans, because increased sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids has been identified in lymphoblastic leukemias. We compared the specificity of the M. rosenbergii lectin for lymphoblastic leukemias with the specificities of the lectins from Triticum vulgaris, Solanum tuberosum, Arachis hipogaea, and Phytolacca americana. By morphologic and phenotype characterization with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, we identified four types of leukemias from 106 leukemia patients: 11 cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 61 cases of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 24 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia, and 10 cases of acute biphenotypic leukemia. As determined by cytofluorometric assays, nine of the eleven cases with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8 +/- 3 years old) were specifically identified with the lectin from M. rosenbergii. In contrast, only six cases of B-cell leukemia, one case of myeloblastic leukemia, and 2 cases of biphenotypic leukemia were identified with this M. rosenbergii lectin. The other lectins tested showed no capacity to differentiate, in a significant manner, any of the four types of leukemias tested. Thus, the lectin from M. rosenbergii could be considered a useful tool for the diagnosis and study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Perez-Campos-Mayoral, Laura', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, Alejandro', 'Perez-Romano, Beatriz', 'Zenteno, Edgar', 'Hernandez-Cruz, Pedro', 'Martinez-Cruz, Ruth', 'Martinez-Cruz, Margarito', 'Pina-Canseco, Socorro', 'Perez-Campos, Eduardo']","['Perez-Campos-Mayoral L', 'Ruiz-Arguelles A', 'Perez-Romano B', 'Zenteno E', 'Hernandez-Cruz P', 'Martinez-Cruz R', 'Martinez-Cruz M', 'Pina-Canseco S', 'Perez-Campos E']","['Clinical Pathology Laboratory Dr. Eduardo Perez Ortega, Oaxaca, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lectins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Lectins/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Palaemonidae/*chemistry', 'Phenotype']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/tjem/214.11 [pii]', '10.1620/tjem.214.11 [doi]']",ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2008 Jan;214(1):11-6. doi: 10.1620/tjem.214.11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: Literature was accessed via MEDLINE (1966-May 2007), EMBASE (1991-3rd quarter 2007), the Proceedings of the American Society of Hematology (2000-2006), and the Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (2000-2007). Search terms included imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Meeting abstracts and studies that reported preclinical and Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials published in English are included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Imatinib is the standard of care for CML; however, some patients develop resistance or are intolerant to the drug. Phase 1 and 2 clinical data for the more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatinib and nilotinib, are promising. Hematologic and cytogenetic responses are reported with both. There does not appear to be cross-resistance between the drugs, although neither is effective against all mutations of the hallmark molecular marker, the Philadelphia chromosome. Novel agents are also being examined for the treatment of patients with CML, including aurora kinase and farnesyl transferase inhibitors, as well as combination therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib and nilotinib are second-line options for patients who have CML and are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Toxicity profiles between agents may differ. Clinical trials with these drugs and others are ongoing.","['Marshall, Helen M', 'Hammond, Julia M']","['Marshall HM', 'Hammond JM']","['Duke University Hospital, Durham, NC, USA. hmarshal@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080122,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/trends', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['aph.1K303 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1K303 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2008 Feb;42(2):259-64. doi: 10.1345/aph.1K303.

Here, we use SRS19-6-driven retroviral insertional mutagenesis to compare the phenotypes of leukemias arising in Cebpa(+/+), Cebpa(+/BRM2), and Cebpa(BRM2/BRM2) mice, with respect to disease type, latency of tumor development, and identity of the retroviral insertion sites (RISs). Both Cebpa(+/BRM2) and Cebpa(BRM2/BRM2) mice preferentially develop myeloid leukemias, but with differing latencies, thereby demonstrating the importance of gene dosage. Determination of RISs led to the identification of several novel candidate oncogenes, some of which may collaborate specifically with the E2F repression-deficient allele of Cebpa. Finally, we used an in silico pathway analysis approach to extract additional information from single RISs, leading to the identification of signaling pathways which were preferentially deregulated in a disease- and/or genotype-specific manner.","['Hasemann, Marie S', 'Damgaard, Inge', 'Schuster, Mikkel B', 'Theilgaard-Monch, Kim', 'Sorensen, Annette B', 'Mrsic, Alan', 'Krugers, Thijs', 'Ylstra, Bauke', 'Pedersen, Finn S', 'Nerlov, Claus', 'Porse, Bo T']","['Hasemann MS', 'Damgaard I', 'Schuster MB', 'Theilgaard-Monch K', 'Sorensen AB', 'Mrsic A', 'Krugers T', 'Ylstra B', 'Pedersen FS', 'Nerlov C', 'Porse BT']","['Section for Gene Therapy Research, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Copenhagen University Hospital, Juliane Maries Vej 20-9322, DK2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080122,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Computational Biology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Neoplasm', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomic Instability', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Injections', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/physiology', 'Virus Latency']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/05/14 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)40894-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-06-097790 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 15;111(8):4309-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-06-097790.

We have previously shown that mice heterozygous for Npm1 (Npm1+/-) develop a hematologic syndrome with features of human MDS. Here we analyzed Npm1+/- mutants to determine their susceptibility to cancer. Npm1+/- mice displayed a greater propensity to develop malignancies compared with Npm1+/+ mice. The Npm1+/- cohort frequently developed hematologic malignancies of both myeloid and lymphoid origin with myeloid malignancies displaying the highest incidence. Malignant cells retained the wild-type allele with normal localization and expression of Npm1 at the protein level, suggesting that complete Npm1 loss is not a prerequisite for tumorigenesis.

We examined the association of cigarette smoking with death attributed to 15 cancer sites, 7 of which are regarded as having an uncertain relation with tobacco. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The original Whitehall study is a prospective cohort of 17 363 London-based male government employees (age 40-69 years) who were examined in the late 1960s and then followed up for a maximum of 38 years. RESULTS: Following adjustment for demographic characteristics, risk factors, and prevalent disease, established positive cigarette smoking--cancer gradients were confirmed for carcinoma of the lung, stomach, pancreas, bladder, upper aero-digestive (including oesophagus), and liver, and for myeloid leukaemia. Among the cancers of uncertain relation with smoking, mortality rates for malignancy of the colon, rectum and prostate and for lymphatic leukaemia were elevated in current and/or former smokers. There was essentially no apparent relation between smoking and mortality from carcinoma of the brain or from lymphoma. CONCLUSION: In this study, cigarette smoking appears to be a risk factor for several malignancies of previously unclear association with tobacco use.","['Batty, G D', 'Kivimaki, M', 'Gray, L', 'Smith, G Davey', 'Marmot, M G', 'Shipley, M J']","['Batty GD', 'Kivimaki M', 'Gray L', 'Smith GD', 'Marmot MG', 'Shipley MJ']","['Medical Research Council Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK. david-b@msoc.mrc.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080122,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/mortality', 'London/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Organ Specificity', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*epidemiology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/etiology/mortality']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)41842-5 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdm578 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2008 May;19(5):996-1002. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdm578.

In patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the RARalpha gene is fused with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene via the t(15;17) translocation, resulting in the expression of a PML/RARalpha fusion protein. Here, we report that topoisomerase II beta (TopoIIbeta) associates with and negatively modulates RARalpha transcriptional activity and that increased levels of and association with TopoIIbeta cause resistance to RA in APL cell lines. Knockdown of TopoIIbeta was able to overcome resistance by permitting RA-induced differentiation and increased RA gene expression. Overexpression of TopoIIbeta in clones from an RA-sensitive cell line conferred resistance by a reduction in RA-induced expression of target genes and differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that TopoIIbeta is bound to an RA response element and that inhibition of TopoIIbeta causes hyperacetylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 and activation of transcription. Our results identify a novel mechanism of resistance in APL and provide further insight to the role of TopoIIbeta in gene regulation and differentiation.","['McNamara, Suzan', 'Wang, Hongling', 'Hanna, Nessrine', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['McNamara S', 'Wang H', 'Hanna N', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

METHODS: Male C57BL-6 mice were subjected to sham operation or resuscitated HS. At t = 0 hours, t = 24 hours, and t = 72 hours, mice were euthanized and the spleens were removed and evaluated for apoptotic changes via DNA fragmentation, caspase activities, and activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Spleens from untreated mice were used as control samples. RESULTS: HS was associated with distinct lymphocytopenia as early as t = 0 hours after hemorrhage without regaining baseline levels within the consecutive 72 hours when compared with sham and control groups. A rapid activation of splenic apoptosis in HS mice was observed at t = 0 hours and t = 72 hours after hemorrhage and predominantly confirmed by increased DNA fragmentation, elevated caspase-3/7, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activities, and enhanced expression of intrinsic mitochondrial proteins. Accordingly, mitochondrial pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins were inversely expressed within the 72-hour observation period, thereby supporting significant pro-apoptotic changes. Solely at t = 24 hours, expression of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein shows a significant increase when compared with sham-operated and control animals. Furthermore, expression of extrinsic death receptors were only slightly increased. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that HS induces apoptotic changes in spleen through a biphasic caspase-dependent mechanism and imply a detrimental imbalance of pro- and anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins Bax, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1, thereby promoting post-traumatic immunosuppression.","['Hostmann, Arwed', 'Jasse, Kerstin', 'Schulze-Tanzil, Gundula', 'Robinson, Yohan', 'Oberholzer, Andreas', 'Ertel, Wolfgang', 'Tschoeke, Sven K']","['Hostmann A', 'Jasse K', 'Schulze-Tanzil G', 'Robinson Y', 'Oberholzer A', 'Ertel W', 'Tschoeke SK']","['Department of Trauma and Reconstructive Surgery, Charite-University Medical School Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, 12207 Berlin, Germany. arwed.hostmann@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080122,England,Crit Care,"Critical care (London, England)",9801902,"['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Count', '*DNA Fragmentation', 'Genes, bcl-2/*physiology', 'Lymphopenia/etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Resuscitation', 'Shock, Hemorrhagic/complications/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Spleen/enzymology/metabolism/*physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*physiology']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2007/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['cc6772 [pii]', '10.1186/cc6772 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Care. 2008;12(1):R8. doi: 10.1186/cc6772.

Four types of solvent fractions (hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and butanol) were prepared from the methanolic extract of medicinal herbs. The cytotoxicity and anticarcinogenic activities of solvent fractions were examined for mouse leukemia L1210 cancer cells and for female ICR mouse epidermal carcinogenesis induced by DMBA, respectively. The chloroform fraction of Artemisia capillaris, Taxus cuspidata, and Anthriscus sylveatris was more toxic to L1210 cells than other solvent fractions. The chloroform fraction of Artemisia capillaris markedly reduced the number of tumors/mouse and tumor incidence relative to that of other medicinal herbs tested. Major active chemical constituents in the chloroform fraction of Artemisia capillaries were found to be camphor, 1-borneol, coumarin, and achillin when analyzed by TLC and GC-MS. These results suggest that Artemisia capillaris was the most effective anticarcinogenic medicinal herb for DMBA-induced mouse epidermal carcinogenesis among 4 medicinal herbs tested, and the effect might be attributed to chemical compounds of camphor, 1-borneol, coumarin, and achillin.","['Kim, Y S', 'Bahn, K N', 'Hah, C K', 'Gang, H I', 'Ha, Y L']","['Kim YS', 'Bahn KN', 'Hah CK', 'Gang HI', 'Ha YL']","['Division of Applied Life Sciences, Graduated School, and Institute of Agriculture & Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Food Sci,Journal of food science,0014052,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Camphanes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)', '5956-04-7 (achillin)', '76-22-2 (Camphor)', '7V31YC746X (Chloroform)', 'A4VZ22K1WT (coumarin)', 'L88RA8N5EG (isoborneol)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene/antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Artemisia/*chemistry', 'Camphanes/analysis/pharmacology', 'Camphor/analysis/pharmacology', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Carcinogens/antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Chloroform', 'Coumarins/analysis/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Random Allocation', 'Sesquiterpenes/analysis/pharmacology', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology/*prevention & control']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/03/01 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['JFDS585 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00585.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Food Sci. 2008 Jan;73(1):T16-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00585.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have used microplate spectrophotometry to measure growth kinetics of hundreds of individual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. Growth rate of each clonal population has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic equation. RESULTS: Growth rates were observed to vary between different clones. Up to six clones with growth rates above or below mean growth rate of the parent population were further cloned and growth rates of their offspring were measured. Distribution of growth rates of the subclones did not significantly differ from that of the parent population, thus suggesting that growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain observed distributions of clonal growth rates, we have developed a probabilistic model, assuming that fluctuation in the number of mitochondria through successive cell cycles is the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes, we have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the average maximum number of mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely observed distributions in growth rates; however, cells in which mitochondria were rendered non-functional (rho(0) cells) showed only 30% reduction in clonal growth variability with respect to normal cells. CONCLUSIONS: A tumour cell population is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rates. At least part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the initial number of mitochondria in daughter cells.","['Tomelleri, C', 'Milotti, E', 'Dalla Pellegrina, C', 'Perbellini, O', 'Del Fabbro, A', 'Scupoli, M T', 'Chignola, R']","['Tomelleri C', 'Milotti E', 'Dalla Pellegrina C', 'Perbellini O', 'Del Fabbro A', 'Scupoli MT', 'Chignola R']","['Department of Science and Technology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Spectrophotometry']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/04/01 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['CPR501 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2007.00501.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2008 Feb;41(1):177-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2007.00501.x.,,PMC6496292,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have tested whether thymidine block, one type of whole-culture synchronization, can synchronize L1210 cells. We demonstrate experimentally that the thymidine block method cannot produce a synchronized culture. Although thymidine-treated cells are arrested primarily with an S-phase amount of DNA, there is no narrowing of the cell size distribution and there is no synchronized division pattern following release from the thymidine block. In contrast to a whole-culture synchronization method, cells produced by a selective (i.e. non-whole-culture) method not only have a specific DNA content, but also have a narrow size distribution and divide synchronously. Generalizing the results to other cell lines, we suggest that these conclusions call into question experimental measurements of gene expression during the division cycle based on thymidine inhibition synchronization.","['Cooper, S', 'Chen, K Z', 'Ravi, S']","['Cooper S', 'Chen KZ', 'Ravi S']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0620, USA. cooper@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/04/01 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['CPR508 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2007.00508.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2008 Feb;41(1):156-67. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2007.00508.x.,,PMC6495963,['5 P30 CA46592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated mRNA levels of ID1 in human myeloid leukaemic cell lines and in specimens of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and protein levels of ID1 in human myeloid leukaemic cell lines using Western blot analysis. Six of seven AML cell lines and 12 of 15 AML patient samples were found to have barely detectable ID1 mRNA. All of these cell lines showed the same levels of protein in proportion to levels of mRNA. Two of the AML cell lines with low ID1 expression, KG1 and KG-1a, were chosen for treatment with either the DNA demethylation reagent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), or the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). These treatments were alone or in combination, and ID1 expression was induced by both DAC and TSA. No hypermethylated ID1 gene promoter was detected in the majority of the cell lines and patient specimens, by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, suggesting that induction of ID1 in KG1 and KG-1a was not due to direct demethylation of the ID1 gene promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that accumulation of acetyl-histone H3 and release of HDAC1 were correlated with ID1 induction by these drugs. Flow cytometric assay demonstrated more apoptosis induced by TSA or TSA in combination with DAC, in both KG-1 and KG-1a cell lines. Increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species was observed when treated with TSA. CONCLUSION: Most AML cell lines and human AML samples have very low levels of expression of ID1. TSA or TSA in combination with DAC is able to restore ID1 expression in low ID1-expressing AML cell lines by re-activating the aberrantly deacetylated promoter, and this also results in more apoptotic cell death, in which ID1 and the redox pathway may be involved.","['Yu, W-P', 'Scott, S A', 'Dong, W-F']","['Yu WP', 'Scott SA', 'Dong WF']","['Department of Pathophysiology, College of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. wpylg@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/01/24 09:00,2008/04/01 09:00,['2008/01/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['CPR499 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2007.00499.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2008 Feb;41(1):86-97. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2007.00499.x.,,PMC6496488,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we had demonstrated that opposing effects of ERK1/2 and JNK on p21 expression in response to arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) are mediated through the Sp1 responsive elements of the p21 promoter in A431 cells. Presently, we demonstrate that Sp1, and c-Jun functionally cooperate to activate p21 promoter expression through Sp1 binding sites (-84/-64) by using DNA affinity binding, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and promoter assays. Surprisingly, As(2)O(3)-induced c-Jun(Ser63/73) phosphorylation can recruit TGIF/HDAC1 to the Sp1 binding sites and then suppress p21 promoter activation. We suggest that, after As(2)O(3 )treatment, the N-terminal domain of c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK recruits TGIF/HDAC1 to the Sp1 sites and then represses p21 expression. That is, TGIF is involved in As(2)O(3)-inhibited p21 expression, and then blocks the cell cycle arrest.","['Liu, Zi-Miao', 'Huang, Huei-Sheng']","['Liu ZM', 'Huang HS']","['Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080122,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",2008/01/23 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/01/23 09:00'],"['2007/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11373-007-9232-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Sci. 2008 May;15(3):333-42. doi: 10.1007/s11373-007-9232-9.

Pan (2003) proposed to use the normal mixture model method (MMM) to estimate the distribution of a test statistic and its null distribution. However, considering the fact that the test statistic is often of t-type, our studies find that the rejection region from MMM is often significantly larger than the correct rejection region, resulting an inflated type I error. This motivates us to propose the t-mixture model (TMM) approach. In this paper, we demonstrate that TMM provides significantly more accurate control of the probability of making type I errors (hence of the familywise error rate) than MMM. Finally, TMM is applied to the well-known leukemia data of Golub et al. (1999).

In this study, we have developed a transient plasmid-based assay to measure the activation of a reporter gene by an adjacent vector provirus. Plasmid pACT contains a luciferase cassette driven by a minimal, enhancerless promoter, into which vector proviruses are inserted upstream for evaluation by luciferase assays and northern blots. In a comparison of analogous vectors based on murine leukemia virus (MLV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and foamy virus (FV), we observed significant enhancer activity and read-through transcription from MLV proviruses, and significant read-through transcription from HIV proviruses. HIV and FV proviruses containing an internal MLV long-terminal repeat (LTR) promoter also had significant enhancer activity, which was not observed with an internal promoter from the murine phosphoglycerate kinase-1 gene, PGK. These results demonstrate that neighboring gene activation can be limited by using internal promoter(s) lacking enhancer activity, especially when present in an FV vector backbone that prevents read-through transcription. Although the pACT assay does not measure oncogenesis directly, it should be useful for screening vectors before more time-consuming and costly animal studies are undertaken.","['Hendrie, Paul C', 'Huo, Yunwen', 'Stolitenko, Raisa B', 'Russell, David W']","['Hendrie PC', 'Huo Y', 'Stolitenko RB', 'Russell DW']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080122,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Simian foamy virus/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2008/01/23 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/01/23 09:00'],"['2008/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(16)31427-7 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.mt.6300398 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2008 Mar;16(3):534-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.mt.6300398.

This increase is the consequence of the availability of more than 11 million URD volunteers and the more efficient donor search process in the recent years. Median time to identify a suitable URD is now 2 months. More than 50% of Caucasian patients have an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-allele donor match and a one-antigen or allele HLA-mismatched donor may also be acceptable. Complications of URD transplants are particularly frequent and severe, with long-term OS in the registries being 10-20% inferior to HLA-identical sibling transplantation. High resolution DNA techniques for donor and recipient HLA matching have contributed to the survival in experienced centres after unrelated donor SCT approaching that achieved with sibling donors. The introduction of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) has extended URD transplants to elderly and/or debilitated patients with AML. With this approach, TRM decreases, although graft-versus-host disease-related morbidity and mortality remain a problem. Despite this complication, results after URD transplantation in this age group seem better than those achieved with chemotherapy and/or autologous transplantation. To confirm this possibility, prospective multicenter comparisons of URD transplants after RIC with other treatment options for elderly AML patients have recently been started.","['Sierra, J', 'Martino, R', 'Sanchez, B', 'Pinana, J L', 'Valcarcel, D', 'Brunet, S']","['Sierra J', 'Martino R', 'Sanchez B', 'Pinana JL', 'Valcarcel D', 'Brunet S']","['Clinical Hematology Division and Hematopoietic Transplant Program, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. jsierra@santpau.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080121,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/methods']",2008/01/23 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2008/01/23 09:00'],"['2008/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705973 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705973 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Mar;41(5):425-37. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705973.

However, unlike other prosurvival Bcl-2-like proteins, Mcl-1 stability is acutely regulated. For example, the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only protein Noxa, which preferentially binds to Mcl-1, also targets it for proteasomal degradation. In this paper, we describe the discovery and characterization of a novel BH3-like ligand derived from Bim, Bim(S)2A, which is highly selective for Mcl-1. Unlike Noxa, Bim(S)2A is unable to trigger Mcl-1 degradation, yet, like Noxa, Bim(S)2A promotes cell killing only when Bcl-x(L) is absent or neutralized. Furthermore, killing by endogenous Bim is not associated with Mcl-1 degradation. Thus, functional inactivation of Mcl-1 does not always require its elimination. Rather, it can be efficiently antagonized by a BH3-like ligand tightly engaging its binding groove, which is confirmed here with a structural study. Our data have important implications for the discovery of compounds that might kill cells whose survival depends on Mcl-1.","['Lee, Erinna F', 'Czabotar, Peter E', 'van Delft, Mark F', 'Michalak, Ewa M', 'Boyle, Michelle J', 'Willis, Simon N', 'Puthalakath, Hamsa', 'Bouillet, Philippe', 'Colman, Peter M', 'Huang, David C S', 'Fairlie, W Douglas']","['Lee EF', 'Czabotar PE', 'van Delft MF', 'Michalak EM', 'Boyle MJ', 'Willis SN', 'Puthalakath H', 'Bouillet P', 'Colman PM', 'Huang DC', 'Fairlie WD']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080121,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2008/01/23 09:00,2008/02/08 09:00,['2008/01/23 09:00'],"['2008/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcb.200708096 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200708096 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2008 Jan 28;180(2):341-55. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200708096.

Since these tumors are HLA class I and class II-positive, the LMPs could serve as both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell targets. In contrast to CD8 responses, very little is known about CD4 responses to LMPs. In this study, we describe CD4+ T cell clones defining four LMP1- and three LMP2-derived peptide epitopes and their restricting alleles. All clones produced Th1-like cytokines in response to peptide and most killed peptide-loaded target cells by perforin-mediated lysis. Although clones to different epitopes showed different functional avidities in peptide titration assays, avidity per se was a poor predictor of the ability to recognize naturally infected B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) expressing LMPs at physiologic levels. Some epitopes, particularly within LMP1, consistently mediated strong LCL recognition detectable in cytokine release, cytotoxicity, and outgrowth inhibition assays. Using cyclosporin A to selectively block cytokine release, we found that CD4+ T cell cytotoxicity is the key effector of LCL outgrowth control. We therefore infer that cytotoxic CD4+ T cells to a subset of LMP epitopes could have therapeutic potential against LMP-expressing tumors.","['Haigh, Tracey A', 'Lin, Xiaorong', 'Jia, Hui', 'Hui, Edwin P', 'Chan, Anthony T C', 'Rickinson, Alan B', 'Taylor, Graham S']","['Haigh TA', 'Lin X', 'Jia H', 'Hui EP', 'Chan AT', 'Rickinson AB', 'Taylor GS']","['Cancer Research United Kingdom Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, Vincent Drive, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Epitopes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/therapy/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*immunology']",2008/01/23 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2008/01/23 09:00'],"['2008/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['180/3/1643 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.180.3.1643 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Feb 1;180(3):1643-54. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.180.3.1643.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potentiation of AML-DC vaccine might become feasible by the addition of adjuvants such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or CPG-rich oligodeoxyribonucleotides binding to Toll-like receptors (TLR) and inducing a stronger Type 1 T-cell response. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: mRNA and protein expression of TLR-2, -4, and -9 were analyzed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and flow cytometry for mature monocyte-derived DCs generated from 14 AML patients versus 14 healthy volunteers (HV-DCs), and the response of the AML- and HV-DCs to different microbial TLR ligands was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, inducible protein (Ip)-10, and interleukin (IL)-6. RESULTS: AML-DCs and HV-DCs strongly expressed TLR-2 and TLR-4, while TLR-9 was expressed at a lower level in both groups. There was no significant difference in TLR expression between the two groups of AML-DCs and HV-DCs. In accordance with the TLR expression levels, DCs generated from both AML patients and HVs responded to the known microbial ligands peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipoteichoic acid for TLR-2 and LPS as ligand for TLR-4, by producing TNF-alpha and IL-6. A response to the ODNs 2006 and 2216 binding to TLR-9 was only detected in AML-DCs. CONCLUSION: Microbial ligands like ODNs and LPS constitute promising adjuvants for enhancing (AML-) DC vaccines.","['Schmitt, Anita', 'Li, Li', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof', 'Greiner, Jochen', 'Reinhardt, Peter', 'Wiesneth, Markus', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Schmitt A', 'Li L', 'Giannopoulos K', 'Greiner J', 'Reinhardt P', 'Wiesneth M', 'Schmitt M']","['Institute for Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics (IKT) gGmbH Ulm, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080115,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Peptidoglycan)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*physiopathology/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/physiology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Peptidoglycan/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*genetics/metabolism']",2008/01/23 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/01/23 09:00'],"['2008/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF01616 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01616.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2008 May;48(5):861-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2007.01616.x.

In the present study, the effects of cyclic nucleotide-elevating agents on HPC proliferation and differentiation were investigated. HPCs from different sources, including healthy persons, patients with tumors (medulloblastoma, seminoma, or multiple myeloma), and patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), were compared. HPCs were isolated by standard leukapheresis procedures and analyzed for proliferation and differentiation into the megakaryocytic and granulocytic lineages. HPCs contained high concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinases G and A (PKG and PKA, respectively). Whereas PKG was partly down-regulated during culture, the PKA level remained constant. Stimulation of PKG in HPCs isolated from healthy donors or tumor patients resulted in a biphasic reaction: low cGMP concentrations inhibited proliferation and stimulated differentiation into megakaryocytes, whereas high concentrations revealed the opposite effect. In contrast, differentiation into granulocytes was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. Stimulation of PKA inhibited HPC differentiation; however, HPC proliferation was inhibited in controls and stimulated in HPCs from tumor patients. HPCs isolated from CML patients showed a nonhomogeneous reaction pattern to both cyclic nucleotides with high variability between the individual donors. We demonstrated the importance of the source of HPCs for the investigation of proliferation and differentiation. Cyclic nucleotide-regulated pathways are clearly involved in HPC proliferation and differentiation. Pharmacological strategies using cyclic nucleotide-elevating substances to influence HPC growth and differentiation in the bone marrow might support current strategies in HPC recovery from the peripheral blood.","['Kobsar, Anna', 'Heeg, Sonja', 'Krohne, Katharina', 'Opitz, Andreas', 'Walter, Ulrich', 'Bock, Markus', 'Gambaryan, Stepan', 'Eigenthaler, Martin']","['Kobsar A', 'Heeg S', 'Krohne K', 'Opitz A', 'Walter U', 'Bock M', 'Gambaryan S', 'Eigenthaler M']","['Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Pathobiochemistry, University of Wuerzburg, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Nucleotides, Cyclic)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.12 (Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/analysis', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/analysis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Nucleotides, Cyclic/analysis/*physiology']",2008/01/23 09:00,2008/04/19 09:00,['2008/01/23 09:00'],"['2008/01/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2007.0060 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2008 Feb;17(1):81-91. doi: 10.1089/scd.2007.0060.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Confocal microscopic analysis of COS1, HEK 293 and HeLa cells transfected with a p53 expression plasmid demonstrated a decrease in the signal of endogenous MCL-1 compared to neighboring non-transfected cells. Transcription regulation assays showed that the 1826 bp human MCL-1 promoter fragment was repressed up to 30-fold by wild-type p53 in a dose-dependent manner. As shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Sp1 binding to the sites located in the -295 to +16 MCL-1 promoter fragment was decreased in the presence of p53. However, the MCL-1 promoter devoid of all Sp1 binding sites was still repressed by p53, albeit 2-fold weaker than the wild-type promoter. Overexpression of Sp1 reduced p53-dependent repression of the MCL-1 promoter only up to 2.2-fold. Transcription regulation assays performed with MCL-1 promoter deletion mutants showed that most of the p53 inhibitory effect was mediated by the -41 to +16 bp promoter fragment containing binding sites only for TATA-binding protein and other basal transcription factors.

Direct evidence of a GH receptor (GHR) abnormality was provided in 1989. More recently, molecular abnormalities in the postreceptor signalling mechanism were found. Mutations of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (Stat5b) were reported in patients with growth retardation and primary immunodeficiency. Mutations of the tyrosin phosphatase Shp2 were identified in patients affected by Noonan syndrome characterized by short stature, cardiopathy and increased risk of leukaemia.

METHODS: Our report is on the successive steps for the implementation of a quality assurance system, methods used, motivations, cost, difficulties encountered as well as the advantages obtained. In the Regional Centre for Paediatric Oncology (CRCP) at the CHU in Clermont-Ferrand, we launched a quality programme based on ISO9001/2000 standards. The implementation of the quality assurance system was conducted as a research project and an established medical project with the support of the Management Team. The mission was divided into several ""processes"", an approach consisting of considering the clinical service in terms of flow and successions of transformations (reception, care, support, accompaniment, etc.) which produce added-value (services and products adapted to the needs of the ""customers"": children, families, correspondents). RESULTS: We singled out ten physical processes or ""job specializations"" such as ""diagnosis"", ""care"" or ""project for the child"". The cartography which is the systematic representation of the processes and the interactions between them made it possible to draw up a global vision of the CRCP ""care"" activity. CONCLUSION: The ISO9001/2000 standard is a tool designed to help organization and management. The benefit obtained in implementing it in a clinic was perceived in organisational terms and lead to a true team spirit, a standardization of the professional practices and the enhancement of the role of each person. The advantages appear at three levels: the child and his/her family, the medical and paramedical teams, and the administrative supervisory bodies.","['Kanold, J', 'Halle, P', 'Paillard, C', 'Merlin, E', 'David, A', 'Levallois, S', 'Roudeix, D', 'Dugue, F', 'Lacaze, C', 'Morisset, C', 'Souquiere, V', 'Demeocq, F']","['Kanold J', 'Halle P', 'Paillard C', 'Merlin E', 'David A', 'Levallois S', 'Roudeix D', 'Dugue F', 'Lacaze C', 'Morisset C', 'Souquiere V', 'Demeocq F']","['Service de pediatrie B, centre regional de cancerologie pediatrique, CHU de Clermont-Ferrand, Hotel-Dieu, 63001 Clermont-Ferrand, France. jkanold@chu-clermontferrand.fr']",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20080118,France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cancer Care Facilities/*standards', 'Child', 'Child Health Services/standards', 'Child, Preschool', 'Family', 'France', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Medical Audit', 'Medical Oncology/*standards', 'Pediatrics/*standards', 'Professional-Family Relations', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization & administration/standards']",2008/01/22 09:00,2008/04/29 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0929-693X(07)00606-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcped.2007.11.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 2008 Feb;15(2):122-34. doi: 10.1016/j.arcped.2007.11.001.

Based on dendritic cell (DC) vaccination, the triggering of an immune response against residual leukemia cells after CT could maintain patients in remission. The aim of our study was to assess, for vaccine preparation, generation of monocyte-derived DCs in AML patients after CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated efficiency of the production, yields, maturation, and functional properties of DCs from 22 AML patients at different CT stages compared to those from 15 healthy donors. RESULTS: We demonstrated that monocyte-derived DC production is successful later than 3 weeks after the last CT cycle, whatever the CT was. Immature DCs demonstrated functional phagocytic activity. Mature DCs displayed migratory, T-cell stimulatory and Th1-activation capacities. Our results also suggest a favorable period from 20 to 60 days after CT for potent monocyte-derived DC production and immune activation. CONCLUSION: In defining patient-sampling conditions, this preclinical study has direct implications for AML DC-based immunotherapy.","['Royer, Pierre-Joseph', 'Bougras, Gwenola', 'Ebstein, Frederic', 'Leveque, Lucie', 'Tanguy-Royer, Severine', 'Simon, Thomas', 'Juge-Morineau, Nadine', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Harousseau, Jean-Luc', 'Gregoire, Marc']","['Royer PJ', 'Bougras G', 'Ebstein F', 'Leveque L', 'Tanguy-Royer S', 'Simon T', 'Juge-Morineau N', 'Chevallier P', 'Harousseau JL', 'Gregoire M']","['INSERM, U601, Nantes, France; Universite de Nantes, Faculte de Medecine, Centre de Recherche en Oncologie, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080122,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*cytology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, CCR7/biosynthesis', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/01/22 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(07)00644-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Mar;36(3):329-39. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.11.001.

Because c-Myc plays a critical role in leukemogenesis, we evaluated whether 2ME2 acts on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through modulation of c-Myc activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML cell lines and primary AML leukemia were treated with 2ME2 and the relationship between 2ME2-induced apoptosis and changes in c-Myc activity was examined. RESULTS: 2ME2 induced mitochondrial apoptosis of human AML cells through increased reactive oxygen species. Further investigation showed that 2ME2 downregulated c-Myc expression in a time-dependent manner. Increased oxidative stress led to downregulation of c-Myc mRNA and protein, but did not affect the stability of c-Myc protein. To demonstrate the role of c-Myc in 2ME2-induced apoptosis, we ectopically expressed wild-type c-Myc in AML cells and found that ectopic expression of c-Myc abrogated the 2ME2-induced apoptosis. In addition, we showed that 2ME2 treatment inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and binding of nuclear factor-kappaB p65/p50 heterodimers to its DNA targets. As with results from cell lines studied, 2ME2 also induced cytotoxicity to primary AML cells and downregulated their c-Myc expression and induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Downregulation of c-Myc is critical for 2ME2-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in AML cells.

Here, we have investigated the role of intracellular ROS generation in apoptotic signaling in human acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cells treated with 9,10-PQ and the role of XR in the generation of ROS. Treatment with 9,10-PQ elicited not only apoptotic signaling, including mitochondrial membrane dysfunction and activation of caspases and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, but also intracellular ROS generation and consequent glutathione depletion. The apoptotic effects of 9,10-PQ were drastically mitigated by pretreatment with intracellular ROS scavengers, such as N-acetyl-l-cysteine, glutathione monoethyl ester, and polyethylene glycol-conjugated catalase, indicating that intracellular ROS generation is responsible for the 9,10-PQ-evoked apoptosis. Surprisingly, the ROS generation and cytotoxicity by 9,10-PQ were augmented in an XR-transformed cell line. XR indeed reduced 9,10-PQ and produced superoxide anion through redox cycling. In addition, the expression levels of XR and its mRNA in the T lymphoma cells were markedly enhanced after the exposure to 9,10-PQ, and the induction was completely abolished by the ROS scavengers. Moreover, the 9,10-PQ-induced apoptosis was partially inhibited by the pretreatment with XR-specific inhibitors. These results suggest that initially produced ROS induce XR, which accelerates the generation of ROS.","['Matsunaga, Toshiyuki', 'Kamiya, Tetsuro', 'Sumi, Daigo', 'Kumagai, Yoshito', 'Kalyanaraman, B', 'Hara, Akira']","['Matsunaga T', 'Kamiya T', 'Sumi D', 'Kumagai Y', 'Kalyanaraman B', 'Hara A']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, Gifu Pharmaceutical University, 5-6-1 Mitahora-higashi, Gifu 502-8585, Japan. matsunagat@gifu-pu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080117,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Oxidoreductases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phenanthrenes/*toxicity', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes']",2008/01/22 09:00,2008/05/22 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2007/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(07)00815-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.12.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2008 Mar 15;44(6):1191-202. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.12.024.

Although drugs targeting at DNA-topoisomerase II characteristically induce translocations involving 11q23, this was seldom seen in patients treated for APL. We report on a patient initially diagnosed with APL. Response to therapy was monitored by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the PML-RARalpha rearrangement. Consecutive samples showed a swift and complete reduction of PML-RARalpha rearranged cells. Twenty months after diagnosis, however, conventional cytogenetics revealed a complex karyotype with a translocation involving 11q23 and loss of chromosomes 7q and Xq. FISH analysis with the MLL probe identified 2q37 (harboring the SEPT2 gene) as the translocation partner of chromosome 11.

The present study investigated micronucleus (MN) frequency in mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from 20 newly diagnosed and untreated leukemia patients: 4 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 10 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 6 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The mean MN frequency for untreated patients was 3.65 +/- 1.47 in ALL, 3.55 +/- 1.24 in AML, 3.03 +/- 1.05 in CLL. No differences in MN frequency were seen between leukemia types ALL, AML, and CLL (P = 0.503). The mean basal MN frequency for all patients, regardless of leukemia type, was 3.41 +/- 1.19, which was significantly higher (P = 0.001) than that of 20 age-matched control subjects, 1.87 +/- 0.75. Although no significant relationship was found between age and MN frequency in patients with leukemia (r = 0.050; P = 0.835), the MN frequency in the lymphocytes of healthy control increased regularly and significantly with age (r = 0.531; P = 0.016). These data indicate that the increased baseline MN frequency in lymphocytes of untreated patients with leukemia may reflect genomic instability or deficiency of DNA repair capacity. MN enhancement in this disease may thus be a consequence of the disease process.","['Hamurcu, Zuhal', 'Donmez-Altuntas, Hamiyet', 'Patiroglu, Turkan']","['Hamurcu Z', 'Donmez-Altuntas H', 'Patiroglu T']","['The College of Physical Education and Sports, Erciyes University, 38039 Kayseri, Turkey. zhamurcu@erciyes.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/*statistics & numerical data', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Middle Aged']",2008/01/22 09:00,2008/03/25 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2007/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(07)00692-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2007.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2008 Jan 15;180(2):140-4. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2007.10.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymerase chain reaction analysis of bone marrow cells revealed that mRNA for the bcr-abl chimera was negative at the onset of t-AML and positive at the terminal phase.

How cells process and detect TOP2-concealed DNA damage for the activation of downstream cellular responses remains unclear. Here, we showed proteasomal degradation of both TOP2 isozymes in a transcription-dependent manner upon etoposide treatment. Downregulation of TOP2 was preferentially associated with proteasomal removal of TOP2 in TOP2cc rather than proteolysis of free TOP2. Interestingly, blockage of TOP2 downregulation in TOP2cc also caused reduction in etoposide-induced activation of DNA damage molecules, an observation suggesting that the processing pathways of TOP2cc are involved in activation of etoposide-induced cellular responses. In this regard, we observed two TOP2cc processing pathways, replication- and transcription-initiated processing (RIP and TIP) with proteasome involved in the latter. Importantly, two processing pathways contributed to differential activation of various DNA damage signaling and downstream cellular responses. Etoposide-induced phosphorylation of p53 relied mainly on RIP, whereas activation of Chk1, Chk2 depended largely on TIP. Both RIP and TIP played roles in activating non-homologous end joining pathway, while only RIP modulated etoposide-induced cell killing in a p53-dependent manner. Collectively, our results are consistent with the notion that protein-linked DNA breakage (e.g., TOP2cc) requires processing pathways for initiating downstream DNA damage detection, repair as well as cell death programs.","['Fan, Jia-Rong', 'Peng, An-Lin', 'Chen, Hsiang-Chin', 'Lo, Shu-Chi', 'Huang, Ting-Hsiang', 'Li, Tsai-Kun']","['Fan JR', 'Peng AL', 'Chen HC', 'Lo SC', 'Huang TH', 'Li TK']","['Department and Graduate Institute of Microbiology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10018, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,DNA Repair (Amst),DNA repair,101139138,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (RPA1 protein, human)', '0 (Replication Protein A)', '0 (TAX1BP3 protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (TOP2A protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Glutaminase/metabolism', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Replication Protein A/metabolism', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2008/01/22 09:00,2008/06/25 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2007/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1568-7864(07)00416-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.dnarep.2007.12.002 [doi]']",ppublish,DNA Repair (Amst). 2008 Mar 1;7(3):452-63. doi: 10.1016/j.dnarep.2007.12.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report presence of a putative imperfect estrogen response element (ERE) in the promoter of icb-1 gene. Given that estrogens are known to regulate cellular differentiation processes of hormone-dependent tissues, we studied whether expression of icb-1 would be regulated by 17-beta (beta) estradiol in breast and ovarian cancer cells. As examined by means of real time PCR, treatment with 17-beta estradiol for at least 24h resulted in a significant increase of icb-1 transcript levels in ERalpha-positive MCF-7 breast cancer and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells, but not in ERalpha-negative SK-BR-3 and SK-OV-3 cells. Upregulation of icb-1 transcript levels was also observed after treatment with specific ERalpha-agonist PPT and was inhibited by co-treatment with pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 in MCF-7 and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells. Treatment with cycloheximide totally inhibited estrogen effects suggesting that activation of icb-1 gene expression is no ERE-dependent early response but a secondary event requiring protein synthesis. The results of this study demonstrate that transcript levels of differentiation-associated gene icb-1 are estrogen-responsive in breast and ovarian cancer cells in an ERalpha-dependent manner. Whether icb-1 is a mediator of estrogen-triggered cellular differentiation processes has to be determined in further studies.","['Bollmann, Julia', 'Ortmann, Olaf', 'Treeck, Oliver']","['Bollmann J', 'Ortmann O', 'Treeck O']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Regensburg, Landshuter Street. 65, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071207,England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (THEMIS2 protein, human)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism', 'Estrogen Receptor beta/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism']",2008/01/22 09:00,2008/06/05 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-0760(07)00281-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jsbmb.2007.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2008 Mar;109(1-2):16-21. doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2007.12.007.

We used methylation specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing to analyze the methylation status of the survivin promoter in primary AML samples and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Both, in patients with de novo AML and normal control samples an unmethylated survivin promoter was present. Mutational analysis of the proximal survivin promoter revealed three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), where the frequently occurred polymorphism (G/C) at position -31 was detectable in both, AML blasts and healthy PBMCs and showed no significant impact on prognosis in de novo AML patients. These results suggest that the methylation status of the survivin promoter and occurrence of these SNPs within the promoter region of the survivin gene appear to be of minor importance in leukemogenesis.","['Wagner, Mandy', 'Schmelz, Karin', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Tamm, Ingo']","['Wagner M', 'Schmelz K', 'Dorken B', 'Tamm I']","['Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Charite, Campus Virchow, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080221,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Survivin']",2008/01/22 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2007/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(07)00445-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Jul;32(7):1054-60. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.11.013.

DESIGN: In vitro study. SETTING: University hospital and research laboratory. PATIENT(S): Twelve fertile donors. INTERVENTION(S): Timed endometrial biopsy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Examine the effect of levonorgestrel along with another well-studied fertility-regulating drug, mifepristone, on the expression of endometrial receptivity factors in a three-dimensional stromal and epithelial cell coculture model by immunohistochemistry. RESULT(S): Both epithelial and stromal cells of in vitro endometrial construct showed the presence of estrogen receptor-alpha, estrogen receptor-beta, progesterone receptors-(A+B), vascular endothelial growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-1 beta, and cyclooxygenase-2, whereas the expression of progesterone receptor-B (AR), integrin alpha(V)beta(3,) and MUC1 were confined to epithelial cells. Mifepristone up-regulated expression of epithelial estrogen receptor-beta and progesterone receptor-B and down-regulated stromal vascular endothelial growth factor and surface molecules MUC1 and integrin alpha(V)beta(3) as observed in vivo. Levonorgestrel had no effect on the expression of endometrial receptivity markers studied. CONCLUSION(S): This in vitro model expresses progesterone-regulated endometrial receptivity factors seen in the physiologic condition. Treatment with levonorgestrel did not affect the expression of these endometrial receptivity markers in contrast to mifepristone. This in vitro model holds the potential to study endometrial receptivity, the embryo-endometrial interaction, and develop new agents for fertility control.","['Meng, Chun-Xia', 'Andersson, Karin Louise', 'Bentin-Ley, Ursula', 'Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina', 'Lalitkumar, P G Luther']","['Meng CX', 'Andersson KL', 'Bentin-Ley U', 'Gemzell-Danielsson K', 'Lalitkumar PG']","['Department of Woman and Child Health, Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Karolinska Institutet/Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080118,United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '5W7SIA7YZW (Levonorgestrel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic/pharmacology', 'Endometrium/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Fertility/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Levonorgestrel/*pharmacology', 'Menstrual Cycle/physiology', 'Mifepristone/*pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Young Adult']",2008/01/22 09:00,2009/01/31 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2007/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0015-0282(07)03972-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2009 Jan;91(1):256-64. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.11.007.

Viral entry: membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of MoMuLV envelope tail facilitates fusion. In the same issue. (accompanying paper)]. By biophysical methods (CD, EPR) a corresponding peptide (membrane-proximal peptide, 598-616) was demonstrated to form a membrane-parallel amphiphilic alpha-helix in the presence of membranes. Electrophysiological studies with planar bilayers and liposomes indicate that the membrane-proximal peptide is membrane destabilizing. This peptide and the fusion peptide from the MoMuLV transmembrane (TM) ectodomain were tested for their effect on the bilayer for hexagonal phase transition temperature of dipalmitoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (T(H)). Importantly, the external fusion peptide and the internal membrane-proximal peptides of MoMuLV env exert opposite effects on membrane curvature. The fusion peptide lowers T(H) while the membrane proximal peptide raises it. These effects on T(H) correlate with the ability of these peptides to induce lipid mixing in large unilamellar vesicles composed of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine: dioleoylphosphatidylcholine:cholesterol (1:1:1 mol). When added externally to preformed liposomes, the N-terminal fusion peptide promotes lipid mixing while the cytoplasmic membrane-proximal peptide inhibits this effect. These finding indicate a possible mechanism by which the membrane-proximal domain in MoMuLV Env may affect the formation of membrane fusion intermediates.","['Epand, Raquel F', 'Zhang, Yan-Liang', 'Mirzabekov, Tajib', 'Kagan, Bruce', 'Silberstein, Anatoly', 'Hubbell, Wayne L', 'Epand, Richard M', 'Chakraborti, Samitabh', 'Dimitrov, Dimiter S', 'Anderson, W French', 'Rozenberg-Adler, Yanina']","['Epand RF', 'Zhang YL', 'Mirzabekov T', 'Kagan B', 'Silberstein A', 'Hubbell WL', 'Epand RM', 'Chakraborti S', 'Dimitrov DS', 'Anderson WF', 'Rozenberg-Adler Y']","['Department of Biochemistry, McMaster University Health Sciences Center, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5 Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071203,Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Electrophysiology', '*Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Liposomes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Membrane Fusion/physiology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Virus Internalization']",2008/01/22 09:00,2008/04/23 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2007/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4800(07)00142-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2007.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2008 Feb;84(1):9-17. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2007.11.003.

The purpose of this work was to study possible interactions between corepressors human SIN3B (hSIN3B) and the ETO homologues - ETO (eight twenty-one), MTG16 (myeloid-transforming gene 16) and MTGR1 (MTG-related protein 1). In addition, the subnuclear localization of the hSIN3B and the ETO homologues was also examined. RESULTS: A ubiquitous expression of hSIN3B was observed in adult and fetal tissues. Results with both ectopically expressed proteins in COS-7 cells and endogeneous proteins in the K562 human erytholeukemia cell line demonstrated interactions between hSIN3B and ETO or MTG16 but not MTGR1. Furthermore, nuclear extract of primary placental cells showed complexes between hSIN3B and ETO. The interaction between hSIN3B and ETO required an intact amino-terminus of ETO and the NHR2 domain. A nucleolar localization of hSIN3B and all the ETO homologues was demonstrated upon overexpression in COS-7 cells, and confirmed for the endogeneously expressed proteins in K562 cells. However, hSIN3B did not colocalize or interact with the leukemia-associated AML1 -ETO. CONCLUSION: Our data from protein-protein interactions and immunolocalization experiments support that hSIN3B is a potential member of a corepressor complex involving selective ETO homologues.","['Dhanda, Rakesh Singh', 'Lindberg, Sofia Rondin', 'Olsson, Inge']","['Dhanda RS', 'Lindberg SR', 'Olsson I']","['Department of Hematology, C14, BMC, SE-221 84 Lund, Sweden.

These cells were potent stimulators of lymphocyte proliferation in specific in vitro assays for DC function. However, the stimulatory abilities of allogeneic T cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction were impaired compared with those of mature DCs derived from healthy donors, although T-cell stimulatory effects were significantly increased in these differentiated leukemia-DCs. These results suggest that functional DCs may be derived from leukemic (AML, CML) blasts in a significant number of patients and may be capable of inducing leukemia-specific immune responses with potentially clinically beneficial effects.","['Tong, X M', 'Yao, H P', 'Qian, W B', 'Zhu, L F', 'Fu, Z H', 'Huang, Z L', 'Jin, J']","['Tong XM', 'Yao HP', 'Qian WB', 'Zhu LF', 'Fu ZH', 'Huang ZL', 'Jin J']","['Institute of Hematologic Disease, Department of Hematology, First Affliated Hospital, Medical School, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080118,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed']",2008/01/22 09:00,2009/01/15 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLH986 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.00986.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2008 Oct;30(5):372-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.00986.x.

In addition, imatinib is ineffective in treating Ph+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) and CML blast crisis, even in the absence of the kinase domain mutations. This type of drug resistance that is unrelated to BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations is caused by the insensitivity of leukaemic stem cells to kinase inhibitors such as imatinib and dasatinib, and by activation of a newly-identified signalling pathway involving SRC kinases that are independent of BCR-ABL kinase activity for activation. This SRC pathway is essential for leukaemic cells to survive imatinib treatment and for CML transition to lymphoid blast crisis. Apart from BCR-ABL and SRC kinases, stem cell pathways must also be targeted for curative therapy of Ph+ leukaemia.","['Li, Shaoguang', 'Li, Dongguang']","['Li S', 'Li D']","['The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA. shaoguang.li@jax.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/01/22 09:00,2008/06/19 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCMM108 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2007.00108.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2007 Nov-Dec;11(6):1251-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2007.00108.x.,69,PMC4401291,"['R01 CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that HIV-HTLV co-infections are associated with upregulated HTLV-1/2 virus expression and disease. An in vitro model of HIV-1 and HTLV-1/2 co-infection was utilized to determine if cell free HIV-1 virions or recombinant HIV-1 Tat protein (200-1,000 ng/ml) upregulated HTLV-1/2 expression and infectivity. Exposure to HIV-1 increased the number of HTLV-1 antigen expressing cells, from 6% at baseline to 12% at 24 hr, and 20% at 120 hr (P < 0.05) post-exposure. A similar, although less robust response was observed in HTLV-2 infected cells. HIV-1 co-localized almost exclusively with HTLV-1/2 positive cells. Exposure to HIV-1 Tat protein (1,000 ng/ml) increased HTLV-1 p19 expression almost twofold by 48 hr, and cells co-stimulated with 10 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) showed almost a fourfold increase over baseline. It is concluded that HIV-1 augments HTLV-1/2 infectivity in vitro.

CD173/CD174 are concentrated on pseudopodial extensions responsible for initial contacts between endothelial cells.

Yet, there is not an acceptable Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development non-animal skin sensitization test method. Several in vitro skin sensitization methods that focus on the activation of Langerhans cells, including human cell lines, are being evaluated as possible alternatives. In our previous study, we optimized our human cell line activation test (h-CLAT) using THP-1 cells (monocytic leukemia cell line) and conducted an inter-laboratory study. We found that measuring CD86/CD54 expression may be useful for predicting skin sensitization. The aim of this study was to confirm the relationship between CD86/CD54 expression and THP-1 cell viability in the h-CLAT. In this study, 21 allergens (e.g., dinitrochlorobenzene, p-phenylenediamine, Ni) and 8 non-allergens (e.g., SLS, lactic acid) were evaluated. For each chemical, more than 10 concentrations that gave a predicted cell viability range of 20-95% were used. The data showed that expression patterns of CD86/CD54 differed depending on chemical. For most allergens, cytotoxicity (65-90% cell viability) was needed for enhancement of CD86/CD54 expression. The criteria of ""CD86 > or = 150 or CD54 > or = 200"" resulted in an accuracy of 93%, which confirms appropriate cut-off criteria for h-CLAT. Furthermore, a good correlation was observed between EC3 of local lymph node assay and EC150(CD86) or EC200(CD54) of h-CLAT (12 or 16 chemicals, respectively), which would provide a useful estimate of allergic potency. These findings suggest that h-CLAT would be a good robust in vitro skin sensitization test.","['Sakaguchi, Hitoshi', 'Ashikaga, Takao', 'Miyazawa, Masaaki', 'Kosaka, Nanae', 'Ito, Yuichi', 'Yoneyama, Katsurako', 'Sono, Sakiko', 'Itagaki, Hiroshi', 'Toyoda, Hidekazu', 'Suzuki, Hiroyuki']","['Sakaguchi H', 'Ashikaga T', 'Miyazawa M', 'Kosaka N', 'Ito Y', 'Yoneyama K', 'Sono S', 'Itagaki H', 'Toyoda H', 'Suzuki H']","['Safety Science Research Laboratories, Kao Corporation, 2606 Akabane, Ichikai-Machi, Haga-Gun, Tochigi, Japan. sakaguchi.hitoshi@kao.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080119,Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Allergens/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Animal Testing Alternatives/methods', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Dermatitis, Contact/immunology/*pathology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/immunology/*pathology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/immunology/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Skin Irritancy Tests/*methods', 'Solubility']",2008/01/22 09:00,2009/04/30 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2007/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10565-008-9059-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 2009 Apr;25(2):109-26. doi: 10.1007/s10565-008-9059-9.

It depletes plasma asparagine and glutamine, killing leukemic lymphoblasts but also causing immunosuppression. The objective of this work was to assess whether supplementing the diet with glutamine modifies the effect of asparaginase on normal lymphocyte populations in the spleen, thymus, and bone marrow. Mice consuming water ad libitum with or without alanyl-glutamine dipeptide (AlaGln; 0.05 mol/L) were injected once daily with 0 or 3 international units/g body weight Escherichia coli L-asparaginase for 7 d. Tissue expression of specific immune cell surface markers was analyzed by flow cytometry. Asparaginase reduced B220+ and sIgM+ cells in the bone marrow (P < 0.05) and diminished total cell numbers in thymus (-42%) and spleen (-53%) (P < 0.05). In thymus, asparaginase depleted double positive (CD4+ CD8+) and single positive (CD4+ CD8-, CD4-CD8+) thymocytes by over 40% (P < 0.05). In spleen, asparaginase reduced CD19+ B cells to 33% of controls and substantially depleted the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. CD11b-expressing leukocytes were reduced by 50% (P < 0.05). Consumption of AlaGln did not lessen the effects of asparaginase in bone marrow or thymus but mitigated cellular losses in the CD4+, CD8+, and CD11b+ populations in spleen. AlaGln also blunted the increase in eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) phosphorylation by asparaginase in spleen, whereas eIF2 phosphorylation did not change in thymus in response to asparaginase or AlaGln. In conclusion, asparaginase reduces maturing populations of normal B and T cells in thymus, bone marrow, and spleen. Oral consumption of AlaGln mitigates metabolic stress in spleen, supporting the peripheral immune system and cell-mediated immunity during asparaginase chemotherapy.","['Bunpo, Piyawan', 'Murray, Betty', 'Cundiff, Judy', 'Brizius, Emma', 'Aldrich, Carla J', 'Anthony, Tracy G']","['Bunpo P', 'Murray B', 'Cundiff J', 'Brizius E', 'Aldrich CJ', 'Anthony TG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Evansville, IN 47712, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'U5JDO2770Z (alanylglutamine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/blood', 'Animals', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Diet', 'Dipeptides/*administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/drug effects', 'Weight Gain']",2008/01/22 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['138/2/338 [pii]', '10.1093/jn/138.2.338 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr. 2008 Feb;138(2):338-43. doi: 10.1093/jn/138.2.338.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: We propose a multiple testing method, called the focus level procedure, that preserves the graph structure of Gene Ontology (GO). The procedure is constructed as a combination of a Closed Testing procedure with Holm's method. It requires a user to choose a 'focus level' in the GO graph, which reflects the level of specificity of terms in which the user is most interested. This choice also determines the level in the GO graph at which the procedure has most power. We prove that the procedure strongly controls the family-wise error rate without any additional assumptions on the joint distribution of the test statistics used. We also present an algorithm to calculate multiplicity-adjusted P-values. Because the focus level procedure preserves the structure of the GO graph, it does not generally preserve the ordering of the raw P-values in the adjusted P-values.

WRN is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family with functions in maintaining genome stability. Sir2, an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase, has been proven to extend life span in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans. Mammalian Sir2 (SIRT1) has also been found to regulate premature cellular senescence induced by the tumor suppressors PML and p53. SIRT1 plays an important role in cell survival promoted by calorie restriction. Here we show that SIRT1 interacts with WRN both in vitro and in vivo; this interaction is enhanced after DNA damage. WRN can be acetylated by acetyltransferase CBP/p300, and SIRT1 can deacetylate WRN both in vitro and in vivo. WRN acetylation decreases its helicase and exonuclease activities, and SIRT1 can reverse this effect. WRN acetylation alters its nuclear distribution. Down-regulation of SIRT1 reduces WRN translocation from nucleoplasm to nucleoli after DNA damage. These results suggest that SIRT1 regulates WRN-mediated cellular responses to DNA damage through deacetylation of WRN.","['Li, Kai', 'Casta, Alex', 'Wang, Rui', 'Lozada, Enerlyn', 'Fan, Wei', 'Kane, Susan', 'Ge, Qingyuan', 'Gu, Wei', 'Orren, David', 'Luo, Jianyuan']","['Li K', 'Casta A', 'Wang R', 'Lozada E', 'Fan W', 'Kane S', 'Ge Q', 'Gu W', 'Orren D', 'Luo J']","['Department of Cancer Biology and the Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080117,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (WRN protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Werner Syndrome Helicase)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Aging, Premature/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology', 'DNA Damage/physiology', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genomic Instability/physiology', 'Humans', 'Longevity/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RecQ Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sirtuin 1', 'Sirtuins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Werner Syndrome Helicase']",2008/01/22 09:00,2008/05/13 09:00,['2008/01/22 09:00'],"['2008/01/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)55148-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M709707200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Mar 21;283(12):7590-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M709707200.

An approach based on mutation screening methods targeted to coding regions of candidate genes offers an attractive strategy for the identification of rare disease-causing alleles. The RAD genes participate in the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks, detecting DNA damage, activating cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis. Defects in members of these genes are linked to increased chromosomal instability and in lymphoma predisposition, thereby representing strong candidate susceptibility genes a priori. To examine this proposition we screened 75 familial CLL probands for germline mutations in this set of genes. No overt pathogenic mutations were identified.

Serum levels of TPO did not correlate with peripheral blood lymphocytosis (p = 0.928), Rai substages (p = 0.516), platelet count (p = 0.572), hemoglobin level (p = 0.228), LDH (p = 0.144) and beta2-microglobulin (p = 0.520). The same applied when correlation with ZAP-70 (p = 0.562), CD38 (p = 0.258) or mutational status of IgV(H) (p = 0.0794) were sought. The risk of disease-progression according to known and putative prognostic parameters was also evaluated as time to first treatment (TFT). The univariate Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that the absence of IgV(H) mutational status (p = 0.0005) and ZAP-70-positivity (p = 0.02) were associated with a shorter TFT. In contrast, Kaplan-Meier estimates of TFT, plotted after setting as cut-off the median value for TPO (i.e., 46 pg/mL), failed to demonstrate any statistical difference between two groups (p = 0.342). Looking for cellular source of TPO we investigated the presence of TPO at gene expression level in 60 B-CLL patients belonging to an independent series. Here we provide evidence for the presence of a low TPO gene expression transcript in B-CLL cells. In conclusion, our results indicate that in early B-cell CLL circulating level of TPO does not provide a useful insight into the complex interrelationship of prognostic variables.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Vitelli, Gaetano', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Mirabelli, Rosanna', 'Digiesi, Giovanna', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Ferrarini, Manlio']","['Molica S', 'Vitelli G', 'Cutrona G', 'Todoerti K', 'Mirabelli R', 'Digiesi G', 'Morabito F', 'Neri A', 'Ferrarini M']","['Department of Oncology/Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood/genetics', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*blood']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/04/17 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['789687263 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701760045 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jan;49(1):62-7. doi: 10.1080/10428190701760045.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, immunophenotypic detection of relapse by flow cytometry in B-lineage ALL can be confounded by several factors, including lack of a unique immunophenotype and modulation of aberrant phenotypes after treatment. We hypothesized that flow cytometric DNA ploidy analysis may detect relapse in aneuploid ALL cases that might be missed by flow immunophenotyping. We retrospectively studied ALL cases at our institution between 1991 and 2003 (n = 114). Aneuploid populations were present at diagnosis in 32% of all patients. Sixty-five percent of all patients had ""normal"" leukemic immunophenotypes, defined as being similar to normal precursor B-cells, while 35% had ""aberrant"" immunophenotypes with myeloid or T antigen co-expression. In ALL cases that were originally aneuploid, follow-up ploidy-analysis detected relapsed disease in all cases which were also detected by flow immunophenotyping, suggesting that ploidy analysis is highly sensitive for detecting ALL relapse. However, in 5 cases in which the diagnosis of relapse could not be reliably made by flow immunophenotyping, ploidy analysis successfully detected aneuploid cells, i.e., relapse, in all five; these included 3 patients with normal and 2 with aberrant original immunophenotypes. These results suggest that it may be beneficial to perform ploidy analysis as an adjunct to flow immunophenotyping in following patients with B-lineage ALL who demonstrate aneuploidy at diagnosis.","['Kenney, Barton', 'Zieske, Arthur', 'Rinder, Henry', 'Smith, Brian']","['Kenney B', 'Zieske A', 'Rinder H', 'Smith B']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8035, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Aneuploidy', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/04/17 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['789685565 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701760052 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jan;49(1):42-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190701760052.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extent of apoptosis by TRAIL is tightly regulated by the expression of these receptors and by downstream signaling. Chemotherapeutic agents increase the expressions of DR4 and DR5 on tumor cells through the activation of various transcription factors and there is enhanced killing on combining these agents with TRAIL. In this review, we will discuss the mechanism of TRAIL death receptor-induced apoptosis and the regulation of DR4 and DR5 expression. In particular, we will focus on the regulation of TRAIL death receptor signaling in hematological malignancies and the mechanisms responsible for the sensitization of leukemia and lymphoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by chemotherapy.

However, a substantial number of patients are either primarily refractory or acquire resistance to imatinib. While a number of mechanisms are known to confer resistance to imatinib, increasing evidence has demonstrated a role for BCR-ABL-independent pathways. The Src-family kinases (SFKs) are one such pathway and have been implicated in imatinib resistance. Additionally, these kinases are key to the progression of CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). The dual SFK/BCR-ABL inhibitor dasatinib is now clinically available and has markedly greater potency compared with imatinib against native BCR-ABL and the majority of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. Therefore, this agent, as well as other dual SFK/BCR-ABL inhibitors under development, could provide added therapeutic advantages by overcoming both BCR-ABL-dependent (i.e. BCR-ABL mutations) and -independent forms of imatinib resistance and delaying transition to advanced phase disease. In this review, we discuss the preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrating the involvement of SFKs in imatinib resistance and the progression of CML and Ph+ ALL, as well as the potential role of dual SFK/BCR-ABL inhibition in the management of these diseases.","['Li, Shaoguang']",['Li S'],"['The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, USA. shaoguang.li@jax.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'src-Family Kinases/*physiology']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/04/17 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['788626616 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701713689 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jan;49(1):19-26. doi: 10.1080/10428190701713689.,90,PMC2430171,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with symptomatic MM responsive to therapy received myeloablative conditioning with radiotherapy (n=12) or chemotherapy (n=10) followed by infusion of HLA-identical grafts from a sibling. Graft vs. host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of 'ex vivo' T-cell depletion with CAMPATH-1 antibody. The objective of the study was to determine transplant-related mortality (TRM), GvHD, overall survival (OS) and Disease free Survival (DFS). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients, median age 45 (range 37-56) years, had a median performance status of 1 (0-2). Patients received a median of 23.8 x 10(4)/kg CFU-GM and 4.31 x 10(6)/kg CD34. Median time to engraftment was 13 days. The day-100 and 1-year TRM was 9% and 20%, respectively. Ten patients suffered disease recurrence. Four of eight patients remained in remission after infusions of donor lymphocyte (DLI) containing a median total of 0.67 x 10(8)/kg CD3 cells. Three-year OS was 56%, and 50% remained disease free at a median of 1101 days (range 385-5309). Multiple regression analysis showed that bone marrow (vs. peripheral blood stem cell) (P=0.03), presentation of low albumin (P=0.02) and a higher dose of CAMPATH-1H (P=0.01) were adverse factors for survival. Cox analysis confirmed that a lower CAMPATH-1H dose was associated with improved outcome. DISCUSSION: In chemotherapy-responsive patients with myeloma, T-cell depletion of allogeneic grafts was associated with an acceptable 1-year TRM and seemed to have a favorable impact on long-term survival.","['Novitzky, N', 'Thomas, V', 'du Toit, C']","['Novitzky N', 'Thomas V', 'du Toit C']","['Groote Schuur Hospital, Observatory, University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre and Department of Haematology, Cape Town, South Africa.

Tissues were collected from 32-week-old commercial meat-type and Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory experimental White Leghorn Line 0 chickens with the following different infection profiles: tV + A-, included in ovo-tolerized viraemic chickens with no neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) on any sampling; ntV + A-, included chickens that were viraemic and NAb-negative at the time of termination at 32 weeks post hatch, but had NAbs on up to two occasions; V+ A+, included chickens that were viraemic and NAb-positive at the time of termination at 32 weeks post hatch, and had NAbs on more than two occasions; V - A+, included chickens that were negative for viraemia and NAb-positive at the time of termination at 32 weeks post hatch, and had antibody on more than two occasions; V - A-, included chickens that were never exposed to ALV J virus.

METHODS: The blastomeres of two (1/2) and eight cells (1/8) embryos were isolated and cultured in T6 medium in the presence and absence of LIF (1,000 IU/ml) and or GM-CSF (2 ng/ml) up to 120 h. The diameter and cell number of blastocysts were measured. RESULTS: The developmental rates of 1/2 isolated blastomeres developed to blastocysts stages in the presence and absence of LIF and GM-CSF were 45.80, 35.10 and 48.66, 41.66, respectively. The diameter of blastocysts was higher in GM-CSF group and total cell number of blastocyst in both treated groups was higher than control (P < 0.05). No 1/8 blastomeres developed to morula and blastocyst stages. CONCLUSIONS: LIF and GM-CSF could improve the development of 1/2 isolated blastomeres.","['Sheikholslami, Behnaz', 'Salehnia, Mojdeh', 'Valojerdi, Mojtaba Rezazadeh', 'Ramezanzadeh, Mehdi']","['Sheikholslami B', 'Salehnia M', 'Valojerdi MR', 'Ramezanzadeh M']","['Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, P.O.

However, toxicity of hypercalcemia has limited the use of 1,25(OH)2D3 in clinical trials. We have evaluated 11 synthesized vitamin D3 analogs for their ability to inhibit clonal growth of HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells. Among the 11 vitamin D3 analogs, HY-11 (code name) showed the most potent antileukemic activity with 2.5x10(-6) M of IC50, however, it did not affect the cellular growth of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells until 10(-6) M. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that HY-11 induced the G1 arrest in a dose-dependent manner, which was mediated via inactivation of CDK4 and CDK6 in association with up-regulation of CDKI (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), p27 and Rb protein. Induction of apoptosis was mediated via caspase-3 pathway in HY-11-treated HL-60. In addition, HY-11 enhanced the expression of TGF-beta1, TGF-beta receptor type I and II and vitamin D3 receptor (VDR). VDR expression was increased by TGF-beta1, suggesting that TGF-beta1 might be involved in the antiproliferative effect of HY-11 on HL-60 cells by autocrine and paracrine regulation. Serum calcium levels were within normal limit when HY-11 was given intraperitoneally (i.p.) every other day for 5 weeks to BALB/c mice at the doses of 10(-7), 10(-6)and 10(-5) M. HY-11 inhibited the growth of WEHI-3BD+ mouse leukemic cells in vitro, and syngeneic BALB/c mice that received WEHI-3BD+ mouse leukemic cells and HY-11 had a significantly longer survival without producing hypercalcemia compared to control group. In summary, HY-11 is a vitamin D3 analog that inhibited the proliferation of human AML cell line, HL-60, through induction of cell cycle arrest, triggering apoptosis as well as modulation of TGF-beta1 and its receptors. In particular, HY-11 significantly increased the survival of mice that had myeloid leukemia without producing hypercalcemia.","['Yoon, Jin Sun', 'Kim, Ju Young', 'Park, Hyun Ki', 'Kim, Eun Shil', 'Ahn, Kwang Sung', 'Yoon, Sung Soo', 'Cho, Cheon Gyu', 'Kim, Byoung Kook', 'Lee, Young Yiul']","['Yoon JS', 'Kim JY', 'Park HK', 'Kim ES', 'Ahn KS', 'Yoon SS', 'Cho CG', 'Kim BK', 'Lee YY']","['Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, University Hospital, 28 Yon Gon-dong, Chong No-ku, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HY-11)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cholecalciferol/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Chemical', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Feb;32(2):387-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HMGA proteins are characterized by three DNA-binding domains, called AT-hooks, and an acidic carboxy-terminal tail. HMGA proteins are architectural transcription factors that both positively and negatively regulate the transcription of a variety of genes. They do not display direct transcriptional activation capacity, but regulate gene expression by changing the DNA conformation by binding to AT-rich regions in the DNA and/or direct interaction with several transcription factors. In this way, they influence a diverse array of normal biological processes including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and death. Both HMGA1 and HMGA2 are hardly detectable in normal adult tissue but are abundantly and ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development. In malignant epithelial tumors as well as in leukemia, however, expression of HMGA1 is again strongly elevated to embryonic levels thus leading to ectopic expression of (fetal) target genes. HMGA2 overexpression also has a causal role in inducing neoplasia. Besides overexpression of full length HMGA proteins in different tumors, the HMGA genes are often involved in chromosomal rearrangements. Such translocations are mostly detected in benign tumors of mesenchymal origin and are believed to be one of the most common chromosomal rearrangements in human neoplasia. To provide clarity in the abundance of articles on this topic, this review gives a general overview of the nuclear functions and regulation of the HMGA genes and corresponding proteins.","['Cleynen, Isabelle', 'Van de Ven, Wim J M']","['Cleynen I', 'Van de Ven WJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Department of Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Herestraat 49/bus 602, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (HMGA Proteins)', '0 (HMGA2 Protein)', '124543-08-4 (HMGA1b Protein)', '124544-67-8 (HMGA1a Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HMGA Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'HMGA1a Protein/*physiology', 'HMGA1b Protein/*physiology', 'HMGA2 Protein/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Feb;32(2):289-305.,169,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we analyzed the stability of retroviral vectors produced in culture supernatants (RTVsup) for ex vivo gene therapy upon long-term storage. We have generated RTVsups derived from two packaging cell lines, PG13 and Phoenix(Ampho). Both lines produced murine leukemia virus-derived SFG-scFv(G250)-CD4gamma vector, which were pseudotyped with the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope and amphotropic envelope, respectively. The supernatants were stored at -80 or -196 degrees C. To date, the PG13-derived RTVsups have been evaluated over a period of 9 years (1998-2007). In addition, a clinical batch of Phoenix(Ampho)-derived RTVsup has been evaluated over a period of 5 years (2002-2007). Here, we show that both RTVsups, when stored up to 9 and 5 years, respectively, do not show any sign of decay in their capacity to functionally transduce primary human T cells. These data provide evidence that in terms of 'life expectancy' the production and storage of clinical batches of RTVsup for gene therapy warrants the corresponding professional and financial risks.","['Lamers, C H J', 'van Elzakker, P', 'Luider, B A', 'van Steenbergen, S C L', 'Sleijfer, S', 'Debets, R', 'Gratama, J W']","['Lamers CH', 'van Elzakker P', 'Luider BA', 'van Steenbergen SC', 'Sleijfer S', 'Debets R', 'Gratama JW']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Laboratory of Clinical and Tumor Immunology, Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. c.lamers@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080118,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,,IM,"['Flow Cytometry', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['7701114 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cgt.7701114 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2008 Apr;15(4):268-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7701114.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with DS and newly diagnosed AML (n = 57) were prospectively enrolled onto the standard-therapy arm of POG 9421 and were administered five cycles of chemotherapy, which included daunorubicin 135 mg/m(2) and mitoxantrone 80 mg/m(2). Outcomes and toxicity were evaluated prospectively and were compared with the non-DS-AML cohort (n = 565). A retrospective chart review was performed to identify adverse cardiac events. RESULTS: In the DS-AML group, 54 patients (94.7%) entered remission. One experienced induction failure and two died. Of the 54 who entered remission, three relapsed and six died as a result of other causes. The remission induction rate was similar in the non-DS-French-American-British (FAB) M7 (91.7%) and non-DS-non-M7 (89.3%) groups. The 5-year overall survival was significantly better in the DS-AML group (78.6%) than in the non-DS-M7 (36.3%) or the non-DS-non-M7 (51.8%) groups (P < .001). No age-related difference in 5-year, event-free survival was seen between patients younger than 2 years (75.8%) and those aged 2 to 4 years (78.3%). Symptomatic cardiomyopathy developed in 10 patients (17.5%) with DS-AML during or soon after completion of treatment; three died as a result of congestive heart failure. CONCLUSION: The POG 9421 treatment regimen was highly effective in both remission induction and disease-free survival for patients with DS-AML. However, there was a high incidence of cardiomyopathy, which supports current strategies for dose reduction of anthracyclines in this patient population.","[""O'Brien, Maureen M"", 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Chang, Myron N', 'Massey, Gita V', 'Stine, Kimo C', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Becton, David', 'Ravindranath, Yaddanapudi', 'Dahl, Gary V']","[""O'Brien MM"", 'Taub JW', 'Chang MN', 'Massey GV', 'Stine KC', 'Raimondi SC', 'Becton D', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Dahl GV']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cardiomyopathies/*chemically induced', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/3/414 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.13.2209 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 20;26(3):414-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.13.2209.,,PMC3897300,"['R01 CA090916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA90916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS515321'],,,,,"[""Children's Oncology Group Study POG 9421""]",,,,,,,,,

In this study, we compared the toxicity and efficacy in mice of natural product gossypol and its semisynthetic derivative apo-gossypol, compounds that bind and inhibit antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Daily oral dosing studies showed that mice tolerate doses of apogossypol 2- to 4-times higher than gossypol. Hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity represented the major adverse activities of gossypol, with apogossypol far less toxic. Efficacy was tested in transgenic mice in which Bcl-2 is overexpressed in B cells, resembling low-grade follicular lymphoma in humans. In vitro, Bcl-2-expressing B cells from transgenic mice were more sensitive to cytotoxicity induced by apogossypol than gossypol, with LD50 values of 3 to 5 microM and 7.5 to 10 microM, respectively. In vivo, using the maximum tolerated dose of gossypol for sequential daily dosing, apogossypol displayed superior activity to gossypol in terms of reducing splenomegaly and reducing B-cell counts in spleens of Bcl-2-transgenic mice. Taken together, these studies indicate that apogossypol is superior to parent compound gossypol with respect to toxicology and efficacy, suggesting that further development of this compound for cancer therapy is warranted.","['Kitada, Shinichi', 'Kress, Christina L', 'Krajewska, Maryla', 'Jia, Lee', 'Pellecchia, Maurizio', 'Reed, John C']","['Kitada S', 'Kress CL', 'Krajewska M', 'Jia L', 'Pellecchia M', 'Reed JC']","['Burnham Institute for Medical Research, Cancer Research Center, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080117,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (apogossypol)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gossypol/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/04/26 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)48632-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-113647 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Mar 15;111(6):3211-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-113647.

In NF-kappaB-inhibited monocytes, TNF stimulates cell death/apoptosis. In the present study, we analyzed the response of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells to TNF stimulation in conjunction with NF-kappaB inhibition. In all AML-derived cells tested, NF-kappaB-inhibited cells were resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that the cytoprotective gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was induced in NF-kappaB-inhibited AML cells in response to TNF stimulation, and HO-1 was responsible for the resistance of AML cells to the cytotoxic actions of TNF. Moreover, after transfection with HO-1 siRNA, the resistance to TNF-induced cell death signals of AML cells was removed. The HO-1 promoter region contains antioxidant-response elements that can bind the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). We further demonstrated that Nrf2 was activated by TNF under NF-kappaB-inhibited conditions, to play the major role in up-regulating HO-1 expression and ultimately the fate of AML cells. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which TNF-induced cell death is inhibited in AML cells through the induction of HO-1, via Nrf2 activation.","['Rushworth, Stuart A', 'MacEwan, David J']","['Rushworth SA', 'MacEwan DJ']","['School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080117,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Necrosis/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)43103-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-104042 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Apr 1;111(7):3793-801. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-104042.

Little is known about the association between the degree of osteonecrosis and functional mobility in this population. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among the degree of osteonecrosis, pain, range of motion (ROM), and functional mobility in people with ALL. SUBJECTS: Thirty-three subjects aged 5 to 27 years with ALL and osteonecrosis participated. METHODS: The extent of osteonecrosis was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip and knee according to 2 classification systems, including the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) and a knee staging scale. Pain, hip and knee ROM, and the Timed Up and Down Stairs (TUDS) Test were used as measures. RESULTS: Correlations were observed between ARCO and hip pain (r=.34), between hip flexion ROM and hip pain (r=-.34), and between knee pain and time on the TUDS Test (r=-.35). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Physical therapists should consider that people with ALL may have hip or knee osteonecrosis without clinical symptoms. This notion supports the need for MRI in addition to a comprehensive examination of functional mobility.","['Marchese, Victoria G', 'Connolly, Barbara H', 'Able, Colleen', 'Booten, April R', 'Bowen, Patrick', 'Porter, Bethany M', 'Rai, Shesh N', 'Hancock, Michael L', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Howard, Scott', 'Neel, Mike D', 'Kaste, Sue C']","['Marchese VG', 'Connolly BH', 'Able C', 'Booten AR', 'Bowen P', 'Porter BM', 'Rai SN', 'Hancock ML', 'Pui CH', 'Howard S', 'Neel MD', 'Kaste SC']","['Department of Physical Therapy, College of Allied Health Sciences, Health Science Center, University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tenn, USA. marchese@lvc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080117,United States,Phys Ther,Physical therapy,0022623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Arthralgia/*physiopathology', 'Arthrometry, Articular', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects', 'Hip Joint/pathology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Knee Joint/pathology/physiopathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/chemically induced/*physiopathology', 'Pain Measurement', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Range of Motion, Articular/*physiology', '*Severity of Illness Index']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/05/09 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['ptj.20070108 [pii]', '10.2522/ptj.20070108 [doi]']",ppublish,Phys Ther. 2008 Mar;88(3):341-50. doi: 10.2522/ptj.20070108.

The overexpression of p210Bcr-Abl was reported to down-regulate CXCR4 expression, and this is associated with the cell migration defects in CML. We proposed that tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib or INNO-406, may restore CXCR4 expression and cause the migration of CML cells to bone marrow microenvironment niches, which in turn results in acquisition of stroma-mediated chemoresistance of CML progenitor cells. In KBM5 and K562 cells, imatinib, INNO-406, or IFN-alpha increased CXCR4 expression and migration. This increase in CXCR4 levels on CML progenitor cells was likewise found in samples from CML patients treated with imatinib or IFN-alpha. Imatinib induced G0-G1 cell cycle block in CML cells, which was further enhanced in a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) coculture system. MSC coculture protected KBM-5 cells from imatinib-induced cell death. These antiapoptotic effects were abrogated by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3465 or by inhibitor of integrin-linked kinase QLT0267. Altogether, these findings suggest that the up-regulation of CXCR4 by imatinib promotes migration of CML cells to bone marrow stroma, causing the G0-G1 cell cycle arrest and hence ensuring the survival of quiescent CML progenitor cells.","['Jin, Linhua', 'Tabe, Yoko', 'Konoplev, Sergej', 'Xu, Yuanyuan', 'Leysath, Clinton E', 'Lu, Hongbo', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Ohsaka, Akimichi', 'Rios, Mary-Beth', 'Calvert, Leslie', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Jin L', 'Tabe Y', 'Konoplev S', 'Xu Y', 'Leysath CE', 'Lu H', 'Kimura S', 'Ohsaka A', 'Rios MB', 'Calvert L', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/04/04 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/1/48 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0042 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 Jan;7(1):48-58. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several essential transcription factors have been identified for the self-renewal of mouse ES cells, including STAT3, Oct-3/4, and Nanog. The molecular mechanism of ES cell self-renewal, however, is not fully understood. In the present study, we identified Eed, a core component of Polycomb repressive complex 2, as a downstream molecule of STAT3 and Oct-3/4. Artificial activation of STAT3 resulted in increased expression of Eed, whereas expression of a dominant negative mutant of STAT3 or suppression of Oct-3/4 expression led to down-regulation of Eed. Reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that STAT3 and Oct-3/4 directly bind to the promoter region of Eed, suggesting that Eed is a common target molecule of STAT3 and Oct-3/4. We also found that suppression of STAT3, Oct-3/4, or Eed causes induction of differentiation-associated genes as well as loss of Lys(27)-trimethylated histone H3 at the promoter regions of the differentiation-associated genes. Suppression of STAT3 and Oct-3/4 also resulted in the absence of Eed at the promoter regions. These results suggest that STAT3 and Oct-3/4 maintain silencing of differentiation-associated genes through up-regulation of Eed in self-renewing ES cells.","['Ura, Hiroki', 'Usuda, Masayuki', 'Kinoshita, Keita', 'Sun, Chuanhai', 'Mori, Keitaro', 'Akagi, Tadayuki', 'Matsuda, Takahiko', 'Koide, Hiroshi', 'Yokota, Takashi']","['Ura H', 'Usuda M', 'Kinoshita K', 'Sun C', 'Mori K', 'Akagi T', 'Matsuda T', 'Koide H', 'Yokota T']","['Department of Stem Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-8640, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080116,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Eed protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/05/29 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)57043-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M707275200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Apr 11;283(15):9713-23. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M707275200.

While the predictive value of cytogenetical abnormalities, immunoglobulin heavy chain gene mutation status, CD38 and ZAP70 expression is already well known, the significance of multi-drug resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is not well characterized. AIMS: The goal of this study was to characterize the multidrug resistance features in 82 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia at the genetical, expression- and functional level and to compare it with the patient's clinical behavior (survival and response to therapy). METHODS: Light Cycler Real Time PCR based ""Single Nucleotide Polymorphism"" analysis of the MDR1 gene, as a biological predictor of the expression level of P-glycoprotein was tested in 66 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. P-glycoprotein expression and MDR-function was detected in 82 cases by flow cytometry (by use of anti-P-glycoprotein monoclonal antibody and calcein-verapamil functional test). Response to therapy was analyzed by statistical Fisher-test in the treated 35 patients. The survival analysis (Log-rank test) was performed on the whole population ( n = 82). RESULTS: No significant correlation was found between the three levels of multidrug resistance (genetics, phenotype, function) in our patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. P-glycoprotein positive cases (n = 9) were predominantly non-responders (8/9, 89%). There must be, however, other mechanisms causing non-response (total non-responders: 13/35 treated cases). Most of P-glycoprotein negative CLL patients (n = 26) responded well (21/26, 80%) to chemotherapy (responders: 22/35 treated CLL) (p < 0,001). The tendency was the same in the average expected survival rate between P-glycoprotein positive and negative patients (84 vs 203 months) but the difference was not significant (p = 0,106). CONCLUSIONS: This study proved the clinical prognostic significance of P-glycoprotein expression of leukaemic cells predicting the chemotherapy response and partially estimating the general survival of patients suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Szendrei, Tamas', 'Magyarlaki, Tamas', 'Kovacs, Gabor', 'Nagy, Agnes', 'Szomor, Arpad', 'Molnar, Lenke', 'David, Mariann', 'Tokes-Fuzesi, Margit', 'Rideg, Orsolya', 'Poto, Laszlo', 'Pajor, Laszlo', 'Kajtar, Bela', 'Losonczy, Hajna']","['Szendrei T', 'Magyarlaki T', 'Kovacs G', 'Nagy A', 'Szomor A', 'Molnar L', 'David M', 'Tokes-Fuzesi M', 'Rideg O', 'Poto L', 'Pajor L', 'Kajtar B', 'Losonczy H']","['Pecsi Tudomanyegyetem, Orvostudomanyi es Egeszsegtudomanyi Centrum I Belgyogyaszati Klinika, Hematologiai Osztaly, Pecs, Hungary. tomasso81@freemail.hu']",['hun'],['Journal Article'],,Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/immunology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/04/17 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['4J2407678H6L175L [pii]', '10.1556/OH.2008.28203 [doi]']",ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2008 Jan 27;149(4):161-7. doi: 10.1556/OH.2008.28203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Multidrogrezisztencia-vizsgalatok kronikus lymphoid leukaemiaban.,,,,

We report on the identification of lif and lifr transcripts in the zebrafish and document the expression of these molecules in the developing embryos and tissues of adult zebrafish. We also examined the phylogenetic relationship between these molecules and other IL-6 cytokine family members known in mammals. In adult zebrafish, lif is expressed in the kidney and brain while lifr is expressed in the kidney, gill, brain, spleen and liver. During zebrafish embryogenesis, lif and lifr are both expressed as early as 12 hours postfertilization (hpf). In developing zebrafish, lif is expressed in the otic vesicle, retina and cranial sensory ganglia, and lifr is strongly expressed in the notochord, forebrain, otic vesicle, cranial ganglia and the retina. Morpholino knockdown of Lif and Lifr in developing embryos suggests that Lifr, but not Lif is required for proper neural development. lifr morpholino-injected embryos exhibit defects in the trigeminal, facial and vagal branchiomotor neurons, and improper axonal development as measured by acetylated tubulin staining. These embryos also display severe hydrocephaly by 48 hpf. This suggests that Lifrs are involved in proper neural development in zebrafish. This is the first evidence of the expression and role of an LIFR-like molecule in developing fish.","['Hanington, Patrick C', 'Patten, Shunmoogum A', 'Reaume, Laura M', 'Waskiewicz, Andrew J', 'Belosevic, Miodrag', 'Ali, Declan W']","['Hanington PC', 'Patten SA', 'Reaume LM', 'Waskiewicz AJ', 'Belosevic M', 'Ali DW']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20071022,United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (m17 protein, zebrafish)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Aging/physiology', 'Animals', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Nervous System/*embryology/growth & development', '*Nervous System Physiological Phenomena', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vertebrates/classification/genetics/physiology', 'Zebrafish/genetics/*physiology', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-1606(07)01436-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2008 Feb 15;314(2):250-60. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.10.012.

Although liposomal cytarabine is increasingly used for the treatment (and prophylaxis) of CNS involvement in patients with leukemia/lymphoma, many of the recently presented clinical trials on liposomal cytarabine were retrospective in nature or used this drug on a compassionate basis. So far, one randomized Phase III study has shown significantly better response rates in patients with lymphomatous meningitis who received liposomal cytarabine compared with free cytarabine. Considerable concerns about the safety of this drug arose from recent observations that liposomal cytarabine might contribute to neurologic side effects when given too closely to high-dose systemic chemotherapy known to penetrate the brain-blood barrier. Superior efficacy of liposomal cytarabine compared with standard intrathecal therapy should be confirmed in prospective clinical trials. Careful adherence with preventive measures might help physicians to minimize side effects possibly related to the administration of liposomal cytarabine.","['Benesch, Martin', 'Urban, Christian']","['Benesch M', 'Urban C']","['Medical University of Graz, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Auenbruggerplatz 30, A-8036 Graz, Austria. martin.benesch@klinikum-graz.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Meningitis/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/trends']",2008/01/19 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2008/01/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14656566.9.2.301 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2008 Feb;9(2):301-9. doi: 10.1517/14656566.9.2.301.,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LSC seems to be immunophenotypically distinct and more resistant to chemotherapy than the more committed blasts. Considering that the multidrug resistance (MDR) constitutive expression may be a barrier to therapy in AML, we have investigated whether various MDR transporters were differentially expressed at the protein level by different leukemic subsets. METHODS: The relative expression of the drug-efflux pumps P-gp, MRP, LRP, and BCRP was evaluated by mean fluorescence index (MFI) and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis (D values) in five leukemic subpopulations: CD34+CD38-CD123+ (LSCs), CD34+CD38+CD123-, CD34+CD38+CD123+, CD34+CD38+CD123-, and CD34- mature cells in 26 bone marrow samples of CD34+ AML cases. RESULTS: : The comparison between the two more immature subsets (LSC versus CD34+CD38-CD123- cells) revealed a higher P-gp, MRP, and LRP expression in LSCs. The comparative analysis between LSCs and subsets of intermediate maturation (CD34+CD38+) demonstrated the higher BCRP expression in the LSCs. In addition, P-gp expression was also significantly higher in the LSC compared to CD34+CD38+CD123- subpopulation. Finally, the comparative analysis between LSC and the most mature subset (CD34-) revealed higher MRP and LRP and lower P-gp expression in the LSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the cellular heterogeneity of AML, the higher MDR transporters expression at the most immature, self-renewable, and quiescent LSC population reinforces that MDR is one of the mechanisms responsible for treatment failure.","['de Figueiredo-Pontes, Lorena L', 'Pintao, Maria-Carolina T', 'Oliveira, Luciana C O', 'Dalmazzo, Leandro F F', 'Jacomo, Rafael H', 'Garcia, Aglair B', 'Falcao, Roberto P', 'Rego, Eduardo M']","['de Figueiredo-Pontes LL', 'Pintao MC', 'Oliveira LC', 'Dalmazzo LF', 'Jacomo RH', 'Garcia AB', 'Falcao RP', 'Rego EM']","['Hematology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Whereas de novo MDS and AML are almost always subclassified according to cytogenetic characteristics, therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) and therapy-related AML (t-AML) are often considered as separate entities and are not subdivided. Alternative genetic pathways were previously proposed in t-MDS and t-AML based on cytogenetic characteristics. An increasing number of gene mutations are now observed to cluster differently in these pathways with an identical pattern in de novo and in t-MDS and t-AML. An association is observed between activating mutations of genes in the tyrosine kinase RAS-BRAF signal-transduction pathway (Class I mutations) and inactivating mutations of genes encoding hematopoietic transcription factors (Class II mutations). Point mutations of AML1 and RAS seem to cooperate and predispose to progression from t-MDS to t-AML. Recently, critical genetic effects underlying 5q-/-5 and 7q-/-7 have been proposed. Their association and cooperation with point mutations of p53 and AML1, respectively, extend the scenario of cooperating genetic abnormalities in MDS and AML. As de novo and t-MDS and t-AML are biologically identical diseases, they ought to be subclassified and treated similarly.","['Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Andersen, M K', 'Andersen, M T', 'Christiansen, D H']","['Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Andersen MK', 'Andersen MT', 'Christiansen DH']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, The Cytogenetic Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. chromjpb@rh.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080117,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2008/01/18 09:00,2008/03/28 09:00,['2008/01/18 09:00'],"['2008/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['2405078 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2405078 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Feb;22(2):240-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2405078.

This subgroup analysis of the phase 3 Assessment of Proteasome Inhibition for Extending Remissions (APEX) study of bortezomib vs high-dose dexamethasone assessed efficacy and safety in patients with relapsed MM with varying degrees of renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30, 30-50, 51-80 and >80 ml min(-1)). Time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and safety were compared between subgroups with CrCl < or =50 ml min(-1) (severe-to-moderate) and >50 ml min(-1) (no/mild impairment). Response rates with bortezomib were similar (36-47%) and time to response rapid (0.7-1.6 months) across subgroups. Although the trend was toward shorter TTP/OS in bortezomib patients with severe-to-moderate vs no/mild impairment, differences were not significant. OS was significantly shorter in dexamethasone patients with CrCl < or =50 vs >50 ml min(-1) (P=0.003), indicating that bortezomib is more effective than dexamethasone in overcoming the detrimental effect of renal impairment. Safety profile of bortezomib was comparable between subgroups. With dexamethasone, grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and discontinuations for AEs were significantly elevated in patients with CrCl < or =50 vs >50 ml min(-1).

We investigated growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of sorafenib in AML. Our studies demonstrated that sorafenib significantly inhibited the phosphorylation levels of Raf downstream target proteins MEK1/2 and Erk, induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation in AML cell lines and in primary AML samples. Mechanistically, treatment with sorafenib resulted in upregulation of proapoptotic Bim, accompanied by an increase in Bad, Bax and Bak protein levels and decreased Mcl-1, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis and surviving levels, which mainly led to the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Silencing of Bim protein expression significantly abrogated sorafenib-induced apoptosis, suggesting a critical function of Bim in the activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway induced by sorafenib. Importantly, sorafenib also modulated phospho-Erk, Bim, Bax and Mcl-1 levels in samples procured from patients in an ongoing Phase I clinical trial of sorafenib in AML. Combination of sorafenib with cytarabine or the novel small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 synergistically induced cell death in AML cell lines. Our results strongly suggest potential activity of sorafenib as a novel mechanism-based therapeutic agent in AML.","['Zhang, W', 'Konopleva, M', 'Ruvolo, V R', 'McQueen, T', 'Evans, R L', 'Bornmann, W G', 'McCubrey, J', 'Cortes, J', 'Andreeff, M']","['Zhang W', 'Konopleva M', 'Ruvolo VR', 'McQueen T', 'Evans RL', 'Bornmann WG', 'McCubrey J', 'Cortes J', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

This antiviral activity can be constitutively expressed or induced by interferon-alpha, and it consists of protein-based tethers, which we term 'tetherins', that cause retention of fully formed virions on infected cell surfaces. Using deductive constraints and gene expression analyses, we identify CD317 (also called BST2 or HM1.24), a membrane protein of previously unknown function, as a tetherin. Specifically, CD317 expression correlated with, and induced, a requirement for Vpu during HIV-1 and murine leukaemia virus particle release. Furthermore, in cells where HIV-1 virion release requires Vpu expression, depletion of CD317 abolished this requirement. CD317 caused retention of virions on cell surfaces and, after endocytosis, in CD317-positive compartments. Vpu co-localized with CD317 and inhibited these effects. Inhibition of Vpu function and consequent mobilization of tetherin's antiviral activity is a potential therapeutic strategy in HIV/AIDS.","['Neil, Stuart J D', 'Zang, Trinity', 'Bieniasz, Paul D']","['Neil SJ', 'Zang T', 'Bieniasz PD']","['Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and Laboratory of Retrovirology, The Rockefeller University, 455 First Avenue, New York, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080116,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (BST2 protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (vpu protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/virology', 'Endocytosis', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HIV Infections/metabolism/therapy/virology', 'HIV-1/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Transport', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Replication', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/metabolism']",2008/01/18 09:00,2008/03/06 09:00,['2008/01/18 09:00'],"['2007/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature06553 [pii]', '10.1038/nature06553 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2008 Jan 24;451(7177):425-30. doi: 10.1038/nature06553.

METHODS: Twenty-six adult AL patients (mean age 46.2 +/- 12.4 years, 15 males) treated with 2-6 cycles of chemotherapy (CT) containing anthracyclines in the total cumulative dose of 464.3 +/- 117.5 mg/m2 were studied. Cardiac evaluation was performed at baseline, after first and last CT with anthracyclines and 6 months after CT. RESULTS: Mean baseline NT-proBNP concentration was 117.7 +/- 46.4 ng/L (slightly elevated in 3 patients). After first and last CT, NT-proBNP elevations to 299.7 +/- 176.2 ng/L and 287.1 +/- 147.4 ng/L were observed, respectively. Six months after CT, mean NT-proBNP concentration was 362.5 +/- 304.9 ng/L (elevated in 16 patients). Changes in NT-proBNP were significant in comparison with the baseline values (p < 0.001). Six months after CT, two patients with marked NT-proBNP elevations during CT developed treatment-related cardiomyopathy with symptoms of heart failure. NT-proBNP correlated with systolic and diastolic LV dysfunction on echocardiography (r = 0.514; p < 0.01) and (r = 0.587; p < 0.01). CTnT concentrations were negative (bellow 0.01 microg/L) during CT in all patients. Six months after CT, delayed cTnT positivity occurred in 3 patients. CK-MB mass remained within the reference range in all patients. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that anthracycline treatment is associated with acute and chronic neurohumoral activation of cardiac dysfunction that is manifested by a significant increase in NT-proBNP. It seems that NT-proBNP could be useful in the early detection of anthracycline cardiotoxicity. CTnT negativity during anthracycline treatment suggests that anthracyclines, even in higher cumulative doses, do not cause detectable acute injury to cardiomyocyte structure. Further studies using more sensitive markers of cardiac damage will be needed in this context.","['Horacek, J M', 'Pudil, R', 'Jebavy, L', 'Tichy, M', 'Zak, P', 'Maly, J']","['Horacek JM', 'Pudil R', 'Jebavy L', 'Tichy M', 'Zak P', 'Maly J']","['2nd Department of Medicine - Clinical Hematology, University Hospital and Charles University, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. jan.hor@post.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Troponin T)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase, MB Form)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Creatine Kinase, MB Form/blood', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*blood/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Peptide Fragments/*blood', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Troponin T/blood']",2008/01/18 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2008/01/18 09:00'],"['2008/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['33/653 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2007 Dec;29(4):309-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the precise pathogenesis of MDS remains to be clarified, cytogenetic abnormalities seem to be involved in its pathogenesis and are considered as an important factor in diagnosis and predicting clinical outcome. OBJECTIVE: To explore the cytogenetic features of Chinese patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: Conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed in 88 MDS patients and among them, 34 cases were studied by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) with precisely chromosome 8 centromere specific DNA probe and DNA specific probes for 7q32 , 5q31. RESULTS: Of the 88 patients, 45 (51.1%) showed clonal karyotypic abnormalities by CC at diagnosis, including numerical changes (18 cases, 20.5%), structural changes (12 cases, 13.6%), and numerical and structural changes simultaneously(15 cases, 17.0%). Trisomy 8, -5/5q-, and -7/ 7q- account for 20.5%, 15.9%, and 5.7% respectively. Complex karyotypes were observed in 17 patients, the incidence being 19.3% in the whole series of cases. Among 34 MDS patients studied by I-FISH, -5/5q-, -7/7q- and trisomy 8 occurring in 4, 2 and 10 cases respectively for CC were confirmed by I-FISH. 5 cases in 30 cases who did not show -5/5q- by CC displayed this abnormality by I-FISH. 3 cases without -7/7q- by CC presented this aberration by I-FISH. 5 cases with trisomy 8 for I-FISH was not identified this change by CC. CONCLUSIONS: The frequent abnormalities are trisomy 8, -5/5q- and -7/ 7q-. FISH is very useful in detecting these alterations in MDS and it is an important complement to CC.","['Chen, L- J', 'Li, J- Y', 'Zhu, Y', 'Qiu, H- R', 'Pan, J- L', 'Wang, R', 'Qian, S- X', 'Xu, W', 'Xue, Y- Q']","['Chen L', 'Li J', 'Zhu Y', 'Qiu H', 'Pan J', 'Wang R', 'Qian S', 'Xu W', 'Xue Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China. lijianyonglm@medmail.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",2008/01/18 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2008/01/18 09:00'],"['2008/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['33/651 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2007 Dec;29(4):299-303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the apoptogenic activity of two inorganic selenium compounds, sodium selenite and sodium selenate, in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia MT-4 cells was compared focusing on their effects on cell cycle progression and activation of proapoptotic Bax protein. METHODS: Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution of MT-4 cells exposed to inorganic selenium compounds was assessed by flow cytometry upon propidium iodide staining. Bax expression was analyzed by flow cytometry of cells labeled with anti-Bax monoclonals. Extent of DNA damage was assessed by Comet analysis. RESULTS: Sodium selenite induced apoptosis in dose-dependent mode starting from concentrations of 10 microM, while sodium selenate was much less toxic inducing apoptotic cell death only at 300 microM. Sodium selenite but not sodium selenate caused a slight arrest in G2/M phase of cell cycle. The cytotoxicity of sodium selenite was accompanied by DNA damaging effects visualized in DNA comet assay. Nevertheless, the drastic increase in Bax flow cytometry intensity was evident only in selenite-induced apoptosis.

Rituximab activates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity/complement-dependent cytotoxicity-dependent lysis but also induces apoptosis by cross-linking of its target antigen CD20. Recent reports indicate that this apoptotic activity of rituximab can be synergized by cotreatment with Fas agonists. Here, we report on a strategy designed to exploit and optimize the synergy between rituximab and Fas signaling by genetically fusing a rituximab-derived antibody fragment to soluble Fas ligand (sFasL). The resultant fusion protein, designated scFvRit:sFasL, potently induced CD20-restricted apoptosis in a panel of malignant B-cell lines (10 of 11) and primary patient-derived malignant B cells (two of two non-Hodgkin lymphoma and five of six B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia). ScFvRit:sFasL efficiently activated CD20 and Fas apoptotic signaling, resulting in a far superior proapoptotic activity compared with cotreatment with rituximab and Fas agonists. ScFvRit:sFasL lacked activity toward normal human B cells and also lacked systemic toxicity in nude mice with no elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels or liver caspase-3 activity. In conclusion, scFvRit:sFasL efficiently activates CD20 and Fas-apoptotic signaling and may be useful for the elimination of malignant B cells.","['Bremer, Edwin', 'ten Cate, Bram', 'Samplonius, Douwe F', 'Mueller, Nicole', 'Wajant, Harald', 'Stel, Alja J', 'Chamuleau, Martine', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Stieglmaier, Julia', 'Fey, Georg H', 'Helfrich, Wijnand']","['Bremer E', 'ten Cate B', 'Samplonius DF', 'Mueller N', 'Wajant H', 'Stel AJ', 'Chamuleau M', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Stieglmaier J', 'Fey GH', 'Helfrich W']","['Groningen University Institute for Drug Exploration, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', '0 (scFvRit-sFasL protein, human)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*agonists', 'Female', '*Genetic Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/adverse effects/*genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Rituximab', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Single-Chain Antibodies', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/01/18 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2008/01/18 09:00'],"['2008/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/2/597 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5171 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jan 15;68(2):597-604. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5171.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Delayed effects are genotype dependent with CBA/Ca mice, but not C57BL/6 mice, susceptible to the induction of damage and also radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia. Because macrophages are a potential source of ongoing damaging signals, we have determined their gene expression profiles and we show that bone marrow-derived macrophages show widely different intrinsic expression patterns. The profiles classify macrophages derived from CBA/Ca mice as M1-like (pro-inflammatory) and those from C57BL/6 mice as M2-like (anti-inflammatory); measurements of NOS2 and arginase activity in normal bone marrow macrophages confirm these findings. After irradiation in vivo, but not in vitro, C57BL/6 macrophages show a reduction in NOS2 and an increase in arginase activities, indicating a further M2 response, whereas CBA/Ca macrophages retain an M1 phenotype. Activation of specific signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathways in irradiated hemopoietic tissues supports these observations. The data indicate that macrophage activation is not a direct effect of radiation but a tissue response, secondary to the initial radiation exposure, and have important implications for understanding genotype-dependent responses and the mechanisms of the hemotoxic and leukemogenic consequences of radiation exposure.","['Coates, Philip J', 'Rundle, Jana K', 'Lorimore, Sally A', 'Wright, Eric G']","['Coates PJ', 'Rundle JK', 'Lorimore SA', 'Wright EG']","['Cancer Biology and Clinical Pathology, Division of Pathology and Neurosciences, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, United Kingdom. p.j.coates@dundee.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Scavenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bystander Effect/*genetics', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/radiation effects', 'Genotype', 'Immunity/genetics', 'Macrophages/*physiology/*radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Opsonin Proteins/genetics', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Receptors, Scavenger/genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/01/18 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2008/01/18 09:00'],"['2008/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/2/450 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-3050 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jan 15;68(2):450-6. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-3050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Drosophila, dMLF has been identified as a protein homologous to hMLF1 and hMLF2, which interacts with various factors involved in transcriptional regulation. However, the precise cellular function of dMLF remains unclear. To generate further insights, we first examined the behavior of dMLF protein using an antibody specific to dMLF. Immunostaining analyses showed that dMLF localizes in the nucleus in early embryos and cultured cells. Ectopic expression of dMLF in the developing eye imaginal disc using eyeless-GAL4 driver resulted in a small-eye phenotype and co-expression of cyclin E rescued the small-eye phenotype, suggesting the involvement of dMLF in cell-cycle regulation. We therefore analyzed the molecular mechanism of interactions between dMLF and a dMLF-interacting protein, dCSN3, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome, which regulates multiple signaling and cell-cycle pathways. Biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that dMLF interacts with dCSN3 in vivo and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that the PCI domain of the dCSN3 protein is sufficient for this to occur, possibly functioning as a structural scaffold for assembly of the COP9 signalosome complex. From these data we propose the possibility that dMLF plays a negative role in assembly of the COP9 signalosome complex.","['Sugano, Wakana', 'Ohno, Katsuhito', 'Yoneda-Kato, Noriko', 'Kato, Jun-ya', 'Yamaguchi, Masamitsu']","['Sugano W', 'Ohno K', 'Yoneda-Kato N', 'Kato JY', 'Yamaguchi M']","['Department of Applied Biology, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Mlf protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (COP9 Signalosome Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COP9 Signalosome Complex', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/cytology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transfection']",2008/01/18 09:00,2008/06/18 09:00,['2008/01/18 09:00'],"['2008/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJB6229 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.06229.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2008 Feb;275(3):588-600. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.06229.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical and pathological diagnosis of a malignant vs. benign adrenocortical tumor is sometimes challenging. Telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) are critical for the persistence of the malignant phenotype, but little is known about these mechanisms or their diagnostic value in adrenocortical lesions. OBJECTIVE: Tissue samples of diagnostically known adrenocortical neoplasms were evaluated for parameters of known TMMs, telomerase activity (TA), and alternative telomere lengthening (ALT). DESIGN: The study analyzed retrospectively collected frozen adrenocortical tissue samples from the University of Michigan Health System. PATIENT SAMPLES: Samples included 24 ACCs, 11 adrenocortical adenomas (ACAs), and three normal adrenal tissues. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Telomerase activity (telomerase activity protocol assay), alternative telomere lengthening (telomere restriction fragment analysis, telomere associated promyelocyte leukemia bodies) were measured. RESULTS: A total of 22 of 24 ACCs (92%) could be definitively assigned to a TMM. The TMM classification was: 19 of 24 TA (79%), two of which displayed very long telomeres, one of 24 ALT (4%) and two of 24 (8%) TA and ALT. Results of two of 24 (8%) were inconclusive (one negative for TA and positive in one ALT assay, one negative in all assays). None of the normal adrenal tissues (none of three) or ACA (none of 11) samples had signs of an active TMM. CONCLUSIONS: TA is the main TMM in the majority of ACCs, but subsets of ACCs additionally or exclusively exhibit signs of ALT. Determination of telomere maintenance mechanisms in diagnostically challenging adrenocortical tumors might be of additional diagnostic value in the pathological diagnosis of malignant vs. benign lesions.","['Else, Tobias', 'Giordano, Thomas J', 'Hammer, Gary D']","['Else T', 'Giordano TJ', 'Hammer GD']","['Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology, and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2200, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080115,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Telomerase/metabolism', '*Telomere']",2008/01/17 09:00,2008/05/28 09:00,['2008/01/17 09:00'],"['2008/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['jc.2007-1840 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2007-1840 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2008 Apr;93(4):1442-9. doi: 10.1210/jc.2007-1840.

This study investigates M-CSF-mediated MEK/ERK activation and identifies a downstream effector of this pathway. M-CSF activates MEK/ERK and induces MEK-dependent expression of the immediate early gene Egr2. Inhibition of either MEK1/2 or inhibition of Egr2 increases osteoclast apoptosis. In contrast, wild-type Egr2 or an Egr2 point mutant unable to bind the endogenous repressors Nab1/2 (caEgr2) suppresses basal osteoclast apoptosis and rescues osteoclasts from apoptosis induced by MEK1/2 or Egr2 inhibition. Mechanistically, Egr2 induces pro-survival Blc2 family member Mcl1 while stimulating proteasome-mediated degradation of pro-apoptotic Bim. In addition, Egr2 increased the expression of c-Cbl, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes Bim ubiquitination. M-CSF, therefore, promotes osteoclast survival through MEK/ERK-dependent induction of Egr2 to control the Mcl1/Bim ratio, documenting a novel function of Egr2 in promoting survival.","['Bradley, Elizabeth W', 'Ruan, Ming M', 'Oursler, Merry J']","['Bradley EW', 'Ruan MM', 'Oursler MJ']",['Department Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080115,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Early Growth Response Protein 2)', '0 (Egr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/*biosynthesis', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects/physiology']",2008/01/17 09:00,2008/05/13 09:00,['2008/01/17 09:00'],"['2008/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)55194-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M709500200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Mar 21;283(12):8055-64. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M709500200.

Pyk2 expression has been known to be restricted to neuronal and hematopoietic cells and Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation and its kinase activity is important for the function of monocytes/macrophages. In NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, the expression of Pyk2 was increased in parallel with differentiation, and inhibited by PD98059, indicating Pyk2 expression is regulated through MAPK/ERK pathway. Dominant-negative kinase-deficient mutant of Pyk2 reduced the differentiation of NB4 cells in response to phorbol 12-mystate 13-acetate. Transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) beta was required to induce Pyk2 expression in promoter analysis. These results suggest that Pyk2 is induced and involved in monocyte differentiation and C/EBPbeta is a critical regulator of the Pyk2 expression.","['Park, Mi Hee', 'Park, Sun Young', 'Kim, YoungHee']","['Park MH', 'Park SY', 'Kim Y']","['Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Pusan 609-735, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080114,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/physiology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2008/01/17 09:00,2008/04/09 09:00,['2008/01/17 09:00'],"['2007/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(08)00013-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.febslet.2008.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2008 Feb 6;582(3):415-22. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2008.01.001.

In fact, cephalostatin 1 ( 1, ED 50 0.1-0.001 pM) proved to be one of the most powerful cancer cell growth inhibitors ever tested by the U.S. National Cancer Institute. The ritterazines and cephalostatins share many common structural features in which two highly oxygenated steroidal units with side chains forming either 5/5 or 5/6 spiroketals are fused via a pyrazine core. Professor P. L. Fuchs and colleagues reported the total syntheses of 1, cephalostatins 7 ( 7), and 12 ( 12), ritterazines K ( 30) and M ( 32), and cytotoxic analogues.

METHODS: We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) based on age- and gender-specific cancer mortality rates for 245 geographic areas, using the registered death data from 2000 to 2004 that were obtained from the Korea National Statistical Office. Using the data from the Agriculture Census in 1995, we obtained the farming index. Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations between cancer mortality and farming after adjustment for socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: The SMR analyses based on 62,403 annual average cancer deaths yielded regional variations for all cancers combined in men (SMR = 70-192) and women (SMR = 80-132). With increasing farming index we found significantly elevated cancer mortality of esophagus, stomach, brain, and leukemia for men, and of esophagus and stomach for women, whereas the SMR for colorectal and gall bladder cancers were inversely associated with farming. The results were similar when the analyses were repeated after the exclusion of metropolitan areas. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a possible association between farming and mortality from a few cancer sites in South Korea.","['Lee, Won Jin', 'Son, Mia', 'Chun, Byung Chul', 'Park, Eun Sook', 'Lee, Ha Kyung', 'Coble, Joseph', 'Dosemeci, Mustafa']","['Lee WJ', 'Son M', 'Chun BC', 'Park ES', 'Lee HK', 'Coble J', 'Dosemeci M']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, 136-705, Korea. leewj@korea.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080116,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"[""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*mortality"", 'Humans', 'Korea/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2008/01/17 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/01/17 09:00'],"['2007/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/01/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10552-008-9112-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2008 Jun;19(5):505-13. doi: 10.1007/s10552-008-9112-2.
