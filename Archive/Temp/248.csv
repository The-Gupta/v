A series of total therapy studies begun in 1962 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee has had a dramatic impact on the survival of children with this disease. These studies have systematically examined various drug combinations and radiation therapy in an effort to cure acute lymphocytic leukemia. As a result, a once uniformly fatal condition is now curable in nearly one half of cases. In addition to improved control of the primary disease, refinements in drug treatment and in supportive care have diminished the frequency of severe infections, which may complicate aggressive therapy. Although the quality of life for the survivors so far appears generally good, treatment-induced toxic effects may impose subtle, though significant, handicaps in some cases. A combination of clinical and laboratory investigations begun in the mid-1970s is beginning to demonstrate a previously unknown heterogeneity among patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. It is now possible to recognize a substantial minority of patients on the basis of these studies as being at ""high risk"" for treatment failure. For them, drastic modifications of present programs are being investigated in an attempt to improve their prognosis.

TCGF has been recently purified. It is a small protein released by a subset of mature T cells following lectin-antigen activation, which in turn acts upon other T-cell subsets that have developed specific receptors for TCGF after lectin-antigen stimulation. Thus, release of TCGF and development of receptors for it appear to be obligatory for the clonal expansion of all activated T cells. Unlike normal T cells, neoplastic T cells respond directly to TCGF, requiring no prior in vitro lectin-antigen activation. This has led to the development of several new cell lines from patients with T-cell leukemias and lymphomas. In some cases, these cells become independent of exogenous TCGF by producing their own growth factor, implying a role for TCGF in the continuous proliferation of these cells. These developments necessitate a reevaluation of some concepts of immunoregulation of T-cell activities in terms of production and response to TCGF. In addition, this information has clinical implications. Recent results have shown that a major defect of the athymic nude mouse is the inability to produce TCGF and that some immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticosteroids and cyclosporin-A, exert their effects on T cells by disrupting the TCGF-T-cell interaction. Some human immune deficiencies might be due to a failure to respond to or to produce TCGF, which in some cases might be corrected by exogenous TCGF.","['Ruscetti, F W', 'Gallo, R C']","['Ruscetti FW', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', 'Lymphokines/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Receptors, Mitogen', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69662-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Mar;57(3):379-94.,67,,,

Purification and characterization in normal and leukemic cells.,245-57,"Tubulin has been purified from human blood and tonsil lymphocytes. Using gel filtration, the molecular weight of human lymphocyte tubulin was estimated to be 119000. The protein was shown to consist of two subunits, with molecular weights of 61000 and 58000 comparable to the alpha and beta polypeptides of human brain tubulin. A partial identity reaction was observed between lymphocyte tubulin and human tubulin when tested by double immunodiffusion against a rabbit anti-human brain tubulin antibody. In the presence of GTP, the purified protein polymerized to form microtubules. Tubulin was localized to the cell's juxtacentriolar region by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. When assayed by a colchicine-binding assay corrected for time decay, the binding affinity was 1.50 +/- 0.86 . 10(6) M-1 and a level in normal lymphocytes of 1.21 . 10(2) +/- 0.79 g/g of soluble protein was determined. Since chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes have an anomalous capping behavior as well as an unusual susceptibility to colchicine toxicity, the properties and levels of tubulin were determined in these cells. Similar values were obtained for the level, decay rate, molecular weight, and Ka for colchicine as for normal lymphocytes. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes tubulin polymerized in a normal fashion. It thus appears that a decrease in the quantity for function of tubulin does not account for these anomalies in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocyte.","['Liebes, L F', 'Fleit, H', 'Zucker-Franklin, D', 'Silber, R']","['Liebes LF', 'Fleit H', 'Zucker-Franklin D', 'Silber R']",['eng'],['AM12274/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Polymers)', '0 (Tubulin)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Colchicine/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoelectrophoresis, Two-Dimensional', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polymers/metabolism', 'Tubulin/analysis/*isolation & purification']",1980/12/01 00:00,1980/12/01 00:01,['1980/12/01 00:00'],"['1980/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-4165(80)90410-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(80)90410-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1980 Dec 1;633(2):245-57. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(80)90410-9.,,,,

The overall results suggested that maintenance therapy was beneficial, though the results were not statistically significant. Most of the difference was found among the few patients with unfavourable prognostic features who survived one year and were eligible for this randomization. In this, as in the two previous MRC trials, no striking differences have emerged between the therapeutic effects of different schedules of melphalan and/or CY.

Classification of the leukemia was based on cytochemical stains. The blasts were negative when stained with Sudan black B and did not have specific esterase activity. They were rich in alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase, which was inhibited by fluoride. Functional assays included phagocytosis of Candida albicans, fungicidal activity measured by differential Giemsa staining of the ingested C. albicans, and locomotion using the agarose method to evaluate both random migration and chemotaxis. At a ratio of 20 yeast cells to one monoblast, 80% of the blasts could be stimulated to phagocytize an average of 4.4 organisms. These results compared favorably with the phagocytic potential of normal human monocytes. Candidacidal activity was present, but reduced. At high ratios of yeasts to monoblasts, only ten organisms were killed for every 100 phagocytic blasts. This correlates with the absence of myeloperoxidase activity demonstrated by negative Sudan black B staining. Neither chemotaxis nor random migration could be demonstrated, indicating that monoblasts lacked the apparatus necessary for locomotion. Extrapolation of these findings to normal monocyte maturation suggests that phagocytosis is acquired prior to microbicidal activity, which develops prior to locomotion.","['Glasser, L']",['Glasser L'],['eng'],['CA 17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adult', 'Candida albicans', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/75.1.122 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1981 Jan;75(1):122-5. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/75.1.122.,,,,

Transmission by contact with hospital personnel is the usual mode of exogenous acquisition of hospital bacteria, and handwashing is the most effective means of prevention. The utility of conventional protective isolation in prevention of exogenous transmission is in question. Inattention to infection control measures by nurses and physicians may result in higher infection rates and more serious types of infections. Endogenous infection by the patient's own bacteria and fungi also occurs in the cancer ward. Autoinfection is ""amplified"" by the use of cannulae, catheters, and other hospital devices. Meticulous nursing care, particularly in neutropenic persons, is important in reducing the incidence of endogenous spread of microbes. Exogenous and endogenous infections in neutropenic patients are reduced using laminar air flow rooms combined with prophylactic antibiotics.

Twenty-seven infections occurred in recipients of standard care (4.42 per 100 days), and 28 infections in isolated patients (6.41 per 100 days). Except for a threefold higher rate of bacteremia in patients in isolation (2.06 vs. 0.65 per 100 days), the profile of infection was similar in the two groups.

Similarly, leukemia lymphocytes were lysed by a highly specific rabbit anti-Ib tumor-associated surface antigen (TASA) in the presence of complement. The density and distribution of TASA on malignant lymphocytes were analyzed by immuno-electron microscopy with the use of a bridging technique in conjunction with antiserum against Ib TASA. The following observations were reported after the examination of more than 100 randomly selected Ib lymphocytes: a) The density of the TASA was low, b) the distribution of the TASA was random, and c) no evidence indicated cell cycle-dependent expression of the TASA.","['Morris, R E', 'Bentley, D M', 'Ciraolo, G M']","['Morris RE', 'Bentley DM', 'Ciraolo GM']",['eng'],['AI14173/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Spleen/pathology/ultrastructure']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Jan;66(1):111-9.,,,,

Clowes Memorial lecture.,361-75,"The major focus of cancer immunology has shifted away from arguments about the validity of the immunosurveillance theory of cancer to the more basic question of tumor-specific antigens. Despite vast effort aimed at demonstrating such antigens, their existence in the generality of cancer remains unproven. Serological analysis of three tumor types, mouse leukemia, mouse sarcoma, and human malignant melanoma, has received most attention, and a rudimentary classification of the surface antigens expressed by these tumors has begun to emerge. The prime candidates for antigens that can be considered tumor specific are the few instances of Class 1 antigens that have now been serologically defined on mouse and human tumors. These antigens show an absolute restriction to individual tumors, not being demonstrable on any other normal or malignant cell type. Biochemical and genetic characterization of Class 1 antigens represents an essential next step in evaluating the significance of these antigens. The surprising features of the Thymus Leukemia (TL) antigens of the mouse provide insight into the genetic origin of another key class of tumor antigens, in this case antigens with characteristic properties of both differentiation antigens and tumor-specific antigens. In normal mice, TL antigens are restricted to cells in the thymus, and strains differ with regard to expression versus nonexpression of TL antigens. Genetic information for TL is universal in the mouse, however, as leukemias developing in mice that normally lack TL are found to express TL. What is clear from the past two decades of research in cancer immunology is that a far more detailed knowledge of surface antigens of tumor cells will be necessary before we can begin to assess the possibility of immunological control of cancer.","['Old, L J']",['Old LJ'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Melanoma/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology', 'Tissue Distribution']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Feb;41(2):361-75.,102,,,

In transplanted tumors both drugs have shown marked schedule dependency and human studies also support this. As a single agent VP 16-213 is among the most active drugs in small-cell carcinoma of the lung. Significant clinical activity (> 20% response frequency) has been observed for both drugs in Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin lymphomas and possibly in other more rare tumors (monocytic leukemia, hepatoma and teratoma). Although further clinical studies of both drugs would be ideal, it seems possible at present to justify a discontinuation of VM-26 in order to concentrate the efforts on VP 16-213.

There is a good correlation between the tumour-promoting activity of these plant diterpenes and their inhibitory effect on cell differentiation systems. Such findings reinforce the 'aberrant differentiation' theory of carcinogenesis and support Berenblum's (1954b) speculation that tumour promoters may act by interfering with the maturation of initiated cells. FLC are one of the best-defined differentiation systems; and in these, one can see the reversible inhibition of spontaneous and induced differentiation by tumour promoters. Furthermore, clones of FLC have been isolated that are completely resistant to tumour promoter-mediated inhibition of differentiation yet retain the capacity to differentiate normally in response to various inducers. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism by which tumour promoters inhibit cell differentiation and to obtain a possible clue as to the mechanism of tumour promotion, these variant clones were characterized and compared with tumour promoter-sensitive clonal FLC. The possible relevance of these finding to mouse skin two-stage carcinogenesis is discussed, and is proposed that initiation may be caused by mutagenic actions of carcinogens, whereas unbalanced differentiation triggered by phorbol esters may play a crucial role in the promotion step.","['Yamasaki, H']",['Yamasaki H'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 1980;(27):91-111.,60,,,

Venocclusive disease was life-threatening or lethal in 13. Typical symptoms developed 1-3 wk post-transplant and consisted of sudden weight gain, hepatic enlargement, ascites, high bilirubin, and encephalopathy. Statistical analyses showed a significantly higher prevalence of venocclusive disease associated with transplantation for leukemia (P = 0.014), pretransplant conditioning with more rigorous chemoradiotherapy regimens (P < 0.001) and three- to fourfold increase of venocclusive disease in patients whose conditioning included dimethyl busulfan (P < 0.005).

This regulator is now known to act at other levels of hemopoietic regulation. The heterogeneity of GM-CSFs is not only related to the tissue of origin and the in vitro production method, but also to functional subclasses of the molecule that have distinct biologic specificities. Most adult mouse organs produce GM-CSF (mol wt 23,000), but a macrophage (M)-CSF has been detected in fetal conditioned medium (CM) and isolated from L-cell CM. Murine endotoxin serum appears to contain a M-CSF, GM-CSF, and G-CSF, the last of which cofractionates with a differentiation factor active on leukemic cells. Human GM-CSFs, G-CSF, and EO-CSFs active on human cells have been detected in a variety of CM, but as yet none have been purified. Again, there are subclasses of progenitor cells that respond to particular forms of human active CSFs. GM-CSF isolated from mouse lung CM stimulates multipotential progenitor cells, the initial proliferatin of progenitors in the erythroid, eosinophil, and megakaryocyte series, as well as mature cells in the GM series. While GM-CSF is also able to stimulate the differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells, other factors appear to be more potent in this respect. Information on the regulation of GM-CSF production, on the modulators of its action on specific target cells, and on its role in vivo will be required before the physiologic function of this molecule can be properly assessed.","['Burgess, A W', 'Metcalf, D']","['Burgess AW', 'Metcalf D']",['eng'],"['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media', '*Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', '*Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice']",1980/12/01 00:00,1980/12/01 00:01,['1980/12/01 00:00'],"['1980/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81785-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1980 Dec;56(6):947-58.,158,,,

The kinetics of crosslinking were linear with respect to concentration and second-order with respect to light exposure time. The latter finding supports the proposed two photon mechanism for the formation of diadducts. In contrast to DNA crosslinking agents such as nitrogen mustard, nitrosoureas and platinums, trimethylpsoralen crosslinks were resistant to proteolytic digestion. Thus, trimethylpsoralen plus 365 nm light produced interstrand crosslinks, as proposed for a bifunctional agent binding to bases on opposite DNA strands.","['Cohen, L F', 'Ewig, R A', 'Kohn, K W', 'Glaubiger, D']","['Cohen LF', 'Ewig RA', 'Kohn KW', 'Glaubiger D']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Furocoumarins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'Y6UY8OV51T (Trioxsalen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', '*Furocoumarins', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/*analysis', 'Mice', 'Peptide Hydrolases', '*Trioxsalen', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",1980/11/14 00:00,1980/11/14 00:01,['1980/11/14 00:00'],"['1980/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2787(80)90055-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2787(80)90055-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1980 Nov 14;610(1):56-63. doi: 10.1016/0005-2787(80)90055-6.,,,,

The remaining 13 patients had TdT positive cells accounting for 7-90% of the total. In two of these cases TdT was expressed on blasts with myeloid features, representing an aberrant expression of TdT by myeloid cells; in contrast, in three cases mixed populations of TdT positive lymphoid blasts and TdT negative myeloid blasts were observed. In the remaining cases it was not possible to determine whether the TdT positive cells had definite lymphoid or myeloid features. Cytogenetic analysis showed no evidence of the Philadelphia chromosome. Response to treatment was assessed in 11 of the 13 patients.

In addition, non-leukaemic marrows were analysed to compare the enzyme expression on normal cells. An excellent correlation was observed between the IF and biochemical methods when specimens contained greater than 5% TdT+ cells (by IF); below this level the biochemical assay was less reliable, while the sensitive IF test could detect isolated TdT+ cells among greater than 10 000 TdT negative cells. The IF method also had the advantage of allowing further immunological characterization of TdT+ cells, by simultaneous labelling of membrane antigens with appropriate antisera. TdT+ cells expressing Ia-like antigens (but lacking other antigens associated with B- and T- lymphoid differentiation) were frequently found in low numbers in remission marrows from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients. However, similar cells were also observed in remission acute myeloid leukaemia, as well as in non-leukaemic regenerating marrows, and marrow from normal donors. The presence of these normal TdT+ precursor cells therefore precluded the use of either IF or biochemical TdT tests for estimating the degree of residual disease or predicting early relapse in patients with non-T, non-B ALL. In contrast, the detection of TdT+ cells with T lymphoid antigens (HuTLA+) but lacking Ia antigens, in thymic (T-cell)-ALL, but not in normal marrow, allowed the use of this combination of markers to detect minimal residual disease in T-ALL.","['Bradstock, K F', 'Janossy, G', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Ganeshaguru, K', 'Llewellin, P', 'Prentice, H G', 'Bollum, F J']","['Bradstock KF', 'Janossy G', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Ganeshaguru K', 'Llewellin P', 'Prentice HG', 'Bollum FJ']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*analysis/immunology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology', 'Male', 'Phenotype']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb02766.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1981 Jan;47(1):121-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb02766.x.,,,,

To determine the significance of peripheral blood involvement in each type of NHL, patients were subdivided according to a modified Rappaport classification.

Of particular note was the recognition of two distinctive cytologic and clinical subtypes within the category of nodular lymphoma, poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (NPDL). In one subtype, the predominant cells had cytologic features akin to those of lymphoblasts. In these cases, although the interval to peripheral blood involvement was variable, the median leukemic survival was only two months. In contrast in conventional NPDL the median leukemic survival was 43+ months, and peripheral blood involvement did not appear to exert an independent effect on prognosis. In diffuse large cell lymphomas the median leukemic survival was 0.5 months, with peripheral blood involvement appearing as a terminal event associated with unresponsive disease in multiple sites.

Ferritin was strikingly increased in all acute leukemias at presentation and in relapse, in the blastic crisis of CML, and in smouldering leukemia. Remission in both ALL and ANLL was associated with a reduction of serum ferritin, and this normalization was a function of remission duration. In the malignant lymphomas serum ferritin was related to tumor histology. Highest levels were found in Hodgkin disease and histiocytic lymphoma, normal levels in lymphocytic lymphoma, and intermediate levels in mixed histiocytic-lymphocytic lymphoma. In all cases, remission was associated with normalization of serum ferritin.

A review.,335-51,"Malignant diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphoid systems have been the subject of vigorous study in recent years. New methodologies, along with conventional techniques for identifying cell markers, now enable us to identify malignant cells with much greater specificity than in the past. Cell marker analysis has begun not only to extend our understanding of normal cell differentiation in the lymphoid and hematopoietic systems, but also to furnish more practical guidelines for approaching malignant disease, including more objective and reproducible classification, more accurate diagnosis and prognosis, more appropriate and more effective choice of treatment. Neoplasms of the T-cell series, which are the subject of this presentation, have in the past received less attention than the B-cell malignancies. More recent literature, however, shows increasing use of modern techniques in the analysis of T-cell malignancies, along with a corresponding increase in clinical resourcefulness. Different phenotypes of malignant cells have been correlated with the heterogeneous clinical and pathological features of T-cell neoplasms, suggesting a basis for their inconsistent responsiveness to treatment. As we develop a uniform system of classification and a generally accepted terminology for these heterogeneous and frequently puzzling disorders, we hope to gain further insight into pathogenetic mechanisms of the T-cell neoplasms, and to refine therapeutic measures for diseases which have defeated conventional therapy in the past.","['Safai, B', 'Good, R A']","['Safai B', 'Good RA']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/pathology', 'Sezary Syndrome/pathology', 'Skin/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005792-198009000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1980 Sep;59(5):335-51. doi: 10.1097/00005792-198009000-00002.,207,,,

The suppression is abrogated by pretreatment of the leukemic cells with DNase. Cells with surface DNA can be enriched by treatment with anti-DNA antibodies and removed on anti-Ig columns. Even though there is a 10-fold enrichment in suppression by the surface DNA-positive cells (DNA+), the depleted population (DNA-) still suppresses with an efficiency comparable to the unfractionated spleen cells. Pretreatment with anti-I-J antiserum and separation on columns neither enriches nor depletes suppressor cells. Fractionating leukemic spleen into 4 populations of cells by sequential treatment with anti-DNA and anti-I-J with separation on appropriate columns, resulting in 4 populations (DNA+/I-J-, DNA+/I-J+, DNA-/I-J+, and DNA-/K-J-), revealed that the DNA+/I-J- cells that comprise ca. 15% of the total are the most potent suppressors. The DNA+/I-J+ cells that comprise ca. 2% of the cells are less efficient and their suppression is not sensitive to DNase. The DNA-/I-J+ population (ca. 10% of the total) are also poor suppressors. The remaining cells, which are DNA-/I-J-, do not act as suppressors. When small numbers of any 2 of the 4 fractions were added together, it was found that the DNA+/I-J- cell can interact with the DNA+/I-J+ and the DNA-/I-J+ cells but not the DNA-/I-J- cells to give enhanced suppression.","['Russell, J L', 'Golub, E S']","['Russell JL', 'Golub ES']",['eng'],['AI 08800/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Surface', 'DNA/*immunology', 'Deoxyribonucleases/pharmacology', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Rabbits']",1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1980 Nov;125(5):2328-33.,,,,

In contrast, when 14 samples from other types of B lymphoproliferative disorder (including hairy cell leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and prolymphocytic leukaemia) were studied, all samples showed membrane immunoglobulin labelling (confirmed by capping experiments). This discrepancy was attributed to the greater density of surface immunoglobulin present on neoplastic cells in the latter group of disorders compared to CLL. This immunoperoxidase technique is therefore less sensitive than immunofluorescent staining of cells in suspension for the demonstration of neoplastic cell surface immunoglobulin.

FI-C3b labeled 17.6% +/- 6.0% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) from 20 normal subjects, which, when separated by the FACS, consisted of B lymphocytes and approximately 5% monocytes. Analyses in which either monocytes or B lymphcoytes were excluded from consideration demonstrated that both these cell types were labeled by the FI-C3b with a heterogeneous distribution of fluorescence intensity, indicating either heterogeneity of CR density or variable avidity of individual CR for the FI-C3b. FACS profiles of PBM ( < 5% monocytes) from 14 of 15 patients with CLL showed a homogeneous distribution of very low fluorescence intensity, with > 60% of the cells being slightly more fluorescent than unlabeled controls. This low, homogeneous distribution of fluorescence is strikingly similar to profiles of CLL cells labeled with anti-Ig reagents and suggests homogeneity of low CR density and/or avidity. Similarly, CR+ mononuclear cells from five patients with HCL and three patients with LCL displayed more homogeneous FI-C3b labeling than normal CR+ PBM. Homogeneity of FI-C3b binding to CLL, LCL, and HCL cells further supports the concept for a clonal origin for these disorders.","['Slease, R B', 'Gadek, J E', 'Frank, M M', 'Scher, I']","['Slease RB', 'Gadek JE', 'Frank MM', 'Scher I']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '80295-43-8 (Complement C3b)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/immunology', 'Complement C3b', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', '*Receptors, Complement', 'Spleen/immunology']",1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84603-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1980 Nov;56(5):792-7.,,,,

A correlation was found between the percentage of cells in S and the morphological classification of the French American British Cooperative Group (FAB), presence of T or B cell markers, haemoglobin concentration, blast size, bone pain, platelet count, and an inverse correlation with coarse granule and block staining with Periodic-acid-Schiff (PAS).63 of the 65 children attained complete remission.

Each feature was correlated individually and then the simultaneous effect of all the features was assessed by stepwise multiple regression.Only 3 features of the disease at diagnosis were individually correlated with duration of remission. These were% cells in S (P < 0.001), log white cell blood count (WBC) (P < 0.01) and the presence of T- or B-cell surface markers (P < 0.05).

Reports of granulocytic leukemia in lymphoma are reviewed in the context of the above findings and the hypothesis that a leukemogenic factor affects a multipotential stem cell.","['Herrmann, R', 'Han, T', 'Barcos, M P', 'Lok, M S', 'Henderson, E S']","['Herrmann R', 'Han T', 'Barcos MP', 'Lok MS', 'Henderson ES']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/immunology/*secondary', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/immunology/*secondary', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Male', 'Rosette Formation']",1980/09/15 00:00,1980/09/15 00:01,['1980/09/15 00:00'],"['1980/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19800915)46:6<1383::aid-cncr2820460616>3.0.co;2-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1980 Sep 15;46(6):1383-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19800915)46:6<1383::aid-cncr2820460616>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,

GpP80gag is a glycosylated precursor of a larger gag glycoprotein exported to the cell surface, whereas Pr65gag is an unglycosylated precursor of the virion internal structural proteins. GpP80gag contains not only carbohydrate, but also additional polypeptide sequences not found in Pr65gag. In the experiment reported here, we localized the differences between GpP80gag and Pr65gag with respect to the domains of the individual gag proteins. This was done by comparison of partial proteolytic cleavage fragments from Pr65gag, from GpP80gag, and from the unglycosylated form of GpP80gag (P75gag) which had been immunoprecipitated by antisera specific for gag proteins p30, p15, and p10. We conclude that the additional polypeptide sequences in GpP80gag are located at or very near the amino terminus of the polyprotein. The carbohydrate in GpP80gag is attached to polypeptide sequences held in common between GpP80gag and Pr65gag.","['Edwards, S A', 'Fan, H']","['Edwards SA', 'Fan H']",['eng'],"['5T01-CA-15274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,"['Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Mannose/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Protein Precursors/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.35.1.41-51.1980 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1980 Jul;35(1):41-51. doi: 10.1128/JVI.35.1.41-51.1980.,,PMC288781,,

The pathogen count in each case was correlated with the gingival index, the plaque index, the amount of fluid in the gingival sulcus, and the pocket depth. Patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia with gingiva clinically free of inflammation showed one to 20 times more bacterial flora in fluid from the gingival sulcus than fluid from healthy control subjects. The quantitative values tend to equalize only if imflammation is severe. If the pathogen count is considered a function of the amount of plaque or pocket depth, markedly more microorganisms/mm3 of sulcus fluid were found with CLL patients than in the control group. It therefore may be concluded that immunologic reactions contribute decisively to the causation and maintenance of gingivitis with all of its consequences and that these reactions play an important role in the destruction of pathogens found in the region of the gingival pocket.","['Krekeler, G', 'Klaiber, B', 'Frick, K']","['Krekeler G', 'Klaiber B', 'Frick K']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Dtsch Zahnarztl Z,Deutsche zahnarztliche Zeitschrift,2984745R,,IM,"['Aged', 'Dental Plaque/immunology', 'Gingival Crevicular Fluid/*microbiology', 'Gingival Pocket/pathology', 'Gingivitis/immunology/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/etiology/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Middle Aged']",1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dtsch Zahnarztl Z. 1980 Feb;35(2):323-6.,,,Quantitative mikrobiologische Untersuchungen der gingivalen Sulcusflussigkeit von Patienten mit Immundefekten.,

An application of this principle to clinical bone marrow transplantation was successfully tried in three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Preparation of the specific anti-human T-cell globulin (ATCG-H) was carried out by absorption of anti-human thymocyte globulin with liver-kidney homogenate, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells of B-cell type, and erythrocytes. Subsequent testing revealed that the serum still reacted with human T-cells but no longer reduced the number of colony-forming units in culture (CFU-C). All three bone marrow recipients were treated by chemotherapeutic conditioning and total body irradiation followed by grafting of in vitro treated bone marrow from HLA-identical siblings. The transplantation of the bone marrow was well tolerated and no major side effects were encountered. No patient so far (24, 7, 6 months) has shown any signs of GvHD.

The actual site of biosynthesis in man has not yet been defined. The finding that bone marrow derived cells release apo-transcobalamin II in the mouse led us to examine the genetic patterns of transcobalamin II in man, both before and after marrow transplantation. A gradual but incomplete transformation of the recipient's transcobalamin II type into donor's type, corresponding to 75% or less of the total activity, was registered in 4 cases. Surprisingly, persistent host-type TC II, in spite of different donor type, was observed in 4 further marrow recipients.

Additional antisera (such as anti-ALL, anti-HuTLA, anti-immunoglobulin reagents, etc.) confirmed the diagnosis and further characterized the leukemic blasts. Ia+,TdT+ cells could be observed in low numbers in normal and nonleukemic regenerating marrow and were probably normal precursor cells; this reagent combinations was, therefore, not useful for monitoring residual non-T, non-B ALL blasts in treated patients.

The KG-1 cell line is composed predominantly of myeloblasts and promyelocytes. A unique characteristic of the KG-1 cells is their almost complete dependence on colony-stimulating factor for proliferation in soft-gel culture. The HL-60 is a promyelocytic leukemia cell line. In the presence of DMSO, the cells mature into granulocytes. Both the KG-1 and HL-60 cells differentiate into nondividing mononuclear phagocytes when exposed to phorbol esters.

Though much has been learned of cellular events affecting expression of the globin genes, e.g., from noninducible variants of MEL cells and cell fusion between MEL cells and other cell types, there is at present no in vitro system available that would permit more detailed study of the molecular events leading to transcription of the globin genes. Presumably, with the availability of cloned chromosomal genes such systems will soon be found. The products of transcription detected in induced MEL cells are 15 S and 11 S species which are precursor forms of beta- and alpha-globin mRNA, respectively. An unmodified primary transcript has not been detected. The 15 S species possesses a fully methylated 'cap' 1 structure the 5' end and poly(A) at the 3' end. Conceivably, there could be cleaving or splicing events preceding the 'capping' and polyadenylation, but all these reactions must occur extremely rapidly, since with a t 1/2 approx. 2 min a large proportion of the 15 S beta-globin RNA must be newly synthesised. It also contains the two intervening sequences found in the chromosomal genes. Selective processing occurs since from pulse and pulse-chase experiments most if not all of the 15 S beta-globin RNA is processed to mature 10 S beta-globin RNA very rapidly, whereas less than 10% of newly synthesised nuclear RNA (HnRNA) leaves the nucleus, the remainder being hydrolysed in the nucleus with a t 1/2 approx. 20 min. Perhaps rapid processing permits efficient transport to the cytoplasm. Further processing occurs in steps; apparently the large intervening sequence is removed first followed by the small intervening sequence. These steps do not appear to be rate limiting events and these sequences have not been detected separately from the 15 S beta-globin RNA. Such results and the wide divergency of intervening sequences, suggest that the intervening sequences per se play no essential function in the cell, though their presence in the nuclear transcript appears to necessary for processing to the mRNA. The selective processing accounts for more increase of the globin RNA in MEL cells, and further accumulation occurs by virtue of the stability of globin mRNA (t 1/2 approx. 17 h) compared with the bulk of poly(A)-RNA (t 1/2 approx. 3 h). It would appear, however, that specific destabilization of a class of stable mRNA (t 1/2 approx. 35 h) is necessary to allow globin mRNA to asccount for 90% of the mRNA population in reticulocytes.","['Curtis, P J']",['Curtis PJ'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Genetic Code', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1980/09/22 00:00,1980/09/22 00:01,['1980/09/22 00:00'],"['1980/09/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/22 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-419X(80)90016-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-419x(80)90016-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1980 Sep 22;605(3):347-64. doi: 10.1016/0304-419x(80)90016-5.,152,,,

In the acute leukaemias there has been a major attempt to improve diagnostic accuracy and to classify the tumours functionally, while the clinical approach is currently comparing bone marrow transplantation during the first complete remission with early or late cytotoxic intensification programmes. As regards cell support, allogeneic granulocytes and platelets are being provided for patients in both the leukaemia and the transplantation programmes. In addition, new techniques are being developed for increasing the efficiency of cell collection and characterizing their in vitro function.

This fact also distinguishes the murine factor from the avian tumour viruses and is stable to column purification methods (von der Helm, 1977; Dittmar & Moelling, 1978). We further observed that: (i) the murine proteolytic factor had an estimated mol. wt. of 20,000 to 22,000, relative to MuLV p12, which eluted as a dimer on Sephadex G-75 columns in the presence of 0.1% NP-40; and (ii) in vitro cleavage of an iodinated Pr65gag-rich, p30-deficient substrate yielded a clear increase in both p30 and p12, which suggests that the in vitro cleavage of Pr65gag is similar to its processing in vivo.","['Yoshinaka, Y', 'Luftig, R B']","['Yoshinaka Y', 'Luftig RB']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/analysis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Rauscher Virus/*enzymology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virion/enzymology']",1980/06/01 00:00,1980/06/01 00:01,['1980/06/01 00:00'],"['1980/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-48-2-329 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1980 Jun;48(Pt 2):329-40. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-48-2-329.,,,,

The study group was heterogeneous with respect to specific histology and prior therapy. Complete regression of testicular infiltrates was confirmed by repeated biopsy examinations of 32 of 33 patients undergoing the procedure. The single treatment failure occurred in a boy with acute myelogenous leukemia. In all other patients, local disease control following radiotherapy persisted throuthout the remainder of the clinical course. Three of 5 children, however, showed evidence of reseeding of the testicle as a part of the relapse process at post-mortem examination. Statistical analysis of data from the 35 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia showed the subsequent course of the disease with respect to next relapse, involving either bone marrow (BM) or the central nervous system (CNS), to be dependent on the acute leukemia prognostic group, as determined by age and peripheral white blood cell count (WBC) at the time of diagnosis, and timing of extramedullary disease (EMD). Patients with poor prognosis at the time of diagnosis and EMD afterward had a 3.8 times greater risk of a subsequent BM or CNS relapse than did patients with good or average prognosis and no EMD at any time (P = 0.07). Of the candidate prognostic factors examined with repect to survival, only the number of prior BM relapses was of statistical significance (P = 0.044). Children with two or more prior BM relapses had the worst prognosis for survival from testicular relapse, with a death risk of 3.6 times greater per unit of time than that of children with no or one prior BM relapse. Protective BM and CNS rescue therapy was recommended for those otherwise in complete remission (CR) at the time of testicular relapse. The median times to next relapse for patients receiving both BM and CNS recue therapy and for patients given CNS recue only were 42+ and seven weeks, respectively ( P = 0.09).

This study of comprehensive cancer treatment and research facility indicates that the prevailing theory is limited to explanation at the intra-psychic level. In her work with hundreds of terminal cases, Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross found that patients typically progress through five stages: 1) denial, 2) anger, 3) bargaining, 4) depression, and 5) acceptance. She concludes that the majority of her patients die in a stage of acceptance--a state of equanimity. Recently, scholars have claimed that this five stage scheme has limited applicability and may in fact contribute to the formalization of a dying person's behavior. This preliminary report proposes that the stage theory, if it has any descriptive validity, becomes meaningful only when used to describe behaviors occurring among patients, families, and medical practitioners. A plausible explanation of these behaviors is accomplished by examination of communication patterns containing the structure of paradox or double bind. Patients are forced to perceive realities about their physical conditions not as they appear to them, but as they are defined by those in their environment. This paper explores these communication patterns in relation to the structure of social relationships and the specific contents of messages being transmitted and received.","['Longhofer, J']",['Longhofer J'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cult Med Psychiatry,"Culture, medicine and psychiatry",7707467,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*psychology', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Attitude to Death', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Communication', '*Double Bind Interaction', 'Family', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Leukemia/*psychology', '*Psychological Theory', 'Terminal Care/*psychology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1980/06/01 00:00,1980/06/01 00:01,['1980/06/01 00:00'],"['1980/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00051430 [doi]'],ppublish,Cult Med Psychiatry. 1980 Jun;4(2):119-36. doi: 10.1007/BF00051430.,,,,

S. marcescens was isolated from 19% of patients with haematological neoplasms, from 5% of patients with lymphoma, and from 6% of those with solid tumours. Among carriers, rectal cultures were the commonest source in patients with lymphoma (32%); rectal and gingival cultures in patients with leukaemia (43% and 39%, respectively), and gingival cultures in patients with solid tumours (30%). Bacteraemias (.07%) were infrequent sources. Although seldom isolated from environmental or food samples, S. marcescens may occasionally be abundant in fresh fruit and vegetables. Serotyping of 220 strains of S. marcescens demonstrated 38 distinct antigenic types. The predominant serotype, O14:H12, was present in the upper respiratory tract of half of the persons who carried this serotype.

HL-60 cells contain approximately 20,000 Fc receptors per cell and bind human IgG1, IgG3 and mouse IgG2a with high affinity (dissociation constant of 5 to 10 nM). Kinetic studies of the binding of IgG1 to HL-60 cells demonstrate rapid exchange with ambient immunoglobulin with approximately one-half of the surface-bound IgG1 exchanging every 25 to 30 min at 37 degrees C. Estimation of the equilibrium binding constant from the rates of association and dissociation of IgG1 agrees well with the values obtained from Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding of radioiodinated IgG1. Approximately one-half of the Fc receptors of HL-60 cells are capable of binding IgG1 complexed to Protein A. This result was independent of the concentration of Protein A (0.5 to 200 microM) or the time of incubation of IgG1 with Protein A. Studies in which Protein A was incubated with HL-60 cells at 37 degrees C then rapidly washed at 0 degrees C indicated that Protein A did not degrade Fc receptors or interact with the Fc receptor sites on HL-60 cells. The complexes formed between Protein A and IgG1 sedimented at 7 to 9S by ultracentrifugation. These results suggest that there are two types of Fc receptors on HL-60 cells, which can be distinguished by their ability to bind the IgG1-Protein A complex.","['Crabtree, G R']",['Crabtree GR'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', '*Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Mice', '*Receptors, Fc', 'Staphylococcal Protein A/*immunology', 'Trypsin/pharmacology']",1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1980 Jul;125(1):448-53.,,,,

The C3b receptors of human erythrocytes and granulocytes were also blocked by the anti-C3 receptor sera. Sheep erythrocyte rosette formation was not affected. IgG-EoxA rosette formation was only slightly reduced by the anti-C3 receptor sera. Immunofluorescent staining with anti-C3 receptor sera revealed only a faint or negative staining of T cells and a distinct staining of EAC-reactive tonsil cells, lymphocytic leukaemia cells, and granulocytes. Absorption of the antisera with human serum proteins, brain, thymus, liver, EU-1 cell line cells, or trypsinized tonsil cells did not influence the capacity of the anti-C3 receptor sera to inhibit C3 receptors, whereas absorption with splenic tissue or tonsil cells completely removed the blocking activity of the anti-C3 receptor sera. Absorption with human erythrocytes or kidney removed only the inhibitory effect of the antisera on C3b receptors of tonsil cells, human erythrocytes, and granulocytes, but not on C3d receptors of tonsil cells.

More than 80% of PBMN cells were generally accounted for by mouse and sheep rosetting. The purified lymphocyte sub-populations were examined with a panel of B-cell specific alloantisera obtained from kidney transplant recipients and a rabbit antiserum to B cell antigen isolated from a human B-lymphoblastoid line. The results illustrated that the antigens detected by these sera also have potential as a marker for characterizing the CLL population. Where conventional markers were weak or absent, B cell antigens were readily detected in both fluorescent and cytotoxic tests. The majority of the non-rosetting cells (less than 90%) in CLL followed similar patterns of reactivity to the purified B cells, suggesting they are a subset of B cells.

Weakly ALL+ blasts were seen in seven of 32 cases of thymic ALL (Thy-ALL) but in other respects these blasts expressed Thy-ALL features, such as strong reactivity with anti-T cell (HuTLA) serum, negativity with anti-Ia-like serum and raised TdT. The combination of tests was particularly useful in 32 cases of undifferentiated leukaemia: in 10 of these cases TdT positivity indicated the probable 'lymphoblast', nature of blast cells: the remaining 22 cases remained unclassifiable with the markers used.

After transplantation, bone marrow cells were cultured in T flasks for 3 weeks and the adherent cells were then trypsinized and passaged weekly. After several passages the cells had the typical morphology and growth pattern of fibroblasts. Metaphases from these cells were all of recipient sex type. In contrast, haematopoietic cells and lymphocytes obtained at the same time were of donor sex type. Our findings indicate that the human bone marrow fibroblast is not derived from a precursor common to haemotopoietic cells or lymphocytes.

In 14, large volume plasma exchange and transfusion of donor-type erythrocytes was successful in reducing the antibody titre to low or undetectable levels. In one patient, plasma exchange was unsuccessful and red cells were removed from the marrow inoculum by unit gravity sedimentation. This approach prevented transfusion reaction, and permitted engraftment of all haematopoietic cell lines despite persistently elevated antibody titres. Parallel in vitro studies revealed that antibodies to ABH antigens failed to inhibit the growth of progenitor cells committed to both granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-C) and erythroid (BFU-E) development.

CALLA is specific for leukemic cells of most patients with non-T cell ALL and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis. It has been extensively tested on a wide variety of normal cells and is unreactive with them. CALLA identifies a surface glycoprotein having a m.w. of approximately 100,000 on reactive cell populations. In contrast, partially absorbed anti-ALL sera detect a similar glycoprotein band on CALLA-negative B and T cell lines. The glycoprotein identified by CALLA has been isolated and used as an immunogen. This new antiserum (C129) detects a 100,000-dalton glycoprotein not only on CALLA-positive cell populations but also on most CALLA-negative normal and malignant hematopoietic cells and on B and T cell lines.

The NTA esterase had a distribution and pattern of staining similar to those of esterases demonstrable at the light microscopic level by the alpha-naphthyl acetate or naphthol AS-D acetate esterase reaction. The NTA esterase appeared as intensely electron-dense granules of varying size and shape in the cytoplasm. The granules were most abundant in the cells of the histiomonocytic series. The large number of diffusely scattered granules in the cytoplasm of the histiocytes and monocytes made it possible to separate these cells from other haematopoietic elements. There was usually no direct relationship between the NTA esterase positivity and the amount or the location of lysosomes or mitochondria, although in some histiocytes the granules appeared to be associated with lysosomes. The NTA esterase-positive granules were usually more numerous than lysosomes and were located outside the lysosomal granules. Some of the lymphocytes outside the germinal centres and most of the lymphocytes in the blood showed a punctate positivity in the form of 1--4 electron-dense dots. Plasma cells were usually negative but, in rare cases, contained an occasional single dot-like reaction product similar to that in some of the lymphocytes. Granulocytes were always negative.

In vitro growth characteristics of the MSV cells were tested in a variety of assays defining cell transformation. None of these indicated that the virus-positive cells were transformed. Sex chromosome marker studies were carried out to determine if secondary tumor arose solely from proliferation of donor cells or through infection of host tissue. Tumors from female irradiated mice induced by injections of tumor cells derived from male mice contained a high proportion of metaphases of non-donor origin, indicating that infection is an important but not the sole mechanism involved in tumor transfer. These data also demonstrated that many of the sarcoma cells are damaged as a result of infection as shown by the presence of chromosome breaks and aneuploid metaphases. Histologic sections of both regressor and progressor tumors showed that the virus-positive cells were scattered as single cells surrounded by inflammatory cells, rather than as masses of dividing virus-positive cells found in the MSV-induced transplanted tumor. Collectively, these data support the contention that the MSV tumor is the manifestation of a response to a highly noxious virus infection rather than a tumor of dividing, transformed malignant cells.","['Becker, S', 'Haskill, S']","['Becker S', 'Haskill S']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Antigens, Viral', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosomes', 'Culture Media', 'Female', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/genetics/immunology/*pathology']",1980/04/15 00:00,1980/04/15 00:01,['1980/04/15 00:00'],"['1980/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910250417 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1980 Apr 15;25(4):543-50. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910250417.,,,,

Growth inhibition reflects sustained elevation of the deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate pool associated with secondary elevation of the deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate pool and reduction in the deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP) pool. Deoxycytidine was capable of partially reversing thymidine growth inhibition at a concentration of 0.5 microM, and growth recovery was virtually complete at 8 microM. The dCTP pool remained depressed until growth inhibition reversal by deoxycytidine was complete, and at a higher concentration of deoxycytidine the dCTP rose above control levels, but the deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate and deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate pools remained elevated. These results support the view that thymidine growth inhibition induces a critical deficiency of dCTP via allosteric inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase rather than inhibiting DNA replication directly by elevated deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate or deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate pools.","['Fox, R M', 'Tripp, E H', 'Tattersall, M H']","['Fox RM', 'Tripp EH', 'Tattersall MH']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/metabolism', 'Thymidine/*antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity']",1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 May;40(5):1718-21.,,,,

Time from testicular relapse to bone marrow relapse or death was significantly shorter for patients with testicular involvement while receiving chemotherapy when compared to patients with testicular relapse after discontinuing therapy. In those patients achieving three years of continuous complete remission, subsequent testicular relapse occurred significantly more often in patients who discontinued therapy than a similar group who continued therapy. In a group of 76 males who received presymptomatic gonadal radiation immediately after achieving an initial marrow remission, protection appears to have been provided against the manifestation of testicular leukemia during maintained remission.","['Nesbit, M E Jr', 'Robison, L L', 'Ortega, J A', 'Sather, H N', 'Donaldson, M', 'Hammond, D']","['Nesbit ME Jr', 'Robison LL', 'Ortega JA', 'Sather HN', 'Donaldson M', 'Hammond D']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Genitalia, Male/radiation effects', 'Hemoglobinometry', 'Hepatomegaly/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Splenomegaly/etiology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Time Factors']",1980/04/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1980/04/15 00:00'],"['1980/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1980/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19800415)45:8<2009::aid-cncr2820450805>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1980 Apr 15;45(8):2009-16. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19800415)45:8<2009::aid-cncr2820450805>3.0.co;2-a.,,,,

Following cytoreduction with cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg x 2) and total body irradiation (1000 rads) they underwent bone marrow transplantation. One patient received marrow from his identical twin brother and the other from his HLA-matched sister. Both patients promptly went into remission. The identical twin recipient is alive and free of disease at 20+ months, but the allogeneic patient died of P. carinii pneumonia at eight months with no evidence of leukemia. These results suggest that even some refractory patients whose disease has multiple negative prognostic features may respond to pretransplant chemoradiotherapy and attain a clinically useful complete remission. Additional patients with longer follow-up will be necessary before the curative potential of bone marrow transplantation in T cell ALL can be assessed.","['Garrett, T J', 'Grossbard, E', 'Hopfan, S', 'Koziner, B', 'Clarkson, B D', 'Good, R A', ""O'Reilly, R""]","['Garrett TJ', 'Grossbard E', 'Hopfan S', 'Koziner B', 'Clarkson BD', 'Good RA', ""O'Reilly R""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1980/04/15 00:00,1980/04/15 00:01,['1980/04/15 00:00'],"['1980/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19800415)45:8<2006::aid-cncr2820450804>3.0.co;2-m [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1980 Apr 15;45(8):2006-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19800415)45:8<2006::aid-cncr2820450804>3.0.co;2-m.,,,,

The data indicate that the single-cell immunofluorescence assay is highly efficient and specific for the detection of cells containing TdT. Using this assay, we have examined 124 marrow or peripheral-blood samples from 104 patients with or without haematological malignancies. Results indicate that TdT(+) cells from 6% to 100% were found in the following patients: 34/40 samples from patients with ALL at the time of diagnosis or during relapse; 2/3 patients with acute undifferentiated leukaemia; 2/3 patients with acute myelomonocytic leukaemia; 1/24 patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia; 1/5 patients with chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) in blastic crisis; and 2/2 patients with diffuse lymphoblastic lymphoma. In contrast less than 1% of TdT(+) cells were found in 20 marrow or peripheral-blood samples from ALL patients in complete remission; 8 patients with CML in chronic phase; 2 patients with myeloma; 1 sample from a patient with Hodgkin's disease, peripheral-blood samples from 7 normal donors and marrow samples from 6 patients without haematological malignancies. TdT(+) cells were also found in association with cells with lymphoblast morphology. The TdT(+) cells in marrow were shown to be directly correlated with the percentage of morphological lymphoblasts, with a Spearman rank coefficient of 0.81, significant at a 0.001 level. In 2 longitudinal studies of 2 ALL patients with TdT(+) cells at diagnosis, the percentage TdT(+) cells also changed in parallel with the proportion of lymphoblasts. However, studies of 2 other patients with morphologically diagnosed ALL with < 1% TdT(+) cells at diagnosis also showed < 1% TdT(+) cells throughout the period studied, indicating a stable phenotype of blast cells in these patients. The single-cell immunofluorescence assay for TdT, which requires < 0.1% of the cells used in a conventional biochemical assay, is highly specific, and could provide a technically more efficient alternative for use in clinics as well as in experimental investigations of subpopulations of leukaemic and normal marrow cells.","['Okamura, S', 'Crane, F', 'Jamal, N', 'Messner, H A', 'Mak, T W']","['Okamura S', 'Crane F', 'Jamal N', 'Messner HA', 'Mak TW']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology']",1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1980.26 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1980 Feb;41(2):159-67. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1980.26.,,PMC2010186,,

Quantitative structure--activity relationships for mutagenic activity and antitumor activity of substituted 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfonanilide derivatives.,269-74,"A series of substituted 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfonanilide (AMSA) derivatives have been tested for mutagenicity using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 1537 and for antitumor activity against the L1210 leukemia in mice. Two measures of mutagenic activity were determined and quantitative structure--activity relationships (QSAR) developed for them. M50, the percentage of drug-induced mutant colonies observed at the concentration providing 50% inhibition of bacterial growth, is a measure of mutagenic efficiency. The lowest molar drug concentration (1/C) needed to induce a fixed proportion of revertants (chosen as 50 per 10(8) bacteria) is a measure of mutagenic effectiveness. The two measures of antitumor activity modeled were ILSmax (the percent increase in life span observed for each derivative at its LD10 dose), a measure of tumor cell selectivity, and 1/D40 (the dose of drug to provide an ILS of 40%), a measure of dose potency. These measures of bioactivity were intercompared and modeled in terms of a number of drug physicochemical properties. The results show that drug lipophilic/hydrophilic balance is the dominant factor in determining both mutagenic and antitumor activity, although other factors are involved. The two different types of activity can be readily separated in the AMSA drug series by appropriate choice of substituent and adjustment of overall drug lipophilic/hydrophilic balance.","['Ferguson, L R', 'Denny, W A']","['Ferguson LR', 'Denny WA']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mathematics', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/*chemical synthesis', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects/genetics', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1980/03/01 00:00,1980/03/01 00:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00177a011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1980 Mar;23(3):269-74. doi: 10.1021/jm00177a011.,,,,

Fever was caused by infections in 84 of 199 episodes (71%). Two-thirds of the febrile episodes and 57% of the documented infections occurred when leukemic activity was demonstrable. However, only nine of 29 febrile episodes which occurred at the time of initial diagnosis of acute leukemia were due to infection. All serious bacterial infections occurred in children with absolute granulocyte counts less than 500/mm3. Septicemia was responsible for seven of the 17 deaths which occurred during the period of observation. The five children with Pseudomonas infections were colonized 10 to 30 days before they developed their infection. The majority of viral infections occurred in patients in remission, and were principally caused by cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, or Epstein-Barr virus. With the exception of one patient who died with a complex infection (CMV and Pneumocystis carinii), the children in this study responded well to viral infections.","['Kosmidis, H V', 'Lusher, J M', 'Shope, T C', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Dajani, A S']","['Kosmidis HV', 'Lusher JM', 'Shope TC', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Dajani AS']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bacterial Infections/*complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications', 'Male', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Nasopharynx/microbiology', 'Pneumonia/complications/microbiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rectum/microbiology', 'Sepsis/complications/microbiology', 'Virus Diseases/*complications']",1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(80)80548-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(80)80548-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1980 May;96(5):814-9. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(80)80548-8.,,,,

This hybridoma antibody, termed OKM1, was reactive by indirect immunofluorescence and complement- (C) mediated lysis with adherent mononuclear cells. OKM1 was unreactive with lymphocytes, thymocytes, lymphoblastoid cell lines, and tumor cells of the T or B cell lineage. In contrast, acute myelomonocytic leukemia cells and granulocytes were reactive with the antibody. Pretreatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with OKM1 and C before culture with soluble antigens totally abolished their antigen-induced proliferative response. This function was restored by addition of 1% adherent cells. These findings provided additional support for the notion that OKM1 was reactive with monocytes. In addition, OKM1 appeared to define two distinct populations of monocytes; an adherent population of large cells bearing surface Ia determinants and a nonadherent population of small, Ia-negative cells. These OKM1+ Ia- cells were found to be a contaminant of most fractionated mononuclear cell subsets including the E-SIg-Null cell population.","['Breard, J', 'Reinherz, E L', 'Kung, P C', 'Goldstein, G', 'Schlossman, S F']","['Breard J', 'Reinherz EL', 'Kung PC', 'Goldstein G', 'Schlossman SF']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1980 Apr;124(4):1943-8.,,,,

The Mo cells produce a colony-stimulating factor necessary for the growth of human granulocyte-monocyte precursors in vitro as well as an erythroid-potentiating activity (EPA) that enhances the proliferation of human erythroid progenitors in vitro. In the presence of serum, the EPA in Mo-conditioned medium stimulated the growth of small and large erythroid colonies almost 2-fold. EPA was also produced in serum-free medium, and, when assayed in serum-free cultures of human erythroid progenitors, it stimulated colony growth about 3-fold. The EPA produced by the Mo cell line did not stimulate normal murine erythroid progenitors (CFU-E) or Friend erythroleukemia cell growth in vitro. EPA was inactivated by protease treatment but was remarkably heat stable, with most of the activity recovered after boiling for 15 min. Preliminary biochemical characterization suggests that EPA is an acidic glycoprotein with molecular weight approximately 45,000. EPA is clearly separable from colony-stimulating factor on the basis of heat stability and gel-filtration chromatography. The present observations provide strong support for the concept that activated T cells produce humoral factors important in the regulation of erythropoiesis. The availability of a cell line producing human EPA should facilitate the characterization of the protein and permit definitive studies of its biologic effects.","['Golde, D W', 'Bersch, N', 'Quan, S G', 'Lusis, A J']","['Golde DW', 'Bersch N', 'Quan SG', 'Lusis AJ']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.77.1.593 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Jan;77(1):593-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.1.593.,,PMC348320,,

In 30% of cases, BT displays the cytomorphological, cytochemical, immunological and biochemical features and the response to therapy observed in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The presence of lymphoid-like cells in a blood disease classically interpreted as a disorder of the myeloid strain led to the suggestion that CML is a disease of a stem cell capable of displaying both myeloid and lymphoid characters. It is thought that this is due to the fact that the Ph1 alteration strikes a premyeloid and prelympoid stem cell that presents myeloid features in the chronic stage of CML and in myeloblastic BT, whereas it displays lymphoid characteristics in the lymphblastic BT of CML and Ph1+ ALL. This fact lends support to the unicystic haematopoietic theory of Ferrata.

The results show that (1) the amount of ethylation of the DNA is similar in these cells when treatment conditions are identical, (2) the relationship between dose to DNA (ethylations per nucleotide) versus exposure (mM applied concentration) is non-linear in the sense that less alkylation of the DNA is observed at the higher exposures than would be predicted on the basis of proportionality between dose to DNA and exposure, and (3) the non-linearity of the genetic response in the bacterial cells is not reflected in a non-linearity of the alkylation of the DNA in those cells. Quantitative comparison of the frequencies of gene mutations in the various systems shows that the mutation frequency per unit of DNA alkylation is heterogeneous among the mammalian cell systems and that the frequencies observed in the bacterial cells fall within the range observed with mammalian cells. Alkylation of the DNA in the bone marrow, testis and liver of Swiss random-bred mice was also measured. The results support the conclusion that the distribution of the compound to the various tissues is rapid and probably uniform.

The incidence of skin cancer increased by 5% annually after the first year of graft function, to a cumulative 44% in those surviving 9 years with functioning grafts. This represents an incidence of 4,356/100,000 person years of post-transplant risk--20.6 times the annual incidence of skin cancer in the general population of Southern Queensland. Half of the patients had multiple tumors when the first skin cancer was diagnosed, after a mean latent interval of 34 months. A total of 138 skin cancers occurred in 26 patients (average, 5.3 per patient), with a maximum of 19 in one individual. The ratio of basal to squamous cell carcinoma was reversed from 4:1, in the general population, to 1:1.7. Conventional surgical excision gave satisfactory results, with the one local recurrence being controlled by reexcision. Two patients (7%) died of melanoma and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, whereas two of the other four patients who died from cancer had coincidental skin cancer. The two skin cancer deaths represent only 2% of all deaths in allograft recipients.

When acute GVHD was present, rectal biopsies were focally abnormal with crypt cell degeneration, crypt dilation, and crypt abscess. Rectal biopsies were normal after day 20 in those patients who did not have clinical evidence of GVHD.

For induction, three weekly I.V. injections of vincristine and Daunorubicin were given with daily prednisone orally, followed by 5-day courses of Cytosine Arabinoside and 6-mercaptopurine. The patients were randomized to chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. Maintenance consisted of vincristine, Daunorubicin, and prednisone one week every odd month, and a 5-day course of Cytosine Arabinoside and 6-mercaptopurine every even month. Every week, the chemoimmunotherapy group also received, without chemotherapy, one injection of C. parvum 4 mg, subcutaneously. All patients received five weekly injections of intrathecal methotrexate 13 mg/m2 right after complete remission was achieved. Out of 181 evaluable cases, 80 (44%) achieved complete remission, 45 were randomized to chemotherapy, and 35 to chemoimmunotherapy. In the chemoimmunotherapy group 32/35 relapsed, and in the chemotherapy group 36/45. Median duration of complete remission and survival were: for group chemotherapy, 8 and 15 months; for group chemoimmunotherapy, 5 and 10 months. This difference is not significant. Intrathecal methotrexate was given to all patients. Six patients (7%) had central nervous system leukemia at the time of the first injection. None had central nervous system relapse after prevention with intrathecal methotrexate. This method seems useful in preventing central nervous system relapse in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, but does not seem to prolong complete remission.","['Eppinger-Helft, M', 'Pavlovsky, S', 'Hidalgo, G', 'Muriel, F S', 'Suarez, A', 'Garay, G', 'Russo, C', 'Santos, M', 'Macchi, A', 'Lein, J']","['Eppinger-Helft M', 'Pavlovsky S', 'Hidalgo G', 'Muriel FS', 'Suarez A', 'Garay G', 'Russo C', 'Santos M', 'Macchi A', 'Lein J']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Propionibacterium acnes/*immunology', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Time Factors']",1980/01/15 00:00,1980/01/15 00:01,['1980/01/15 00:00'],"['1980/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19800115)45:2<280::aid-cncr2820450213>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1980 Jan 15;45(2):280-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19800115)45:2<280::aid-cncr2820450213>3.0.co;2-o.,,,,

One patient had a shift from the 45,X to a 47,XX, +5, 13q + karyotype in the terminal phase of the disease. The findings indicate that the 45,X cells were not involved in further karyotypic progression, and that the leukemic process usually seemed to involve the 46,XY cell rather than the 45,X cells. Based on the data of the current study and that in the literature, it appears that the presence of missing Y in ANLL may afford a rather benign clinical course to such patients when compared to that of the ANLL patients with a missing Y.

Age- and sex-distribution, localization as well as intracytoplasmic immunoglobulins (Ig) in tumour cells were evaluated. Hodgkin's lymphomas were classified according to Lukes (1971), the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) according to the Kiel-classification. Among NHL of low grade malignancy the most common type was chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (18%), among the NHL of high grade malignancy the immunoblastic lymphomas (IB) (13%). In IB 5 cases of T-cell type of IB were be identified. 8 cases were classified as ""histiocytic"" reticulosarcomas. Immunomorphology performed on routinely formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections showed a clear-cut difference between CLL and immunocytic lymphomas (IC): In all IC ""monoclonal"" Ig could be detected in lymphoplasmacytoid and plasma cells. The most common Ig was of the IgM/K type. 4 IC were turned out as ""biclonal"" ML detected by the double immunofluorescence. In IB lymphomas less than 50% contained intracytoplasmic Ig mainly of the IgM/K type. In Hodgkin's- and Sternberg cells sometimes IgG, K, lambda and also lysozyme was observed intracytoplasmically. This finding supports the hypothesis of the macrophage origin of these cells. In lymphogranulomatosis X and in lymphoepithelioid cell lymphoma (Lennert's lymphoma) as well as in pseudolymphomas ""polyclonal"" Ig containing ""reactive"" plasma cells was demonstrable.

Workers in certain departments (especially chemical workers) were exposed to high average air levels of uranium dust. Based on deaths reported in 1974 by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and using mortality rates for U.S. white males, standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for various causes in the entire cohort were generally less than 1.00. After correction for unascertained deaths and missing death certificates, the SMR for lung cancer was 1.22 (95% confidence limits, 1.10 and 1.36). SMRs for various causes, including lung cancer, did not tend to be higher in 8,345 workers employed in areas where uranium dust was present or in 4,008 of these 8,345 workers employed for one year or longer at the plant.

There are myeloid leukemic cells that constitutively produce their own MGI-1, but the cells do not differentiate in culture medium containing horse or calf serum. By removing serum from the medium, or in medium with mouse or rat serum, these leukemic cells are induced to differentiate to mature cells, which like normal mature cells, then no longer multiply.

All three lines expressed tumor-associated transplantation antigens (TATA) which elicited specific T cell-mediated antitumor immune reactions in the host. The strongest host response was elicited upon intradermal inoculation. It could be followed by (a) the infiltration of the locally growing tumor by host cells, such as lymphocytes and macrophages, (b) the establishment of specific systemic antitumor immunity, (c) the generation of immune cells capable of transferring protective antitumor immunity into a normal syngeneic recipient, and (d) the generation of tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Anti-TATA CTL were used as typing reagents to investigate the stability or variability in the TATA expression by cloned tumor cell lines. Antigenic variability in the TATA expression was seen under various conditions: (a) clone-dependent variation in the sensitivity to anti-TATA CTL lysis upon prolonged growth in tissue culture, (b) qualitative change in the TATA (TATA1 leads to TATA2) upon successive i.p. transplantation of the parental Eb tumor line and, (c) generation of TATA negative immune escape variants (TATA2 leads to TATA-) during metastasis formation from a s.c. site. The relative inefficiency of specific immunization procedures against ESb was found to be due to the effective generation of TATA negative variants by this highly metastatic tumor. The balance between immune control and immune escape could be influenced to the advantage of the host by some means, for instance optimizing the route of antitumor-immune sensitization or by infusion of allogeneic but H-2 identical antitumor-immune T cells. Such immune cells recognized the tumor via minor histocompatibility antigens and thus circumvented the need of TATA recognition. Finally, manipulations at the cell surface of the highly malignant ESb tumor such as those introduced in the ESb-M variant were found to dramatically effect its metastatic potential.","['Schirrmacher, V', 'Fogel, M', 'Russmann, E', 'Bosslet, K', 'Altevogt, P', 'Beck, L']","['Schirrmacher V', 'Fogel M', 'Russmann E', 'Bosslet K', 'Altevogt P', 'Beck L']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (tumor-associated transplantation antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunization', 'Injections, Intradermal', 'Leukemia L5178/*immunology/secondary/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', '*Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00046830 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1982;1(3):241-74. doi: 10.1007/BF00046830.,,,,

It has enabled us to relate components of the host's tumor suppressive immune system to the stage of tumor dormancy and the magnitude of the tumor burden. A strong CTL response has been associated with establishment of the tumor dormant state and can be reelicited in vivo or in vitro, after its initial decline, by reexposure to tumor antigen. This reelicitation is mediated via immunologic stimulation of memory CTL. Combined cultures of NAD T-lineage lymphocytes and macrophages from tumor dormant mice produce considerable cytolytic activity where little or no activity can be detected in the individual populations. Based on the similar pattern of tumor target cell specificity of the two responses, it is likely that memory CTL contribute to this synergistic cytolytic activity. The synergistic cytolytic response persists after CTL activity has waned to undetectable levels and is probably the predominant cytolytic activity associated with maintenance of the tumor dormant state. However, this activity may be obscured by proliferation of endogenous tumor cells, which in turn triggers direct macrophage-mediated cytolytic activity. The target cell specificity of this direct macrophage-mediated cytolytic response is also similar to the CTL response suggesting T cell (or memory CTL) involvement in its generation. The L5178Y-cell tumor dormant model is well suited for attempts at cure with immunotherapy. Active specific and nonspecific immunotherapy are each capable of eliminating all tumor cells from approximately 50% of tumor dormant mice. The L5178Y-cell tumor dormant state is one of several animal models of tumor dormancy. The great variety of growth restraint mechanisms that control tumor dormant states in animal systems is strong evidence that tumor dormant states exist in cancer in human beings.","['Wheelock, E F', 'Robinson, M K', 'Truitt, G A']","['Wheelock EF', 'Robinson MK', 'Truitt GA']",['eng'],"['32576/PHS HHS/United States', '32577/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA 32575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology/pathology/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Propionibacterium acnes', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00049479 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1982;1(1):29-44. doi: 10.1007/BF00049479.,,,,

Now there are several potentially curative regimens, such as MOPP therapy for Hodgkin's disease, and MOPP (or C-MOPP), CHOP (or HOP), BACOP and COMLA for diffuse histiocytic lymphoma. There are recent trends to include methotrexate in combination and to use two non-cross-resistant regimens alternatively (CVP/ABP, MOPP/ABVD) for improving complete remission rate and remission duration.

Chemotherapy makes the deficiency in cellular immunity worse, and this is followed by lethal infections. Therefore, a patient with ATL underwent leukapheresis on an IBM 2997 cell separator. A total of 22.3 x 10(11) leukemic T cells was removed. Removal of a large number of leukemic T cells was not associated with improvements in clinical symptoms except for skin eruption, but was not complicated by lethal infections. The peripheral leukocyte count after the 14th procedure began to increase over the prepheresis levels. In the course of frequent leukapheresis, leukemic meningitis occurred. Intrathecal injections of a small dose of antileukemic agents resulted in a rapid reduction of the leukemic T cell count and improvements in clinical symptoms. However, the patient died from cryptococcal sepsis. The survival time was 10 months from clinical onset, 9 months from diagnosis, 9 months from leukapheresis and 5 months from chemotherapy. From this experience, it appears that long-term repeated leukapheresis can decrease lethal infections and extend the survival time.","['Yamauchi, K', 'Noguchi, K', 'Shimizu, M', 'Nagao, T', 'Arimori, S']","['Yamauchi K', 'Noguchi K', 'Shimizu M', 'Nagao T', 'Arimori S']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Tokai J Exp Clin Med,The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,7704186,,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*T-Lymphocytes']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tokai J Exp Clin Med. 1982 Nov;7(6):655-60.,,,,

This disease shows a peculiar geographic clustering of patient birthplaces in the southwestern part of Japan. A retrovirus was isolated from the T-cell line, MT-2, which was established from cord lymphocytes cocultivated with leukemic cells from an ATL patient and characterized by: (a) density of 1.152-1.155 g/ml in sucrose gradient; (b) reverse transcriptase activity; (c) specific protein components; (d) RNA labeled with 3H-uridine, and (e) specific DNA complementary with viral RNA. The retrovirus was named adult T-cell leukemia virus (ATLV). Complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared by the endogenous reaction of detergent-treated virions hybridized with 35S RNA in MT-2 cells and another ATL cell line, MT-1, and this 35S RNA was inducible with IUDR treatment of the MT-1 cells, indicating that ATLV is a typical retrovirus containing 35S RNA as the genome. However, the cDNA did not show any detectable hybridization with cellular RNA of other human cell lines unrelated to ATL. The ATLV proviral DNA was detected in the chromosomal DNA of MT-1 and MT-2 cell lines as well well as in fresh peripheral blood cells of all five patients with ATL tested; however, it was not found in those of three healthy adults. Furthermore, sera from the patients reacted with one component of the ATLV protein, but normal sera did not. These sera and all other sera from ATL patients were previously shown to react with antigen(s) in leukemic cells of ATL, and the antigen(s) also reacted with sera from about 25% of the healthy adults in the endemic area, but not in the non-endemic area. These close associations of ATLV proviral DNA and proteins with ATL are direct evidence strongly suggesting the involvement of the retrovirus, ATLV, in the leukemogenesis of human ATL.","['Yoshida, M', 'Miyoshi, I', 'Hinuma, Y']","['Yoshida M', 'Miyoshi I', 'Hinuma Y']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*microbiology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Retroviridae/*isolation & purification', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Viral Proteins/analysis']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1982;12:285-94.,,,,

Compared with undifferentiated colonies, spontaneously differentiating colonies have a reduced content of clonogenic cells and surviving clonogenic cells tend themselves to form differentiating colonies, both being characteristics of differentiated colonies induced by the regulator, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF. Colony crowding increased the frequency of spontaneously differentiating colonies and WEHI-3B D+ colony cells were shown to release material able to induce differentiation in WEHI-3B D+ colonies. Cells from spontaneously differentiating D+ colonies were not hyperresponsive to the induction of differentiation by G-CSF and did not release larger amounts of differentiation-inducing material than did cells from undifferentiated colonies. Cells of the differentiation-unresponsive WEHI-3B D-line produced similar amounts of differentiation-inducing material to those produced by D+ cells.

Erythroid-potentiating activity has been partially purified and characterized. It is an acidic glycoprotein of 45,000 daltons molecular weight and it has remarkable heat stability. Erythroid-potentiating activity is physically separable from the colony-stimulating factor. Partially purified EPA was found to stimulate the proliferation of human K-562 and murine Friend erythroleukemia cells. These erythroleukemia cell lines may therefore prove useful for studying the action of EPA on target cells. Erythroid-potentiating factors from other human and murine sources stimulated erythroleukemia cell proliferation in a manner indicating some species restriction.

According to the French-American-British (FAB) classification three types (L1-L3) of acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and six types (M1-M6) of acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) are distinguished. Besides morphology cytochemical studies are used, particularly in cases where panoptic stains do not permit an unequivocal attribution to either ALL or ANLL. In addition, cytochemical reactions contribute to the distinction of myelocytic and monocytic types of ANLL. The heterogeneity of ALL in childhood is best revealed by immunological markers which permit to distinguish common, null, pre-T, T, pre-B and B subtypes. A discussion of published results demonstrates that the prognostic implications of these studies cannot be clearly evaluated as yet. By use of monoclonal antibodies new subtypes of ALL, and, very recently, of ANLL have been defined.

Although a good correlation was generally observed between colony formation and PHA transformation, in a few cases a low PHA response was accompanied by moderate colony growth and vice versa.

The functional abnormalities reported here suggest that neoplastic T-cells with a helper/inducer phenotype show a low proliferative response in the assay systems used, although expressing mature T-cell characteristics.

Since the majority of TdT-positive acute leukemias are anatomically bone marrow-derived, one would have predicted the presence of a bone marrow TdT-phosphocellulose chromatographic pattern in such patients. However, in 376 consecutive, untreated TdT-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) studied by us we have invariably encountered the two-peak thymocyte-type phosphocellulose pattern. The TdT patterns in the thymic-dependent, TdT-positive lymphoma of AKR mice, and the TdT-positive bone marrow-derived, thymic-independent Abelson virus leukemia of Balb/C mice duplicate the situation in human ALL: a thymocyte pattern is seen in both the marrow-derived and thymus-derived diseases. This chromatographic difference between leukemia-associated and normal marrow-associated TdT in both murine and human leukemia suggested that phosphocellulose-TdT patterns might be useful for monitoring residual marrow tumour cell burden in TdT-positive leukemia. This has not turned out to be the case: in eight patients studied in early relapse the blast cell TdT pattern was the single-peak 0.3 M species. Therefore, leukemic cell TdT cannot reliably be distinguished from normal marrow cell TdT. The chromatographic behaviour of TdT may be regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, the 0.3 M salt peak can be converted to the 0.4 M salt species by treatment with protein kinase and ATP, and the 0.4 M species can be converted to the 0.3 M form by exposure to alkaline phosphatase. Thus, apparently anatomic compartment-specific forms of TdT may only reflect differing cellular metabolic activity.","['Bell, R', 'Lillquist, A', 'Abelson, H', 'McCaffrey, R']","['Bell R', 'Lillquist A', 'Abelson H', 'McCaffrey R']",['eng'],"['A-105877/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA18662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FR-128/PHS HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(82)90059-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1982;6(6):775-80. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(82)90059-5.,,,,

Comparison of the partial proteolytic products generated by treatment of p80 molecules from different tumors with V8 protease did not reveal heterogeneity in p80 among tumors of different strains of mice. Direct labeling and competition blocking experiments with lysates from normal cells failed to provide evidence of p80 synthesis in normal thymus, spleen, or bone marrow.

Prevention of Friend leukemia virus-induced immunosuppression by passive serum therapy.,609-24,"Previous studies have suggested that the passive therapy of Friend leukemia virus (FLV)-induced disease with chimpanzee anti-FLV serum operates by reducing the level of infectious virus in the treated animal below the immunosuppressive threshold, thereby allowing the host to mount anti-viral immune responses which are responsible for long-term protection. The present study was undertaken to examine directly the effect of passive serum therapy on the marked immunosuppression induced by FLV in progressively infected mice, as well as to determine whether virus-specific host cellular immune effector functions are augmented in serum-protected animals. Using a variety of assays of host immunocompetence, including natural killing (NK), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vivo and in vitro induction of allogeneic killers, and mitogen blastogenesis, a marked compartmentalization of FLV immunodepression was observed in progressively infected DBA/2 mice, possibly reflecting the distribution of FLV target cells in various host lymphoid populations. Thus, spleen-cell functions were suppressed most rapidly and to the greatest degree, followed by peritoneal cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes, while lymph node cells and thymocytes maintained normal levels of activity. In contrast, serum-protected mice demonstrated no sign of FLV-induced immunosuppression regardless of the host effector-cell population or immune function examined. However, we were not able to identify host anti-viral cellular immune functions which are significantly enhanced in serum-protected animals; thus the specific role of the host immune system in the passive serum therapy of FLV-induced disease remains undefined at the present time.","['Genovesi, E V', 'Livnat, D', 'Collins, J J']","['Genovesi EV', 'Livnat D', 'Collins JJ']",['eng'],['5T32 CA09111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', '*Immune Tolerance', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Pan troglodytes/immunology', 'Splenomegaly/etiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1982/11/15 00:00,1982/11/15 00:01,['1982/11/15 00:00'],"['1982/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910300512 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1982 Nov 15;30(5):609-24. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910300512.,,,,

On lymphoblastoid cell lines the distribution of the 231 epitope is completely nonpolymorphic, while the 164 epitope is present on all cells except on those that are DR7 homozygous. Binding-inhibition studies show that the 231 and 164 epitopes are spatially close to each other when present on the same molecule. The mutual inhibition pattern and the absence of the 164 epitope from the 231+ cells of a few leukemia patients suggest, however, that 231 and 164 epitopes are not invariably present together. Most DR-positive cells possess 231+ and 164+ and 231+ 164- class II molecules in approximately a 2:1 ratio. This has been confirmed by immune depletion studies.

Intensive consolidation chemotherapy produced a median duration of complete remission of 160 weeks with 40% of patients projected to be in remission at 4 years. By contrast, the median duration of remission for patients treated with moderate consolidation/maintenance therapy was 23 weeks with only 10% of patients in remission at 4 years.

Of the 11 analyzed patients, 5 died within 6 months after initial ATG treatment. Six patients, or 54 percent, survived with a minimum follow-up of 24 months and the longest 48 months. Median survival is 42 months. All patients are transfusion-independent although none are completely normal, due to mild thrombocytopenia. The in vitro effect of ATG on pretreatment marrow CFUE was determined in 8 patients and concordance with clinical outcome was observed for only 3 patients. Three patients had no in vitro response and survived, and 2 patients had a positive in vitro response and died. Survival after ATG correlated with maximum percent decrease in absolute lymphocyte count during treatment. No significant correlation was determined for any other parameter. The mechanism of ATG action remains unknown but the clinical response suggests that immune dysfunction may play an important role in the development or prolongation of aplastic anemia, and that this abnormality may be reversible by ATG in some patients.","['Rothmann, S A', 'Streeter, R R', 'Bukowski, R M', 'Hewlett, J S']","['Rothmann SA', 'Streeter RR', 'Bukowski RM', 'Hewlett JS']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/mortality/*therapy', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1982 Oct;10(9):809-16.,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine whether this association is confined to AML cells or whether the linking of these two properties in AML represents retention of an association occurring in normal granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cell populations. Bone marrow cells from normal donors were studied using four independent techniques to enrich for clonogenic cells with different clone size potentials (equilibrium density centrifugation, adherence to microcarrier beads, osmotic lysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting). It was shown that mean clone size was directly related to the mean CSA threshold (amount of CSA required to stimulate 50% of the cells to clone formation). Further studies (including analysis of the kinetics of production of clonogenic cells with different clone size potentials in suspension culture) suggested that these two properties were linked to differentiation, with proliferative capacity decreasing and sensitivity to CSA increasing as cells differentiate down the granulocyte-monocyte pathway.","['Francis, G E', 'Berney, J J', 'Bodger, M P', 'Bol, S J', 'Wing, M A', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Francis GE', 'Berney JJ', 'Bodger MP', 'Bol SJ', 'Wing MA', 'Hoffbrand AV']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Stem Cells,Stem cells,8110002,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],IM,"['Cell Separation', 'Clone Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Stem Cells. 1981;1(2):124-39.,,,,

The antibodies identify nonoverlapping populations of surface Ig-positive cells in the spleen and a large (95%) proportion of bone marrow cells. Both recognize differentiation antigens in that the surface representation of the markers changes during the development of the cell. The NIM-R3 specificity does not appear until three weeks of age in both the spleen and bone marrow and may be on a more mature set of cells. In contrast, the NIM-R2 antibody, which stains the pre-B cell line 70Z/3 and binds to neonatal cells, may recognize pre-B cells in the bone marrow. There was no clear-cut correlation between the presence or absence of surface IgM, surface IgD or complement receptors on B cells positive or negative for either NIM-R2 or NIM-R3. Most interesting was the finding of identical total surface Ig densities on cells which stained weakly or strongly with NIM-R2, since these two B cell subpopulations are shown to be enriched for memory and virgin B cells, respectively. To bias the production of monoclonal antibodies to distinct populations of cells, the immunogen for the NIM-R3 fusion was depleted of cells strongly reactive with NIM-R2.

HTLV is genetically and serologically distinct from any known animal retroviruses. The absence of HTLV proviral sequences in DNA from normal humans showed that HTLV is not a ubiquitous endogenous (germ-line transmitted) virus of humans. Antibodies to HTLV core proteins have been identified in some people with T-cell neoplasias and are particularly prevalent in Japanese with adult T-cell leukemia, suggesting that HTLV is acquired horizontally. However, it was possible that HTLV is transmitted through the germ line of some (possibly rare) families and is then expressed in the HTLV- positive malignancies. An opportunity to study this question was provided by the development of several T-cell lines and a B-cell provided by the development of several T-cell lines and a B-cell line from one HTLV-positive patient with a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here we report that HTLV proteins or nucleic acids (or both) are found in three independently derived T-cell lines, all shown by HLA typing to have originated from the patient. In contrast, the B-cell line, the identity of which was also ascertained by HLA typing, contained no detectable HTLV protein, RNA, or proviral DNA. Because the sensitivity of the latter assay is more than sufficient to detect one proviral equivalent per haploid genome, the results indicate that HTLV was not transmitted to this patient through the germ line but rather was acquired by infection.","['Gallo, R C', 'Mann, D', 'Broder, S', 'Ruscetti, F W', 'Maeda, M', 'Kalyanaraman, V S', 'Robert-Guroff, M', 'Reitz, M S Jr']","['Gallo RC', 'Mann D', 'Broder S', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Maeda M', 'Kalyanaraman VS', 'Robert-Guroff M', 'Reitz MS Jr']",['eng'],['Y01 CP 00502/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*microbiology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/microbiology', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae/*isolation & purification', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology']",1982/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.18.5680 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Sep;79(18):5680-3. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.18.5680.,,PMC346968,,

In addition, it is long lived in vitro in the absence of stimulation and survives for more than 1 wk in vivo in the absence of exogenous antigen or growth factors. Mice injected intraperitoneally with lethal doses of L1-2 and then treated with 1E4 survived longer than animals treated with saline or with a control T-cell clone. Multiple weekly injections of effector cells, or a single injection in animals given a low dose of tumor cells, resulted in 50-80% long-term survivors. The observation that intravenous injection of killer cells was less effective than intraperitoneal treatment, coupled with the previous demonstration of markedly abnormal circulatory patterns for T-cell clones, suggests that those animals succumbing to progressively growing neoplasm die because the effector cells are unable to home into peripheral sites of tumor deposition.

MTX cytotoxicity was found to increase linearly with drug dose for MTX concentrations between 10(-9) M and 10(-7) M. No further increase in cytoxicity was observed with much higher MTX concentrations (10(-7) M-10(-4) M). A similar dose-response relationship was found for both MTX-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis and changes in dTTP and dGTP pools but not for either MTX-induced inhibition of purine synthesis or changes in dATP and dCTP pools. Exogenous dThd reduced MTX cytotoxicity, at all MTX concentrations examined, but Hx reduced cytotoxicity only at MTX concentrations less than 6 X 10(-8) M and potentiated toxicity with higher MTX concentrations. This potentiation of cytotoxicity was accompanied by substantial elevation of dATP pools.

The immune adjuvant lentinan has been shown in this study to augment IL-1 production by human monocytes. Stimulation of IL-1 by lentinan was seen as early as 5 hr, with some effect as late as 60 hr. Optimal effects were seen with very low concentrations, around 0.1 micrograms/ml. Lentinan was also able to stimulate IL-1 production by the leukemic cell line, K-562.

The specific binding of [3H] bestatin was a rapid and saturable process exhibiting one affinity, characterized by an association constant of 0.8 x 10(5) M-1, as determined in the L5178y mouse lymphoma system. Optimal binding was observed at 37 degrees C. L-leucine and L-leucine-beta-naphthylamide prevented the binding, suggesting that the complex was formed between leucine aminopeptidase and bestatin. The protein nature of the bestatin-""receptor"" was suggested by its susceptibility to trypsin. Under the conditions used here intracellular translocation of bestatin appeared to be negligible. A maximum of about 2.2 x 10(6) bestatin molecules could bind to L5178y mouse lymphoma cells. Under identical conditions by far the highest amount of bestatin was bound to macrophages from mice. Lower levels were measured with T-lymphocytes; very low binding capacity was observed with B-lymphocytes. Experiments with synchronized L5178y cells revealed a cell cycle dependent change of binding capacity for bestatin; the highest level was observed during the transition from S-to G2 phase and the lowest during G1- and early S phase. These data lend further support to the assumption that the immuno-potentiating activity of bestatin is due to a stimulation of T-lymphocyte proliferation probably mediated through the activation of macrophages.","['Muller, W E', 'Schuster, D K', 'Zahn, R K', 'Maidhof, A', 'Leyhausen, G', 'Falke, D', 'Koren, R', 'Umezawa, H']","['Muller WE', 'Schuster DK', 'Zahn RK', 'Maidhof A', 'Leyhausen G', 'Falke D', 'Koren R', 'Umezawa H']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'I0J33N5627 (ubenimex)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Aminopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0192-0561(82)90012-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(82)90012-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1982;4(5):393-400. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(82)90012-1.,,,,

At the 2-cell, 4-cell and 8-32-cell stage, individual cells were washed and recloned in control cultures to test for clonogenicity and the ability to form differentiating progeny. With increasing clone size, an increasing proportion of treated cells either failed to proliferate or generated differentiating colonies of reduced size. The observed suppression indicated that both ES and DF exert irreversible effects on leukemic stem cell self-replication within one or two cell cycles. The stem cell suppression observed was markedly asymmetric and most often involved premature differentiation and death of progeny of the affected cells rather than immediate death of the cell. The results are consistent with the possibility that the regulator DF irreversibly modifies one or more of the newly synthesised daughter chromatids of myeloid leukemic cells during the induction of stem cell suppression and differentiation.","['Metcalf, D']",['Metcalf D'],['eng'],"['CA-25972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Endotoxins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Endotoxins/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1982/08/15 00:00,1982/08/15 00:01,['1982/08/15 00:00'],"['1982/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910300213 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1982 Aug 15;30(2):203-10. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910300213.,,,,

In contrast to similarly cultured hairy cells (HCs), the cultured CLL cells continue to express light-chain-restricted surface immunoglobulin (SIg) and show no change in their morphology. The continued SIg positivity and staining with a panel of monoclonal antibodies indicated that the high proportion of E+ cells could not be attributed to the outgrowth of normal T-cells or to mitogen-induced non-specific stickiness. Repeated addition of supernatants from cultured T-cells caused no phenotypic changes and therefore excluded the possibility of shedding and passive acquisition of E receptor.

As compared to the controls, colony growth was very poor when unseparated peripheral-blood lymphocytes from CLL-patients were seeded. The number of colonies was greatly higher when T-cell enriched fractions from CLL were plated; however, they failed to reach the normal range even in this experimental condition. The role of adherent cells in the colony growth was also investigated. Depletion of these cells resulted in impaired colony generation either in normals or in CLL-patients, which was subsequently restored by the addition of the same adherent cells. In the patients investigated in this study, an imbalance of T-subsets was found with increase of OKT8-positive cells (T-suppressors). When the number of colonies and the percentage of OKT8-positive cells were plotted, an inverse correlation was found. Conversely, a linear relationship was detected between the percentage of OKT4-positive cells (T-helpers) and the values of colonies. On the basis of the present experiments, it is suggested that the defective colony growth of T-cell fractions in B-cell CLL may be related to the low number of OKT4-positive cells plated, which are known to be mainly responsible for the colony generation in agar culture.","['Neri, A', 'Brugiatelli, M', 'Comis, M', 'Iacopino, P', 'Morabito, F', 'Nobile, F', 'Ronco, F', 'Trapani Lombardo, V', 'Ozger Astaldi, U', 'Astaldi, G']","['Neri A', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Comis M', 'Iacopino P', 'Morabito F', 'Nobile F', 'Ronco F', 'Trapani Lombardo V', 'Ozger Astaldi U', 'Astaldi G']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Boll Ist Sieroter Milan,Bollettino dell'Istituto sieroterapico milanese,17720040R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Boll Ist Sieroter Milan. 1982 May;61(2):97-106.,,,,

No immune protection against TH was observed in mice that had been immunized with irradiated cells of the original TH tumor. These results confirm that tum- variants can elicit a syngeneic rejection response against tumors that are apparently devoid of transplantation immunogenicity.

Normal myeloid precursors are induced to multiply by one form (MGI-1) and to differentiate by another form (MGI-2). There are clones of myeloid leukemia cells that no longer require MGI-1 for growth but can still be induced to differentiate by MGI-2. After induction of differentiation in these leukemia cells by adding MCI-2 or inducing endogenous production of MGI-2 by lipopolysaccharide, the differentiating leukemia cells, like normal cells, again required MGI-1 for growth. This growth requirement for MGI-1 could not be substituted for by adding other protein growth factors such as epidermal, fibroblast, or nerve growth factor or insulin. Induction of differentiation in these leukemia cells by dexamethasone, arabinonucleoside (cytosine arabinoside), or methotrexate instead of by MGI-2, did not restore the requirement of MGI-1 for growth. Mutant myeloid leukemia cells that could not be induced to differentiate by MGI-2 also did not show this restoration of the requirement of MGI-1 for growth. MGI-1 in normal cells induced cell growth and also induced MGI-2, so that the cells could then differentiate by the endogenously produced MGI-2. However, MGI-1 did not induce production of MGI-2 in the leukemia cells, even though they again required MGI-1 for growth, so that there was no induction of differentiation after adding MGI-1. This lack of induction of differentiation-inducing protein by growth-inducing protein has thus identified an effective mechanism for uncoupling of growth and differentiation in malignant cells.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Rosette Formation']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.14.4347 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Jul;79(14):4347-51. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.14.4347.,,PMC346668,,

In Group I, two of three patients had significantly increased percentages of T gamma cells (mean +/- S.E.M. = 57 +/- 5 vs 18 +/- 2 for controls). There was defective in vitro appearance of T mu cells in both groups. In Group II, repeated studies of T cell subsets revealed persistently elevated T gamma cells despite various modes of oral chemotherapy. In three CLL patients who required splenectomy a dramatic decrease in the percentages of T gamma cells was noted post-splenectomy (51 +/- 3 to 15 +/- 3). In all cases the spleen was diffusely involved with CLL. These findings indicate: (1) abnormalities of T cell subsets are present early in CLL, (2) chemotherapy does not affect the levels of T gamma cells in stable patients and (3) removal of infiltrated CLL spleens results in a dramatic decrease in the proportion of T gamma cells. This latter finding plus the increase in T gamma cells in progressive disease post-splenectomy suggest T gamma cells may be an important determinant of the course of CLL.","['Kay, N E', 'Howe, R B', 'Douglas, S D']","['Kay NE', 'Howe RB', 'Douglas SD']",['eng'],['HL27068/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Rosette Formation', 'Splenectomy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(82)90096-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1982;6(3):345-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(82)90096-0.,,,,

An absent or reduced (less than 50) colony growth was observed in 21 of the 33 B-CLL and in four of the five B-PLL studied. Seven of the nine stage 0 patients (77.7%) according to Rai's clinical staging) gave rise to more than 50 colonies, compared with five out of 24 (20.9%) in stages I-IV patients. Furthermore, the mean number of colonies was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in stage 0 patients (57 +/- 33.6), compared with more advanced stages (22 +/- 29.9). Since in normal peripheral blood, T-colony formation appears to be a property of T mu lymphocytes, and T gamma cells are significantly increased in B-PLL and B-CLL, mainly in advanced disease, the T-colony growth was correlated with the percentage of T gamma cells. Despite a negative trend, a statistical correlation was not observed. Our findings are suggestive of a functional defect of the T-cell population in the majority of cases of B-CLL, with a partial sparing in stage 0 patients. This abnormality, apparently unrelated to the T mu: T gamma ratio, is probably due to an intrinsic defect of the T mu cell population.","['Foa, R', 'Lauria, F', 'Catovsky, D', 'Galton, D A']","['Foa R', 'Lauria F', 'Catovsky D', 'Galton DA']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*pathology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(82)90094-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1982;6(3):329-33. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(82)90094-7.,,,,

However, K-247 accelerated the turnover of phosphatidylinositol (PI) measured by [32P] incorporation into PI in L-1210 cells and Ml cells but not in normal lymphocytes. 45Ca2+ influx into normal lymphocytes and leukemic cells was also increased by K-247. A methyltransferase inhibitor, 5'-deoxy-5'-S-isobutyl adenosine (SIBA), suppressed both the increase of phospholipid methylation and that of Ca2+ influx.

Moreover, K-247 elevated the Con A response of murine thymocytes, most of which were immature T cells and had low reactivity to Con A, and caused a decrease of Thy 1.2 antigen on thymocytes.

To ascertain if these karyotypically abnormal cells and the leukemic cells had a common lineage, chromosome analyses were performed on bone marrow cells. Examination of the marrow cells on the seven occasions when leukemic cells were present in the marrow, including times when they were predominant, showed only a normal karyotype without the presence of t(14;14). However, an abnormal clone, which had the karyotype 45,XX,-9,t(9;6)(q12;q13), was identified in the marrow cells on the last examination during the terminal phase of the leukemia. Immunologically, the ALL was classified as an atypical type which had characteristics in common with certain T-cell subsets.

The potential usefulness of this enzyme in predicting the onset of relapse before any morphological indications has been demonstrated in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients in blast phase of the disease. In order to be able to detect low levels of TdT activity especially during remission phase, we have used cell separation techniques which can enrich cell populations containing TdT activity. A number of cell separation techniques have been developed to separate different cell types. We have used the techniques of unit gravity sedimentation and free flow electrophoresis to achieve enrichment of TdT positive cell populations. Our results show that up to 20 fold enrichment of TdT activity in normal human bone marrow can be accomplished by using cell separation techniques. With the use of free flow electrophoresis, we have achieved enrichment of TdT positive cell populations from normal human bone marrow, cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase of the disease. No TdT positive cells were detected in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. These cell separation techniques should prove to be useful in early detection of relapse in patients in remission.","['Sarin, P S', 'Virmani, M', 'Gallo, R C']","['Sarin PS', 'Virmani M', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/enzymology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4684-8929-3_28 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1982;145:337-56. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4684-8929-3_28.,,,,

In this study, the properties and rate of turnover of ADA are compared in cultured human T and B lymphoblast cell lines. (1) Relative to B lymphoblasts, the level of ADA activity in extracts of T lymphoblast cell lines (MOLT-4, RPMI-8402, CCRF-CEM and CCRF-HSB-2) is elevated 7- to 14-fold and differs by 2-fold among the T-cell lines. (2) In T and B lymphoblast extracts, the enzyme is apparently identical based on Km for adenosine and deoxyadenosine, Ki for inosine, Vmax for adenosine, S20w, isoelectric pH, and heat stability. Further, by radioimmunoassay the quantity of ADA immunoreactive protein is proportional to the level of enzyme activity in all cell lines studied. (3) Using a purification and selective immunoprecipitation technique, the enzyme turnover could be assessed in cell lines labeled with [35S]methionine. The apparent rate of ADA synthesis, relative to total protein, is 2-fold faster in both T cell lines (RPMI-8402 and CCRF-CEM) than in the B cell lines (MGL-8 and GM-130). The apparent half-life (t1/2) for the enzyme degradation is 19 and 39 hr, respectively, for CCRF-CEM and RPMI-8402, while the t1/2 for both B cell lines is 7-9 hr. From the net rate of synthesis and degradation, the T cell lines exhibit a 6- and 12-fold difference in ADA turnover relative to B cells, consistent with the observed differences in enzyme activity. (4) The level of ADA (activity and/or protein) in cultured T or B lymphoblasts is not influenced by either substrates or products of the ADA reaction or an ADA inhibitor or a selected group of immunosuppressive drugs added to these cells in culture. These studies indicate that while ADA is apparently identical in all T and B lymphoblasts, alterations in both the rate of ADA synthesis and degradation lead to its accumulation and high steady-state level in T cells.","['Daddona, P E', 'Kelley, W N']","['Daddona PE', 'Kelley WN']",['eng'],['CA26284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(82)90014-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1982;20:153-63. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(82)90014-0.,,,,

Nonetheless, it was shown that 80% of adults with histologically proved pneumocystis pneumonia who were treated with TMP-SMZ intravenously for at least four days or orally for at least nine days (total daily dose, 10-20 mg/kg) responded clinically and radiologically. Recipients of organ transplants and patients with lymphomas or lymphatic leukemia predominated in these studies. The median time to improvement was four days. TMP-SMZ therapy was continued for up to six days before a change to pentamidine was considered. Clinical failures of treatment were associated with delayed diagnosis and initiation of treatment, poor absorption of the orally administered drug, and concomitant life-threatening infections. Thus, a regimen involving initial intravenous therapy with doses of 15-20 mg/kg per day, with subsequent reduction of dosage or change to oral medication if improvement is rapid, was developed. With large initial intravenous doses, the monitoring of drug levels in the serum may not be necessary.

Adults given TMP-SMZ continuously had fewer readmissions for infection than did controls given TMP-SMZ only while hospitalized. TMP-SMZ used continuously in children with acute leukemia was effective in preventing bacterial and Pneumocystis carinii infections. For prophylaxis in granulocytopenic patients, TMP appeared equivalent to TMP-SMZ both in efficacy and incidence of side effects. However, TMP was less effective in suppressing gastrointestinal flora, including TMP-resistant gram-negative rods. Thus, TMP-SMZ has some role in preventing infections in high-risk patients, but further studies, especially comparisons with untreated patients may still be required.

Incubation of this cell line with LPS resulted in a decrease in the amount of membrane IgM, measured by both immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, and an increase in IgM secretion, measured by plaque-forming cells (PFC). Activation to high rate secretion was independent of cell cycle in synchronized cells and was independent of DNA synthesis because PFC formation was not inhibited by hydroxyurea. Almost all cells in the in vitro line were shown to contain large quantities of intracytoplasmic IgM before LPS activation. Thus, it would appear that the in vitro cell line represents a partially activated stage of differentiation compared to normal resting B cells or to the in vivo line of BCL1. Analysis of the two forms of mRNA coding for membrane and secreted IgM showed that, at least for cells at the level of differentiation examined here, the control of membrane IgM expression is post-transcriptional. The differentiation of resting B cells to the plasma cell level appears to consist of multiple stages of differentiation. The present data suggest that LPS provides at least two signals of activation. One induces the resting cell to synthesize cytoplasmic IgM, increase surface IgM, and to begin cell division. The second induces the secretion of intracytoplasmic IgM associated with a decrease in surface IgM.","['Lafrenz, D', 'Koretz, S', 'Stratte, P T', 'Ward, R B', 'Strober, S']","['Lafrenz D', 'Koretz S', 'Stratte PT', 'Ward RB', 'Strober S']",['eng'],"['AI 10293/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism']",1982/09/01 00:00,1982/09/01 00:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1982 Sep;129(3):1329-35.,,,,

This key functional membrane defect is more closely related to the neoplastic nature of CLL-cells than to their B-lymphocyte phenotype.","['Segel, G B', 'Lichtman, M A']","['Segel GB', 'Lichtman MA']",['eng'],['CA12970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Amino Acids, Cyclic)', '20448-79-7 (2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*metabolism', '*Amino Acids, Cyclic', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1982/08/25 00:00,1982/08/25 00:01,['1982/08/25 00:00'],"['1982/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)34059-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1982 Aug 25;257(16):9255-7.,,,,

Regression of MSV-induced tumors was not prevented by lead exposure and lead-treated animals were more resistant to late sarcoma development following primary tumor regression. The primary cell-mediated cytotoxic response in the spleen or lymph nodes of MSV-tumor bearing mice was significantly augmented by lead exposure. This augmentation appeared to reflect the increased antigenic stimulation resulting from the enhanced primary tumor growth in lead-exposed animals. Using an allogeneic tumor model, under conditions of similar antigenic stimulation, little effect of lead on T cell-mediated cytotoxicity was observed. On the other hand, macrophage phagocytic activity was significantly depressed in lead-exposed mice. Coupled with a decrease in the total number of macrophages recovered from lead-exposed mice, the results suggested significant impairment of macrophages function by lead. The influence of lead-induced macrophage dysfunction on tumor growth is discussed.","['Kerkvliet, N I', 'Baecher-Steppan, L']","['Kerkvliet NI', 'Baecher-Steppan L']",['eng'],['ESCA01612/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Immunopharmacology,Immunopharmacology,7902474,['2P299V784P (Lead)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Cellular/*drug effects', 'Lead/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/immunology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Sarcoma/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0162-3109(82)90003-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0162-3109(82)90003-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunopharmacology. 1982 Jun;4(3):213-24. doi: 10.1016/0162-3109(82)90003-0.,,,,

Extrapolated peak levels (i.e., following infusion of ara-A) ranged from 1.5 to 7.4 micrograms/ml (mean, 4.2 micrograms/ml). Elimination of drug appeared to follow a single-compartment model. In two patients who received ara-A without prior DCF and in a third patient who had significant residual ADA activity despite DCF, ara-A was unmeasurable within 5 min of the end of infusion. These data confirm that the kinetics of ara-A catabolism can be altered by inhibition of ADA and suggest that more than one dose of DCF may be necessary for complete inhibition of the enzyme and optimal pharmacological modulation of ara-A.","['Agarwal, R P', 'Blatt, J', 'Miser, J', 'Sallan, S', 'Lipton, J M', 'Reaman, G H', 'Holcenberg, J', 'Poplack, D G']","['Agarwal RP', 'Blatt J', 'Miser J', 'Sallan S', 'Lipton JM', 'Reaman GH', 'Holcenberg J', 'Poplack DG']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '7013-16-3 (hypoxanthine arabinoside)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arabinonucleosides/metabolism', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthines/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Pentostatin', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/*metabolism/therapeutic use']",1982/09/01 00:00,1982/09/01 00:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Sep;42(9):3884-6.,,,,

Incubation with dCF and AdR resulted in a significant rise of dATP concentrations in all groups (the highest rises occurring in the leukaemic groups particularly in AML and Thy-ALL). The concentrations of the other three deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates fell in all groups. The dATP level fell during the 'chase' period but in Thy-ALL and thymocytes this fall was insignificant and slower than in the other groups. This suggests that not only intracellular build-up of dATP but also the capacity of the cell to degrade dATP is important for in vivo cytotoxicity of dCF treatment.

However, biochemical understanding of the CTL-target interaction has made little progress. Recently, we have developed a monoclonal antibody (MAb) which blocks killing by binding to a previously undescribed molecule on the CTL membrane, a molecule which we therefore have termed lymphocyte function-associated antigen one (LFA-1). LFA-1 and Lyt-2,3 are the only presently identified sites for such blocking; antibodies to over a dozen other molecules expressed on the CTL do not block killing. Present evidence suggests that LFA-1 is crucial in the adhesive interaction of T cells with other cells (e.g., targets, macrophages, perhaps B cells) The continuing search for blocking MAbs provides a systematic way to link specific molecules with CTL function.","['Martz, E', 'Davignon, D', 'Kurzinger, K', 'Springer, T A']","['Martz E', 'Davignon D', 'Kurzinger K', 'Springer TA']",['eng'],"['CA-14723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31798/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Lyt antibodies)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4684-8959-0_27 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1982;146:447-68. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4684-8959-0_27.,,,,

C57BL/6 mice were immunized to syngeneic FBL-3 lymphoma by two ip injections of irradiated FBL-3 lymphoma cells. Splenocytes from these animals were injected into mice with disseminated lethal FBL-3 tumor. The injection of cyclophosphamide (Cy) plus immunized lymphocytes significantly improved survival with cure of 53% of 38 animals.

Although in vivo and in vitro sensitized lymphocytes exhibited no cytotoxicity toward fresh FBL-3 tumor cells in an 18-hour 51Cr release assay, expansion of appropriately sensitized cells in LF-TCGF resulted in significant lysis of fresh FBL-3 tumor cells. This significant lysis was specific and lysed syngeneic FBL-3 but not syngeneic MCA-103 fresh tumor targets. This maximal specific cytotoxicity was maintained for 2.5 months. A screening assay was developed that permitted rapid identification and isolation of low-frequency cytotoxic clones with reactivity specific for FBL-3 tumor.

These cytotoxic lines and clones will be of value for the study of tumor-host immunologic interactions and perhaps for use in adoptive immunotherapy.","['Eberlein, T J', 'Rosenstein, M', 'Spiess, P J', 'Rosenberg, S A']","['Eberlein TJ', 'Rosenstein M', 'Spiess PJ', 'Rosenberg SA']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1982 Jul;69(1):109-16.,,,,

Two complement-dependent assays (C1q fluid phase and Raji) and a complement-independent assay (L1210) were employed. The 3 assays generally revealed similar patterns of reactivity when control and pathological groups were compared, with the L1210 assay invariably demonstrating the lowest incidence of positive values in each group. The most significant elevations in IC levels were exhibited in bronchiectasis and bronchogenic carcinoma. However, within these two groups correlations between IC assays performed on individual sera were poor. Significant but weak correlations (p less than 0.01) were only observed for C1q vs Raji in bronchiectasis and C1q vs L1210 in bronchogenic carcinoma. Complement-binding ICs were present to a similar extent in both conditions. However, non-complement binding ICs were found to be more common in bronchiectasis. The relative sensitivity of the tests and the contribution of interfering factors to the disparity between the assays is discussed. However, the interpretation favoured is that the lack of correlation is primarily a reflection of the intrinsic heterogeneity of immune complexes formed under similar and dissimilar pathological conditions.","['Cooper, K M', 'Moore, M']","['Cooper KM', 'Moore M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Scotland,J Clin Lab Immunol,Journal of clinical & laboratory immunology,7808987,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Heterophile)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '80295-33-6 (Complement C1q)', 'EC 3.- (Complement Activating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/*analysis', '*Antigens, Heterophile', 'Bronchiectasis/immunology', 'Carcinoma, Bronchogenic/immunology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complement Activating Enzymes/metabolism', 'Complement C1q', 'Complement Fixation Tests', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Lung Diseases/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Preservation, Biological', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/immunology']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Clin Lab Immunol. 1982 Apr;7(3):155-61.,,,,

In this study, ALL cells that do not express the B1 antigen were studied in an attempt to further elucidate the cellular lineage of these tumors. Non-T cell ALL lines and tumor cells isolated from patients with non-T cell ALL that are Ia + CALLA + B1- were studied in vitro with a variety of agents known to promote cellular differentiation. Phorbol diester (TPA) or phytohemagglutinin conditioned leukocyte culture media were capable of inducing the expression of B1 on all four non-T cell ALL lines tested. In contrast, B1 could not be induced under the identical conditions on a promyelocytic leukemia line or a T cell lymphoblastic leukemia line. With the induction of B1 on non-T cell ALL lines, cytoplasmic mu-heavy chain (c mu) became undetectable, whereas the expression of CALLA and Ia were unchanged. The expression of B1 was accompanied by a decrease of cellular proliferation and DNA synthesis, but not significant morphologic changes were noted. In addition, no other B or T cell antigens were detected. The cellular origin of non-T cell ALL was further investigated using tumor cells isolated from leukemic patients. Tumor cells from eight patients with Ia + CALLA + B1-c mu- ALL could be induced in vitro with TPA to express both B1 and c mu. In contrast, cells from five patients with Ia + CALLA-B1-c mu- non-T cell ALL could not be induced with TPA to express CALLA, B1 or c mu. These studies suggest that the non-T cell ALL are heterogeneous and represent a spectrum of early B cell differentiation including the pre- pre-B cell (Ia + CALLA + B1-c mu-), the intermediate pre-B cell (Ia + CALLA +B1 + c mu-), and finally the ""true"" pre-B cell (Ia + CALLA + B1 + c mu+).

In a search for a convenient alternative source of biologically active human IL2, cells from the five established T cell lines, MOLT4, HSB2, CCRF-CEM, RPMI1301 and JURKAT were cultured at high concentrations for 18-36 h (induction cultures), and their cell-free supernatants thereafter screened on IL2-dependent cultured human and mouse T cells. MOLT4, HSB2, RPMI1301, and CCRF-CEM all failed to produce detectable levels of IL2. Of the three JURKAT cell lines obtained from different sources, one, designated JMN, produced high levels of IL2 activity. A second, JM, failed to produce any IL2, while the third, JHAN, produced intermediate levels. Stimulation of the IL2-producing JMN or JHAN variants with PHA, the phorbol diester 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or both PHA and TPA together, resulted in an apparent increase of IL2 activity in the culture supernatant when assayed by a short-term tritiated thymidine incorporation test. However, both PHA and TPA added directly to the test cells caused substantial thymidine incorporation. Moreover, the nonproducer line JURKAT-JM could not be converted to an IL2 producer by stimulation with PHA, TPA, or both. When JMN supernatants were used to support actual long-term growth and cloning of T cells in limiting dilution, the constitutively produced IL2 was superior to that produced after PHA and/or TPA stimulation. Addition of TPA, but not of PHA, to lectin and TPA-free JMN IL2 resulted in a decreased ability of such supernatants to support clonal T cell growth, suggesting that TPA had a growth-inhibiting effect. These results show that the continuously growing JURKAT-JMN cell line could provide a suitable source of mitogen-free human IL2.","['Pawelec, G', 'Borowitz, A', 'Krammer, P H', 'Wernet, P']","['Pawelec G', 'Borowitz A', 'Krammer PH', 'Wernet P']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830120506 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1982 May;12(5):387-92. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830120506.,,,,

A ""myeloid"" zymogram was found with AMML cells, which closely matched control monocyte and granulocyte zymograms. On the other hand, nonspecific esterase of ALL showed a striking departure from the zymogram pattern of control B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. An intense reactivity with a very low isoelectric point accounted for most of the ALL nonspecific esterase activity. No corresponding reactivity or relatively small amounts thereof were seen in other zymograms. Conversely, few of the isoenzymes that were prominent in zymograms of control lymphocytes were apparent above trace levels in ALL zymograms. Thus, zymogram analysis of nonspecific esterases clearly differentiated the myeloid leukemia from the lymphoid leukemia and provided a potential marker for each. The AMML cells appeared well enough differentiated with respect to nonspecific esterases as to be similar to mature cells of like lineage.

These mu, gamma, and alpha-positive cells had the convoluted nucleus and narrow cytoplasm characteristic of normal mu+ pre-B cells. Sequential isotype switching among this unusual pre-B population was indicated by co-expression of mu-chains and alpha-chains by 11% and 63%, respectively, of the gamma pre-B cells. These pre-B cells and the surface alpha-chains and cytoplasmic gamma-chains of the leukemic B cells were reactive with one of four monoclonal anti-VH antibodies. The data suggest malignant transformation of the clone before isotype switching, and also imply light chain precommitment at the pre-B cell level of differentiation.","['Mayumi, M', 'Kubagawa, H', 'Omura, G A', 'Gathings, W E', 'Kearney, J F', 'Cooper, M D']","['Mayumi M', 'Kubagawa H', 'Omura GA', 'Gathings WE', 'Kearney JF', 'Cooper MD']",['eng'],"['R01 AI014782/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 03013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin A/biosynthesis/classification', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1982 Aug;129(2):904-10.,,,,

This suggests that the response is due primarily to residual normal cells in the circulation. In support of this postulate, dilution of normal cells reproduced the effect and also induced a delayed response to PHA, which is found frequently with CLL lymphocytes. A combination of autoradiography and immunofluorescence microscopy identified both B and T cells in the responding population in similar proportions from both normal and CLL donors.

Patients in Stages M3 or M4 with FAB types M1 or M2 formed aggregates with a high proportion of myelocytic cells; aggregates of all other AML patients were composed predominantly of macrophages and plasmacytes. Aggregates appeared to form as a result of attraction of cells in the medium toward the stroma cell core.

Since the discovery of T-cell growth factor (TCGF), systems are now available for the long-term specific in vitro propagation of mature normal or neoplastic human T cells, providing an opportunity to study the influence of T cells on hematopoiesis. Recently, 24 cell lines from patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) were grown with TCGF and then assessed for release of humoral factors that affect hematopoiesis. Conditioned media (CM) from these cell lines were tested for erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA) and granulocyte colony-stimulating activity (CSA). BPA was detected in CM from 3/6 cultures of T-ALL patients and 4/6 CTCL cultures. CSA was found in the CM from 6/8 cultures of T-ALL patients, 7/12 CTCL cultures, and 3/4 CTCL cell lines that become independent of exogenous TCGF for growth. The CSA from several of the neoplastic T-cell cultures stimulated high levels of eosinophil colonies, a possible source of the eosinophilia seen in these patients. The ability of continuously proliferating human T lymphocytes, which retain functional specificity and responsiveness to normal humoral regulation, to produce factors that directly or indirectly stimulate myeloid and erythroid colony formation lends further credence to the role of T lymphocytes in regulating hematopoiesis.","['Tarella, C', 'Ruscetti, F W', 'Poiesz, B J', 'Woods, A', 'Gallo, R C']","['Tarella C', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Poiesz BJ', 'Woods A', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/biosynthesis', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76051-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1982 Jun;59(6):1330-6.,,,,

Clones that could be induced to differentiate by this protein showed a higher basal phospholipase A2 activity than clones that could not be induced to differentiate by this protein inducer. Cell competence to be induced to differentiate by TPA did not show this correlation, and the clone with the least ability to respond to TPA showed the lowest number of binding sites for [20-3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Differentiation induced by the protein was accompanied by a 7-14-fold increase in prostaglandin E synthesis, whereas differentiation induced by TPA did not show this increase. Externally added prostaglandin E1 did not induce differentiation but inhibited cell proliferation and the degree of inhibition in the different clones was related to the basal phospholipase A2 activity. The results indicate that increase of prostaglandin E synthesis was not an essential pre-requisite for differentiation, that prostaglandin E seems to be involved in the inhibition of cell proliferation in association with phospholipase A2, and that the differentiation-inducing protein and TPA can induce differentiation by different pathways. The amount of basal phospholipase A2 activity was also related to previously found differences in the ability of the clones to develop desensitization to beta-adrenergic hormones or prostaglandin E1.","['Simantov, R', 'Sachs, L']","['Simantov R', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Prostaglandins E/*biosynthesis']",1982/04/29 00:00,1982/04/29 00:01,['1982/04/29 00:00'],"['1982/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(82)90001-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(82)90001-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1982 Apr 29;720(2):111-9. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(82)90001-5.,,,,

The biosynthesis of both complex and high-mannose-type oligosaccharides was monitored by metabolic labelling with [6-3]fucose and [2-3H]mannose. Bio-Gel P6 elution profiles of [6-3H]fucose-labelled glycopeptides showed that quiescent thymocytes and stimulated thymocytes synthesized qualitatively and quantitatively similar glycopeptides; however, higher-molecular-weight glycopeptides were synthesized by the acute-leukaemic lymphoblasts. The amount of [2(-3)H]mannose incorporated into glycopeptide by quiescent thymocytes was less than 10% of that incorporated by stimulated thymocytes. The Bio-Gel P6 elution profile of [2(-3)H]mannose-labelled glycopeptides from acute leukaemic lymphoblasts was qualitatively similar to that of stimulated thymocytes, with about 40% of the radioactivity incorporated into one glycopeptide peak. This glycopeptide was characterized by Bio-Gel P6 and concanavalin A affinity chromatography, radioactive-sugar analysis, sensitivity to alpha-mannosidase and endoglycosidase H and resistance to beta-glucosaminidase as containing a high-mannose oligosaccharide, possible of Man7-8GlcNAc2 structure. Pulse/chase experiments indicated that this high-mannose oligosaccharide was an end product and not a biosynthetic intermediate. It is concluded that higher-molecular-weight fucose-labelled glycopeptides are characteristic of the malignant cell type, and the synthesis of high-mannose oligosaccharide, Man7-8GlcNAc2, in stimulated thymocytes and acute-leukaemic lymphoblasts is associated with mitotically active cells.","['Rupar, C A', 'Cook, G M']","['Rupar CA', 'Cook GM']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '28RYY2IV3F (Fucose)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Fucose/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mannose/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Oligosaccharides/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tritium']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2010377 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1982 Feb 1;201(2):377-85. doi: 10.1042/bj2010377.,,PMC1163654,,

Twenty T-cell neoplasms were investigated for reactivity with the OKT hybridoma monoclonal antibodies and expression of acid alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE), beta-glucuronidase (BG), and acid phosphatase (AP) activity. Twelve cases (Mycosis fungoides, Sezary syndrome, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) were OKT3'T4', ie, expressed the phenotype commonly associated with mature T-helper cells. These cases were further divisible into ANAE+BG+ (6 cases), ANAE-BG+ (5 cases), and ANAE-BG- (1 case) phenotypes. In contrast to the 12 OKT3+T4+ cases, the remaining 8 cases showed considerable inter- and intratumor heterogeneity with respect to reactivity with the OKT antibodies. Six of these cases (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoblastic lymphoma) expressed phenotypes consistent with various intrathymic stages of T-cell differentiation. Five of the latter 6 cases were AP+BG+ANAE-, analogous to the majority of normal cortical thymocytes; an OKT3+T4-T8+T10+ neoplasm was ANAE+, analogous to normal medullary thymocytes. Two cases expressed the previously undescribed OKT3+T4-T8-T10+ phenotype. These studies demonstrate that the T-cell malignancies are divisible into phenotypes which correspond to normal maturational stages of T-cell differentiation and functionally distinct T-cell subsets.

Results suggest that X-rays can affect differentiation in two different ways. First, X-rays inactivate the ability of these cells to respond to an external trigger of differentiation, e.g., dimethyl sulphoxide. Second, X-rays themselves trigger a partial differentiation response, in the absence of any other external trigger. The radiation-induced lesions leading to these two end-points are not repaired in split-dose experiments, unlike those lesions which lead to loss of cell proliferative capacity. The profile of soluble FELC proteins, as analysed by isoelectric focusing, was also affected by irradiation.

On the basis of enzyme markers, it was possible to assign each of the cell lines examined to one of nine different groups. With two exceptions, surface antigen phenotypes for each of 12 cell lines were clearly distinctive. Thus, some groups of cell lines indistinguishable by enzyme markers could be further subdivided by surface antigen phenotyping. However, significant quantitative variation in expression of individual antigens was observed. In addition, surface antigen expression was not uniform in different subcultures of one cell line studied in detail.

The relative amounts of these two molecules, as isolated from surface iodinated cells, varied from the RBL cell line to the other and their apparent molecular weights were not identical on all cell lines. Since comparisons were made on the same gel using receptors isolated from cells labelled with different isotopes of iodine, differences in molecular weight must be considered as being intrinsic and not due to methodological variations. These results provide an explanation why differences were observed among receptors for IgE as characterized in various laboratories.

This substance has been named immature B-cell lectin (IBL). The specificity of IBL was further demonstrated by fluorescence labelling, absorption and latex rosetting. IBL does not bind to pronase-treated M (pro M), indicating that it has the specificity of R1 as distinct from R2 which binds to a pronase-resistant ligand on M. Other evidence that IBL is associated with B-cell membrane receptors for mouse erythrocytes is as follows: (1) The amount of IBL released into the supernatant correlated with the trypsin sensitivity of M rosetting with different clones of BM+ CLL cells. (2) Only small amounts of IBL were released from non-rosetting cells (T cells and mature B cells). (3) Binding properties of IBL were inhibited by extract of M but not extract from ox erythrocytes. (4) High-titre solutions of IBL conferred the capacity to form M rosettes on certain types of non-rosetting B cells. IBL has a dual binding specificity. Its binding to M is inhibited by fetuin and mannan, while its binding to B cells is not inhibited by these substances. The relationship of IBL to other membrane lectins including fibronectin is discussed.

Three of these, possessing the phenotypes BM+ pro M+, BM- pro M+ or BM- pro M-, constitute 17%, 61% and 22% of normal blood B cells respectively. The fourth subset, BM+ pro M-, does not occur in normal tissues but was found in the pre-B-cell line of Raji cells, indicating that this phenotype may be a marker for early B cells. Some differences in the proportion of each subset were found in cord blood, lymph nodes and tonsils. Surface-immunoglobulin-positive (SIg+) and -negative (SIg-) non-T cells were present in each subset. M and pro-M rosetting tests were applied to cells from blood of 27 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and to cells from involved nodes, spleen or marrow in five cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In 15 cases of CLL, there was considerable increase in the BM+ pro M+ subset (BM+ pro M+ type CLL); in seven cases, there was a predominance of BM- pro M+ cells and in another four cases, BM- pro M- cells predominated. All five cases of NHL were greatly enriched in BM- pro M- cells. There was no obvious correlation between rosetting and other surface markers but BM- pro M- clones in CLL or NHL always stained brightly with FITC-anti-Ig. This was not found in BM+ pro M+ or BM- pro M+ clones. Rosette formation of neuraminidase-treated B cells with M identifies the same subset as B-pro-M rosetting in normals and CLL. Evidence is presented that two types of receptors are involved in M and pro-M rosetting, designated R1 and R2, binding to corresponding M ligands L1 and L2. M rosetting is due to R1-L1 binding while R2-L2 binding mediates B-pro-M rosetting. Shifts between subsets within the same clone in some cases of CLL suggest that the subsets are distinct maturational stage of B-cell development rather than families of B cells of different lineage. The following B-cell maturation sequence is proposed: R1+ R2- lead to R1+ R2+ leads to R1- R2+ leads to R1- R2-.","['Forbes, I J', 'Zalewski, P D', 'Valente, L', 'Gee, D']","['Forbes IJ', 'Zalewski PD', 'Valente L', 'Gee D']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dogs', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*immunology', 'Rosette Formation', 'Species Specificity']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1982 Feb;47(2):396-404.,,PMC1536537,,

The mean percentage of MRFC in B-CLL was 54.8% +/- 24.4%, in nodular centro-follicular NHL 2.3% +/- 3%, in hairy cell leukaemia 14.6% +/-14.7% and among the controls 3.2% +/- 1.9%. Thus, MRFC appear to be an excellent marker of B-CLL and sometimes the only B cell marker as in 11 cases of SIg negative CLL. There is no correlation between the percentage of MRFC and clinical staging according to Rai classification whereas patients with stage 2 in Binet's classification (isolated splenomegaly) have a significantly lower MRFC percentage (23.4% +/- 27.7%; P less than 0.05). There is no correlation with prognosis, nor with serum Ig levels. We found no correlation with surface phenotype IgM, IgM-IgD or IgG. Thus, this study does not confirm the hypothesis that MRFC might characterize and immature stage in the B lymphocyte differentiation. However, these results are consistent with another hypothesis which states that lymphocytes in CLL possibly originate from a clonal expansion of a normal B lymphocyte subset, characterized by a low concentration of SIg and a receptor for mouse erythrocytes.","['Kuhlein, E', 'Laurent, G', 'Rigal, F', 'Delsol, G', 'Pris, J', 'Ducos, J']","['Kuhlein E', 'Laurent G', 'Rigal F', 'Delsol G', 'Pris J', 'Ducos J']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', '*Rosette Formation']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1982 Feb;47(2):389-95.,,PMC1536522,,

Protein synthetic patterns were analyzed visually and with the GELLAB system for computer analysis of two-dimensional gel images. Qualitative and quantitative differences were found between the T- and B-cell patterns. GELLAB detected and accurately paired most of the well-defined spots in each image and constructed a unified data base from data on our initial gels. Statistical analysis of this data revealed several marker proteins, the relative synthetic rates serving to distinguish the T-cell line from the B-cell line.

Two preparations of MSV were used; one which gives rise to tumors which uniformly regress in normal adult mice, and another which elicits progressively growing tumors in the majority of recipients. The tumor incidence, mean tumor size, and tempo of regression were not modified by treatment with anti-IgM. However, whereas tumors induced by the regressor virus were all rejected in 19 NRG-treated and 29 untreated recipients, continued growth was obtained in 2 of 23 B-lymphocyte-deprived mice. Furthermore, in 9 additional mice from this group, apparent rejection was followed by tumor recurrence at the site of the initial tumor. Continued growth was accompanied by widespread metastasis. These tumors were freely transplantable to normal syngeneic recipients. Metastasis and transplantability were also detected in 7 of 24 anti-IgM-treated mice given progressor virus, but were not seen in the control animals. Recurrence and metastasis was obtained despite the presence of high levels of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the spleen. It is concluded that B lymphocytes or their products play an essential role in host protection against MSV-induced tumors.","['Gordon, J', 'Holden, H T', 'Segal, S', 'Feldman, M']","['Gordon J', 'Holden HT', 'Segal S', 'Feldman M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology/pathology']",1982/03/15 00:00,1982/03/15 00:01,['1982/03/15 00:00'],"['1982/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910290320 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1982 Mar 15;29(3):351-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910290320.,,,,

After 10 months of feeding, the cells became resistant to 10(-7) M MTX; resistance was not reversed when the cells were placed in the original MTX-free medium. At 10(-7) M MTX, the concentration which produced complete inhibition of the parent MOLT-3 cell growth, the resistant cells were not inhibited at all. On a 50% inhibitory concentration basis, the resistant cells were approximately 30-fold more resistant to MTX. The parent MOLT-3 and the resistant line had the same doubling time of approximately 36 hr. There were no differences in light microscopic morphology. MOLT-3 produced loose colonies on 0.5% agar enriched with fetal bovine serum, whereas the colonies of the resistant line were tightly packed. The development of resistance was accompanied by a 4- to 5-fold decrease in [3H]MTX transport (MOLT-3/MTXt). Kinetic analysis of MTX uptake showed that the resistant subline did not have an altered Km for MTX (6.6 microM) but had a decreased Vmax of about 20% of the parent cell line. These data suggest that either the number of folate transport sites or the turnover rate of these sites has been reduced in the MTX-resistant cell line. Dihydrofolate reductase was only minimally elevated in the resistant cell line. The MTX-resistant cell line was cross-resistant to dichloromethotrexate. The sensitivity of the resistant line to the substituted 2,4-diaminoquinazoline and pyrimidine compounds, 2,4-diamino-5-methyl-6-[(3',4',5'-trimethoxyanilino) methyl] quinazoline (JB-11) and 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)-6-methylpyrimidine, increased more than 3-fold.

As effectors the following tumor cells transplanted in syngeneic mice were used: EL-4 (H-2b), MX-II (H2b), L-1210 (H2d), SA-1 (H2a). As target cells, the splenocytes from the following mice were used: B10/Sn, C57BL/6, B10.A (3R), B10.A (5R), B10.D2, B10.SM, CBA, B10. D2 (R 101), B10.D2 (R 107). It was shown that noncoincidence of the effectors and targets as regards the genetic basis, K, IA, IB, IJ, IE and D-subregions does not lower the maximal membranotoxicity inherent in the entire syngeneic system. Noncoincidence of the effectors and targets as regards the D-terminal of H-2 complex reduces more than 2-fold the effect of tumor cells on splenocytes. Thus, the coincidence of the effectors and targets only as regards the IC-subregion of H-2 complex is enough for attainment of the maximal membranotoxicity of tumor cell as regards splenocytes. It is discussed whether the injury to the target membrane (membrane toxicity) recorded in the research under consideration should be considered as cytotoxic (the target death) or as cytostatic. It is suggested that the phenomenon studied may underlie the immunosuppression due to tumor cells.","['Sterlina, A G', 'Nikonenko, B V', 'Fuks, B B']","['Sterlina AG', 'Nikonenko BV', 'Fuks BB']",['rus'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Biull Eksp Biol Med,Biulleten' eksperimental'noi biologii i meditsiny,0370627,,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/genetics/*immunology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biull Eksp Biol Med. 1982 Jan;93(1):52-5.,,,Membranotoksichnost' opukholevykh kletok po otnosheniiu k limfotsitam.

In addition, leukaemic blasts of all patients were investigated according to morphological and cytochemical criteria. In APh and ANAE, indices and the percentages of cases showing a granular staining pattern were high in pre-T- and in T-ALL, but low in C/T- and in C-ALL. PAS-staining, conversely, was more pronounced in C/T- and C-ALL. APh proved to be more discriminative for recognition of the T- and pre-T-ALL subgroups than ANAE, but ANAE-cytochemistry may be useful to detect contaminating normal T-lymphocytes in ALL.

Also associated with the viremia is the development of a chronic cellular immune response detectable in vitro by the ability of viral proteins to induce splenic lymphocyte proliferation. Previous studies have demonstrated that, in the absence of this cellular immune response, leukemia does not develop irrespective of whether viremia is present [Lee, J. C. & Ihle, J. N. (1981) Nature (London) 289, 407-409]. In vitro proliferative responses to antigens involve the nonspecific response of various subpopulations of lymphocytes to lymphokines produced by antigen-specific Thy 1+, Lyt 1+,2- lymphocytes. The studies presented here concern the effects of a chronic immune response in viremic mice on the frequency of lymphocytes capable of responding to lymphokines in vitro. The data demonstrate that the number of responsive lymphocytes is increased 30- to 100-fold in preleukemic mice and that such increases are dependent upon the induction of an immune response in viremic mice. The role of this altered immune response in leukemia is discussed.","['Lee, J C', 'Ihle, J N']","['Lee JC', 'Ihle JN']",['eng'],['N01-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*immunology', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Preleukemia/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.12.7712 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Dec;78(12):7712-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.12.7712.,,PMC349340,,

Simultaneous blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were assayed for DCF levels at times ranging from 10 minutes to 6 hours after the drug was given. Average peak CSF drug levels of 5.5 X 10(-8) M and 3 X 10(-7) M were reached 1 1/2 - 2 hours following injections of 0.25 and 1.0 mg DCF/kg, respectively. The ratio of peak CSF to simultaneous plasma levels was 1 to 10. Data obtained from a patient who had acute lymphocytic leukemia and who was given iv DCF were comparable. Drug levels achieved within the CSF following iv administration of 0.25 mg DCF/kg are similar to those previously demonstrated to inhibit ADA.

Such long-term cultured T lymphocytes have previously been shown to specifically lyse FBL-3 and to mediate specific adoptive therapy of advanced disseminated FBL-3 when used as an adjunct to cyclophosphamide (CY) in adoptive chemoimmunotherapy. Because the cultured cells are dependent upon IL-2 for proliferation and survival in vitro, their efficacy in vivo is potentially limited by the availability of endogenous IL-2. Thus, the aim of the current study was to determine whether exogenously administered purified IL-2 could augment the in vivo efficacy of long-term cultured T lymphocytes. Purified IL-2 alone or as an adjunct to CY as ineffective in tumor therapy. However, IL-2 was extremely effective in augmenting the efficacy of IL-2-dependent long-term cultured T lymphocytes in adoptive chemoimmunotherapy. The mechanism by which IL-2 functions in vivo is presumably by promoting in vivo growth and/or survival of adoptively transferred cells. This assumption was supported by the findings that IL-2 did not enhance the modest therapeutic efficacy of irradiated long-term cultured cells that were incapable of proliferating in the host and was ineffective in augmenting the in vivo efficacy of noncultured immune cells that are not immediately dependent upon exogenous IL-2 for survival.","['Cheever, M A', 'Greenberg, P D', 'Fefer, A', 'Gillis, S']","['Cheever MA', 'Greenberg PD', 'Fefer A', 'Gillis S']",['eng'],"['CA 10777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.155.4.968 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1982 Apr 1;155(4):968-80. doi: 10.1084/jem.155.4.968.,,PMC2186656,,

Upon metastasis of a cloned ESb tumor line from an s.c. site to the spleen, the tumor cells which were originally sensitive to lysis by anti-ESb CTL became specifically immunoresistant. The development of immunoresistant variants after tumor-cell transplantation followed a refined kinetic and organ pattern: they were first detected in the spleen, then also in the liver and in the late stage of tumor progression they were the predominant tumor type in all involved organs. No immunoresistant tumor variants were generated in immunoincompetent animals such as nude (nu/nu) mice. Immunoresistant variants also developed when immunosensitive ESb clones were inoculated into animals specifically preimmunized against ESb. In fact, these variants were the only type of cells eventually growing out from such animals causing death from metastasis in spite of the specific immune status of the host. The change of tumor antigen expression described here differs from antibody-induced antigenic modulation in that it is genetically transmitted and stable in tissue culture. The immunoresistant tumor variants which did not preexist in the starting, twice-cloned cell population represent a new type of immune escape variant.","['Bosslet, K', 'Schirrmacher, V']","['Bosslet K', 'Schirrmacher V']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia L5178/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1982/02/15 00:00,1982/02/15 00:01,['1982/02/15 00:00'],"['1982/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910290214 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1982 Feb 15;29(2):195-202. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910290214.,,,,

The present results indicate that MGI-2 can also induce differentiation (without inducing colony formation) in the normal cells, and that MGI-l induced MIG-2 in the normal but not in the leukemic cells.

Seven cell lines underwent multiple phenotypic alterations in response to TPA but were unresponsive to synthetic thymic hormones (TP5, FTS) or to other compounds (e.g. DMSO, retinoic acid) which induce maturation in other types of leukaemia. The changes parallel those observed in normal T-cell differentiation and partly reflect alterations in glycosyl transferase activity, altered synthesis of proteins and regulation of cell surface receptors (for transferrin) associated with rapid growth and metabolism. These studies further illustrate the reversibility of maturation arrest in human leukaemia and provide support for the view that leukaemia may involve regulatory defects in the coupling of proliferation and maturation. Induction of promotion of terminal differentiation in leukaemic equivalents of T-cell precursors may provide a convenient system for the study of biochemical and molecular events involved in T-cell development and diversification.","['Delia, D', 'Greaves, M F', 'Newman, R A', 'Sutherland, D R', 'Minowada, J', 'Kung, P', 'Goldstein, G']","['Delia D', 'Greaves MF', 'Newman RA', 'Sutherland DR', 'Minowada J', 'Kung P', 'Goldstein G']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",1982/01/15 00:00,1982/01/15 00:01,['1982/01/15 00:00'],"['1982/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910290106 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1982 Jan 15;29(1):23-31. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910290106.,,,,

Viable tumour and normal cells exerted a rapid, continuous and temperature-dependent destruction of antibody activity.

Tumour cells digested antibody more effectively than did normal lymphocytes. This observed degradation of antibody was most extensive at 37 degrees, significantly less at room temperature (23 degrees) and not detectable at 0 degrees. Undegraded antibody released from antibody-coated cells had also lost its antibody activity to a considerable extent. This was due to the formation of soluble antigen-antibody complexes, which was observed even at 0 degrees. Cells fixed with 10% formalin bound maximum amounts of antibody were incapable of digesting antibody even at 37 degrees and did not release immune complexes. These findings are of relevance to cancer immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy.","['Froese, G', 'Berczi, I', 'Israels, L G']","['Froese G', 'Berczi I', 'Israels LG']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1982 Feb;45(2):313-23.,,PMC1555266,,

In contrast, other monoclonal anti-T reagents tested (OKT1, OKT3, OKT4, OKT6, OKT8, OKT9, OKT10) did not block E rosette formation. E rosette formation and OKT11 bindings are coincident on T-ALL cell lines and both are trypsin-sensitive. In a series of 145 leukemias and 26 leukemic cell lines investigated, only leukemias with a T cell phenotype including E rosette positivity were reactive with OKT11 and OKT11A. OKT11A binds to a polypeptide of approximately 50 000 molecular weight on thymic lymphocytes. This structure may carry the recognition site for sheep erythrocytes.

T cells synthesize and insert into their plasma membrane 225-MICG, null cells 185-MICG, and B cells both 225 and 185-MICG. In contrast, the monoclonal B cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are characterized by the presence of 225-MICG and the absence of 185-MICG. We have recently found it possible to chemically deplete 185-MICG from viable normal B cells by treating them with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), thus making normal B cells phenotypically resemble leukemic cells. In the present report we determined whether certain peculiar properties of these leukemic cells would be associated with the normal B cells chemically depleted of 185-MICG. In normal B cells, SIg diffuses in the lipid bilayer to form clusters and caps under appropriate conditions, while in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells this does not occur. Normal B cells depleted of 185-MICG fail to undergo capping of SIg or surface MICG under appropriate conditions. Both DFP-treated B cells and CLL cells tend to rupture when smeared on a glass slide. Both CLL cells and DFP-treated B cells fail to secrete 225-MICG after it has been synthesized intracellularly. The relationship of these findings to the mechanisms of secretion and capping are discussed.","['Simmonds, M A', 'Sobczak, G', 'Hauptman, S P']","['Simmonds MA', 'Sobczak G', 'Hauptman SP']",['eng'],"['AM 07084/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26 369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '12UHW9R67N (Isoflurophate)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Fibronectins/*deficiency/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Capping', 'Isoflurophate/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)66051-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1982 Mar;59(3):555-62.,,,,

Eight children (7%) had non-T, non-B tumors, 4 of whom presented at a young age with cutaneous lymphoblastic tumors. These results demonstrate that the great majority of children with NHL, not leukemic at diagnosis, have tumors clearly committed to either T- or B-cell differentiation pathways and only rarely exhibit the common ALL phenotype (cALLa+, Ia+, E-, T-, SIg-), contrasting with the distribution of childhood lymphoblastic leukemias.

Refeeding with lymphotoxin-free medium is followed by resumption of 104C1 but not alpha L929 cell growth. This suggests that growth inhibition of alpha L929 is primarily due to cytolytic mechanisms, while that of 104C1 cells is due to cytostatic mechanisms. This is confirmed by radionuclide (3H, 51Cr, and 75Se) release assays with LD 50's of 1.0, 1.9, and 2.4 units lymphotoxin/ml, respectively, for alpha L929 cells, whereas as many as 100 units lymphotoxin/ml produce no radionuclide release from 104C1 cells. The L cell variant L929M is 10-fold more resistant to lymphotoxin colony inhibitory activity and 40-300-fold more resistant to cytolytic lymphotoxin activity as measured by the three radionuclide release assays than are alpha L929 cells. L929 and 2071 L cell variants are more resistant as a result of smaller cytolytic and cytostatic responses and some tumor cells, such as one strain of L1210 mouse leukemia cells, exhibit no detectable cytolytic or cytostatic responses to 100 units of guinea pig lymphotoxin.

It is known that filariasis affects lymphatic vessels and results in several lymphoreticular ailments, and microfilaria is transmitted by mosquitoes infected with some kinds of not yet fully identified viruses. From analyses of the time trends of the average weight and height of school children by prefecture, it is suggested that the nutritional condition of inhabitants in Kyushu might have been poorer than that of inhabitants of other areas in Japan, especially in the past. In order to elucidate the etiology of ATLL, relevant geographic-pathological information and other related information was accumulated and an etiological hypothesis was formulated.

Detailed studies were carried out using an EPA produced by a human T-lymphoblast line (Mo). Although EPA has not been purified to homogeneity, several observations indicate that the factor elaborated by Mo cells that stimulates erythroleukemia cell growth is the EPA molecule. The erythroleukemia growth factor cofractionates with EPA using gel exclusion chromatography, isoelectric focusing, and ion exchange chromatography. In addition, the activities exhibit similar kinetics of heat inactivation. A granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor also elaborated by Mo cells had no effect on the growth of the erythroleukemia cells. Other sources of EPA, such as peripheral blood leukocyte-conditioned medium, preparations from urine of anemic patients, and medium conditioned by a human monocyte-like cell line, stimulated erythroleukemia cell growth. Mouse sources of EPA (termed ""burst-promoting activity"") stimulated mouse but not human erythroleukemia cells.

Cytotoxicity against K562, cells highly sensitive to NK activity, though variable, was detected in 93% of PBL of normal donors and 83% of patients, and among the latter showed no evidence of significant decline with advancing disease. However, LNC and TIL anti-K562 activity was infrequent (17%) in concordance with previous reports. There was no correlation between the ability of patients' PBL to lyse autologous tumour and K562 cells. The independence of these 2 cytotoxic actions was further explored in studies fractionating lymphocytes: autologous tumour killing was augmented in T-enriched PBL; whereas the greatest anti-K562 activity was found in the corresponding non-T fraction. Lymphocyte cytotoxicity in colonic neoplasia is thus manifest in 2 apparently independent lymphocyte populations; a relatively specific killer T-cell population, detectable in PBL, LNC and TIL, which is preferentially reactive with the autologous cells; and a non-specific killer population, largely limited to PBL, with the properties of NK cells.

Active synthesis of thymus-leukemia antigen restricted to proliferating cells.,140-54,"Large cortical thymocytes from C57BL/6-Tla(a) mice have been prepared rapidly and in high yield by a combination of centrifugal elutriation and differential binding to peanut agglutinin (PNA)-coated plates. The cells in these lymphoblast-rich fractions were clearly distinct from the majority of thymocytes, with up to 70 percent in the S or G(2) + M phases of the cell cycle and an average rate of [(35)S]methionine incorporation per cell up to 20 times higher than that of the majority population. The populations of cells resolved in this fractionation were characterized by monitoring their rates of synthesis of specific glycoproteins, thymus- leukemia antigen (TL) and the Lyt-2, Lyt-3 complex (Lyt-2/3), relative to their total protein synthesis. Cells that bound to PNA synthesized high levels of Lyt-2/3, consistent with their identification as cortical thymocytes. Those that failed to bind made little or no Lyt-2/3, as expected for medullary cells, The fraction of dividing lymphoblasts that bound to PNA was enriched in cortical thymocyte precursors, including all the large cells detectably active in synthesizing Lyt-2. It differed sharply from the small cortical cells, however, in the synthesis of TL. Although both populations displayed abundant surface TL, the TL glycoprotein was produced actively in fractions containing dividing cells but made at a drastically reduced rate by the nondividing majority of cortical thymocytes. Thus, TL seems to be made at a narrowly circumscribed stage of early thymocyte development that is correlated with rapid proliferation. In most of the descendants of such blast cells, the TL glycoprotein is presumably retained on the cell surface as long as no substantial membrane turnover takes place. Ongoing TL synthesis may therefore serve as a marker for a unique developmental state which terminates rapidly in normal differentiation but may be extended by agents that give rise to TL(+) thymic lymphomas.","['Rothenberg, E']",['Rothenberg E'],['eng'],"['AI 16769/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peanut Agglutinin)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Lectins', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Peanut Agglutinin', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.155.1.140 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1982 Jan 1;155(1):140-54. doi: 10.1084/jem.155.1.140.,,PMC2186575,,

Optimal IL 2 production requires culturing OT-CLL cells at 2 to 5 X 10(6)/ml for 24 hr in the presence of 1 to 2% PHA-M. Under these conditions, the titer of IL 2 generated is greater than 20-fold that obtained from conventional sources, e.g., from mitogen-activated tonsillar lymphocytes. Two lines of experimental evidence suggest that the tumor cell product(s) is IL 2. First, in functional assays, suprenatants derived from cultures of PHA-activated OT-CLL cells trigger the proliferation and long-term growth of IL 2-dependent human TCL cells. Second, a partial biochemical purification of the active moiety(ies) derived from OT-CLL demonstrates marked similarity to conventional human IL 2. Thus, the biologically active material(s) precipitates in 50 to 70% saturated (NH4)2 SO4 solutions; elutes from DEAE-Sepharose in the presence of 0.04-0.08 M NaCl; and has an apparent m.w. of approximately 14,000, as determined by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. In addition, analysis of OT-CLL cells by indirect immunofluorescence, utilizing a panel of monoclonal antibodies, confirms not only that these tumor cells are of T cell lineage but that they display surface antigens that define the normal human peripheral T cell subset subserving helper or inducer function: OKT3+, OKT4+ , OKT8-.","['Friedman, S M', 'Thompson, G', 'Halper, J P', 'Knowles, D M']","['Friedman SM', 'Thompson G', 'Halper JP', 'Knowles DM']",['eng'],"['14969/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA 21112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Phenotype', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Pokeweed Mitogens/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1982 Feb;128(2):935-40.,,,,

An analogy between this phenomenon and human combined immunodeficiency disease associated with inborn adenosine deaminase deficiency and the use of inhibitors of adenosine deaminase in the management of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been noted. These phenomena are believed to reflect accumulation of high intracellular concentrations of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) following phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine, inhibiting replicating T-cells. In an attempt to extend these observations to noncultured, nonleukemic T-cells, we studied deoxyadenosine metabolism in human thymocytes. Human thymuses were separated into large replicating and small nondividing cell types by centrifugal elutriation. Both thymocyte subpopulations elevated in their dATP pools on incubation with microM concentrations of deoxyadenosine in the presence of erythro-9-[3-(2-hydroxynonyl)]adenosine, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. These dATP pool rises were similar in extent to those found in cultured leukemic T-lymphoblasts. However, the finding that small nonreplicating thymocytes elevate their dATP pool was unexpected. This prompted study of unstimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. These cells (T and non-T) showed a similar elevation of their dATP pool on incubation with deoxyadenosine. Furthermore, these nondividing peripheral blood lymphocytes were killed by microM concentrations of deoxyadenosine in the presence of an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. The biochemical mechanism of this G0-phase cell death is not known. These findings provide impetus for the investigation of adenosine deaminase inhibitors as lympholytic immunosuppressants or as agents to noncycling malignant lymphoid cells.","['Kefford, R F', 'Fox, R M']","['Kefford RF', 'Fox RM']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deoxyadenosines/*toxicity', 'Deoxyguanosine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Jan;42(1):324-30.,,,,

Because this peak appeared very prominent in the elution profile of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lymphocyte extracts, we measured the ascorbic acid content in lymphocytes from the blood of normal subjects and untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A significantly higher concentration of 111 +/- 15.3 nmol per 10(8) cells (mean +/- SEM) was found in CLL lymphocytes than in normal blood lymphocytes, which contained 42.2 +/- 3.3 nmol per 10(8) cells. Selective enrichment with B and T cells showed that this difference was limited to the chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cell, which had a 5- to 15-fold higher content of ascorbic acid than normal B cells had. In contrast, the ascorbic acid level was similar in normal and CLL T cells. The very high ascorbic acid content provides the chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cell with a reducing substance that could react with oxidants or free radicals.","['Liebes, L', 'Krigel, R', 'Kuo, S', 'Nevrla, D', 'Pelle, E', 'Silber, R']","['Liebes L', 'Krigel R', 'Kuo S', 'Nevrla D', 'Pelle E', 'Silber R']",['eng'],"['CA 11655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28376/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)'],IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*analysis', 'Reference Values', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'T-Lymphocytes/analysis']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.10.6481 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Oct;78(10):6481-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.10.6481.,,PMC349063,,

Most of the patients were in the stages 0, I and II, only 18% were in the stages III and IV according to Rai. In all cases, the disease was characterized by an increased number of B lymphocytes (B-CLL). The B cells mostly expressed a weak fluorescence intensity when tested for membrane bound immunoglobulins (Ig). In accordance to that, the quantitative measurement of Ig in the serum revealed a decrease of one or more Ig classes in 72% of the patients. No correlation existed between the number of b lymphocytes (and T lymphocytes) or the Ig concentration in the serum and the stage of the disease. To distinguish the CLL from related lymphoproliferative disorders, especially the immunocytic lymphoma, lymph node biopsies were examined histologically and immunomorphologically for intracytoplasmic Ig. This examination confirmed the diagnosis of CLL in 33 out of 40 cases. Six lymph nodes were classified as immunocytic lymphoma of the lymphoplasmacytoid type. In three of the latter, the immunocytic lymphoma was clinically associated with decreased Ig concentrations in the serum. These findings emphasize that the clinically established diagnosis of CLL should be corroborated by immunomorphology.","['Schwarzmeier, J D', 'Radaszkiewicz, T', 'Graninger, W', 'Hofer, F', 'Paietta, E', 'Moser, C']","['Schwarzmeier JD', 'Radaszkiewicz T', 'Graninger W', 'Hofer F', 'Paietta E', 'Moser C']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Wochenschr,Klinische Wochenschrift,2985205R,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Agammaglobulinemia/diagnosis', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'T-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01711181 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Wochenschr. 1981 Dec 1;59(23):1313-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01711181.,,,Chronisch lymphatische Leukamie vom B-Zellen-Typ: Klinische und morphologische Untersuchungen zur diagnostischen Abgrenzung.,

Particularly, in 10 cell lines remarkable growth stimulation was observed with 1 to 10 ng TPA/ml. The effect of TPA was reversible, since the leukemia cells exposed to TPA for 48 hours failed to grow without TPA or adherent cells. The leukemia cells from a symbiotic cell line could be maintained in TPA-containing medium for as long as 8 weeks without losing dependence. The leukemia cells were refractory to growth stimulation by TPA after they acquired the capability to grow independently. Furthermore, by affecting the leukemia cells, TPA and active tumor promoters inhibited pseudoemperipolesis (i.e., localization of leukemia cells under or between adherent cells), which is the basic cell interaction in symbiotic complexes. These effects of tumor-promoting phorbol esters are discussed with a special reference to the multistage hypothesis of leukemogenesis.","['Hiai, H', 'Nishizuka, Y']","['Hiai H', 'Nishizuka Y']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Dec;67(6):1333-40.,,,,

Induction of differentiation occurred equally well in serum-containing and serum-free media. Protein synthesis was necessary for elaboration of DIF, which seems to be of a protein nature inasmuch as it is destroyed by proteases. Gel chromatography showed that one or two species of DIF with apparent molecular weights of 40,000 and 25,000 were produced, depending on the type of mitogen used. At least the 40,000-molecular weight DIF was distinct from the colony stimulating activity (CSA), which was produced simultaneously.

Normal T cells were obtained by rosetting mononuclear cells with sheep erythrocytes followed by centrifugation on a gradient composed of Ficoll and diatrizoate salts. Monocyte populations were prepared by adhering mononuclear cells to plastic dishes and B cells were obtained by the depletion of T lymphocytes and monocytes from a mononuclear cell population. Cell volumes were determined on a Coulter Counter Model H4 Channelyzer. In normals, the average mean cell volume (MCV) of T lymphocytes was smaller than B lymphocytes and the average MCV of B lymphocytes was smaller than the average MCV of monocytes (p less than 0.05). The average MCV of lymphocytes from patients with CLL was smaller than the average MCV of normal B cells (p less than 0.01). The average MCV of lymphoblasts from cases of ALL was larger than the average MCV of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (p less than 0.01). In addition, the size of lymphoblasts showed great variation within and among cases of ALL. The MCV of lymphocytes from most cases of NHL was larger than the MCV of lymphocytes from reactive lymph nodes and from the peripheral blood of normal individuals.

Complementation of the developmental program in myeloid leukemic cells by regulating mRNA production and mRNA translation.,615-20,"Regulation of gene expression has been analysed in different clones of mouse myeloid leukemic cells treated with the tumor promoter 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the macrophage- and granulocyte-inducing protein MGI, and combined treatment with TPA and MGI. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to measure changes in the rate of synthesis of specific proteins and in the amount of corresponding translatable mRNAs assayed in the reticulocyte cell-free translation system. TPA induced different subsets of differentiation-associated protein changes in the different clones and the degree of response to TPA was not necessarily related to the degree of response to MGI. It is shown that TPA can induce protein changes either by inducing the synthesis of new mRNA, by increasing or decreasing the amount of pre-existing mRNA, or by modulating the translation of a constant amount of mRNA. Combined treatment with TPA and MGI resulted in an enhancement of protein changes induced by MGI or TPA alone and induced differentiation-associated protein changes not induced by either compound separately in differentiation-defective clones. This complementation of gene expression appeared to be due to each compound inducing functions not induced by the other, so that the combined treatment resulted in new gene expression. Complementation also occurred at the level both of mRNA production and of mRNA translation. It is suggested that the ability of TPA to regulate gene expression at the level of mRNA production and mRNA translation and to complement changes in gene expression induced by other compounds such as MGI are important functions for its role as a tumor promoter.","['Hoffman-Liebermann, B', 'Liebermann, D', 'Sachs, L']","['Hoffman-Liebermann B', 'Liebermann D', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Carcinogens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*RNA, Messenger', '*RNA, Neoplasm', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",1981/11/15 00:00,1981/11/15 00:01,['1981/11/15 00:00'],"['1981/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910280514 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1981 Nov 15;28(5):615-20. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910280514.,,,,

Use was made of lectins attached to latex particles, as convenient probes to detect binding of lectins to individual cells, Specificity of lectin-latex probes was demonstrated by comparison with agglutination and fluorescent lectin binding; experiments with untreated and enzyme-treated human and animal erythrocytes confirmed the specificity of the lectin-latex beads as did inhibition in the presence of N-acetyl-galactosamine, the immunodominant sugar of blood group A substance. The binding of HP to T cells and a proportion of B, and non-B, non-T cells is confirmed. Binding to B cells in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is also confirmed. HP-latex had the same specificity as soluble HP, but binding did not require pretreatment of lymphocytes with neuraminidase. HL-latex had the same specificity for erythrocytes, normal lymphocyte subpopulations and CLL lymphocytes as HP, but the binding was weaker and required pretreatment of the lymphocytes with neuraminidase to demonstrate it. Contrary to expectation, CN and DB bound to B lymphocytes and did not bind to T lymphocytes. CN binding was almost completely restricted to B cells, whereas DB bound to part of the non-B, non-T populations as well as to a substantial proportion of B cells. Neither CN nor DB labelled malignant T cells. Both CN and DB bound to B cells in CLL. As with HP, pretreatment of lymphocytes with neuraminidase increased the accessibility of receptors, but was not essential to demonstrate labelling with CN-, and DB-latex preparations. Binding of each lectin to lymphocytes was independent of ABO blood group of donor suggesting that ABO antigens may be expressed poorly, if at all, on lymphocytes. Binding is probably due to additional specificities possessed by these lectins. Protease treatment destroyed CN- and DB-binding sites but not HP receptors suggesting that at least two types of binding site are involved.","['Zalewski, P D', 'Forbes, I J', 'Uhlenbruck, G', 'Valente, L']","['Zalewski PD', 'Forbes IJ', 'Uhlenbruck G', 'Valente L']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System', 'Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Helix, Snails', 'Humans', 'Latex Fixation Tests', 'Lectins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Neuraminidase/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1981 May;44(2):304-14.,,PMC1537351,,

Growth of the cultured human leukemic cells HL-60 and K-562 was measured by cloning in soft agar. Of the deoxyribonucleosides, dGuo was the most potent cell growth inhibitor; however, the potency of added dAdo was probably attenuated by the presence of adenosine deaminase in the tissue culture growth medium. The concentrations of nucleoside causing 50% inhibition of HL-60 cloning were: dCyd, greater than 10,000 microM; dAdo, 500 microM; dThd, 5,000 microM; and dGuo, 80 microM. For K-562 cloning, the concentrations causing 50% inhibition of cloning were dCyd, greater 10,000 microM; dAdo, 1,600 microM; dThd, 880 microM;' and dGuo, 100 microM. Measurement of deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP) pool size in HL-60 cells following incubation with 750 microM deoxyribonucleosides revealed that dGuo caused the greatest reduction of dCTP pools, both in early (passage 10)- and late (passage 71)-passage-derived HL-60 cell cultures (35 and 19% of control, respectively), compared to dThd (61 and 26% of control, respectively) and dAdo (39% of control of HL-60 passage 10). In K-562 cells, reductions in dCTP pool size caused by dAdo, dThd, and dGuo were 68, 46, and 35% of control, respectively. Incorporation of [3H]dCyd into DNA of HL-60 and K-562 cells was enhanced by dThd and dGuo, but the degree of enhancement was greater for dThd than for dGuo. Despite its effect in reducing HL-60 dCTP pool size, dAdo failed to enhance [3H]dCyd incorporation in either HL-60 or K-562 cells. Addition of dCyd to the cultures could only partially rescue the inhibition of HL-60 cloning caused by dThd or dGuo, suggesting that inhibition of cytidine 5'-diphosphate reduction by ribonucleotide reductase is not the only mechanism whereby these nucleosides inhibit leukemic cell cloning. These data suggest that, in addition to inhibiting de novo dCTP production via ribonucleotide reductase, these nucleosides may affect other processes in the salvage pathway such as cellular uptake and phosphorylation or the DNA polymerase reaction itself.","['Ross, D D', 'Akman, S A', 'Schrecker, A W', 'Bachur, N R']","['Ross DD', 'Akman SA', 'Schrecker AW', 'Bachur NR']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyguanosine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Nov;41(11 Pt 1):4493-8.,,,,

To carry out these studies, a method was developed to identify cells histochemically within agar cultures as containing either the myeloid marker, chloroacetate esterase (CAE), or the monocyte marker, nonspecific esterase (NSE). Cells from normal donors were placed into agar cultures with placenta conditioned medium (PCM), TPA in various concentrations, or combinations of PCM and TPA as stimulating materials, and examined after 7-14 days of incubation. TPA alone at concentrations of 5 x 10(-7) M to 10(-9) M stimulated cluster formation. With increasing concentrations of TPA, the percentage of clusters positive for NSE progressively increased, while CAE-positive clusters decreased. I contrast, when TPA at concentrations greater than 10(-9) M was added to PCM, the total number of clusters and colonies decreased. This resulted from a decrease in the number of clusters and colonies that contained the myeloid marker CAE, whereas the number positive for the monocyte marker NSE remained unchanged. These studies demonstrate two effects of TPA on normal CFU-C. In the absence of other sources of colony stimulating activity (CSA), TPA induces clusters. In the presence of PCM, it inhibits the production of myeloid colonies and clusters. Under both conditions, it favors the development of colonies and/or clusters containing predominantly monocytes.","['Abrahm, J L', 'Smiley, R']","['Abrahm JL', 'Smiley R']",['eng'],['CA-16520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Placenta', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84735-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Dec;58(6):1119-26.,,,,

Synergy was associated with an increase in the Ara-C nucleotide pool and Ara-C triphosphate concentration. dThd increased, and hydroxyurea decreased, the incorporation of Ara-C into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble macromolecules per unit time. Hydroxyurea was more effective than dThd at equimolar concentrations in increasing the acid-soluble Ara-C pool. Maximal stimulation of Ara-C triphosphate formation by dThd occurred at 1 mM and was associated with reduction of the deoxycytidine triphosphate pool to 31% of control. At the same concentration, hydroxyurea increased Ara-C triphosphate formation to a greater extent but increased deoxycytidine triphosphate to 116% of control. When tested at clinically achievable concentrations on blasts from patients with acute leukemia, hydroxyurea increased the Ara-C nucleotide pool in all six cases studied, whereas dThd decreased the Ara-C nucleotide pool.

Quantitation, specificity, and biological relevance.",1455-74,"To examine directly the hypothesis that T cell growth factor (TCGF) interacts with target cells in a fashion similar to polypeptide hormones, the binding of radiolabeled TCGF to various cell populations was investigated. The results indicate that TCGF interacts with activated T cells via a receptor through which it initiates the T cell proliferative response. Internally radiolabeled TCGF, prepared from a human T leukemia cell line and purified by gel filtration and isoelectric focusing, retained biological activity and was uniform with respect to size and charge. Binding of radiolabeled TCGF to TCGF-dependent cytolytic T cells occurred rapidly (within 15 rain at 37 degrees C) and was both saturable and largely reversible. In addition, at 37 degrees C, a receptor- and lysosome-dependent degradation of TCGF occurred. Radiolabeled TCGF binding was specific for activated, TCGF-responsive T cells. Whereas unstimulated lymphocytes of human or murine origin and lipopolysaccharide-activated B cell blasts expressed few if any detectable binding sites, lectin- or alloantigen-activated cells had easily detectable binding sites. Moreover, compared with lectin- or alloantigen-activated T cells, long-term TCGF-dependent cytolytic and helper T cell lines and TCGF-dependent neo-plastic T cell lines bound TCGF with a similar affinity (dissociation constant of 5-25 pM) and expressed a similar number of receptor sites per cell (5,000-15,000). In contrast, a number of TCGF-independent cell lines of T cell, B cell, or myeloid origin did not bind detectable quantities of radiolabeled TCGF. Binding of radiolabeled TCGF to TCGF-responsive cells was specific, in that among several growth factors and polypeptide hormones tested, only TCGF competed for binding. Finally, the relative magnitude of T cell proliferation induced by a given concentration of TCGF closely paralleled the fraction of occupied receptor sites. As the extent of T cell clonal expansion depends on TCGF and on the TCGF receptor, the dissection of the molecular events surrounding the interaction of TCGF and its receptor that these studies permit, should provide new insight into the hormonelike regulation of the immune response by this lymphokine.","['Robb, R J', 'Munck, A', 'Smith, K A']","['Robb RJ', 'Munck A', 'Smith KA']",['eng'],"['CA-17323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17643/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-2/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Lymphokines', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Time Factors']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.154.5.1455 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1981 Nov 1;154(5):1455-74. doi: 10.1084/jem.154.5.1455.,,PMC2186509,,

These are the first reported human cell lines which constitutively produce TCGF. Biologically active TCGF could also be eluted from the surface of these cells using an acid glycine buffer under conditions that maintained cell viability, and subcellular fractionation showed that almost all the TCGF activity was associated with the plasma membrane. Over 30 other human hematopoietic cell lines derived from other disorders were unable to produce TCGF even after induction, and their acid eluates did not contain TCGF activity. L-TCGF from CTCL lines had the same biological activity as TCGF obtained from normal leukocytes (N-TCGF) in that they both supported the long-term growth of normal T cells only after the cells were previously activated by antigen or lectin. Both L-TCGF and N-TCGF increased the rate of proliferation of TCGF-independent and TCGF-dependent CTCL cell lines. The same three factor-independent cell lines that released TCGF adsorbed TCGF in a cell-concentration, time-, and temperature-dependent manner. Since the CTCL cell lines produce TCGF, adsorb TCGF, and increase their proliferative rate in response to TCGF or a related molecule, it is suggested that this endogenously produced factor plays a role in maintaining the abnormal proliferation of these cells in culture as permanently growing cell lines independent of exogenous TCGF. However, this does not mean that this is an essential aspect of neoplastic transformation. Since it is unusual to develop these cell lines in the absence of the continuous need for added TCGF, ""autostimulation"" may be one of the many unusual variant phenotypic properties sometimes associated with neoplastic cells that gives them a selective advantage for in vitro growth.","['Gootenberg, J E', 'Ruscetti, F W', 'Mier, J W', 'Gazdar, A', 'Gallo, R C']","['Gootenberg JE', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Mier JW', 'Gazdar A', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Adsorption', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.154.5.1403 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1981 Nov 1;154(5):1403-18. doi: 10.1084/jem.154.5.1403.,,PMC2186515,,

The VIP-induced activation of lymphocyte adenylate cyclase was time, temperature, and concentration dependent. VIP and the GTP analog, Gpp(NH)p, acted synergistically to stimulate lymphocyte adenylate cyclase; stimulation by VIP and PGE1 was additive; and VIP activation was antagonized by somatostatin. VIP-mediated activation of lymphocyte adenylate cyclase was observed in normal human T cells, B cells obtained from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and a human T cell culture line. The Raji human B cell culture line did possess adenylate cyclase activity, but this activity was not stimulated by VIP.

IL 2 produced by this cell line is eluted from a DEAE-Sephacel ion-exchange column with 0.05 M NaCl and has a m.w. determined by AcA54 gel chromatography in the range of 9000 to 18,000. Isoelectric focusing yields active material with a pI value of 7.75. Elution of IL 2 from a SDS-polyacrylamide gel shows it to have a m.w. of approximately 13,500.

Thus, suspensions of spleen cells that were treated with anti-NK-1.2 antibodies and C lost virtually all lytic activity for 6 lymphoma cell lines, whereas lytic activity for 2 nonlymphoma cell lines remained largely intact. It must be noted, however, that unlike NK-1.2 expression, target cell preference is not an absolute indicator of NK cell subclass.

All organs were able to do this but were much more effective from endotoxin-injected animals. Production of the differentiation factor (DF) was dependent on protein synthesis and occurred throughout the 7-day incubation period. DF produced by the different organs in vitro and found in vivo in endotoxin serum were indistinguishable from each other by several fractionation procedures but could be distinguished from the majority of granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM- and M-CSFs). DF was precipitated by 55% ammonium sulfate whereas CSF required 85% saturation. DF did not bind to Concanavalin A-Sepharose whereas CSF did. DF eluted later than CSF from Phenyl-Sepharose columns. The dissociated molecular weight of DF was 21,000-29,000 and was not greatly affected by neuraminidase treatment. There was no evidence that DF was glycoprotein in nature although this cannot yet be ruled out. Although the DF activity could be clearly separated from the bulk of GM-CSF and M-CSF activities, there was always residual CSF activity associated with the DF. This CSF was distinct from GM- and M-CSF in its biochemical properties, in the fact that it only stimulated a subset of colony-forming cells and that upon dilution it stimulated exclusively granulocytic colonies to develop. In two steps (ammonium sulfate precipitation and Phenyl-Sepharose chromatography) it was possible to selectively enrich the differentiation activity over the CSF activity by 21-fold.","['Nicola, N A', 'Metcalf, D']","['Nicola NA', 'Metcalf D']",['eng'],"['CA22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Culture Media', 'Endotoxins/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*isolation & purification', '*Growth Inhibitors', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lung/metabolism', '*Lymphokines', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Muscles/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041090208 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1981 Nov;109(2):253-64. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041090208.,,,,

This variability cannot be explained by the known correlation between active cell proliferation and an increase in the number of receptors, since the tumors with the highest growth fraction (i.e., Burkitt's lymphoma and T-cell leukemia) tend to have lower average receptor numbers than do tumors with lower growth fractions such as common ALL. All clinical specimens from patients with lymphatic leukemia have some measurable level of glucocorticoid receptors; therefore, the resistance seen in vivo cannot be explained by the lack of receptors. However, there has been a positive correlation, in our hands, with receptor level and prognosis. On the basis of in vitro models, it is proposed that perhaps the high receptor cell lines (i.e., common ALL of childhood) have relative stability of their genetic material making glucocorticoid-resistant mutations less likely to occur in patients with these cells than in low-receptor cell lines (i.e., T-cell leukemia).

This system involves the continuous use of a factor, termed T-cell growth factor (TCGF) for the propagation of T-lymphocytes previously activated by lectin (PHA or Con A) or by antigen. Normal human T cells do not respond to TCGF unless they are first activated to become blast cells by antigen or lectin, presumably because they do not contain TCGF receptors until activated. We think then that TCGF is the physiological growth promoter in the immune response of T-lymphocytes, acting as the second signal (after antigen) in the immune response. These T cells show functional features, e.g., cytotoxic or helper function and other evidence of maturity. By using purified TCGF free of PHA and of lymphokines other than TCGF, we have recently been able to grow routinely neoplastic T cells from patients with leukemias and lymphomas of mature T cells, e.g., from patients with the Sezary syndrome and those with mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T-cell leukemias and lymphomas). Of considerable interest, the neoplastic T cells respond directly to TCGF; unlike normal T Cells they do not require prior in vitro activation with antigen or lectin. This indicates that transformed mature T cells already express TCGF receptors. This may be an important functional difference between normal and transformed human T cells. From some of these new cell lines we have recently isolated a new class of RNA tumor viruses (retroviruses), which we call HTLV. For several reasons we believe these are the first unambiguous isolates of RNA tumor viruses from humans. For instances, we now have data that these new viruses are easily distinguishable from all previously isolated viruses from animals. In addition, we have found antibodies in sera of some patients with these diseases specifically reactive with proteins of these viruses.","['Gallo, R C']",['Gallo RC'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*microbiology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'RNA Viruses/*isolation & purification', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1981;7(2):313-29.,,,,

To characterize the different steps of the host-virus relationship further, the degree of viremia, the appearance of leukemia, organ involvement, and the surface phenotype of leukemic cells were studied in individual mice. The results demonstrate that: a) The viremia was controlled by H-2 and non-H-2 genes. Three H-2 genes located in the I and D or T region of the MHC behave like immune-response genes controlling the specific antiviral immune response. Other gene(s) mapped outside the complex also affected the virus production. Both sets of genes influenced leukemia incidence, since leukemias were observed only in highly viremic strains. b) Additional non-H-2 genes, which were not involved in viremia control, were determinants in the induction of malignancies because some sensitive strains do not become leukemic despite high levels of viremia. c) The anatomical type of Moloney virus-induced leukemias varied according to the non-H-2 background. Most of the leukemias arising in B10 congeneic mice involved the thymus and were frequently limited to this organ, whereas BALB mice preferentially developed splenic leukemias. d) In a given inbred strain, the leukemias arising in different animals frequently expressed different phenotypes.

The helper T cells in normal and CLL patients were the most responsive to PHA stimulation, although the responsiveness of helper T cells to PHA was decreased in CLL. Purified CLL B cells responded minimally to PHA stimulation, but normal B lymphocytes did not.

While clinically the drug has been found to be active at serum concentrations of approximately 10 microM, we have tested it at concentrations up to and including 1 mM. It was found that both erythroid and granulocytic colony growth was completely unaffected by 1 mM dCF, a concentration at least 2 magnitudes higher than that necessary to totally ablate intracellular ADA levels. T-lymphocyte colony growth was unaffected by 100 microM dCF, but at 1 mM some inhibition was observed.

The mean CSA threshold (amount of CSA required to stimulate 0.5 of the clone forming cells) of 27 different AML cell samples varied from normal to an approximately nine-fold increase in CSA requirement. The degree of sensitivity to CSA at presentation was found to be closely correlated to the response to induction chemotherapy in 15 patients. There was a highly significant correlation (P less than 0.001) between the mean CSA threshold and the number of courses of chemotherapy required to induce remission. Also, an increased mean CSA threshold at presentation was associated with a significantly slower decline of marrow blasts following the first course of chemotherapy and a reduced remission rate. Sensitivity to CSA was closely related to the clone size achieved in maximally stimulated cultures of AML cells and this in turn also related to the remission rate and ease with which remission was achieved (presentation marrows, 39 patients). Possible reasons for the linking of these two functional properties of AML cells and their relation to response to chemotherapy will be discussed.","['Francis, G E', 'Tuma, G A', 'Berney, J J', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Francis GE', 'Tuma GA', 'Berney JJ', 'Hoffbrand AV']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb07222.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1981 Oct;49(2):259-67. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb07222.x.,,,,

Simultaneous measurements od drug levels in both pleural fluid and blood after a single dose demonstrated that free MTX and MTX-PLL 3K were cleared from the pleural cavity and blood within 4 hr, MTX-PLL 40K-60K was cleared within 2 hr, and MTX-BSA was still present in the tumor compartment at 48 hr. The coupling of MTX to these carriers increased its toxicity by extending the half-life of MTX-BSA within the animal and by incorporating a toxic PLL derivative as a carrier. At equitoxic doses, a single dose of MTX-BSA gave a peak increase in lifespan (ILS) of 50% (at 35 mg/kg) compared with a peak ILS of 30 to 35% for both free drug (at 95 mg/kg) and the MTX-PLL derivatives (at 1.4-6 mg/kg). Systemic administration of sufficient leucovorin to provide partial marrow protection compromised the antitumor activity of both MTX and MTX-BSA in the pleural cavity, and although leucovorin permitted higher doses to be used, this resulted in only a small increase in peak ILS for MTX-BSA on a single dose schedule.","['Chu, B C', 'Howell, S B']","['Chu BC', 'Howell SB']",['eng'],"['CA23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23334/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Injections', 'Kinetics', 'Leucovorin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/metabolism/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Pleura/metabolism', 'Polylysine', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1981 Nov;219(2):389-93.,,,,

A model system for cobalamin-folate inter-relationships.,10329-34,"L1210 mouse leukemia cells were made cobalamin-deficient by propagation in a medium from which cyanocobalamin was omitted and fetal bovine serum (containing protein-bound cobalamins) was replaced by bovine serum albumin. These cobalamin-deficient cells exhibited a normal replication time of 12 h, provided that the medium contained excess folate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. The cells responded poorly, however, to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate unless exogenous cobalamin was added. A cobalamin dependency was also observed when low levels of folate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate were used. With 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, optimal stimulation of growth was observed with free and transcobalamin-II-bound cobalamin at 4,000 pM and 2 pM, respectively. Under cobalamin-replete conditions, cells contained 2,000 to 4,000 molecules of cobalamin/cell, and in the deficient state, this value declined to less than 10 molecules/cell; optimal replication on 5-methyltetrahydrofolate required approximately 180 molecules/cell. Cobalamin-deficient cells cultured in the absence of folate reached an arrested state from which limited replication could be induced by the addition of aquacobalamin; normal replication was induced by aquacobalamin plus 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Results of this investigation are interpreted in terms of the requirement for tetrahydrofolate in cell replication and the production of this compound from folate and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (via cobalamin-independent pathways) and from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (via the cobalamin-dependent methionine synthetase).","['Fujii, K', 'Nagasaki, T', 'Huennekens, F M']","['Fujii K', 'Nagasaki T', 'Huennekens FM']",['eng'],"['AM07097/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA06522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Folic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*physiopathology', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Vitamin B 12/*pharmacology']",1981/10/25 00:00,1981/10/25 00:01,['1981/10/25 00:00'],"['1981/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)68622-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1981 Oct 25;256(20):10329-34.,,,,

In AKR mice there is a sharp rise in thymic hormone sensitive thymocytes bearing a high concentration of Thy 1 antigen. While these cells also rise with age in BALB/c mice, they do so more slowly. The response of thymocytes to Con A was also compared between the two strains: the response of AKR cells drops to below significant levels within seven months, while BALB/c cells remain reactive throughout the experimental period. Since these age-related changes in Thy 1 antigen density and Con A reactivity can be reversed after incubation with a thymic hormone preparation, it is concluded that they are the result of a decrease in thymic hormone secretion, that this decrease is much more pronounced in AKR mice than in BALb/c mice and may therefore play a role in the etiology of the AKR leukemia.","['Fournier, M', 'Potworowski, E F', 'Kowalczyk, D']","['Fournier M', 'Potworowski EF', 'Kowalczyk D']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Thymus Hormones)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Thymus Hormones/pharmacology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(81)80094-0 [pii]', '10.1016/S0171-2985(81)80094-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1981;159(4-5):382-91. doi: 10.1016/S0171-2985(81)80094-0.,,,,

Mice bearing disseminated FBL leukemia were successfully treated by a combination of cyclophosphamide and adoptive transfer of syngeneic immune lymphocytes. Therapeutic efficacy was largely dependent on the presence of Lyt-1+2- T cells in the transferred cells, whereas cells cytotoxic to FBL tumor in vitro were derived from the Lyt-1+2+ and Lyt-1-2+ subsets. Thus, the predominate cell required to eradicate tumor in adoptive chemoimmunotherapy was not cytolytic to tumor in vitro. Potentially, the Lyt-1+2- cell may operate in vivo as an amplifier cell rather than by a direct anti-tumor effect. Elimination of the Lyt-1+ population with alpha-Lyt-1 and complement prevented the generation of significant cytotoxic responses during both primary in vitro sensitization to alloantigens and in vitro sensitization of tumour-primed cells. The capacity of Lyt-1+ cell-depleted population to generate cytotoxic responses was partially reconstituted by addition, at the initiation of culture, of interluekin 2, a T cell growth factor derived from Lyt-1+2- cells, which contain the CTL and CTL precursors, were nearly as effective in vitro as unseparated immune cells. If the remaining effector cells (i.e., Lyt-1+2- T cells) function in vivo predominantly as amplifier cells, than the tumour-bearing host must be capable of making a positive contribution to the outcome of therapy.","['Greenberg, P D', 'Cheever, M A', 'Fefer, A']","['Greenberg PD', 'Cheever MA', 'Fefer A']",['eng'],"['CA10777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CB-84247/CB/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/analysis', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.154.3.952 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1981 Sep 1;154(3):952-63. doi: 10.1084/jem.154.3.952.,,PMC2186470,,

Leukemic spleen cells, 30-60 d after virus inoculation, expressed decreased amounts of ecotropic Friend murine leukemia helper virus gag- and env-encoded cell surface and intracellular proteins compared with leukemic cells tested 8-10 d after virus inoculation. In contrast, the spleen focus-forming virus-induced protein, gp55, was present on both leukemia cell populations. This difference appeared to be mediated by the humoral antibody response in Rfv-3r/s mice, which could recognize only ecotropic gag and env proteins, and not gp55. A new gp70 molecule cross-reactive with a recombinant Friend mink cell focus-inducing virus was found in large quantities on late leukemic cells. This protein appeared to be derived from a recombinant virus produced during the course of Friend virus infection. The appearance of this new gp70 suggests that recombinant viruses other than spleen focus-forming virus may play a role in Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia.","['Britt, W J', 'Collins, J K', 'Chesebro, B']","['Britt WJ', 'Collins JK', 'Chesebro B']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis/*immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Envelope Proteins']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.154.3.868 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1981 Sep 1;154(3):868-82. doi: 10.1084/jem.154.3.868.,,PMC2186456,,

The ability of normal non-T cells or non-T cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to form rosettes with human red blood cells coated with SpA (SpA-HRBC) was strongly inhibited or abolished by incubation with F(ab')2 fragments of antibodies against human immunoglobulin (Ig), whereas the incubation with F(ab')2 fragments of antibodies against a non-Ig cell surface antigen, such as beta 2-microglobulin, had no effect on the SpA-rosetting of human lymphocytes. The role of the reaction between surface Ig (sIg) and SpA in the triggering of the proliferative response induced by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria strain Cowan I (Cowan Staph) on normal or leukemic non-T cells was also investigated. A parallelism was observed between the mitogenic activity on normal human non-T cells of Cowan Staph and F(ab')2 fragments of immunosorbent-purified rabbit antibodies to human mu-chain. On the other hand, monovalent Fab fragments of anti-F(ab')2 or anti-mu chain antibodies were unable to activate human non-T lymphocytes, but usually induced a partial inhibition of the Cowan Staph-induced cell proliferation. Non-T cells from 2 patients with CLL did not respond to either Fab or F(ab')2 fragments of anti-Ig antibodies, but were stimulated to proliferate by Cowan Staph. However, the proliferative response of non-T cells from these patients to Cowan Staph was markedly inhibited or abolished by the addition to the cultures of F(ab')2 fragments of anti-Ig antibodies. Antibody preparations to human F(ab')2 or gamma-chain inhibited the response of IgG-bearing leukemic cells, whereas the Cowan Staph-induced proliferation of IgM-bearing leukemic lymphocytes was inhibited by the addition to the cultures of either anti-F(ab')2 or anti-mu chain antibodies. The proliferative response to Cowan Staph or normal non-T cells was also inhibited by the addition to the cultures of human and guinea pig polyclonal IgG, whereas IgG from other species, such as goat, ox, horse, and rabbit, were poorly or not at all inhibitory. On a molar basis, the F(ab')2 preparation from human IgG was as potent an inhibitor as intact IgG molecules, whereas Fc gamma was much less effective in inhibiting the Cowan Staph-induced cell proliferation. A monoclonal IgM, isolated from the serum of a patient with CLL, whose lymphocytes were able to form rosettes with SpA-HRBC and to proliferate in vitro after stimulation with Cowan Staph, also showed a marked inhibitory activity on the Cowan Staph-induced proliferation or normal non-T cells. These data suggest that an interaction between SpA present on the bacterial cell wall and a structure located in the Fab region of sIg, which is shared by sIgM, sIgG, and perhaps also by sIg of other classes, plays an important role in the triggering of B cell proliferation induced by SpA-containing staphylococci.","['Romagnani, S', 'Giudizi, M G', 'Biagiotti, R', 'Almerigogna, F', 'Maggi, E', 'Del Prete, G', 'Ricci, M']","['Romagnani S', 'Giudizi MG', 'Biagiotti R', 'Almerigogna F', 'Maggi E', 'Del Prete G', 'Ricci M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', '*Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Rosette Formation', 'Staphylococcal Protein A/*pharmacology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/immunology']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1981 Oct;127(4):1307-13.,,,,

Demonstration of Friend leukemia-virus-permissive and non-permissive subsets of splenic T cells.,505-12,"The permissiveness of normal splenic lymphocytes to Friend murine leukemia virus was determined by enumeration of cells producing infectious MuLV following infection with Friend virus in vitro. The infection was enhanced greatly in the presence of mitogens in the culture medium. The number of infected cells in cultures stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide increased progressively between days 1 and 7 whereas in cultures with concavalin A, the number of infected cells reached a maximum on days 3-4 post infection and then declined to the level observed in unstimulated cultures. The con-A-enhanced infection was absent in cultures of splenocytes from nude mice but was present in cultures from nude mice implanted with thymus glands 6 weeks or more before use as donors of spleen cells. The cells permissive to MuLV upon con-A stimulation segregated in the nylon-wool-adherent fraction (together with B cells involved in the LPS-dependent infection) whereas the nylon-non-adherent fraction, containing approximately 90% T cells, was refractory to in vitro infection. The con-A-dependent infectious centers were inhibited by cytotoxic treatment with anti-Thy 1.2 antibody plus complement. These results indicate the existence of two subpopulations of splenic T cells, a major nylon-non-adherent and a minor, nylon-adherent subpopulation, which are, respectively, non-permissive and permissive to MuLV-Friend.","['Isaak, D D', 'Cerny, J']","['Isaak DD', 'Cerny J']",['eng'],['CA 14922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Mitogens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910270414 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1981;27(4):505-12. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910270414.,,,,

When HL-60 cells were cultured at high cell density, optimal growth rate occurred in liquid suspension and confluent colony growth was observed in viscous medium without the addition of conditioned medium. However, when cells were cultured at lower cell density, growth rate was reduced and colony growth was nil unless conditioned medium from HL-60 culture was added. All HL-60 populations studied, including the earliest available passage, 9, both elaborated and responded to HL-60 CM. HL-60 CM did not stimulate normal human or mouse granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming cell (CFU-GM) growth. Conditioned media from other human cell lines varied in the ability to stimulate HL-60 cell and CFU-GM proliferation. Some, such as GCT CM, stimulated both HL-60 cells and normal CFU-GM, whereas others, like HL-60 CM, stimulated only HL-60 growth. The majority of cell line CMs tested did not stimulate either HL-60 or CFU-GM. Chromatography of HL-60 CM on Ultrogel AcA54 showed a single peak of HL-60 stimulating activity of apparent molecular weight 13,000. The ability of HL-60 cells to elaborate this activity provides a possible explanation for their proliferation at higher cell densities.

These studies were aimed at identifying the molecular basis of cell killing by this drug. In three patients an increase in blast deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) concentration occurred which was found to be temporally related to cell killing and was accompanied by decreased concentrations of the other three deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. In the one patient with Thy-ALL who responded poorly to treatment, the increase in dATP concentration was delayed and was not accompanied by a fall in the concentrations of the other deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Progressive inactivation of blast cell S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase was found to occur in the three patients tested but was maximal only after a substantial reduction of peripheral blast cell count. These results show that 2' deoxycoformycin has a potent cytoreductive effect in Thy-ALL and suggest that the molecular basis of this toxicity is related both to the intracellular accumulation of dATP with inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase.

However, after treatment with neuraminidase-galactose oxidase (NGO), in the presence of PWM, CLL lymphocytes transformed into blasts and incorporated 3H-thymidine in 3-day cultures. This response of CLL lymphocytes was similar to that given by normal lymphocytes to PWM in 3-day cultures. The best stimulation of CLL lymphocytes was achieved when conditioned medium (CM) from normal T lymphocytes was present in PWM cultures. Purified B lymphocytes from CLL (T lymphocytes and monocytes removed) did not respond to PHA or PWM. However, after NGO treatment these cells were stimulated by PWM, but only in the presence of CM. PHA failed to stimulate NGO-treated CLL lymphocytes or purified B lymphocytes.

This paper restricts itself to briefly summarized some observations gathered in our laboratory and in those of other investigators which directly address themselves to the regulation of the biosynthesis of cholesterol and its possible significance in immunocompetent cells. It is suggested that de novo synthesis of cholesterol represents a critical metabolic step for proliferation and, possibly also, differentiation of lymphoid cells such as cytotoxic T-cells. De novo synthesis of cholesterol is regulated specifically by a feedback mechanism involving oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol. Some of these oxidation products are known to be generated spontaneously from cholesterol, which in itself is not affecting the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34). At present, it is not known to what extent oxidized derivatives of cholesterol contaminate the human diet. If they do, their effects on the immune system may be significant, and further investigations on such minor yet very potent and naturally occurring compounds in the diet are needed to understand the etiology of several human diseases. These compounds may also be of therapeutic value in the treatment of some malignant disorders.","['Heiniger, H J']",['Heiniger HJ'],['eng'],['CA 19305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Diet/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oxygen', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Sep;41(9 Pt 2):3792-4.,,,,

The Rai-staging system was found to be generally useful for determining prognosis of groups of patients, although less useful in any individual patient. Findings relating to surface membrane immunoglobulin-positive (B) and E-rosetting (T) lymphocytes are described. A patient with null-cell CLL is described. All patients with proliferation of gamma heavy-chain-bearing cells were diagnosed in early Rai stages suggesting that this marker may identify a subset of patients who present early and have a good prognosis. These data suggest that lymphocyte marker studies augment the Rai criteria in evaluating prognosis and may eventually be of value to the clinician in evaluating stage of disease and response to treatment.","['Van Scoy-Mosher, M B', 'Bick, M', 'Capostagno, V', 'Walford, R L', 'Gatti, R A']","['Van Scoy-Mosher MB', 'Bick M', 'Capostagno V', 'Walford RL', 'Gatti RA']",['eng'],['CA-16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830100103 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1981;10(1):9-18. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830100103.,,,,

A regulatory role for acidic isoferritins in the production of granulocytes and macrophages.,1426-44,"Acidic isoferritins have been identified as leukemia-associated inhibitory activity (LIA), which suppresses colony and cluster formation of colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophages from normal donors but not from patients with leukemia. LIA was detected in all ferritin preparations tested, including ferritin isolated from normal heart, spleen, liver, and placental tissues, and from the spleens of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and Hodgkin's disease. Purified preparations of LIA were composed almost entirely of acidic isoferritins, as determined by immunoassay, radioimmunoassay, and isoelectric focusing. The inhibitory activity in the LIA and ferritin samples was inactivated by a battery of antisera specific for ferritin, including those prepared against acidic isoferritins from normal heart and spleen tissues from patients with Hodgkin's disease, and those previously absorbed with basic isoferritins. Antisera absorbed with acidic isoferritins did not inactivate the inhibitory activity. Separation of LIA and chronic myelogenous leukemia and normal spleen ferritin by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing confirmed that the regions of peak inhibitory activity corresponded in each to an apparent molecular weight of approximately 550,000 and to a pI value of 4.7. Similar physicochemical characteristics included inactivation by methods that dissociate ferritin molecules into subunits and by treatment with trypsin, chymotrypsin, pronase, and periodate. The purified preparations were extremely stable to heat treatment. The glycoprotein nature of the inhibitory activity was substantiated because it bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose and was eluted off by alpha-methyl mannose. Inhibitory activity of the activity of the acidic isoferritins was detected at concentrations as low as 10(-17)-10(-19) M and iron saturation did not appear to be necessary for its action. These results implicate acidic isoferritins in the regulation of normal myelopoiesis and suggest a role for them in the progression of leukemia.","['Broxmeyer, H E', 'Bognacki, J', 'Dorner, M H', 'de Sousa, M']","['Broxmeyer HE', 'Bognacki J', 'Dorner MH', 'de Sousa M']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (acidic isoferritin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Ferritins/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Point', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Macrophages/*physiology']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.153.6.1426 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1981 Jun 1;153(6):1426-44. doi: 10.1084/jem.153.6.1426.,,PMC2186184,,

Among the noted changes, most prominent was the drop in the leukocyte count. Initially, the cell count rose from 7,200 cells/microliters on Day 1 to 120,000 cells/microliters on Day 3. On Day 5, the cell count began to decline and reached a nadir of 600 cells/microliter on Day 10. The leukocyte count remained below 1,000 cells/microliter through Day 12. The reduction in cell count was preceded by a decline in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in the cells, which dropped to negligible amount by Day 7. The other prominent change was a decrease in adenosine deaminase activity in both red cells and leukemic cells. Adenosine deaminase activity of red cells dropped to 5% on Day 4, and that of leukemic cells dropped to 59% on Day 5. In addition, there were considerable alterations in the concentrations of purine metabolites which were characterized by a progressive reduction in the concentrations of total purine metabolites, especially adenosine 5'-triphosphate, and a transient rise in the concentrations of deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate, adenosine 5'-monophosphate, and adenosine 5-diphosphate. These findings suggest that treatment with deoxycoformycin may be of therapeutic value for T-cell leukemia. It may provide opportunities for studying the purine metabolism in T-leukemic cells which could lead to better approaches to treatment.","['Yu, A L', 'Bakay, B', 'Kung, F H', 'Nyhan, W L']","['Yu AL', 'Bakay B', 'Kung FH', 'Nyhan WL']",['eng'],"['CA 27740-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 17702/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Pentostatin', 'Purines/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Jul;41(7):2677-82.,,,,

Here we report on the colony-forming ability of HL-60 and KG-1 over an extended culture life of the cells. Several different sources of human CSA of different stages of purity enhanced colony formation of these cells. CSA, obtained from conditioned media from an SV-40 transformed human trophoblast, was partially purified, and its activity for normal bone marrow copurified with the activity that stimulated HL-60 colony formation. Over 100 clones of HL-60 were developed and tested for their response to CSA. All responded to CSA by showing an increase in colony size and number. However, none of the colonies formed from any of the 100 clones differentiated in response to CSA despite the fact that many chemical can induce differentiation of HL-60. since HL-60 forms spontaneous colonies without the addition of any exogenous stimulating factors, HL-60 conditioned media and cell extracts were tested for the production by these cells of their own endogenous growth-promoting activity (such as a CSA-like molecule). No growth-promoting endogenous activity was found that stimulated normal bone marrow or HL-60 colony formation even after concentration and fractionation methods were employed. These experiments suggest that: (1) the effect of CSA markedly favors proliferation over differentiation in these cell lines; (2) CSA is unlikely to suppress growth of the age of the type of leukemic myeloid cells that HL-60 and KG-1 represent; and (3) if HL-60 cells produce their own growth-promoting factor it is not detectable in the media.","['Ruscetti, F W', 'Collins, S J', 'Woods, A M', 'Gallo, R C']","['Ruscetti FW', 'Collins SJ', 'Woods AM', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Clone Cells', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63019-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Aug;58(2):285-92.,,,,

The mean percentage of T lymphocytes in th pleural effusions of ten patients wit nonmalignant diseases was 80.2, and the mean percentage of B lymphocytes was 7.4. In marked contrast, B cells predominated (mean, 83.3%) in the pleural effusions of patients with lymphoma or leukemia.

The hybridomas appear to possess neither natural killing nor antibody-dependent cytolytic activity. Clones of hybrids propagated in culture for over 6 months without the addition of known external stimulus (i.e., independent of cell growth factor and antigen) exhibit specific lytic activity against H-2b tumor cells.

Our results show that conversion of B-tropism to NB-tropism is associated with changes in the primary structure of three gag proteins--p15, p12, and p30.

The cells studied include a clone of myeloid leukemia cells (clone 11) that can be induced to differentiate to macrophages by the protein inducer MGI and the steroid dexamethasone (Dex) and mutant clones that were inducible for differentiation to macrophages by MGI but not by Dex. The mutants were not defective in the specific binding of [3H]Dex to cytoplasmic receptors or in the transport and nuclear binding of the receptor--steroid complex. The protein patterns in the mutants showed both specific constitutive protein changes and nonresponding proteins. Twenty-one percent of the Dex-induced protein changes and 2% of the MGI-induced protein changes in clone 11 were constitutively expressed in the mutants. In addition, 28% of the proteins that responded to Dex in clone 11 did not respond to Dex in the mutants, whereas only 4% of the proteins that responded to MGI in clone 11 did not respond to MGI. The higher percentage of constitutive changes was thus associated with a larger defect in induction. The proteins with an abnormal response to Dex still showed a normal response to MGI, and the constitutive changes and nonresponding proteins were different for the two inducers. It is suggested that specific constitutive protein changes expressed by the mutants produced an asynchrony in the developmental program, resulting in a defective response to Dex and to MGI, and that this may apply to other inducers and developmental programs.","['Cohen, L', 'Sachs, L']","['Cohen L', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Dexamethasone/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.1.353 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Jan;78(1):353-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.1.353.,,PMC319051,,

The results supported the hypothesis that the genetic content of chromosome 15 rather than its translocated state is decisive for the preferential duplication of this chromosome in T-cell leukemogenesis.

ES contains high levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a regulator known to stimulate differentiation of these leukemic cells, but an antiserum which neutralized greater than 85% of the GM-CSF in ES did not suppress the differentiation-inducing activity of ES on WEHI-3B cells. The active factor in endotoxin serum stimulating differentiation in WEHI-3B leukemic cells (GM-DF) was separated from most of the GM-CSF by gel filtration using Ultrogel AcA44. The residual CSF associated with the GM-DF appeared to stimulate selectively granulocytic colonies. Disproportionation of GM-DF and GM-CSF was observed in ES fractions obtained using concanavalin-A/Sepharose chromatography: none of the GM-DF bound to this matrix, whereas 40% of the GM-CSF bound and was eluted with competing alpha methylglucopyranoside. Although no separation of GM-CSF and GM-DF was obtained using DEAE-Sepharose, non-isoelectric focusing in amphoteric buffers indicated charge differences between the differentiation factor and several sub-species of GM-CSF. Sequential purification of GM-DF from ES using 40 - 70% ammonium sulfate precipitation gel filtration and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography resulted in a 25-fold purification. In all fractionation procedures used, a sub-species of GM-CSF, stimulating granulocyte colony formation, was consistently associated with partially purified GM-DF, but some subspecies of GM-CSF clearly lacked any capacity to induce differentiation in the leukemic cells. The observations suggest that the factor in post-endotoxin serum most efficient in enforcing differentiation in myelomonocytic leukemic cells may be a subset of GM-CSF molecules with a selective capacity to stimulate granulocyte colony formation by normal cells.","['Burgess, A W', 'Metcalf, D']","['Burgess AW', 'Metcalf D']",['eng'],"['R0I-CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I-CA-25972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Endotoxins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*isolation & purification', 'Endotoxins/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Mice']",1980/11/15 00:00,1980/11/15 00:01,['1980/11/15 00:00'],"['1980/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910260517 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1980 Nov 15;26(5):647-54. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910260517.,,,,

The steroid dexamethasone, which is an effective inducer of some differentiation-associated properties in this clone, did not induce either MGI-1 or MGI-2. Studies with different clones of myeloid leukemic cells have shown a clonal variation in the induction of MGI-1 and MGI-2.

Sera from I-PRCA patients (P greater than 0.05) but not CLL-PRCA patients (P less than 0.1) inhibited erythroid stem cell proliferation in the presence of complement. BFUE in null cells of all PRCA patients were barely detectable or absent (P less than 0.0025). Normal or I-PRCA T cells increased BFUE proliferation from PRCA null cells of six patients (P less than 0.001). In contrast, CLL-PRCA T cells were poor stimulators of BFUE from autologous (P less than 0.001) or allogeneic null cells (P less than 0.02). Treatment with cyclophosphamide and prednisone induced reticulocytosis in all four CLL-PRCA patients. After treatment, in two cases, the burst promoting function of T lymphocytes was normal. Analysis of T cell subpopulations in two CLL-PRCA patients, suggested that the reduced burst promoting function was due to decreased numbers and/or function of T cells bearing Fc receptors for IgM (TM cells). These findings suggest that reduced generation of a burst promoting activity by CLL-PRCA T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of PRCA in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Mangan, K F', 'Chikkappa, G', 'Scharfman, W B', 'Desforges, J F']","['Mangan KF', 'Chikkappa G', 'Scharfman WB', 'Desforges JF']",['eng'],['HL15157/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*blood/complications', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiopathology']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1981 May;9(5):489-98.,,,,

The properties of the D-factor and CSF and the roles of carbohydrates in the molecules of these factors were examined using tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of asparaginase-linked glycosylation. Although both the D-factor and CSF were produced by L-cells in usual medium containing fetal calf serum, production of D-factor, but not CSF, was reduced by omission of serum from the medium. The activity of the D-factor was slightly decreased by treating the L-cells with tunicamycin (0.5 microgram/ml) in the presence of 2% fetal calf serum, without any decrease in CSF activity. Conditioned medium of L-cells incubated with or without tunicamycin was fractionated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column.

On the other hand, most of the CSF was eluted in the void volume, even when it was produced in the presence of tunicamycin. The D-factor produced in the presence of tunicamycin was more sensitive than normal D-factor was to trypsin or heat treatment at 70 degrees. The CSF produced in the presence of tunicamycin was resistant to these treatments. These results indicate that the D-factor is distinct from CSF. Furthermore, the results suggest that the D-factor produced by L-cells is also a glycoprotein and that, although carbohydrate is not essential for production or activity of the D-factor, it contributes to stabilizing the protein portion of D-factor.","['Yamamoto, Y', 'Tomida, M', 'Hozumi, M', 'Ayusawa, D', 'Seno, T', 'Tamura, G']","['Yamamoto Y', 'Tomida M', 'Hozumi M', 'Ayusawa D', 'Seno T', 'Tamura G']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Clone Cells', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/analysis/*metabolism', 'Glucosamine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', '*Growth Inhibitors', '*Interleukin-6', 'L Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', '*Lymphokines', 'Mice', 'Tunicamycin/*pharmacology']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Jun;41(6):2534-9.,,,,

Histologic compartmentalization of the CRL subtypes was observed in frozen sections of normal lymphoid tissue. CR1+ cells were present in lymphoid follicles interfollicular areas, and in splenic red pulp. CR2+ cells were confined to lymphoid follicles.

These results provide evidence for the suggestion that some cells of the abnormal clone do not express the Ph1 abnormality. Thus, acquisition of Ph1 may not be a sufficient cause for the disease.

There is disagreement in the literature as to whether tumor cytotoxicity can be elicited from all M phi or from a subset of small, newly formed peroxidase-positive (p+) monocytes.

PGE1 was found to be a dose-dependent inhibitor of normal peripheral blood and bone marrow CFUc. Peripheral blood CFUc from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) showed normal inhibition when cultured in the absence of exogenous colony stimulating factor (CSF). The addition of CSF to CML peripheral blood cultures resulted in complete abrogation of normal PGE1 inhibition. Dose-titration studies in which increasing amounts of CSF were added to CML cultures showed decreasing PGE1 inhibition with increasing CSF concentration. This observation indicated increased efficiency of competition between the colony stimulating effect of CSF and the colony inhibitory effect of PGE1 in CML. Peripheral blood CFUc from patients with myelofibrosis/myeloid metaplasia (MM) showed heterogeneous responses to PGE1 with complex dose-effect curves showing variable combinations of stimulation and inhibition of CFUc proliferation. Further studies showed that these effects of PGE1 were blocked by the prostaglandin antagonist SC-19220, and were not due to elaboration of CSF or non-CSF enhancers of CFUc proliferation from MM adherent cells. Cell fractionation studies in 2 patients, with MM showed dual populations of CFUc, one responding abnormally, and another normally to PGE1, accounting in part for the complex dose-response curves. These studies indicate that significant abnormalities exist in the in vitro response to PGE1 by CFUc from patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders. Deficiencies in PGE 1 inhibition may contribute to the excess myelopoiesis seen in these disorders.","['Taetle, R', 'Guittard, J P', 'Mendelsohn, J M']","['Taetle R', 'Guittard JP', 'Mendelsohn JM']",['eng'],"['CA 23100-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 22637/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/immunology', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/immunology', 'Prostaglandins E/*pharmacology']",1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1980 Nov;8(10):1190-1201.,,,,

Varying numbers of malignant Tr cells (2 X 10 to 2 X 10(5) cells) were cocultured with 2 X 10(5) normal bone marrow cells. The malignant Tr cells caused a marked reduction of erythroid colony formation in the plasma clot system.

There was no evidence of inhibitory effects in the serum or the supernatant media of the malignant Tr cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). The malignant Tr cells, stored at --80 degrees C before transfusion, were also capable of suppressing autologous erythroid colony formation after recovery from PRCA. In addition, malignant Tr cells were found to have strong suppressor activity against the immunoglobulin biosynthesis by allogeneic B cells.

The antigen patterns of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells from peripheral blood and established cell lines were nearly identical; the cells were negative for human thymus antigen (OKT6 and NA1/34), positive for pan-T-cell (OKT3, 17F12, 10.2, and 9.6) and helper-T-cell-subset (OKT4) antigens, and negative for T-cell-subset antigens 3A1 and OKT8. In contrast, the phenotypes of malignant T cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were heterogeneous, with at least five patterns of reactivity. The T-cell-specific antibody 3A1 was the only monoclonal reagent that clearly distinguished the peripheral-blood T cells in CTCL (3A1-) from those in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (3A1+). Moreover, 3A1 was the most reliable T-cell marker in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

To determine which SFFV-encoded protein molecule bears the antigen recognized by these neutralizing antibodies, we studied different lots of rat anti-SFFV antiserum by immunoprecipitation and virus neutralization assays. The ability of these sera to neutralize SFFV correlated with the titer of antibodies to p45gag and not with the titer of those to gp52, suggesting that the neutralizing antibodies recognize the p45gag molecule. To verify this specificity for p45gag, we tested antisera to various MuLV gag gene-encoded proteins for neutralization of SFFV. Goat anti-Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RMuLV) p30 and goat anti-RMuLV p10 sera neither precipitated p45gag from SFFV-infected nonproducer cells nor neutralized SFFV. In contrast, goat anti-RMuLV Pr65gag and goat anti-RMuLV p12 sera precipitated p45gag from SFFV-infected cells and also specifically neutralized SFFV in the Friend virus complex. These findings suggest that, unlike the gag proteins coded for by FMuLV, the proteins coded for by defective SFFV are incorporated into the envelope of virions carrying the SFFV genome, but not into the envelope of those carrying the helper FMuLV genome.","['Anand, R', 'Ruscetti, S', 'Steeves, R A', 'Lilly, F']","['Anand R', 'Ruscetti S', 'Steeves RA', 'Lilly F']",['eng'],"['09060/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA 19873/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Defective Viruses/*immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Helper Viruses/immunology', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/immunology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Rats', 'Viral Proteins/*immunology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.37.1.55-60.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Jan;37(1):55-60. doi: 10.1128/JVI.37.1.55-60.1981.,,PMC170981,,

Analysis of the subpopulations of thymocytes demonstrated that they represent a heterogeneous population of cells with respect to their size, proliferative activity, and presence and quantities of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and human thymus leukemia-associated antigen, a thymic isozyme of adenosine deaminase (HThy-L/ADA). Only a minor subpopulation of thymocytes (large cells) was in active cycle. The highest level of HThy-L/ADA was associated with the main subpopulation of thymocytes sedimenting at 3 to 4 mm/hr while low amounts of the HThy-L/ADA antigen (enzyme) were found in the minor fractions of the small and large cells. The distribution of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-positive cells indicated that most, but not all, thymocytes contain the enzyme. Analysis of the T-cell line MOLT-3 showed that these cells could be separated into subpopulations with different biochemical and biological properties. More than one subpopulation of cells was capable of DNA synthesis. In contrast to the thymocytes, all fractions of MOLT-3 cells contained high amounts of HThy-L/ADA. The proportion of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-positive cells as a function of sedimentation velocity was also quite constant although there was a slight but reproducible drop in the percentage of these cells in the slowly sedimenting fractions. The percentage of cells with receptors for sheep erythrocytes also remained high in fractions separated on the basis of size, although a consistently higher percentage was found in smaller cells. These studies indicated that thymus cells as well as the malignant T-cell line MOLT-3 can be separated on the basis of sedimentation velocity into subpopulations with different biological and biochemical properties. The data also indicated that the heterogeneity of MOLT-3 line cannot be explained solely on the basis of volume changes due to cell cycle, suggesting that they may represent heterogeneous populations of cells.","['Okamura, S', 'Chechik, B E', 'Lee, C', 'Gelfand, E W', 'Mak, T W']","['Okamura S', 'Chechik BE', 'Lee C', 'Gelfand EW', 'Mak TW']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/analysis/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 May;41(5):1664-8.,,,,

Correlation with clinical stage and findings in B-prolymphocytic leukaemia.,539-44,"The proportion of T gamma and T mu lymphocytes was studied in 40 cases of B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and six of B-prolymphocytic leukaemia (B-PLL). The significant increase in T gamma cells, previously reported in two small B-CLL series, was confirmed and shown to be directly correlated with the clinical stages of the disease (P less than 0.01 to less than 0.001). The normal T mu:T gamma ratio (2.3:1) was reversed in B-CLL (1:1.4) and B-PLL (1:1.9). The proportion of T mu cells was decreased but was not related to stage. Our findings suggest that the increase in T gamma cells may be responsible for the hypogammaglobulinaemia of B-CLL. This is supported by two sets of observations. First, serum Ig levels were more often normal in cases in Stages 0 and I than in Stages II-IV (P less than 0.05), while the levels of two or three Ig classes were below normal in Stages II-IV twice as frequently. Secondly, splenic irradiation in one case was followed by a fall in the absolute number of T gamma lymphocytes, a reversion to normal of the T mu: T gamma ratio and an improvement in serum Ig levels. Thus, the imbalance in ;the regulatory T-cell subsets may provide an important clue to understand the pathogenic mechanism of the immunodeficiency in the chronic B-cell leukaemias.","['Catovsky, D', 'Lauria, F', 'Matutes, E', 'Foa, R', 'Mantovani, V', 'Tura, S', 'Galton, D A']","['Catovsky D', 'Lauria F', 'Matutes E', 'Foa R', 'Mantovani V', 'Tura S', 'Galton DA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/radiotherapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Spleen/radiation effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*classification/immunology']",1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb02682.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1981 Apr;47(4):539-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb02682.x.,,,,

These tumors often occur concurrently with Hodgkin's disease and are not as clearly related to therapy as are other secondary tumors. Presumably, the immune deficiency state found in Hodgkin's disease plays an important role. A patient with Hodgkin's disease and simultaneous acute lymphocytic leukemia is reported. The leukemia was B cell in type, a rare form that most likely is identical to acute lymphosarcoma cell leukemia of immature cell type. This case expands the spectrum of lymphoid neoplasms known to occur with Hodgkin's disease.

Thymocyte heterogeneity was also analyzed directly in tissue sections and in double labeling assays in combination with TdT staining, a marker for cortical thymocytes. Many large thymic blasts (in fetal and infant thymus) showed reactivity with OKT11--a pan-T reagent, but had only weak or negligible activity with the other antibodies. Cortical thymocytes reacted strongly with OKT11, 6, 4, and 8, whereas medullary cells reacted with OKT11, 3, 4 (majority) and 8 (minority).

Another monoclonal antibody, FMC1, which reacts specifically with B lymphocytes, binds a separate antigenic determinant.

These proteins differ antigenically, structurally, and in their cellular distribution. T cells can be distinguished by the synthesis and presence in the plasma membrane of 225-MICG, Null cells by the appearance of 185-MICG, and B cells by the appearance of both 225- and 185-MICG. The characterization of these two proteins in the monoclonal B lymphocytes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia forms the basis of this report. Using immunofluorescent microscopy, we found only 225-MICG on the surface of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in 15 patients, whereas control B cells from 20 individuals displayed both 225- and 185-MICG. When MICG proteins were isolated and compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, normal B cells showed two stained bands, corresponding to 225- and 185-MICG, whereas the CLL cells demonstrated only the 225-MICG band. Using labeled amino acid incorporation into cellular protein, normal B cells were shown to synthesize 225- and 185-MICG, whereas CLL cells synthesized only 225-MICG, as determined by immune or cold precipitation of labeled cell lysates. When labeled secretions from B cells and CLL cells were analyzed by immune precipitation, 225- and 185-MICG were secreted by B cells, whereas neither protein was secreted by CLL cells. When normal B cells and CLL cells were mixed, incubated, and lysed together, both 225- and 185-MICG were present, thus excluding proteolysis as a cause of the absence of 185-MICG in CLL. The lack of 185-MICG in CLL distinguishes leukemic cells from normal B lymphocytes. Furthermore, the absence of this normal cell surface protein in these leukemic cells suggests a role for 185-MICG in the malignant transformation of lymphocytes.","['Simmonds, M A', 'Sobczak, G', 'Hauptman, S P']","['Simmonds MA', 'Sobczak G', 'Hauptman SP']",['eng'],"['AM 07084/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26369-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI110076 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1981 Mar;67(3):624-31. doi: 10.1172/JCI110076.,,PMC370610,,

The plasma levels of granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating activity (CSA) of normal and leukemic plasmas were the same when undiluted or unfractionated plasmas were tested. However, dilution or fractionation revealed elevations in plasma CSA levels in the leukemic animals. Most of the activity in both normal and leukemic plasma eluted in the void-volume peak during Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, and the CSA levels in the leukemic peak were increased 5- to 10-fold. This increase did not reflect higher levels of an inhibitory lipoprotein eluting in the void volume since the differential between normal and leukemic plasma was present after delipidation. We therefore investigated the possibility that a nonlipoprotein inhibitor was present. Sephadex G-200 chromatography of leukemic plasma revealed that a potent inhibitor of colony formation was present in one of the peaks of material eluting from the column. Eight micrograms of this material inhibited colony formation by 50%. This inhibitory material was not detected in corresponding fractions obtained after chromatography of normal plasma. These data show that plasma from the chick with myeloblastic leukemia has marked elevated levels of CSA and that it also contains an inhibitor of colony formation which is absent or present at very low levels in normal plasma. Finally, leukemic plasma contained abundant amounts of avian myeloblastosis virus polypeptides which are being investigated for possible relationships to the above-described activities.","['Bryant, D', 'Smith, R', 'Sharma, S', 'Dodge, W']","['Bryant D', 'Smith R', 'Sharma S', 'Dodge W']",['eng'],"['CA-12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-12323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '77538-12-6 (colony inhibiting factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/physiology', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Lipoproteins/blood/physiology', 'Monocytes/*physiology', '*Proteins']",1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Nov;40(11):4031-6.,,,,

The long latency periods, requirement for an acute viraemia and monoclonality of the tumours distinguish leukaemogenesis from neoplasias induced by the acute transforming viruses and suggest an indirect mechanism. Consistent with this is the lack of in vitro transforming activity of replication-competent leukaemogenic viruses. We have shown previously that the presence of T cells which proliferate in vitro in response to viral antigens is uniquely associated with the conditions leading to leukaemia. Based on these observations we have hypothesized that chronic immune stimulation is required for leukaemogenesis. We now demonstrate that CBA/N mice, when inoculated as newborns with Moloney leukaemia virus (MoLV), develop an acute viraemia but do not develop leukaemia or have detectable T-cell responses against the virus. This supports the hypothesis that chronic immune stimulation is essential for leukaemogenesis.","['Lee, J C', 'Ihle, J N']","['Lee JC', 'Ihle JN']",['eng'],['N01-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred CBA/immunology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Viremia/immunology', 'Virus Replication']",1981/01/29 00:00,1981/01/29 00:01,['1981/01/29 00:00'],"['1981/01/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/29 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/289407a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1981 Jan 29;289(5796):407-9. doi: 10.1038/289407a0.,,,,

Furthermore, we have studied two cell lines (Hut 78 and Hut 102) derived from malignant Sezary T cells from CTCL patients. The monoclonal antibody 3A1 defines a major human PB T cell subset (85% of PB T cells) while the antigen defined by the monoclonal antibody 4F2 is present on a subset (70%) of activated PB T cells and on circulating PB monocytes. In contrast to normal subjects in whom 60-70% of circulating PB mononuclear cells were 3A1(+) T cells, PB mononuclear cells from six CTCL patients studied had an average of only 10.6+/-3.2% 3A1(+) T cells. Whereas 85% of E-rosette positive cells from normal individuals were 3A1(+), virtually all E-rosette positive T cells from the Sezary patients were 3A1(-). Two patients with high numbers of circulating Sezary T cells had both aneuploid and diploid PB T cell populations present; after separation of PB T cells into 3A1(+) and 3A1(-) cell suspensions, all 3A1(-) cells were found to be aneuploid. In contrast to normal resting PB T cells which were 4F2(-), all PB Sezary cells were 4F2(+), suggesting a state of activation. The 3A1 antigen was on a variety of acute lymphoblastic leukemia T cell lines (HSB-2, RPMI-8402, MOLT4, CEM) but was absent on the Hut 78 and Hut 102 Sezary T cell lines. Using rabbit anti-human T and anti-human Ia (p23, 30) antisera, we found that all malignant Sezary PB cells tested were killed by anti-T cell antiserum plus complement but not by anti-Ia plus complement. In contrast, Sezary cell lines Hut 78 and 102, were killed by both anti-T cell antiserum and anti-Ia plus complement. Similar to 3A1(-) normal PB T cells, 3A1(-) Sezary PB T cells proliferated poorly to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A. However, 3A1(-) Sezary T cells were able to provide T cell help towards pokeweed mitogen-induced in vitro B cell immunoglobulin synthesis, an immunoregulatory function limited to 3A1(+) T cells in normal subjects.Thus, the 3A1 antigen is present on 85% of normal PB T cells, and on most T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia lines tested; in contrast the 3A1 antigen is not present on the majority of circulating malignant Sezary PB T cells nor on T cell lines derived from malignant Sezary T cells. The lack of expression of the 3A1 antigen may be associated with malignant transformation of T cells in CTCL and may be an important marker for tracing the clonal origin of the malignant Sezary T cell.","['Haynes, B F', 'Bunn, P', 'Mann, D', 'Thomas, C', 'Eisenbarth, G S', 'Minna, J', 'Fauci, A S']","['Haynes BF', 'Bunn P', 'Mann D', 'Thomas C', 'Eisenbarth GS', 'Minna J', 'Fauci AS']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immune Sera)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/*immunology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Sezary Syndrome/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI110062 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1981 Feb;67(2):523-30. doi: 10.1172/JCI110062.,,PMC370595,,

The modulation was effective for both xenogeneic (rabbit) and syngeneic (guinea-pig strain 2) complements, but more rapid for the latter. It appeared simply to require the action of antibody on a metabolically active cell: no requirement could be demonstrated for any serum component other than antibody, and there was a need to raise the temperature to 37 degrees after attachment of the antibody. There was molecular specificity inasmuch as modulation with anti-Ig failed to confer any resistance to lysis by another antibody (anti-Ia) plus complement.","['Gordon, J', 'Robinson, D S', 'Stevenson, G T']","['Gordon J', 'Robinson DS', 'Stevenson GT']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Temperature']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1981 Jan;42(1):7-12.,,PMC1458195,,

Relationship to redistribution of the antigen.,13-7,"Experiments were carried out on guinea-pig L2C leukaemic lymphocytes to investigate the mechanism of antigenic modulation of their surface immunoglobulin (Ig) defined as the conferring by anti-Ig of resistance to lysis by anti-Ig plus complement. The phenomenon reflects, and is probably a consequence of, redistribution of the Ig molecules by bivalent antibody. Fab fragments of the antibody were completely ineffective. Parallel studies by indirect immunofluorescence of the movement of th surface antigen-antibody complexes revealed that modulation for syngeneic complement was apparent when the complexes were minimally aggregated: capping and extensive endocytosis were not necessary. Modulation for xenogeneic (rabbit) complement required more extensive movement but was still appreciable while complexes persisted on the surface. Sodium azide at 10 mM, which inhibits antibody-induced redistribution of surface molecules, diminished modulation. In experiments omitting pre-incubation with antibody alone, the presence of azide during incubations with anti-Ig plus syngeneic complement increased lysis from a low and variable to a consistently high level; there was no effect on the already high level of lysis occurring with the non-modulating anti-Ia plus syngeneic complement. This effect of azide provides further evidence that antigenic modulation can be a major factor determining a cell's survival when it is confronted simultaneously by antibody and complement.","['Gordon, J', 'Stevenson, G T']","['Gordon J', 'Stevenson GT']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Immunologic Capping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1981 Jan;42(1):13-7.,,PMC1458209,,

SP1 detection rates and concentrations appeared to increase in the sera of cervical carcinoma and leukemia patients in accordance with the progress of the diseases. SP1 concentrations in the sera of women in early pregnancy were not correlative to measured E2 and E3 concentrations in the same samples, but there was a significant correlation with progesterone and HCG concentrations. The RIA method for measuring SP1, which we have established, is available for measuring SP1 in the low concentration range. The method is expected to be applied clinically, such as in examinations in early pregnancy, and will be available in fundamental studies such as attempts to measure the SP1 movement in malignant tumour patients, in cooperation with studies of the meaning of SP1 production at pregnancy.","['Maeda, K', 'Nishiyama, Y', 'Nose, Y', 'Murata, K', 'Yamaguchi, H', 'Ito, M', 'Hayakawa, S', 'Imaizumi, H', 'Sugiyama, Y']","['Maeda K', 'Nishiyama Y', 'Nose Y', 'Murata K', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Ito M', 'Hayakawa S', 'Imaizumi H', 'Sugiyama Y']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Naibunpi Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Naibunpi Gakkai zasshi,0413717,"['0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Pregnancy-Specific beta 1-Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Amniotic Fluid/analysis', 'Choriocarcinoma/blood', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/analysis', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*analysis', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First', 'Pregnancy-Specific beta 1-Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Radioimmunoassay/*methods', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/blood', 'Uterine Neoplasms/blood']",1980/07/20 00:00,1980/07/20 00:01,['1980/07/20 00:00'],"['1980/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1507/endocrine1927.56.7_945 [doi]'],ppublish,Nihon Naibunpi Gakkai Zasshi. 1980 Jul 20;56(7):945-61. doi: 10.1507/endocrine1927.56.7_945.,,,,

The effect on colony formation was studied in order to compare the results with those obtained with normal mouse bone marrow cells grown in a similar manner in previous studies and in additional experiments presented. Light microscopy could not be used for colony counting of L1210 cells because MTX did not inhibit colony formation and only affected further colony growth. Therefore, it was necessary to evaluate the toxic effect of MTX by analysis of colony size distribution using an electronic image analyzer. Results show that the reversal of MTX toxicity to L1210 cells with leucovorin is competitive and is similar to that with normal mouse bone marrow cells. Thymidine in combination with a purine prevents MTX toxicity as well. The optimal concentration of thymidine is 10(-5) M, whereas at least 10(-4) M purine is required. Reversal of MTX toxicity by thymidine and purines is independent of the MTX concentration and is possible at drug concentrations as high as 10(-4) M. Compared to mouse bone marrow cells, L1210 cells appear to require more purines to prevent the toxic effects of MTX. MTX toxicity towards bone marrow myeloid precursor cells can be reversed by 10(-4) M inosine alone. These cells are better protected against MTX toxicity when 10(-6) to 10(-5) M thymidine is added. The results suggest that the use of a high-purine-low-thymidine combination has advantages over the use of leucovorin in controlling toxicity over a wide range of MTX concentrations and in providing some degree of selective protection to normal proliferating cells.","['Nederbragt, H', 'Uitendaal, M P', 'van der Grint, L', 'Leyva, A', 'Pinedo, H M']","['Nederbragt H', 'Uitendaal MP', 'van der Grint L', 'Leyva A', 'Pinedo HM']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Purines)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Inosine/pharmacology', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/pharmacology']",1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Mar;41(3):1193-8.,,,,

Inhibition of this enzyme in vitro and in vivo results in an impairment in lymphoblast proliferation. We have investigated the pharmacologic inhibition of this enzyme by 2'-deoxycoformycin in 15 patients with hematologic malignancies. Biochemical consequences of the administration of this agent were closely monitored in erythrocytes, nucleated peripheral blood and bone marrow cells, serum, and urine. A marked rise in erythrocyte dATP was accompanied by a depletion of ATP in those patients exhibiting toxicity. Most patients excreted large amounts of deoxyadenosine but not adenosine in the urine. Serum deoxyadenosine rose in patients demonstrating a marked decrease in cell mass. The biochemical disturbances and clinical toxicity, including hepatic, renal, and conjunctival abnormalities, were usually reversible. Central nervous system toxicity, which potentially was the most serious consequence, was associated with high erythrocyte dATP/ATP ratios and high levels of cerebrospinal fluid deoxyadenosine. In patients with lymphoma and leukemia, objective responses were observed but were short-lived. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia receiving weekly low doses of the drug demonstrated minimal toxicity and some efficacy.

Classification by lymphoblast surface markers showed 22 T-cell, 71 null cell, and 3 B-cell leukemias; 3 cases were unclassifiable and 1 had both T- and B-cell markers.

Most patients with mediastinal masses, 5 of thymus and 4 of the non-thymus type, fared poorly with a median duration of continuous complete remission of less than 12 months as compared with greater than 48 months for those without such masses. The most satisfactory model to estimate remission duration in children without mediastinal masses was dependent upon initial WBC, sex, race, and surface markers. Low WBC, white race, female sex, and T-cell markers in patients without mediastinal masses were associated with a favorable prognosis.

T cell responses of preleukemic BALB/c mice to Moloney leukemia virus antigens.,715-22,"The T cell responses of Moloney leukemia virus (MoLV)-infected preleukemic BALB/c mice were examined. The major in vitro response detectable was T cell blastogenesis in response to the major viral envelope protein MoLV gp71 and an internal viral protein p12. The majority of the preleukemic mice had readily detectable responses to gp71, whereas the presence of a response to p12 was less consistent. With both antigens, T cell blastogenesis showed typical antigen response characteristics similar to those detected in other immune responses to C-type viruses. Proliferation was dependent on a Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, 2- population and was macrophage-independent. In contrast to most immune responses to C-type viruses, which are temporally restricted, T cell blastogenesis was detectable throughout the preleukemic period of 4 to 16 wk of age. During this period neither gp71-specific T cells nor PHA-responsive T cells were found to express viral antigens. The correlations between T cells responding to gp71 and leukemia were examined. Under conditions in which MoLV inoculation of BALB/c mice does not induce leukemia, no T cell responses were deectable. These results suggest a causal relationship between the presence of antigen-specific T cells and the ability of MoLV to induce leukemia. The results are discussed with reference to the possible role of chronic immune stimulation in virus-induced leukemogenesis.","['Lee, J C', 'Horak, I', 'Ihle, J N']","['Lee JC', 'Horak I', 'Ihle JN']",['eng'],['N01-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Antigens, Viral', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Preleukemia/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/microbiology', 'Time Factors', 'Viremia/immunology']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1981 Feb;126(2):715-22.,,,,

However, when neonatal mice that were injected with Moloney-murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV carrier) were subsequently challenged as adults with M-MSV, the sarcomas did not regress nor did they generate CTL. This failure to produce CTL cannot be ascribed to nonspecific immunodepressive effects or to suppressor cell generation since M-MuLV carrier mice exhibit normal reactivity after allogeneic cell stimulation. Moreover, addition of M-MuLV-infected cells as the third party to cultures does not reduce activity of CTL from M-MSV immune mice. Since M-MSV and M-MuLV possess common antigens, the observed unresponsiveness was considered in relationship to induction of a T lymphocyte tolerance, which may follow introduction of foreign antigens at an early stage of development. In fact, it was observed that as early as 10 days after injection, thymus, lymph node, and spleen from M-MuLV carrier mice express virus-induced cell-surface antigens that not only are targets for M-MSV-immune CTL, but also induce in vitro a strong specific cytotoxic response. In addition, a cold target inhibition assay disclosed that the same antigens are shared by both M-MuLV infected and leukemia cells, even though they are less expressed on the surface of the former. The finding that the cytotoxicity of alloreactive lymphocytes from M-MuLV carrier mice is reduced after preincubation with M-MSV immune CTL confirms that virus infection does not bring about functional inactivation of lymphocytes. Finally, it was observed that virus antigen presence on lymphocytes from M-MuLV neonatally injected mice is closely related to subsequent leukemia development.","['Collavo, D', 'Zanovello, P', 'Biasi, G', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L']","['Collavo D', 'Zanovello P', 'Biasi G', 'Chieco-Bianchi L']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', '*Antigens, Surface', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1981 Jan;126(1):187-93.,,,,

The source of the factor is a T-lymphoblast cell line (Mo) that was derived from a patient with a T-cell variant of hairy-cell leukemia. The Mo line constitutively produces a number of lymphokines that are normally produced by mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes. Medium conditioned by Mo cells grown in the absence of serum is especially rich in CSF activity, and using this source we have purified the CSF to a specific activity of about 3.5 x 10(6) colonies per 10(5) Ficoll-Hypaque-separated human bone marrow cells plated per mg protein. The Mo CSF stimulates the formation of both granulocyte and macrophage colonies in vitro (in about equal numbers) and it has a relatively steep dose-response curve. Both the crude and purified preparations stimulated the formation of eosinophil as well as neutrophil colonies; it is unclear whether this is due to the presence of multiple factors with similar physical properties or a single factor with multiple activities. The CSF has little stimulating activity for mouse bone marrow progenitors. Physically, the Mo CSF is an acidic glycoprotein of molecular weight about 34,000. It binds to concanavalin A-Sepharose, is unusually resistant to denaturing agents and heat treatment, and is not inactivated in the presence of sulfhydryl reagents. The Mo CSF is distinct from factors stimulating erythroid colony formation and inhibiting neutrophil migration that are also produced by Mo cells. It differs in several physical and biologic properties from other human CSFs that have been characterized.","['Lusis, A J', 'Quon, D H', 'Golde, D W']","['Lusis AJ', 'Quon DH', 'Golde DW']",['eng'],"['CA 15619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 00865/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*isolation & purification', 'Culture Media', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis', 'Macrophages/cytology/*physiology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Species Specificity', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Temperature']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71568-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Jan;57(1):13-21.,,,,

Mononuclear spleen cell conditioned media stimulated myeloid CFU-GM by human nonadherent marrow target cells. In contrast to conditioned media produced by marrow and peripheral blood cells, the vast majority of spleen CSA was generated by nonadherent lymphoid cells rather than adherent monocytic cells. The nonadherent cells producing CSA were non-T cells (assessed by sheep erythrocyte rosetting), with 98% +/- 2% CSA produced by the nonrosetted fraction (B lymphocytes and null cells), and had a peak density heavier than that of the adherent spleen CSA-producing cells. Dose response curves demonstrated significantly increased cellular CSA production from patients with lymphomas and AML in remission. In a high proportion of patients, foci of immature granulocytic cells were found by specific cytochemical staining of histologic sections of spleens. A limited degree of splenic granulocytopoiesis was demonstrated morphologically and by CFU-GM incidence. CSA was not detectable in conditioned medium prepared from nonadherent spleen cells from 5 patients with CML, due to a nondialyzable substances(s) produced by the nonadherent cells which inhibited normal CFU-GM response to CSA. The high CFU-GM incidence and extensive leukemic granulocytopoiesis present in the CML spleens suggests diminished effect of this inhibitor on leukemic as opposed to normal granulocytic precursor cell proliferation.","['Greenberg, P L', 'Steed, S M']","['Greenberg PL', 'Steed SM']",['eng'],['CA-05838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*biosynthesis/urine', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Lymphoma/*blood', 'Rosette Formation', 'Spleen/pathology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71585-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Jan;57(1):119-29.,,,,

Additional studies were therefore carried out using purified populations of B, T and null cells as well as normal mononuclear cell populations, so as to determine the nature of the cells responsible for induction of the reaction and further delineate the factors capable of modifying this pattern of reactivity. Populations of T cells alone gave the largest reaction whereas both B cells from patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia and null cells from patients with acute lymphatic leukemia failed completely to induce a GVHR. The addition of anti-T-lymphocytic serum abolished the reaction, providing further proof of the role played by T lymphocytes. Thymic hormone (THF) was found to enhance the reaction when applied both in vivo and in vitro. The immunostimulatory agents transfer factor and levamisole also enhanced the GVHR obtained with normal mononuclear cells. Cytoxan was found to have an enhancing effect at low doses and an inhibiting effect at high doses. Trypsin also acted to abolish the GVHR. The combination of two populations of normal mononuclears always gave a larger GVHR, indicating allogeneic antigen stimulation. Depletion of the monocytes from the population of normal mononuclears resulted in a smaller reaction, providing further evidence that monocytes are required for T-lymphocyte antigen-induced reactivity. On the basis of these findings it is proposed that the local xenogeneic GVHR is a useful clinical test for the measurement of immunocompetence of T lymphocytes, for the differential diagnosis of leukemias and for the determination of the effectiveness of THF.","['Shohat, B', 'Trainin, N']","['Shohat B', 'Trainin N']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Thymus,Thymus,8009032,"['0 (Transfer Factor)', '1404-86-0 (Trichophytin)', '2880D3468G (Levamisole)', '9H198D04WL (Thymic Factor, Circulating)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Levamisole/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/transplantation', 'Phagocytes/transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymic Factor, Circulating/pharmacology', 'Transfer Factor/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Trichophytin/pharmacology']",1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Thymus. 1980 Sep;2(2):93-105.,,,,

Framycetin, colymycin, nystatin, and metronidazole were given in 35 neutropenic episodes in 33 children, while co-trimoxazole and lactobacilli preparation were administered in 35 episodes in 35 children. The diseases, severity of neutropenia, and incidence of infection at entry into study were comparable in the two groups. There was no significant difference in the incidence of infections developing during the phase of neutropenia. The median and range of time required to recover from neutropenia were also not different. Co-trimoxazole and lactobacilli were significantly better tolerated, there being no nausea and vomiting, no refusal to take medication, no dose reduction or change to an alternative regimen. We conclude that co-trimoxazole and lactobacilli preparation improve quality of life during a neutropenic episode and have the additional advantage of being relatively inexpensive.","['Ekert, H', 'Jurk, I H', 'Waters, K D', 'Tiedemann, K']","['Ekert H', 'Jurk IH', 'Waters KD', 'Tiedemann K']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '1400-61-9 (Nystatin)', '4BOC774388 (Framycetin)', '77097-79-1 (synerlac)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'AN164J8Y0X (Trimethoprim)', 'JE42381TNV (Sulfamethoxazole)', 'Z67X93HJG1 (Colistin)']",IM,"['Agranulocytosis/*therapy', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*prevention & control', 'Biological Products/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colistin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Combinations/therapeutic use', 'Framycetin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Lactobacillus', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Neutropenia/*therapy', 'Nystatin/therapeutic use', 'Sulfamethoxazole/*therapeutic use', 'Trimethoprim/*therapeutic use', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950080108 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1980;8(1):47-51. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950080108.,,,,
