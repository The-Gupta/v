The companion review, Leif et al., Cytometry 2006;69A:767-778, described a new technique for the enhancement of lanthanide luminescence, the Resonance Energy Transfer Enhanced Luminescence (RETEL) effect, which increases luminescence and is compatible with standard slide microscopy. METHODS: The luminescence of the europium ion macrocyclic complex, EuMac, was increased by employing the RETEL effect. After adding the nonluminescent gadolinium ion complex of the thenoyltrifluoroacetonate (TTFA) ligand or the sodium salt of TTFA in ethanol solution, the EuMac-labeled sample was allowed to dry. Both a conventional arc lamp and a time-gated UV LED served as light sources for microscopic imaging. The emission intensity was measured with a CCD camera. Multiple time-gated images were summed with special software to permit analysis and effective presentation of the final image. RESULTS: With the RETEL effect, the luminescence of the EuMac-streptavidin conjugate increased at least six-fold upon drying. Nuclei of apoptotic cells were stained with DAPI and tailed with 5BrdUrd to which a EuMac-anti-5BrdU conjugate was subsequently attached. Time-gated images showed the long-lived EuMac luminescence but did not show the short-lived DAPI fluorescence. Imaging of DNA-synthesizing cells with an arc lamp showed that both S phase and apoptotic cells were labeled, and that their labeling patterns were different. The images of the luminescent EuMac and fluorescent DAPI were combined to produce a color image on a white background. This combination of simple chemistry, instrumentation, and presentation should make possible the inexpensive use of the lanthanide macrocycles, Quantum Dyes, as molecular diagnostics for cytological and histopathological microscopic imaging.",['(c) 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology.'],"['Leif, Robert C', 'Vallarino, Lidia M', 'Becker, Margie C', 'Yang, Sean']","['Leif RC', 'Vallarino LM', 'Becker MC', 'Yang S']","['Newport Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA. rleif@rleif.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Moreover, quercetin induced caspase-3 and cytochrome c-dependent apoptosis almost exclusively in the former cell line. Exposure of K562 cells to quercetin caused also a significant increase of cells in G(2)/M phase that reached the maximum peak at 24 h (4-fold with respect to the basal value). The major sensitivity exhibited by K562 cells was only in part imputable to their higher glutathione content, as compared to HSB-2 cells, thus confirming previous reports describing the formation of intracellular quercetin-thiol toxic adducts in cells exposed to the flavonoid. In fact, after induction of intracellular glutathione increase we detected in both cell lines a significant rise of apoptotic cells, again more marked in K562 cells. By contrast, glutathione-depleted cells, failed to show a decrease of apoptosis in both cell lines, thus contradicting our previous findings and literature data. Since the yet unresolved question about the anti-oxidant or the pro-oxidant capacity of quercetin, we investigated which of these two properties worked in our experimental model. Interestingly, not only quercetin did not produce reactive oxygen species but also prevented their formation, as observed in cells exposed to the oxidizing agent ter-butylhydroperoxide, acting as an efficient oxygen radicals scavenger. This result indicates that quercetin exhibited, in these cell lines, anti-oxidant more than pro-oxidant ability.",,"['Brisdelli, Fabrizia', 'Coccia, Cristina', 'Cinque, Benedetta', 'Cifone, Maria Grazia', 'Bozzi, Argante']","['Brisdelli F', 'Coccia C', 'Cinque B', 'Cifone MG', 'Bozzi A']","[""Department of Biochemical Sciences and Technologies, University of L'Aquila, Via Vetoio, Coppito 2, 67100 L'Aquila, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2006/09/14 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2006/09/14 09:00'],"['2006/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-006-9307-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2007 Feb;296(1-2):137-49. doi: 10.1007/s11010-006-9307-3.

The study presented here analyses the relationship between mitotic activity in standardised cytogenetic bone marrow preparations from three haematological diseases and diagnostic and clinical parameters, most importantly the outcome. The disorders studied were: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (N=107), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (N=166) and aplastic anemia in childhood (AA) (N=39). A strict protocol of quantitative standardisation of cytogenetic slides was adhered to ensuring comparability both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The samples were studied after short-term incubation without mitogenic in vitro stimuli. The most important findings include: i) ALL: Immunological subtypes can be differentiated according to their proliferation profile; there is a striking difference between childhood and adult ALL in proliferation activity; most importantly initial proliferation is much higher in patients who will relapse than in those with stable remission. ii) CML: Philadelphia-positive CML shows proliferation activities quite distinct from Philadelphia-negative CML; however there is only a small change in the proliferative activity from the chronic phase to the accelerated phase or blast crisis. iii) AA: Very low proliferation scores rise quickly to near normal levels during immunosuppressive therapy in most patients. Higher levels at diagnosis are associated with a faster and better response to therapy.

The principal aim of this study was to focus the incidence and the outcome of TMA in the era of more complex HSCTs. METHODS: We analyzed the role of some predicting factors for the incidence and the outcome of TMA after HSCT. We enrolled 539 consecutive patients (307 males, median age 31 years) undergoing HSCT from match or mismatch human leukocyte antigen family donor (314) or match/mismatch unrelated (195) and haploidentical donor (30) for malignant or nonmalignant diseases. TMA diagnosis was performed by homogeneous clinical and laboratory criteria. RESULTS: Sixty-four of 539 patients presented TMA (11,87%) and the five-year cumulative incidence of TMA was 14% (HR=0.13). Fifty nine of 64 patients were affected by malignant and 5/64 by non-malignant diseases. On multivariate analysis, TMA occurrence was influenced by graft versus host disease >grade II (P=0.0001), donor type (P=0.029), gender (P=0.0233), total body irradiation based conditioning regimen (P=0.0041). Three factors for TMA outcome proved to be statistically significant by multivariate analysis: age (P=0.009), donor type (P=0.0187) and TMA index (P=0.029). The TMA mortality rate was 50%. The outcome was influenced by defibrotide (P=0.02 in univariate analysis).

In gastric cancer, the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein is expressed in up to 75% of all cases and associated with poor prognosis. The biological relevance of Mcl-1 expression in gastric cancer is unclear. Thus, we investigated the functional significance and potential role of Mcl-1 as a molecular target in gastric cancer by using an antisense strategy. Gastric cancer cell lines (NCI-N87, MKN-28, MKN-45) were treated with Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides. Protein expression, cell growth and apoptosis were assessed for single-agent Mcl-1 AS oligonucleotide treatment and for combinations with docetaxel or cisplatin. Treatment by Mcl-1 AS oligonucleotides resulted in approximately 50% reduction in Mcl-1 protein levels in all gastric cancer cell lines examined. Surprisingly, dose-dependent Mcl-1 downregulation produced a significant increase in apoptosis and up to 60% decrease in cell growth. Moreover, combination of Mcl-1 AS oligonucleotide with docetaxel or cisplatin displayed synergistic anti-tumor activity.

Eg5, a microtubule-associated motor protein has been described to be highly expressed in BC CML by microarray analysis (Nowicki et al., Oncogene 2003; 22:3952-63). We investigated the regulation of Eg5 by Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase and its potential as a therapeutic target in BC CML. Eg5 was highly expressed in all Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph(+)) cell lines and BC CML patient samples. Inhibition of Bcr-Abl by Imatinib downregulated Eg5 expression in Imatinib-sensitive KBM5 and HL-60p185 cells, but not in Imatinib-resistant KBM5-STI571, harboring a T315I mutation, and Bcr-Abl-negative HL-60 cells. Blocking Eg5 expression with antisense oligonucleotide (Eg5-ASO) or inhibiting its activity with the small-molecule Eg5 inhibitor, S-trityl-L-cysteine induced G(2)/M cell cycle block and subsequent cell death in both Imatinib-sensitive and -resistant cells. Further, Eg5-ASO treatment of SCID mice harboring KBM5 cell xenografts significantly prolonged the median survival of the animals (p = 0.03). Our findings suggest that Eg5 is downstream of and regulated by Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in Philadelphia chromosome positive cells. Inhibition of Eg5 expression or its activity blocks cell cycle progression and induces cell death independent of the cellular response to Imatinib.

Since then, there have been over 11,000 mutations in the three RAS (HRAS, KRAS and NRAS) genes in codons 12, 13 and 61 reported in the literature. We report here the identification of recurrent somatic missense mutations at alanine 146, a highly conserved residue in the guanine nucleotide binding domain. In two independent series of colorectal cancers from Hong Kong and the United States we detected KRAS A146 mutations in 7/126 and 2/94 cases, respectively, giving a combined frequency of 4%. We also detected KRAS A146 mutations in 2/40 (5%) colorectal cell lines, including the NCI-60 colorectal cancer line HCC2998.

The B-lymphoidPAX5 gene participates in the generation of the t(9;14)(p13;q32) translocation in germinal center B cells, which leads to deregulated PAX5 expression under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus in a subset of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Here we reconstructed a human t(9;14) translocation in a knock-in mouse by inserting a PAX5 minigene into the IgH locus. The IgH(P5ki) allele, which corresponds to a germline rather than somatic mutation, is activated in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and is subsequently expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) and in natural killer (NK), T, and B cells. Ectopic Pax5 expression interferes with normal T-cell development and causes immature T-lymphoblastic lymphomas in IgH(P5ki/+) and IgH(P5ki/P5ki) mice. Aggressive T-cell lymphomas develop even faster in Ik(Pax5/+) mice expressing Pax5 from the Ikaros locus. Pax5 expression in thymocytes activates B-cell-specific genes and represses T-lymphoid genes, suggesting that Pax5 contributes to lymphomagenesis by deregulating the T-cell gene-expression program. These data identify Pax5 as a potent oncogene and demonstrate that the T-lymphoid lineage is particularly sensitive to the oncogenic action of Pax5.",,"['Souabni, Abdallah', 'Jochum, Wolfram', 'Busslinger, Meinrad']","['Souabni A', 'Jochum W', 'Busslinger M']","['Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna Biocenter, Dr Bohr-Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Pax5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Radiation Chimera', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2006/09/14 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2006/09/14 09:00'],"['2006/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52155-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-03-009670 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jan 1;109(1):281-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-03-009670.

We previously demonstrated redirected antileukemic reactivity of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells by transfer of minor histocompatibility antigen HA-2-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs). HA-2-TCR-transferred CMV-specific T cells were potent effectors against HA-2-expressing leukemic cells, as well as CMV-expressing cells. Functional activity of these T cells correlated with TCR cell-surface expression. In the present study we analyzed which properties of transferred and endogenous TCRs are crucial for efficient cell-surface expression. We demonstrate that expression of the introduced TCR is not a random process but is determined by characteristics of both the introduced and the endogenously expressed TCR. The efficiency of TCR cell-surface expression is controlled by the intrinsic quality of the TCR complex. In addition, we demonstrate that chimeric TCRs can be formed and that efficiency of TCR expression is independent of whether TCRs are retrovirally introduced or naturally expressed.

Aquaglyceroporin 9 (AQP9) is a transmembrane protein that may be involved in arsenic uptake. In 10 of 11 myeloid and lymphoid leukemia lines, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and Western blotting showed that AQP9 expression correlated positively with As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. As a proof-of-principle, transfection of EGFP-tagged AQP9 to the hepatoma line Hep3B, not expressing AQP9 and As2O3 insensitive, led to membrane AQP9 expression and increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Similarly, the chronic myeloid leukemia line K562 expressed low levels of AQP9 and was As2O3 insensitive. The K562(EGFP-AQP9) transfectant accumulated significantly higher levels of intracellular arsenic than control K562(EGFP) when incubated with As2O3, resulting in significantly increased As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of the myeloid leukemia line HL-60 with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) up-regulated AQP9, leading to a significantly increased arsenic uptake and As2O3-induced cytotoxicity on incubation with As2O3, which might explain the synergism between ATRA and As2O3. Therefore, AQP9 controlled arsenic transport and might determine As2O3 sensitivity. Q-PCR showed that primary APL cells expressed AQP9 significantly (2-3 logs) higher than other acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), which might explain their exquisite As2O3 sensitivity. However, APL and AML with maturation expressed comparable AQP9 levels, suggesting that AQP9 expression was related to granulocytic maturation.",,"['Leung, Jordy', 'Pang, Annie', 'Yuen, Wai-Hung', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam', 'Tse, Eric W C']","['Leung J', 'Pang A', 'Yuen WH', 'Kwong YL', 'Tse EW']","['Department of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Professorial Block, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AQP9 protein, human)', '0 (Aquaporins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aquaporins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Oxides/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2006/09/14 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2006/09/14 09:00'],"['2006/09/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52086-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-04-019588 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jan 15;109(2):740-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-04-019588.

In the present research, we designed several ATRA derivatives having a hydrophobic alkyl ketone moiety instead of the negatively charged carboxylic acid moiety. Among them the ethyl ketone derivative, Et-ketone ATRA, was shown to induce the differentiation of UF-1 cells when assessed in terms of intracellular ROS production. It also induced the formation of PML NBs and expression of CD11b antigen marker and p21, transcriptional targets of RARalpha. Et-ketone ATRA did not induce these phenotypic changes in wild-type APL NB4 cells. Furthermore, we found that Et-ketone ATRA induced apoptosis selectively in UF-1 cells, i.e., not in other leukemic cells. The induction of apoptosis was shown to be partly due to the up-regulation of Bax protein.

CD20 expression in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is one of the best examples of such a biomarker, but results from the use of different QFC methods vary considerably. METHODS: We measured CD20 expression on normal and B-CLL B-cells, using FITC and PE conjugates from the same monoclonal antibody (Mab). As a biological control and calibrator, we also measured CD4 expression on T-cells with FITC and PE Mab. Calibration curves were constructed using the CLSI (formerly NCCLS) consensus guidelines for QFC. Calibration with QuantiBRITE PE-labeled microspheres and the use of unimolar PE conjugates provided direct measurement of antibody bound per cell (ABC) for CD4 and CD20. Calibration for FITC conjugates was based on molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF), as determined by NIST RM 8640 microsphere standards. These MESF values were then converted to ABC, using the CD4 T-cell as a biologic calibrator, to normalize FITC and PE results for CD20 expression. RESULTS: On normal B cells, the mean ABC value for unimolar CD20-PE conjugate was 143,500 (CV +/- 19.1%). The mean ABC value for B-CLL B-cells stained with the same conjugate was 21,700 (CV +/- 42.0%). Using the CD4 T-cell as a biologic calibrator for FITC conjugate, the mean ABC value for CD20-FITC on normal B-cells was 199,300. CD20-FITC staining on B-CLL cells was generally too weak for accurate quantification. On normal T-cells, the mean ABC value for CD4 unimolar PE conjugate was (36,800 +/- 10.4)%, and it did not differ significantly in CLL samples. CONCLUSION: The expression of CD20 on normal and B-CLL lymphocytes can be quantified in ABC units using unimolar CD20-PE conjugates. In addition, CD4 expression on T-cells can be used as a biological calibrator to quantify CD20-FITC ABC, with reasonable agreement between the two conjugates with different fluorochromes. Issues regarding the accuracy of MESF microsphere calibrators and effective F/P ratios for FITC conjugates will require additional laboratory studies.",['Copyright 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology.'],"['Wang, Lili', 'Abbasi, Fatima', 'Gaigalas, Adolfas K', 'Vogt, Robert F', 'Marti, Gerald E']","['Wang L', 'Abbasi F', 'Gaigalas AK', 'Vogt RF', 'Marti GE']","['Biochemical Science Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899-8312, USA. lili.wang@nist.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Azacitidine administered in the outpatient setting is well tolerated and can induce complete hematological remission in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). At higher doses, azacitidine has activity in AML. METHODS: Twenty patients were retrospectively identified who had been treated with azacitidine with bone marrow blast counts between 21 and 38%. Patients with blast counts up to 29% were initially treated as MDS, but by WHO now meet criteria for AML. Patients with blast counts over 29% were treated with azacitidine after being deemed poor candidates for induction chemotherapy. Azacitidine 75 mg/m2/day was administered subcutaneously for 7 days every 4 weeks, which was defined as 1 cycle. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 60% (12/20): complete response (CR; n = 4; 20%); partial response (PR; n = 5; 25%); hematologic improvement (HI; n = 3; 15%). The median survival of responders was 15+ months compared with 2.5 months for nonresponders (P = .009). During therapy, responders had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 or 0. The most common toxic event was infection (n = 8).

This gene can undergo rearrangements or deregulation, giving rise to T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. The present report is focused on the identification of elements and factors playing a role in the TLX3 physiologic expression regulation and therefore likely to be involved in cancer development. In particular, after identifying the transcription start points, we have made use of in vitro transfection assays to show that the 5'-untranslated region of the gene is necessary for the basal promoter activity in cell lines from different origin. By site-directed mutagenesis, two tandem CCAAT boxes have been localized as critical elements of this region. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays have indicated that nuclear factor Y (NFY) recognizes these sites in all the analyzed cell lines. The physiologic role of such an interaction has been confirmed by a dominant-negative version of the NFY transcription factor that has turned out to decrease both in vitro TLX3 promoter activity and endogenous amount of mRNA. Finally, a consistent in vivo TLX3 expression impairment was also achieved after NFY mRNA knockdown.

Here we demonstrate that plasmid DNA artificially tethered to PML or the PML NB-targeting domain of Sp100 is preferentially localized to PML NBs. Using the tethering technique, we targeted a simian virus 40 promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid to PML NBs, resulting in the repression of the transgene transcriptional activity. Conversely, the tethering of a cytomegalovirus promoter-containing reporter plasmid resulted in activation. Targeting a minimal eukaryotic promoter did not affect its activity. The expression of targeted promoters could be modulated by altering the cellular concentration of PML NB components, including Sp100 and isoforms of the PML protein. Finally, we demonstrate that ICP0, the promiscuous herpes simplex virus transactivator, increases the level of transcriptional activation of plasmid DNA tethered to the PML NB. We conclude that when PML NB components are artificially tethered to reporter plasmids, the PML NB contributes to the regulation of the tethered DNA in a promoter-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate that transient transcription assays are sensitive to the subnuclear localization of the transgene plasmid.",,"['Block, Gregory J', 'Eskiw, Christopher H', 'Dellaire, Graham', 'Bazett-Jones, David P']","['Block GJ', 'Eskiw CH', 'Dellaire G', 'Bazett-Jones DP']","['The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus Structures/*physiology', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', '*Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', '*Plasmids/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",2006/09/13 09:00,2006/12/27 09:00,['2006/09/13 09:00'],"['2006/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00636-06 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00636-06 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2006 Dec;26(23):8814-25. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00636-06.

We hypothesized that loss of p210Bcr-Abl (the kinase target) may lead to imatinib mesylate resistance. We studied K562 cells [chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) blast crisis line] and MO7E/MBA-1 cells (with MBA-1 cells representing MO7E cells stably transfected with BCR-ABL). Imatinib mesylate resistance developed when p210Bcr-Abl expression was abolished. Furthermore, K562 cells were significantly more growth suppressed after imatinib mesylate exposure than after downregulation of Bcr-Abl expression. Signaling pathways which were functional in the absence of Bcr-Abl expression (NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation or the growth factor pathway) were disrupted when p210Bcr-Abl was present but dephosphorylated, suggesting that an intact, but enzymatically inactive Bcr-Abl, may interfere with critical growth/signaling pathways. Downregulation of p210Bcr-Abl may be a mechanism by which imatinib mesylate resistance emerges. Samples from three of 15 patients with imatinib mesylate-resistant CML blast crisis had undetectable levels of p210Bcr-Abl. We conclude that retention of a dephosphorylated p210Bcr-Abl has a biologic impact distinct from that of downregulation/loss of p210Bcr-Abl and, in a subset of patients, loss of the target of the kinase inhibitor may lead to imatinib mesylate resistance.",,"['Kurzrock, Razelle', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Li, Lan', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Kurzrock R', 'Talpaz M', 'Li L', 'Estrov Z']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancver Center, Houston, Texas 77230-1402, USA. rkurzroc@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Down-Regulation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",2006/09/13 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/13 09:00'],"['2006/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['R817110X41041851 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600709572 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Aug;47(8):1651-64. doi: 10.1080/10428190600709572.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand molecular mechanisms of arsenic actions, this study investigated the effect of two different arsenic compounds on gene expression of apoptosis and cellular proliferation related genes. The Wilms' tumor gene (wt1) is up-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a variety of leukemia cell lines. The expression of wt1 in these cells is proposed to have an anti-apoptotic effect. HL-60 and K562 were treated with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) at concentrations between 0 - 10 microM for up to 48 h. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied by down-regulation of hTERT and wt1 mRNA and protein expression but up-regulation of par-4. Low concentrations of 0.1 microM arsenic induced expression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene in both cell lines HL-60 and K562. There were no major differences encountered between compounds. After arsenic treatment of the leukemia cell lines HL-60 and K562 the up-regulation of par-4 may contribute to the induction of apoptosis rather than down-regulation of bcl-2.

The antitumor activity of doxorubicin (DXR) has also been reported to be dependent on AUC, whereas its cumulative cardiotoxicity has been reported to be Cmax dependent. In this study, we evaluated whether the antileukemic and cardiotoxic effects of DXR were AUC or Cmax dependent, and compared their cytotoxic effects, utilizing the computer-controlled in vitro pharmacokinetic simulation system or a conventional culture system for a leukemic cell line and measuring the intracellular ATP amount or the proportion of beating cells for the cardiotoxicity. In leukemic cells, the cytotoxic rate decreased as the simulated infusion time or exposure time increased with the same AUC value in the simulation and conventional culture system (P < 0.05 and <0.01, respectively). The intracellular ATP and proportion of beating cells also increased with prolonged DXR exposure time with the same constant concentration - time product value (P < 0.05 and <0.0001, respectively) in heart cells.

The impact of pregnancy on expressed autoimmunity increased with each additional sexual partner (the odds of autoimmunity increased 11 times with each long-term sexual partner). The average numbers of pregnancies in female CLL patients with and without autoimmunity were 4.92 and 2.24, respectively (P < 0.001).

Among 4204 3-year survivors of a childhood cancer treated in eight French and British centres before 1986, 11 patients developed leukaemia as a second malignant neoplasm (SMN). Compared with the leukaemia incidence in the general French and British populations, the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of leukaemia was 7.8 (95% CI 4.0-13.4). It decreased from 20.3 (95% CI 8.3-41.2) during the first years of follow-up, to 2.2 (95% CI 0.1-9.7) between 10 and 20 years, but rose again to 14.8 (95% CI 3.7-38.3) 20 or more years after the first cancer. Radiotherapy appeared to increase the risk of leukaemia at moderate weighted doses to active bone marrow; the relative risk (RR) was 4.2 (95% CI 0.8-20.7) for doses ranging from 3 to 6.6 Gy. A greater RR was observed for epipodophyllotoxins and for vinca alkaloids. No specific type of first malignant neoplasm (FMN) was found to lead to a higher risk of secondary leukaemia.

This study examined the influence of three antiglaucoma drugs differing in their chemical structure and pharmacological profile (i.e. latanoprost, timolol, GLC756) on TNF-alpha release from activated rat mast cells. A rat basophilic leukemia mast cell line (RBL-2H3) was activated via IgE/anti-IgE. Rat mast cells were incubated with latanoprost, timolol, GLC756 or betamethasone (positive control) at concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10 and 30 microM. TNF-alpha concentration in supernatant was measured by ELISA 5 h post-activation. Compared to controls, the prostaglandin derivative latanoprost and the beta-blocker timolol in the concentration range 0.1-30 microM, had no significant effect on TNF-alpha release from rat mast cells measured 5h after activation. By contrast, the dopaminergic drug GLC756 compared to controls in the concentration range 1-30 microM significantly inhibited TNF-alpha release from activated rat mast cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The positive control betamethasone inhibited TNF-alpha release almost completely at all concentrations tested. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that latanoprost and timolol do not reduce inflammation triggered by activated mast cells.

Various studies using the herb alone or in combination with other therapy plans have evidenced the effectiveness of the herb in the management of cancers of different tissue origin. However, the mechanisms underlying its anti-cancer activity are unknown. In the present study, we attempted to investigate the apoptotic activity of crude extracts of the herb as well as the possible molecular pathways. METHODS: We incubated human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 cells with ethanol or aqueous extracts of the herb, and determined the levels of intracellular superoxide at 2 and 4 hours as well as caspase activity at 3, 6 and 8 hours using photospectrometry. Cancer cell survival and apoptosis were quantified at 24 hours by using MTT and flow cytometry analyses respectively. RESULTS: We found that it dose-dependently inhibited the cancer cell growth in MTT assay. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that it elicited significant production of sub-G(1) population of the cells, indicating the extract-evoked cell apoptotic death. The LD(50) of the ethanol extract was estimated to be approximately 320 microg/ml. Moreover, treatment of the cancer cells with the ethanol component markedly increased the production of superoxide within few hours. Significant elevation in the protease activities of caspases-2 and -3 were detected at as early as 3 and 6 hours respectively.

However the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donors can be found for only 25%-30% patients. The probability of finding an unrelated matched donor is 1/50000-1/100000, or even lower. If we choose haploid HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation instead, we may be able to find donors for 90% patients. Our present study was to explore the feasibility of allo-HSCT by using haploid HLA-matched donor in treatment for malignant hematological disease. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with malignant hematological disease received allo-HSCT with HLA 2 or 3 antigen mismatched related donors. All patients were treated with intensive immunosuppression, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and combination of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. The conditioning regimen was intensified and prolonged by using the combination of cyclosporine (Cs) A, MMF, ATG and anti-CD25 antibody for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. RESULTS: All patients achieved sustained, full donortype engraftment. Acute GVHD occurred in 21 of 25 patients. Eight of them were grade I aGVHD, six grade II aGVHD, two grade III aGVHD and five grade IV aGVHD. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was 48%,and grade III-IV aGVHD was 28.57%. Chronic GVHD was observed in 12 of 25 patients and none of them developed extensive cGVHD. Sixteen patients were alive and disease free, with 64.0+/- 2.98% 1 year disease-free survival rate. One year overall survival rate was 64.0+/-3.08%. Nine patients died, 1 from relapse and 8 from transplantation related mortality.

A histone-deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), has been shown to induce apoptosis in many cancer cells at submicromolar concentrations. However, the mechanism remains unknown. This study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of trichostatin A on apoptosis of Molt-4 cells by characterizing the global gene expression profiles before and after TSA treatment. METHODS: PI single-labeled flow cytometry, MTT and DNA ladder were used to observe the effect of TSA on apoptosis of MOLT-4 cells and normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Microarray and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to detect the differentially expressed genes of Molt-4 cells after incubation with TSA. RESULTS: TSA could induce apoptosis in Molt-4 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. Besides, the dose of TSA within the time duration which could induce significant apoptosis in Molt-4 cells did not demonstrate apparent cytotoxicity to PBMCs. After incubation with TSA for 9 hours, 313 genes were detected down-regulated by microarray. Proteins encoded by these genes included signal transduction molecules, transcription factors, enzymes etc., which were involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and survival. STAT5A, MYC and ikaros were down-regulated by 80.4%, 77.3% and 83.1%, respectively. The changes of the three genes were confirmed by RT-PCR and the changes of STAT5A and MYC were further confirmed by Western blot.

I'm-Yunity (PSP) is used as a dietary supplement by cancer patients and by individuals diagnosed with various chronic diseases. Laboratory studies have shown that I'm-Yunity (PSP) enhances immune functions and also modulates cellular responses to external challenges. Recently, I'm-Yunity (PSP) was also reported to exert potent anti-tumorigenic effects, evident by suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in malignant cells. We investigate the mechanisms by which I'm-Yunity (PSP) elicits these effects. METHODS: Human leukemia HL-60 and U-937 cells were incubated with increasing doses of aqueous extracts of I'm-Yunity (PSP). Control and treated cells were harvested at various times and analyzed for changes in: (1) cell proliferation and viability, (2) cell cycle phase transition, (3) induction of apoptosis, (4) expression of cell cycle, apoptogenic/anti-apoptotic, and extracellular regulatory proteins. RESULTS: Aqueous extracts of I'm-Yunity (PSP) inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HL-60 and U-937 cells, accompanied by a cell type-dependent disruption of the G1/S and G2/M phases of cell cycle progression. A more pronounced growth suppression was observed in treated HL-60 cells, which was correlated with time- and dose-dependent down regulation of the retinoblastoma protein Rb, diminution in the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and survivin, increase in apoptogenic proteins bax and cytochrome c, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) from its native 112-kDa form to the 89-kDa truncated product. Moreover, I'm-Yunity (PSP)-treated HL-60 cells also showed a substantial decrease in p65 and to a lesser degree p50 forms of transcription factor NF-kappaB, which was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). I'm-Yunity (PSP) also elicited an increase in STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and correspondingly, decrease in the expression of activated form of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase). CONCLUSION: Aqueous extracts of I'm-Yunity (PSP) induces cell cycle arrest and alterations in the expression of apoptogenic/anti-apoptotic and extracellular signaling regulatory proteins in human leukemia cells, the net result being suppression of proliferation and increase in apoptosis.

One of them, perillyl alcohol (POH), displays tumor chemopreventive, chemotherapeutic, and antiangiogenic properties. We investigated whether mastic oil would also suppress tumor cell growth and angiogenesis. We observed that mastic oil concentration and time dependently exerted an antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect on K562 human leukemia cells and inhibited the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from K562 and B16 mouse melanoma cells. Moreover, mastic oil caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of endothelial cell (EC) proliferation without affecting cell survival and a significant decrease of microvessel formation both in vitro and in vivo. Investigation of underlying mechanism(s) demonstrated that mastic oil reduced 1) in K562 cells the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) known to control leukemia cell proliferation, survival, and VEGF secretion and 2) in EC the activation of RhoA, an essential regulator of neovessel organization.

Our data showed that La(3+) ions could induce a pulse of phosphorylation of ERK mainly through an unknown metal-sensing mechanism, which is different from the Ca(2+)-sensing receptor . The putative sensor protein showed one binding site for La(3+) with a dissociation constant of approximately 8 nM. Inductions of c-fos, c-myc, and cyclin D1 and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) were observed after activation of ERK. These results are consistent with our previous observation that La(3+) promotes proliferation by helping the cells pass through the G1/S restriction point and enter S phase. This La(3+)-induced signaling cascade exhibited abnormally sustained c-myc induction and pRb phosphorylation. Furthermore, a continual increase of the p53 level was observed along with the signal transduction, and a significant decrease of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene was observed after approximately 18 h of incubation. All of the results were highly correlated with the increase of S-phase population and apoptotic cells.

HL-60 cells were treated with Cur, TSA or their combinations; cell proliferation arrest, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cell viability were measured as indicators of cell damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and the acetylation of histones were also measured. The cytotoxicity of Cur and TSA increased in a time and dose-dependent manner. Low Cur (no more than 20 microM) diminished the ROS generation in HL-60 cells, while high Cur (50 and 100 microM) promoted that. In contrast, TSA showed no influence on ROS generation. When their effects on histone acetylation were determined, low Cur showed no effect, while TSA significantly increased that. As expected, combinations of low Cur and TSA could not only diminish ROS generation, but also increase histone acetylation, and hence showed a more significant cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells.

We demonstrated that the essential oil composition varied with the species, the major constituent of Satureja hortensis being carvacrol (50.61%) and that of Satureja montana being alpha-terpineol (12.66%). In order to identify molecules possibly responsible for the biological activity, commercially available derivatives have been assayed on the K562 cell line. Satureja montana essential oil displayed different natural derivatives characterized by higher activity than those present in Satureja hortensis.

In a conditional cell transformation system, WS5 gene expression was tightly correlated with v-myc activation. The WS5 gene contains 11 exons, encoding a 733-amino acid protein with a transmembrane region and a polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain. Near the transcriptional start site, the WS5 promoter contains a cluster of four binding sites for the Myc-Max complex and a binding site for transcription factor C/EBPalpha. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Myc, Max and C/EBPalpha bind specifically to these sites. Functional promoter analyses revealed that both the Myc-binding site cluster and the C/EBPalpha-binding site are essential for strong transcriptional activation, and that Myc and C/EBPalpha synergistically activate the WS5 promoter. Ectopic expression of WS5 led to cell transformation documented by anchorage-independent growth. The human melanoma antigen Pmel17, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, is the mammalian protein with the highest amino acid sequence identity (38%) to WS5. The Pmel17 gene is regulated by the MITF protein, a bHLHZip transcription factor with DNA binding specificities similar to those of Myc/Max.

Overexpression of Bmi1 oncogene causes neoplastic transformation of lymphocytes and plays essential role in pathogenesis of myeloid leukemia. Another PcG protein, Ezh2, was implicated in metastatic prostate and breast cancers, suggesting that PcG pathway activation is relevant for epithelial malignancies. Whether an oncogenic role of the BMI1 and PcG pathway activation may be extended beyond the leukemia and may affect progression of solid tumors as well remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that activation of the BMI1 oncogene-associated PcG pathway plays an essential role in metastatic prostate cancer, thus mechanistically linking the pathogenesis of leukemia, self-renewal of stem cells, and prostate cancer metastasis. To characterize the functional status of the PcG pathway in metastatic prostate cancer, we utilized advanced cell- and whole animal-imaging technologies, gene and protein expression profiling, stable siRNA-gene targeting, and tissue microarray (TMA) analysis in relevant experimental and clinical settings. We demonstrate that in multiple experimental models of metastatic prostate cancer both BMI1 and Ezh2 genes are amplified and gene amplification is associated with increased expression of corresponding mRNAs and proteins. For the first time, we provide images of human prostate carcinoma metastasis precursor cells isolated from blood and shown to overexpress both BMI1 and Ezh2 oncoproteins. Consistent with the PcG pathway activation hypothesis, increased BMI1 and Ezh2 expression in metastatic cancer cells is associated with elevated levels of H2AubiK119 and H3metK27 histones. Quantitative immunofluorescence colocalization analysis and expression profiling experiments documented increased BMI1 and Ezh2 expression in clinical prostate carcinoma samples and demonstrated that high levels of BMI1 and Ezh2 expression are associated with markedly increased likelihood of therapy failure and disease relapse after radical prostatectomy. Gene-silencing analysis reveals that activation of the PcG pathway is mechanistically linked with highly malignant behavior of human prostate carcinoma cells and is essential for in vivo growth and metastasis of human prostate cancer. We conclude that the results of experimental and clinical analyses indicate the important biological role of the PcG pathway activation in metastatic prostate cancer. Our work suggests that the PcG pathway activation is a common oncogenic event in pathogenesis of metastatic solid tumors and provides justification for development of small molecule inhibitors of the PcG chromatin silencing pathway as a novel therapeutic modality for treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.",,"['Berezovska, Olga P', 'Glinskii, Anna B', 'Yang, Zhijian', 'Li, Xiao-Ming', 'Hoffman, Robert M', 'Glinsky, Gennadi V']","['Berezovska OP', 'Glinskii AB', 'Yang Z', 'Li XM', 'Hoffman RM', 'Glinsky GV']","['Translational and Functional Genomics Laboratory, Ordway Cancer Center, Ordway Research Institute, Inc., Center for Medical Sciences, Albany, New York 12208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Anoikis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Gene Amplification', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics']",2006/09/12 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/09/12 09:00'],"['2006/09/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['3222 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.5.16.3222 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2006 Aug;5(16):1886-901. doi: 10.4161/cc.5.16.3222.

Hypersensitivity of cis-regulatory elements to digestion with DNaseI remains the gold-standard approach to locating such elements. Traditional methods used to identify DNaseI hypersensitive sites are cumbersome and can only be applied to short stretches of DNA at defined locations. Here we report the development of a novel genomic array-based approach to DNaseI hypersensitive site mapping (ADHM) that permits precise, large-scale identification of such sites from as few as 5 million cells. Using ADHM we identified all previously recognized hematopoietic regulatory elements across 200 kb of the mouse T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia-1 (Tal1) locus, and, in addition, identified two novel elements within the locus, which show transcriptional regulatory activity. We further validated the ADHM protocol by mapping the DNaseI hypersensitive sites across 250 kb of the human TAL1 locus in CD34+ primary stem/progenitor cells and K562 cells and by mapping the previously known DNaseI hypersensitive sites across 240 kb of the human alpha-globin locus in K562 cells.

The causes of FUO have changed over the years. Neoplastic disorders have now displaced infectious diseases as the most common cause of FUOs. Most neoplasms are associated with no or low-grade temperatures, with some important exceptions. Hypernephromas and lymphomas are neoplasms typically associated with high spiking fevers or may present as FUOs. Hematologic malignancies, that is, the acute and chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative disorders, and multiple myeloma, do not usually present with acute fevers or as FUOs. We present an elderly male patient who presented with an FUO, whose history is significant for multiple myeloma in remission. Differential diagnostic possibilities in this patient included plasma cell leukemia, relapse of multiple myeloma, secondary/superimposed malignancy, or opportunistic infection. The main differential diagnosis for his FUO was between neoplastic and infectious disorders. As part of the diagnostic workup, a Naprosyn test (naproxen 375 mg [by mouth] every 12 hours for 3 days) was used to differentiate neoplastic from infectious causes of FUO in this patient. The Naprosyn test was positive, which indicated a neoplastic explanation for the patient's FUO and eliminated, along with the infectious disease workup, an infectious explanation for his FUO. The patient's FUO was finally determined to be the result of a relapse of multiple myeloma and not of a secondary malignancy or malignant transformation of myeloma into plasma cell leukemia.

We have already described the overexpression of P-gp under the selection pressure of vincristine in L1210 mouse leukemia cells. In the present study, mechanisms of multidrug resistance induced in L1210 cells cultivated in the presence of doxorubicin were analyzed. The selection pressure of both vincristine (yielding a resistant subline of L1210 cells, R(V)) and doxorubicin (yielding a resistant subline of L1210 cells, R(D)) induced a dramatic depression of cell sensitivity to both drugs. Both R(V) and R(D) cells demonstrated a lack of ability to accumulate calcein/AM and fluo-3/AM as fluorescent substrates of P-gp and MRP. The retention of dyes could be reached in both cell sublines by the application of inhibitors of P-gp (like verapamil) but not by probenecid - an inhibitor of anion transporters, including MRPs. Massive protein bands, at a M(r) range of 130-180 kDa that interact with c219 antibody against P-gp, were detected in the crude membrane fraction isolated from both R(V) and R(D) (but not from L1210) cells by Western blot. The cytosolic activity of glutathione S-transferase was found to be similar in R(V) and R(D) cells and did not differ significantly from the activity ascertained in parental L1210 cells. Neither the R(V) nor R(D) cell sublines differed considerably, as measured by cell ultrastructure.

Both had palpable lymph nodes in the neck and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was performed to evaluate the pathological process. In addition, the literature on cutaneous SCC metastatic to CLL/SLL with special emphasis on the role of FNAC in this specific clinical situation was reviewed. RESULTS: On examination of the FNAC smear, cancer-to-cancer metastasis of cutaneous SCC to lymph node replaced by CLL was found. In one of the patients, light microscopy examination of the smear was complemented by immunostaining of atypical cells with cytokeratin antibodies and immunophenotyping of lymphoid cells by flow cytometry. In addition to our two patients, nine cases of cutaneous SCC metastatic to CLL/SLL have been reported in the literature, and in only one was the diagnosis made by FNAC.

However, sometimes, competing risks data cannot be considered as independent because of a clustered design, for instance in registry cohorts or multicentre clinical trials. Frailty models have been shown useful to analyse such clustered data in a classical survival setting, where only one risk acts on the population. Inclusion of random effects in the subdistribution hazard has not been assessed yet. In this work, we propose a frailty model for the subdistribution hazard. This allows first to assess the heterogeneity across clusters, then to incorporate such an effect when testing the effect of a covariate of interest. Based on simulation study, the effect of the presence of heterogeneity on testing for covariate effects was studied.

RESULTS: No significant difference in writing speed was found. Mean difference in number of letters produced during 5 min was 6.4 (+/-67.1, range -103 to +169). No significant difference was found in quality of writing scores; mean difference in points was 1.5 (+/-7.7, range -19 to +22).

The GATA family consists of six transcription factors that function in hematopoietic and endodermal development. Among them, GATA-1 is expressed in erythroid, megakaryocytic, eosinophil and mast cell lineages, and GATA-2 is expressed in stem and progenitor cells, at more immature stage compared with GATA-1. Based on the characteristic phenotypes of GATA-1 and GATA-2 mutant mice, it has been suggested that mutations of these GATA genes in humans may result in the onset of certain clinical diseases. To date, mutations of GATA-1 gene have been found in inherited anemia and thrombocytopenia, and Down syndrome-related acute leukemia, which exhibits megakaryocytic phenotypes and frequently occurs in patients with Down syndrome. In contrast, no mutation of GATA-2 gene has been identified in hematological diseases; however, we found the expression level of GATA-2 is significantly decreased in CD34 positive cells in patients with aplastic anemia. Since GATA-2 functions in the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, the reduction of GATA-2 expression in CD34 positive cells may result in the decreased number of hematopoietic stem cells, which is the characteristic feature of aplastic anemia.

Multiple submicroscopic genetic alterations with prognostic significance have been discovered, including internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene, mutations in the NPM1 gene, partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene, high expression of the BAALC gene, and mutations in the CEBPA gene. Application of gene-expression profiling has also identified a gene-expression signature that appears to separate cytogenetically normal AML patients into prognostic subgroups, although gene-expression signature-based classifiers predicting outcome for individual patients with greater accuracy are needed. These and similar future findings are likely to have a major impact on the clinical management of cytogenetically normal AML not only in prognostication but also in selection of appropriate treatment, since many of the identified genetic alterations already constitute or will potentially become targets for specific therapeutic intervention.

We investigated the role of a novel regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphism (-938C>A) in the inhibitory P2 BCL2 promoter in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). The -938C allele displayed significantly increased BCL2 promoter activity and binding of nuclear proteins compared with the A allele. Concomitantly, Bcl-2 protein expression in B cells from CLL patients carrying the -938 AA genotype was significantly increased compared with CC genotypes. Genotype distribution between 123 CLL patients (42 AA, 55 AC, 26 CC) and 120 genotyped healthy controls (36 AA, 63 AC, 21 CC) was not significantly different, suggesting that genotypes of this polymorphism do not increase the susceptibility for B-CLL. However, median time from first diagnosis to initiation of chemotherapy and median overall survival were significantly shorter in patients with -938AA genotype (38 and 199 months, respectively) compared with AC/CC genotypes (120 and 321 months, respectively; P = .008 and P = .003, respectively). Multivariable Cox regression identified the BCL2-938AA genotype as an independent prognostic factor for the time to first treatment (hazard ratio [HR] 1.9; P = .034) together with disease stage at diagnosis (HR 2.5; P = .004) and ZAP-70 status (HR 3.0; P = .001).

The CD34(+) acute myeloid leukemia cell line MUTZ-3 displays a unique ability to differentiate into interstitial DC (IDC) and Langerhans cells (LC) in a cytokine-dependent manner. Phenotypic characterization revealed MUTZ-3 to consist of three distinct subpopulations. Small CD34(+)CD14(-)CD11b(-) progenitors constitute the proliferative compartment of the cell line with the ability to differentiate through a CD34(-)CD14(-)CD11b(+) stage to ultimately give rise to a morphologically large, nonproliferating CD14(+)CD11b(hi) progeny. These CD14(+)CD11b(hi) cells were identified as common, immediate myeloid DC precursors with the ability to differentiate into LC and IDC, exhibiting characteristic and mutually exclusive expression of Langerin and DC-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin, respectively.

In the present study, we elaborated the expression of the Notch signaling system in the postnatal pituitary, and examined its functional significance within the SP compartment. Using RT-PCR, we detected in the anterior pituitary of adult mouse the expression of all four vertebrate Notch receptors, as well as of Hes1, 5, and 6, key downstream targets and effectors of Notch. All Notch receptors, Hes1 and Hes5 were measured at higher mRNA levels in the Sca1(high) SP than in the main population (MP) of differentiated hormonal cells. In contrast, Hes6, known as an inhibitor of Hes1, was more abundant in the MP. Cells with SP phenotype, enriched for Sca1(high) expression, were detected throughout postnatal life. Their proportion was higher in immature mice, but did not change from adult (8 wk old) to much older age (1 yr old). Notch pathway expression was higher in the Sca1(high) SP than in the MP at all postnatal ages analyzed. Functional implication of Notch signaling in the SP was investigated in reaggregate cultures of adult mouse anterior pituitary cells. Treatment with the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT down-regulated Notch activity and reduced the proportion of SP cells. Activation of Notch signaling with the conserved DSL motif of Notch ligands, or with a soluble ligand, caused a rise in SP cell number, at least in part due to a proliferative effect. The SP also expanded in proportion when aggregates were treated with leukemia-inhibitory factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor, again at least partly accounted for by a mitogenic action. These intrapituitary growth factors all activated Notch signaling, and DAPT abrogated the expansion of the SP by basic fibroblast growth factor and leukemia-inhibitory factor, thus exposing a possible cross talk. In conclusion, we show that the Notch pathway, typically situated in embryogenesis, is also present and active in the postnatal pituitary, that it is particularly expressed within the SP independent of age, and that it plays a role in the regulation of SP abundance. Whether our data indicate that Notch regulates renewal and fate decisions of putative stem/progenitor cells within the pituitary SP as found in other tissues, remains open for further exploration.",,"['Chen, Jianghai', 'Crabbe, Annelies', 'Van Duppen, Vik', 'Vankelecom, Hugo']","['Chen J', 'Crabbe A', 'Van Duppen V', 'Vankelecom H']","['Laboratory of Cell Pharmacology, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, University of Leuven (K.U.Leuven), Campus Gasthuisberg O&N1, Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Hes5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hes6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (N-(N-(3,5-difluorophenylacetyl)alanyl)phenylglycine 4-benzoylbenzyl amide)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dipeptides/pharmacology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/drug effects/*growth & development/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2006/09/09 09:00,2007/02/08 09:00,['2006/09/09 09:00'],"['2006/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['me.2006-0293 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2006-0293 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2006 Dec;20(12):3293-307. doi: 10.1210/me.2006-0293.

METHODS: All cases of enteroviral infections in a University Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit were assessed, during a 5-year period. RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and indirect immunofluorescence assay were performed to document the enteroviral infection and the type of virus. RESULTS: Fifty-five children had documented enteroviral infection among 104 patients evaluated for possible enteroviral infection. Severe manifestations occurred in 11/55 (20%) patients, such as encephalitis 5/55, cardiac involvement 3/55 (1/55 myocarditis, 1/55 dilated cardiomyopathy, 1/55 ventricular fibrillation) and infection associated hemophagocytic syndrome 3/55. Children with lymphoid malignancy had increased incidence of enteroviral infections (87%) compared to children with solid tumors (13%). All patients received supportive care, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (30/55 low dose 400 mg/kg or 25/55 high dose 2 gr/kg) and/or pleconaril (2/55).

Four months later, 14 phase II clinical trial participants who received novel GO-containing combination chemotherapy regimens developed an unexpected hepatic toxicity termed sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) or hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Investigators associated with the Research on Adverse Drug Events and Reports (RADAR) project reviewed safety reports for GO included in reports of clinical trials and observational studies, interim reports from an FDA mandated Prospective Observational Registry, and the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System. Medline searches provided incidence estimates of GO-associated SOS and comparative rates of SOS without GO. SOS is characterized by hyperbilirubinemia, painful hepatomegaly, ascites, and sudden weight gain developing at a median of 10 days following GO administration for patients who did not undergo an allogeneic SCT procedure and 13 days following an allogeneic SCT for patients who had previously received GO. Among adult AML patients who received GO in clinical trials, SOS incidence was 3% at doses < or =6 mg/m(2) if administered as monotherapy or in combination with non-hepatotoxic agents versus 28% if administered with thioguanine and 15% when administered as monotherapy at a dose of 9 mg/m(2). Observational studies identified SOS rates between 15% and 40% if an SCT is performed within 3 months of GO administration. The FDA mandated Prospective Observational Registry of patients who receive care at 60 medical centers has identified GO-associated SOS rates of 14% if an SCT is performed and 9% otherwise.

Most interestingly, the decrease of nuclear STAT5a and -5b after curcumin treatment was accompanied by an increase of truncated STAT5 isoforms, indicating that curcumin is able to induce the cleavage of STAT5 into its dominant negative variants lacking the STAT5 C-terminal region. Interferon (IFN)-beta and -gamma treatment induced IFN-stimulated responsive element (ISRE) transcriptional activity, which was efficiently inhibited by curcumin pre-treatment. In parallel, IFN-gamma treatment induced an increase of the amount of nuclear STAT1 and -3, as well as their phosphorylated isoforms. Again, curcumin pre-treatment inhibited these increases.

However, the cellular mechanisms by which malignant hematologic cells induce angiogenesis are not well understood. In order to investigate the role of cells from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM) in angiogenesis on human bone marrow endothelial cells (HBMEC), we analyzed the impact of factors secreted by B-CLL cells and by MM cells on HBMEC capillary tube formation on matrigel. It was found that, in addition to the secretion of angiogenic factors VEGF and b-FGF by B-CLL and MM cells, MM cells (but not B-CLL cells) induced a dramatic increase in expression of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-3 on human bone marrow endothelial cells (HBMEC). It would seem that this increase in VEGFR-3 occurred via the ERK and mTOR pathways, since their respective inhibitors U0126, LY294002 or rapamycin were responsible for a decrease of VEGFR-3. In response to MM cells-increased VEGF receptors on HBMEC, endothelial cell migration was enhanced in a wound artificially produced in a semi-confluent HBMEC culture, a phenomenon which was also down-regulated by the same inhibitors that reversed the increase in VEGF receptors. The present study suggests that, in addition to the classic angiogenic pathway, another mechanism related to an increased expression of VEGFRs on HBMEC might exist in malignant hematopoietic angiogenesis.",,"['Mirshahi, P', 'Toprak, S K', 'Faussat, A M', 'Dubrulle, S', 'Marie, J P', 'Soria, C', 'Soria, J', 'Mirshahi, M']","['Mirshahi P', 'Toprak SK', 'Faussat AM', 'Dubrulle S', 'Marie JP', 'Soria C', 'Soria J', 'Mirshahi M']","['INSERM, UMR736, IFR 58, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, 75006 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Culture Media', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood supply/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2006/09/09 09:00,2006/11/09 09:00,['2006/09/09 09:00'],"['2006/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)01941-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.08.132 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 Oct 27;349(3):1003-10. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.08.132.

The disadvantage of the former is that it ignores the importance of gene interactions; the disadvantage of the latter is that it often does not provide a sufficient focus for further investigation because many genes may be included by chance. Our strategy is to search for classification rules that perform well with few genes and, if they are found, identify genes that occur relatively frequently under multiple random validation (random splits into training and test samples). RESULTS: We analyzed data from four published studies related to cancer. For classification we used a filter with a nearest centroid rule that is easy to implement and has been previously shown to perform well. To comprehensively measure classification performance we used receiver operating characteristic curves. In the three data sets with good classification performance, the classification rules for 5 genes were only slightly worse than for 20 or 50 genes and somewhat better than for 1 gene. In two of these data sets, one or two genes had relatively high frequencies not noticeable with rules involving 20 or 50 genes: desmin for classifying colon cancer versus normal tissue; and zyxin and secretory granule proteoglycan genes for classifying two types of leukemia. CONCLUSION: Using multiple random validation, investigators should look for classification rules that perform well with few genes and select, for further study, genes with relatively high frequencies of occurrence in these classification rules.",,"['Baker, Stuart G', 'Kramer, Barnett S']","['Baker SG', 'Kramer BS']","['Biometry Research Group, Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-7354, USA. sb16i@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Desmin)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (ZYX protein, human)', '0 (Zyxin)', '0 (secretory granule proteoglycan)']",IM,"['Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Desmin/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proteoglycans/genetics', '*Software Validation', 'Zyxin']",2006/09/09 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/09/09 09:00'],"['2006/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-7-407 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-7-407 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2006 Sep 7;7:407. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-7-407.,20060907,,,,PMC1574352,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to the methodological limitations in these studies, it remains impossible to determine accurately the true prevalence of mood disorders in pediatric cancer patients receiving cancer treatment. To date, no study has reported rates of antidepressant treatment in this population. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were: (1) To determine the prevalence of the use of antidepressant medication (ADM) in children with cancer; (2) to identify a group of children being treated for cancer, that are likely to receive ADM, and who therefore may be eligible for a prospective observational or interventional clinical trial of depression during cancer therapy. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 224 pediatric patients suspected for cancer in 2003 at the Children's Medical Center of Dallas. Of these, 6 proved non-oncologic and 2 were lost to follow up, leaving 216 charts for review. RESULTS: Within 1 year of diagnosis, 29 patients (13%) had received a psychiatric consultation. Twenty-two patients (10.2%) received ADM within 1 year of cancer diagnosis. Children >/= 12 years, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and children receiving radiotherapy or opiate analgesics were more likely to receive ADM by multivariate analysis. Race, sex, bone marrow transplant, and surgery were not significantly associated with ADM use. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ADM use in pediatric cancer patients (10.2%) was higher than the reported rates of depression (4-8%) and ADM treatment (1%) in the general pediatric population.

METHODS: Cancer incidence was obtained from 90% of the Hispanic/Latino and 82% of the U.S. populations. Cancer deaths were obtained for the entire U.S. population. Cancer screening, risk factor, incidence, and mortality data were compiled for Latino and non-Latino adults and children (incidence only). Long-term (1975-2003) and fixed-interval (1995-2003) trends and comparative analyses by disease stage, urbanicity, and area poverty were evaluated. RESULTS: The long-term trend in overall cancer death rates, declining since the early 1990s, continued through 2003 for all races and both sexes combined. However, female lung cancer incidence rates increased from 1975 to 2003, decelerating since 1991 and breast cancer incidence rates stabilized from 2001 to 2003. Latinos had lower incidence rates in 1999-2003 for most cancers, but higher rates for stomach, liver, cervix, and myeloma (females) than did non-Latino white populations. Latino children have higher incidence of leukemia, retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, and germ-cell tumors than do non-Latino white children. For several common cancers, Latinos were less likely than non-Latinos to be diagnosed at localized stages. CONCLUSIONS: The lower cancer rates observed in Latino immigrants could be sustained by maintenance of healthy behaviors. Some infection-related cancers in Latinos could be controlled by evidence-based interventions. Affordable, culturally sensitive, linguistically appropriate, and timely access to cancer information, prevention, screening, and treatment are important in Latino outreach and community networks.",,"['Howe, Holly L', 'Wu, Xiaocheng', 'Ries, Lynn A G', 'Cokkinides, Vilma', 'Ahmed, Faruque', 'Jemal, Ahmedin', 'Miller, Barry', 'Williams, Melanie', 'Ward, Elizabeth', 'Wingo, Phyllis A', 'Ramirez, Amelie', 'Edwards, Brenda K']","['Howe HL', 'Wu X', 'Ries LA', 'Cokkinides V', 'Ahmed F', 'Jemal A', 'Miller B', 'Williams M', 'Ward E', 'Wingo PA', 'Ramirez A', 'Edwards BK']","['North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, Springfield, Illinois 62704-6495, USA. hhowe@naaccr.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Environment', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology/ethnology']",2006/09/08 09:00,2006/12/16 09:00,['2006/09/08 09:00'],"['2006/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.22193 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Oct 15;107(8):1711-42. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22193.,,,,"['HHSN261200444001C/PHS HHS/United States', 'N02-PC-44401/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U75/CCU523346/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preservation of as few as 5% to 10% of myelinated axons in individual tracts can confer locomotor recovery. Thus, strategies aimed at rescuing mature oligodendrocytes ensheathing viable axons are likely to be of therapeutic significance. We report that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) can prevent oligodendrocyte apoptosis, notably contralateral to the spinal cord lesion, through the induction of the JAK/STAT and Akt signaling pathways as well as by potentiating the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule, cIAP2. Reduced oligodendrocyte apoptosis after SCI with LIF administration resulted in a substantial decrease in demyelination shown by the preservation of lamellated myelin surrounding viable axons and deposition of the degraded myelin basic protein.

We applied the multi-factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method to a large cohort study on gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. The study (case-control nested in the EPIC cohort) was established to investigate molecular changes and genetic susceptibility in relation to air pollution and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in non-smokers. We have analyzed 757 controls and 409 cases with bladder cancer (n=124), lung cancer (n=116) and myeloid leukemia (n=169). Thirty-six gene variants (DNA repair and metabolic genes) and three environmental exposure variables (measures of air pollution and ETS at home and at work) were analyzed. Interactions were assessed by prediction error percentage and cross-validation consistency (CVC) frequency. For lung cancer, the best model was given by a significant gene-environment association between the base excision repair (BER) XRCC1-Arg399Gln polymorphism, the double-strand break repair (DSBR) BRCA2-Asn372His polymorphism and the exposure variable 'distance from heavy traffic road', an indirect and robust indicator of air pollution (mean prediction error of 26%, P<0.001, mean CVC of 6.60, P=0.02). For bladder cancer, we found a significant 4-loci association between the BER APE1-Asp148Glu polymorphism, the DSBR RAD52-3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) polymorphism and the metabolic gene polymorphisms COMT-Val158Met and MTHFR-677C>T (mean prediction error of 22%, P<0.001, mean CVC consistency of 7.40, P<0.037). For leukemia, a 3-loci model including RAD52-2259C>T, MnSOD-Ala9Val and CYP1A1-Ile462Val had a minimum prediction error of 31% (P<0.001) and a maximum CVC of 4.40 (P=0.086).

STAT3 appears to be fundamentally important for vertebrate organisms, being required for the self-renewal of embryonal stem cells in response to leukemia inhibitory factor signaling and for proliferation of some somatic cell types. Moreover, STAT3 is up-regulated in a range of tumors, and a modified version of STAT3 (STAT3C) has been shown to function as an oncogene, whereas inhibition of STAT3 can suppress tumor cell growth. The constitutive activity of oncogenic STAT3C was reported to depend on spontaneous dimerization directed by disulfide bonds in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. In fact, tyrosine phosphorylation consequent upon cytokine or mitogen-induced signaling events remains obligatory for STAT3C activation. Instead, the DNA-binding affinity of phospho-STAT3C is elevated resulting in a faster on-rate and slower off-rate. The faster on-rate sensitizes STAT3C to cytokine stimulation, and the slower off-rate protects it from inactivation by nuclear phosphatases.

However, this effect of adaphostin in adherent cells/solid tumor models has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferative effects of adaphostin in the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Specifically, we explored the potential molecular mechanism(s) by which adaphostin elicits its anti-proliferative effect(s). We demonstrate that adaphostin inhibits the proliferation of PC-3 cells by inducing a G(1) phase cell cycle arrest. This adaphostin-induced G(1) arrest was associated with an increase in the expression of p21 and p27 and a decrease in the expression of G(1)-specific cyclins (cyclin A, D1, and D3) and cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6. Consequently, a dramatic decrease in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein was also observed. Additionally, we found that adaphostin treatment induced a decrease in the phosphorylation of nucleophosmin, a major nuclear phosphoprotein, and that this decreased phosphorylation was a result of the p21- and p27-mediated inactivation of cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 complex kinase activity. Furthermore, we have determined that the adaphostin-mediated cell cycle arrest of PC-3 cells is dependent upon activation of the p38 MAPK. We also demonstrate that the hepatocyte growth factor receptor-c-Met is involved in the adaphostin-mediated signaling events that regulate p38 MAPK. Taken together, these results identify for the first time a signaling cascade of adaphostin-mediated G(1) phase-specific cell cycle arrest in PC-3 cells.

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic relevance of molecular-cytogenetic abnormalities in pediatric patients using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization. DESIGN AND METHODS: The patients were assigned to TAL1, HOX11/TLX1, HOX11L2/TLX3, or CALM-AF10 subgroups. The cytogenetic subgroups were characterized in relation to immunophenotype and the expression of aberrantly expressed transcription factors. RESULTS: In our cohort study, CALM-AF10 was associated with an immature immunophenotype and poor outcome (p=0.005). HOX11L2 was associated with both immunophenotypically immature cases as well as cases committed to the gammadelta-lineage. HOX11L2 was significantly associated with poor outcome (p=0.01), independently of the expression of CD1 or the presence of NOTCH1 mutations. TAL1 abnormalities were associated with alphabeta-lineage commitment, and tended to be associated with a good outcome. Cells in HOX11 cases resembled early CD1-positive cortical thymocytes without expression of Cytbeta and TCR molecules. In relation to the expression of early T-cell transcription factors, high TAL1 levels were found in immunophenotypically-advanced cases, whereas high LYL1 levels were found in immature subgroups. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The reported outcomes for HOX11L2-rearranged T-ALL cases are conflicting; the prognostic impact may depend on the therapy given. In our cohort, this cytogenetic aberration was associated with a poor outcome.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the expression of Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie2 by immunohistochemical analyses in bone marrow biopsies of 64 adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and correlated angiogenic factor expression with clinicopathological variables and long-term survival. RESULTS: Expression of Ang-2 was significantly higher in the bone marrow of AML patients than in 16 control patients. In contrast, the levels of Ang-1 expression in AML patients did not differ from those found in controls. Thus, we observed a reversal of the Ang-1 and Ang-2 expression balance in the neoplastic bone marrow. Furthermore, Tie2 was significantly overexpressed in leukemic blasts. Patients expressing high levels of Ang-2 had significantly longer overall survival than those with low Ang-2 levels (52.7 vs. 14.7 months). Multivariate analysis revealed that karyotype and Ang-2 expression were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (hazard ratio [CI]: 3.06 [1.39-6.70] and 0.31 [0.14-0.69], respectively). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that the alteration of angiopoietin balance in favor of Ang-2 may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of AML.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze conventional risk factors for relapse and design a predictive model for relapse in our series, after 20 years of experience in treating ALL. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We performed a multivariate analysis of conventional prognostic factors in the treatment of ALL in our unit and compared them with the risk groups in the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM-ALL) treatment protocols. RESULTS: Between 1984 and 2004, 232 children were diagnosed with ALL and treated according to the different versions of the BFM protocols (BFM83, BFM86, BFM90 and BFM95) at the Hospital Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain. The event-free survival for all patients was 79.4 % (95 % CI: 72.7-85.4). Overall survival among patients who relapsed was 10.72 % (95 % CI: 6-27.3). The only significant prognostic factor for relapse identified by multivariate analysis was leukocyte [white blood cell (WBC)] count higher than 80,000/ml at diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.63; 95 % CI: 1.61-13.3; p 5 0,004). The sensitivity and specificity of WBC in predicting relapses were 31.4 % and 87.5 %, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of BFM risk group stratification in predicting relapses were 25 and 85.9 respectively.

Thereby, retroviruses exploit by interaction with cellular partners the cellular machineries for vesicular transport in various ways. RESULTS: The retroviral Gag precursor protein drives assembly of murine leukaemia viruses (MLV) at the plasma membrane (PM) and the formation of virus like particles in multivesicular bodies (MVBs). In our study we show that caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a multifunctional membrane-associated protein, co-localizes with Gag in a punctate pattern at the PM of infected NIH 3T3 cells. We provide evidence that Cav-1 interacts with the matrix protein (MA) of the Gag precursor. This interaction is mediated by a Cav-1 binding domain (CBD) within the N-terminus of MA. Interestingly, the CBD motif identified within MA is highly conserved among most other gamma-retroviruses. Furthermore, Cav-1 is incorporated into MLV released from NIH 3T3 cells. Overexpression of a GFP fusion protein containing the putative CBD of the retroviral MA resulted in a considerable decrease in production of infectious retrovirus. Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative Cav-1 mutant affected retroviral titres significantly. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that Cav-1 interacts with MLV Gag, co-localizes with Gag at the PM and affects the production of infectious virus.

ANIMALS: Dogs evaluated for bone marrow disorders at a veterinary teaching hospital. HYPOTHESIS: A better understanding of the spectrum and the prevalence of canine bone marrow disorders can be achieved with a multiyear retrospective study. METHODS: Bone marrow aspirate smears, core biopsy specimens, and case records from 717 dogs were reviewed. RESULTS: Bone marrow specimens were first categorized based on the presence or the absence of a primary bone marrow disorder. Nondysplastic and nonmalignant pathologic changes were placed into 14 subcategories. Frequently observed pathologic disorders included nonregenerative immune-mediated anemia, pure red cell aplasia, bone marrow necrosis, myelofibrosis, and hemophagocytic syndrome. Dysmyelopoiesis (n = 61) was subcategorized into myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 27), and congenital (n = 1) and secondary (n = 33) dysmyelopoiesis. One hundred twenty-six cases of neoplasia were divided into acute leukemia (n = 46), chronic leukemia (n = 7), stage 5 malignant lymphoma (n = 28), multiple myeloma (n = 25), malignant histiocytosis (n = 11), metastatic mast-cell tumor (n = 3), sarcoma (n = 5), and carcinoma (n = 1).

To explore the effect of caspase-3 in this apoptotic model, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODNs) targeting 5'-noncoding region (ASODN-1) and initial translation region (ASODN-2) of caspase-3 mRNA were designed, synthesized and introduced into HL-60 cells by means of liposome-mediated transfection followed by gamma-irradiation in the present study. The TUNEL assay was used for morphological analysis of HL-60 cell apoptosis. Immunocytochemical staining, Western blotting and RT-PCR were, respectively, performed for detecting expression of caspase-3 and its mRNA. HL-60 cells transfected with mismatched oligodeoxynucleotide (MODN) or untransfected were taken as the control groups. The TUNEL assay showed that the percentages of HL-60 cell apoptosis induced by gamma-Irradiation in both ASODN-1 and ASODN-2 groups were significantly reduced compared with those in the control group (P<0.01) when the final transfection concentration was > or = 3 micromol/L. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that in the ASODN-1 and ASODN-2 groups, caspase-3 positive cell percentages were reduced and average gray values of the positive cells increased significantly compared with those in the control group (P<0.01). Western blotting found that procaspase-3 expression in HL-60 cells of the ASODNs groups was decreased,and it was lower in the ASODN-1 group than in the ASODN-2 group. RT-PCR revealed marked expression of caspase-3 mRNA in HL-60 cells of the control group. Expression of caspase-3 mRNA was decreased after ASODNs transfection. Furthermore, ASODN-1 was more effective in inhibiting HL-60 cell apoptosis (P<0.05) and caspase-3 expression (P<0.01) than ASODN-2. These results indicate that caspase-3 mRNA ASODNs prevent HL-60 cells from apoptosis induced by gamma-radiation,and reduce expression of caspase-3 and its mRNA.

Although direct radionecrosis of the salivary glands and the taste buds might explain the chemosensory problems after radiotherapy, the olfactory and gustatory complaints seen after chemotherapy remain unexplained. The patients reporting olfactory symptoms rarely complain about qualitative olfactory disorders such as parosmia or phantosmia. Quantitative olfactory loss such as anosmia and hyposmia seem to be more frequent. METHODS: We present the case of a 63-year-old woman with chemotherapy-induced parosmia leading to severe nutrition and appetite problems resulting in a life-threatening weight loss. RESULTS: With the aid of a simple nose clip the parosmia could be abolished and oral food intake became possible again. Parosmia resolved gradually over an observation period of 9 months, in parallel to an increase of olfactory sensitivity. The patient progressively gained appetite and weight.

However, biased risk grouping and high treatment-related mortality have hampered some of those comparisons. METHODS: In Sweden during the 1990s, adolescents with ALL were treated in a pediatric oncology unit or in an adult hematologic unit, depending on the initial referral. In the current national, comparative, retrospective study, patients with ALL aged 10 years to 40 years who were treated either according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL protocol (1992-2000) (NOPHO-92 protocol) or according to the Swedish Adult ALL Group protocol (1994-2000) (Adult protocol) were included. None of the protocols had age as a high-risk criterion. RESULTS: In total, 243 patients with B-precursor and T-cell ALL were treated according to the protocols. There was a significant difference in the remission rate between the NOPHO-92 protocol (99%; n = 144 patients) and the Adult protocol (90%; n = 99 patients; P < .01), and the event-free survival (EFS) was also superior for the NOPHO-92 protocol compared with the Adult protocol (P < .01).

Extensive publications report that p210BCR-ABL1 complexed with multiple cytoplasmic proteins can modulate several cell signaling pathways. However, while altered signaling states can be demonstrated in primary CML material, most of the reported analytical work on complexed proteins has been done in cell lines expressing p210BCR-ABL1. This has been necessary because primary hemopoietic cell lysates contain a degradative activity which rapidly and permanently destroys p210BCR-ABL1, precluding accurate p210BCR-ABL1 quantification by Western blotting or investigation of coimmunoprecipitating proteins in primary cells. This degradative activity has proven intractable to inhibition by conventional protease inhibitors. We show here that the degradative activity in primary cells is associated with cell lysosomes and is most likely to be an acid-dependent hydrolase. By lysing primary hemopoietic cells at high pH, we have demonstrated substantial inhibition of the p210BCR-ABL1-degradative activity and now report, to the best of our knowledge, the first published demonstration by coimmunoprecipitation of the association between p210BCR-ABL1 and cytoplasmic effector proteins in primary CML material.","['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Patel, Hetal', 'Marley, Stephen B', 'Gordon, Myrtle Y']","['Patel H', 'Marley SB', 'Gordon MY']","['Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, Hammersmith Campus, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/09/07 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/07 09:00'],"['2006/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20377 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Dec;45(12):1121-9. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20377.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that tanshinone IIA exhibited induction of apoptosis by activation of caspase-3, downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 and bcl-xl and upregulation of pro-apoptotic protein bax, as well as disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, treatment by tanshinone IIA could reduce cell adhesion to and invasion through ECM in leukemia NB4 cells.

This review focuses on such FISH-banding techniques, which were recently defined as 'any kind of FISH technique, which provide the possibility to characterize simultaneously several chromosomal subregions smaller than a chromosome arm. FISH-banding methods fitting that definition may have quite different characteristics, but share the ability to produce a DNA-specific chromosomal banding'. While the standard chromosome banding techniques like GTG lead to a protein-related black and white banding pattern, FISH-banding techniques are DNA-specific, more colorful and, thus, more informative. For some, even high-resolution FISH-banding techniques the development is complete and they can be used for whole genome hybridizations in one step. Other FISH-banding methods are only available for selected chromosomes and/or are still under development. FISH-banding methods have successfully been applied in research in evolution- and radiation-biology, as well as in studies on the nuclear architecture. Moreover, their suitability for diagnostic purposes has been proven in prenatal, postnatal and tumor cytogenetics, indicating that they are an important tool with the potential to partly replace the conventional banding techniques in the future.","['Copyright 2006 S.

In research, mouse M-FISH provides a powerful tool to characterize mouse models of a disease. In addition, the ability to accurately karyotype single metaphases without selection makes M-FISH the perfect tool in chromosome breakage studies and for characterizing clonal evolution of tumours.

The adverse prognosis in T-ALL has not been attributed to cytogenetic or molecular aberrations. We have determined the prognostic impact of the oncogenic transcription factor ERG in T-ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ERG expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 105 adults with newly diagnosed T-ALL treated on the German ALL protocols. Patients were dichotomized at ERG's median expression into low (n = 52) and high (n = 53) expressers. Homeobox (HOX) 11 and HOX11L2 expression was determined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: High ERG expressers compared with low ERG expressers had an inferior overall survival (OS, P = .02; 5-year OS: high ERG 26% v low ERG 58%) and relapse-free survival (RFS, P = .003; 5-year RFS: high ERG 34% v low ERG 72%). On multivariable analysis high ERG expression (P = .005), immunophenotypic subgroups (early v mature v thymic T-ALL; overall P = .04), HOX11L2 positivity (P = .055), and absence of HOX11 (P = .017) were independent adverse risk factors predicting RFS. Patients with high ERG expression had a hazard ratio (HR) for relapse of 3.2. Within the good prognostic subgroup of thymic T-ALL (n = 57), high ERG (HR, 4.1; P = .02) and presence of HOX11L2 (HR, 6.6; P = .008) were independent adverse factors for RFS. CONCLUSION: High expression of ERG is an adverse risk factor in adult T-ALL. Within thymic T-ALL, otherwise classified as standard-risk, high ERG expression-identified patients that were four times more likely to fail long-term RFS.

Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a gene down-regulated in activated murine B cells, is expressed at low levels in several types of human B-cell lineage lymphomas and leukemias. The human KLF4 gene has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in colon and gastric cancer; in concordance with this, overexpression of KLF4 can suppress proliferation in several epithelial cell types. Here we investigate the effects of KLF4 on pro/pre-B-cell transformation by v-Abl and BCR-ABL, oncogenes that cause leukemia in mice and humans. We show that overexpression of KLF4 induces arrest and apoptosis in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. KLF4-mediated death, but not cell-cycle arrest, can be rescued by Bcl-XL overexpression. Transformed pro/pre-B cells expressing KLF4 display increased expression of p21CIP and decreased expression of c-Myc and cyclin D2. Tetracycline-inducible expression of KLF4 in B-cell progenitors of transgenic mice blocks transformation by BCR-ABL and depletes leukemic pre-B cells in vivo.

CNS relapse may be explained by limited penetration of imatinib mesylate into the cerebrospinal fluid because of the presence of P-glycoprotein at the blood-brain barrier. To overcome imatinib mesylate-resistance mechanisms such as bcr-abl amplification, mutations within the ABL kinase domain, and activation of Lyn, we developed a dual BCR-ABL/Lyn inhibitor, INNO-406 (formerly NS-187), which is 25 to 55 times more potent than imatinib mesylate in vitro and at least 10 times more potent in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of INNO-406 in treating CNS Ph+ leukemia. We found that INNO-406, like imatinib mesylate, is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. The concentrations of INNO-406 in the CNS were about 10% of those in the plasma. However, this residual concentration was enough to inhibit the growth of Ph+ leukemic cells which expressed not only wild-type but also mutated BCR-ABL in the murine CNS. Furthermore, cyclosporine A, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, augmented the in vivo activity of INNO-406 against CNS Ph+ leukemia.

Previous studies have shown that DNA repair is a major target for fludarabine. We postulate that potentiation of oxaliplatin toxicity by fludarabine may be due to the inhibition by fludarabine of the activity of the DNA excision repair pathways activated by oxaliplatin adducts. To test this, we investigated the cytotoxic interactions between the 2 drugs in normal and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lymphocytes. In each population, the combination resulted in greater than additive killing. Analysis of oxaliplatin damage revealed that fludarabine enhanced accumulation of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in specific regions of the genome in both populations, but to a lesser extent in normal lymphocytes. The action of fludarabine on the removal of oxaliplatin ICLs was explored to investigate the mechanism by which oxaliplatin toxicity was increased by fludarabine. Lymphocytes from patients with CLL have a greater capacity for ICL unhooking compared with normal lymphocytes. In the presence of fludarabine the extent of repair was significantly reduced in both populations, more so in CLL.

The Notch1 receptor signals through a gamma-secretase-dependent process that releases intracellular Notch1 from the membrane to the nucleus, where it forms part of a transcriptional activator complex. To identify Notch1 target genes in leukemia, we developed mouse T-cell leukemic lines that express intracellular Notch1 in a doxycycline-dependent manner. Using gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified c-myc as a novel, direct, and critical Notch1 target gene in T-cell leukemia. c-myc mRNA levels are increased in primary mouse T-cell tumors that harbor Notch1 mutations, and Notch1 inhibition decreases c-myc mRNA levels and inhibits leukemic cell growth. Retroviral expression of c-myc, like intracellular Notch1, rescues the growth arrest and apoptosis associated with gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment or Notch1 inhibition. Consistent with these findings, retroviral insertional mutagenesis screening of our T-cell leukemia mouse model revealed common insertions in either notch1 or c-myc genes.

Cardiac symptoms in patients with myelodysplasia are often due to anemia and may be due to iron overload and side effects of therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we report the first case of neoplastic infiltration of the heart with associated myocardial necrosis in a patient with myelodysplasia. It was associated with unicellular and multifocal geographic areas of necrosis in the left ventricle and the interventricular septum. It is likely that cardiac compromise in our patient was due to a combination of restrictive cardiomyopathy due to leukemic infiltration, concomitant anemia, cardiac dilatation, conduction blocks and myocardial necrosis. Myocardial necrosis was most likely due to a combination of ischemic damage secondary to anemia and prolonged hypotension and extensive leukemic infiltration. Markedly rapid decrease in ejection fraction from 66% to 33% also suggests the role of ischemia, since leukemic infiltration is not expected to cause this degree of systolic dysfunction over a 24-hour period. The diagnosis was not suspected during life due to concomitant signs and symptoms of anemia, pulmonary infections, and pericardial and pleural effusions. The patient succumbed to cardiac failure. CONCLUSION: Hemopoietic cell infiltration was not considered in the differential diagnosis and contributed to this patient's morbidity and mortality. This case highlights the clinical importance of considering myocardial infiltration in patients with myelodysplasia and cardiac symptoms.",,"['Mateen, Farrah J', 'Harding, Sheila R', 'Saxena, Anurag']","['Mateen FJ', 'Harding SR', 'Saxena A']","['Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic1, Rochester, USA. farrah_mateen@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Blood Disord,BMC blood disorders,100968550,,,,2006/09/07 09:00,2006/09/07 09:01,['2006/09/07 09:00'],"['2006/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/07 09:01 [medline]', '2006/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2326-6-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2326-6-4 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Blood Disord. 2006 Sep 5;6:4. doi: 10.1186/1471-2326-6-4.,20060905,,,,PMC1569821,,,,,,,,,,,,

These thioester compounds serve as useful tools for probing the intrinsic chemical stability of ZBDs that exist within a variety of cellular and viral proteins. In our studies, the classical (Cys(2)His(2)) zinc finger ZBDs, the interleaved RING like ZBDs of protein kinase C delta (Cys(2)HisCys and HisCys(3)), and the carboxyl-terminal (Cys(2)HisCys) ZBD of Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus nucleocapsid protein (MMTV NCp10) were resistant to reaction with the thioester compounds. In contrast, the thioester compounds were able to efficiently eject zinc from the amino-terminal (Cys(2)HisCys) ZBD of MMTV NCp10, a Cys(2)HisCys ZBD from Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1), and from both Cys(4) ZBDs of GATA-1. In all cases, zinc ejection led to a loss of protein structure. Interestingly, GATA-1 was resistant to reaction with the thioester compounds when bound to its target DNA sequence. The electronic and steric screening was calculated for select ZBDs to further explore their reactivity. Based on these results, it appears that both first and second zinc-coordination shell interactions within ZBDs, as well as nucleic acid binding, play important roles in determining the chemical stability and reactivity of ZBDs. These studies not only provide information regarding the relative reactivity of cysteine residues within structural ZBDs but also are crucial for the design of future therapeutic agents that selectively target ZBDs, such as those that occur in the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein.",,"['Jenkins, Lisa M Miller', 'Durell, Stewart R', 'Maynard, Andrew T', 'Stahl, Stephen J', 'Inman, John K', 'Appella, Ettore', 'Legault, Pascale', 'Omichinski, James G']","['Jenkins LM', 'Durell SR', 'Maynard AT', 'Stahl SJ', 'Inman JK', 'Appella E', 'Legault P', 'Omichinski JG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 30602, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (zinc-binding protein)', '129924-33-0 (retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp10, Moloney murine leukemia', 'virus)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Benzamides/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/chemistry/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Viral Core Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']",2006/09/07 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2006/09/07 09:00'],"['2006/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ja063329e [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2006 Sep 13;128(36):11964-76. doi: 10.1021/ja063329e.,,,,"['R01 GM60298-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nelarabine has shown activity in the treatment of T-cell malignancies, especially T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Preliminary data suggested that nelarabine might penetrate into the CSF. We therefore studied the CSF penetration of nelarabine and ara-G in a nonhuman primate model that has been highly predictive of anticancer drug distribution in humans. METHODS: Nelarabine (35 mg/kg, approximately 700 mg/m2) was administered over 1 h through a surgically implanted central venous catheter to four nonhuman primates. Blood (four animals) and ventricular CSF (three animals) samples were obtained at intervals for 24 h for determination of nelarabine concentrations, which were measured by HPLC-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The nelarabine plasma AUC (median+/-s.d.) was 2,820+/-1,140 microM min and the ara-G plasma AUC was 20,000+/-8,100 microM min. The terminal half-life of nelarabine in plasma was 25+/-5.2 min and clearance was 42+/-61 ml/min/kg. The terminal half-life of ara-G in plasma was 182+/-45 min. In CSF the terminal half-life of nelarabine was 77+/-28 min and of ara-G was 232+/-79 min. The AUCcsf:AUCplasma was 29+/-11% for nelarabine and 23+/-12% for ara-G. CONCLUSION: The excellent CSF penetration of nelarabine and ara-G supports further study of the contribution of nelarabine to the prevention and treatment of CNS leukemia.",,"['Berg, Stacey L', 'Brueckner, Claudia', 'Nuchtern, Jed G', 'Dauser, Robert', 'McGuffey, Leticia', 'Blaney, Susan M']","['Berg SL', 'Brueckner C', 'Nuchtern JG', 'Dauser R', 'McGuffey L', 'Blaney SM']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, 6621 Fannin Street, MC3-3320, Houston, TX 77030, USA. sberg@txccc.org""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*blood/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Arabinonucleosides/*blood/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Prodrugs/pharmacokinetics']",2006/09/06 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2006/09/06 09:00'],"['2006/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-006-0328-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2007 May;59(6):743-7. doi: 10.1007/s00280-006-0328-0.

However, a significant percentage of CML patients develop resistance to imatinib and/or still progresses to blast crisis, a disease stage that is often refractory to imatinib therapy. Furthermore, there is compelling evidence indicating that the CML leukaemia stem cell is also resistant to imatinib. Thus, there is still a need for new drugs that, if combined with imatinib, will decrease the rate of relapse, fully overcome imatinib resistance and prevent blastic transformation of CML. We recently reported that the activity of the tumour suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is markedly inhibited in blast crisis CML patient cells and that molecular or pharmacologic re-activation of PP2A phosphatase led to growth suppression, enhanced apoptosis, impaired clonogenic potential and decreased in vivo leukaemogenesis of imatinib-sensitive and -resistant (T315I included) CML-BC patient cells and/or BCR/ABL+ myeloid progenitor cell lines.

Some of these TAs represent end-to-end chromosomal fusions and may subsequently initiate breakage-bridge-fusion cycles. Wild-type (wt) and myc box II mutant (mt) Myc induce different types of genomic instability when conditionally expressed in mouse proB cells (Ba/F3). Only wt Myc overexpressing Ba/F3 cells are capable of tumor formation in severe combined immunodeficient mice. In this study, we investigated whether telomere dysfunction leading to TA formation is linked to the genetic changes that permit wt c-Myc-dependent transformation of Ba/F3 cells. To this end, we examined the 3D organization of telomeres after the deregulated expression of deletion myc boxII mutant (Delta106) or wt Myc. Delta106-Myc overexpression did not induce TAs, whereas wt-Myc deregulation did. Instead, Delta106-Myc remodelled the 3D telomeric organization such that telomeres aligned in the center of the 3D interphase nucleus forming a telomeric disk owing to a Delta106-induced G1/S cell cycle arrest. In contrast, wt-Myc overexpression led to distorted telomere distribution and TA formation. Analysis of chromosomal alterations using spectral karyotyping confirmed Delta106-Myc and wt-Myc-associated genomic instability. A significant number of chromosomal end-to-end fusions indicative of telomere dysfunction were noted in wt-Myc-expressing cells only.

Feral mouse (Mus dunni) cells are not susceptible to infection by the ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), although they can be infected by other ecotropic murine leukemia viruses, including Friend MLV and Rauscher MLV. The relative inability of MoMLV to replicate in M. dunni cells has been attributed to two amino acids (V214 and G236) located within the third extracellular loop of the M. dunni CAT1 receptor (dCAT1). Via the exchange of the third extracellular loop of the mCAT1 cDNA encoding receptor from the permissive mouse and the corresponding portion of cDNA encoding for the nonpermissive M. dunni receptor, we have identified the most critical amino acid residue, which is a glycine located at position 236 within the third extracellular loop of dCAT1. We also attempted to determine the role of the third extracellular loop of the M. dunni CAT1 receptor with regard to the formation of the syncytium. The relationship between dCAT1 and virus-induced syncytia was suggested initially by our previous identification of two MLV isolates (S82F in Moloney and S84A in Friend MLV), both of which are uniquely cytopathic in M. dunni cells. In an attempt to determine the relationship existing between dCAT1 and the virally-induced syncytia, we infected 293-dCAT1 or chimeric dCAT1 cells with the S82F pseudotype virus. The S82F pseudotype virus did not induce the formation of syncytia, but did show increased susceptibility to 293 cells expressing dCAT1.

When each of these studies is scrutinized, however, there is only enough evidence to support a link between colorectal adenocarcinoma, SBA, and squamous and adenocarcinomas that are associated with perianal fistulizing disease. All of the studies of large bowel adenocarcinoma or SBA follow patients in an era during which there were far fewer effective medicines to treat CD and surgery was more commonplace. The only surveillance study of patients who had extensive, long-duration Crohn's colitis showed a 22% risk for developing neoplasia (low-grade, high-grade, or cancer) after four surveillance examinations. Overall results from this study and the multitude of the other studies show that the risk for cancer in Crohn's colitis is equal to that in UC given equal extent and duration of disease. Patients who have Crohn's colitis that affects at least one third of the colon and with at least 8 years of disease should undergo screening and surveillance, just as in UC. Although the absolute risk for SBA in CD is low (2.2% at 25 years in one study), we should not rule out screening and surveying for this complication that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients who have long-standing, extensive, small bowel disease. The risk for lymphoma and leukemia in CD is low, but immunomodulators and biologics may increase this risk.

Furthermore, the decrease or even disappearance of AgNORs from nucleoli was observed in HL-60 cells after the treatment with TP5. The suppression induced by TP5 was accompanied by an accumulation of cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. Moreover, TP5 significantly increased the NBT-reduction activity of HL-60 cells. Cytofluorometric and morphologic analysis indicated that TP5 had induced differentiation along the granulocytes lineage in HL-60 cells. d-tubocurarine (TUB) significantly antagonized the inhibitory effects induced by TP5, whereas atropine did not exhibit such effect.

A number of different methods have emerged for computing biclusters in gene expression data. Many of these algorithms may output a very large number of biclusters with varying degrees of overlap. There are no systematic methods that create a two-dimensional layout of the computed biclusters and display overlaps between them. RESULTS: We develop a novel algorithm for laying out biclusters in a two-dimensional matrix whose rows (respectively, columns) are rows (respectively, columns) of the original dataset. We display each bicluster as a contiguous submatrix in the layout. We allow the layout to have repeated rows and/or columns from the original matrix as required, but we seek a layout of the smallest size. We also develop a web-based search interface for the user to query the genes and samples of interest and visualise the layout of biclusters matching the queries. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on gene expression data for two types of leukaemia and on protein-DNA binding data for two growth conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Expression of CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) by tumor cells is associated with skin involvement, but CCR4 also has an important role in normal and tumor immunity. In a subset of patients with CCR4(+) T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, the tumor cells themselves function as regulatory T (Treg) cells, contributing to tumor survival in the face of host antitumor immune responses. In other types of cancers, the chemokines TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22, specific ligands for CCR4 that are produced by tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment, attract CCR4(+) Treg cells to the tumor, where they create a favorable environment for tumor escape from host immune responses. A novel humanized anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been developed, the Fc region of which is defucosylated to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by increasing its binding affinity to Fc receptor on effector cells. We are now conducting a phase I clinical trial of this anti-CCR4 mAb in patients with CCR4(+) T-cell leukemia/lymphoma in Japan (clinical trials gov. identifier: NCT00355472).

The ubiquitin-ligase SCF(Skp2) promotes degradation of phosphorylated p27 at T187 in the nucleus, resulting in G1/S progression of the cells. On the other hand, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-directed T157 nuclear localization signal (NLS) phosphorylation results in cytoplasmic sequestration of p27, leading to abnormal integrin-mediated proliferation of CD34(+) CML cells. METHODS: We demonstrate the generation of an engineered Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vector with a BAC backbone that has the unique capacity to carry doubly modified (DM) p27 (i.e. T187A, T157A p27) along with the BCR-ABL siRNA expression construct. The HSV-tk suicide gene has also been incorporated in the same vector, which promotes apoptosis in a BCR-ABL-independent pathway. RESULTS: Expression of DM p27 markedly inhibits proliferation of BCR-ABL(+) primary human CML cells. Moreover, DM p27 strongly inhibits the growth of imatinib-resistant CML cells, compared to the T157A p27 (SM p27). The CML growth inhibition is found to be the result of significant G1/S arrest with concomitant increase in hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb). Moreover, the EBV vector mediated stable RNA interference induces apoptosis in K562 cells and reduces myeloid colony forming units. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore propose a multi-gene delivery strategy for BCR-ABL(+) CML cells by targeting not only the fusion transcript, but also the downstream signaling, to overcome drug resistance in the acute phase of CML.","['Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Sengupta, Amitava', 'Banerjee, Debasish', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Banerjee, Subrata']","['Sengupta A', 'Banerjee D', 'Chandra S', 'Banerjee S']","['Structural Genomics Section & Biophysics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata 700 064, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'G1 Phase', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*chemical synthesis', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*chemical synthesis', 'Retinoblastoma/metabolism', 'S Phase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/09/05 09:00,2007/02/01 09:00,['2006/09/05 09:00'],"['2006/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.959 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2006 Oct;8(10):1251-61. doi: 10.1002/jgm.959.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that the CDK inhibitor R-roscovitine (Seliciclib or CYC202) markedly enhances resolution of established neutrophil-dependent inflammation in carrageenan-elicited acute pleurisy, bleomycin-induced lung injury, and passively induced arthritis in mice. In the pleurisy model, the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk prevents R-roscovitine-enhanced resolution of inflammation, indicating that this CDK inhibitor augments inflammatory cell apoptosis.

Acute PVT usually presents as abdominal pain. When the thrombus extends to the mesenteric venous arches, intestinal infarction can occur. Chronic PVT is usually recognized after a fortuitous diagnosis of hypersplenism or portal hypertension, or when there are biliary symptoms related to portal cholangiopathy. Local risk factors for PVT, such as an abdominal inflammatory focus, can be identified in 30% of patients with acute PVT; 70% of patients with acute and chronic PVT have a general risk factor for PVT, most commonly myeloproliferative disease. Early initiation of anticoagulation therapy for acute PVT is associated with complete and partial success in 50% and 40% of patients, respectively. A minimum of 6 months' anticoagulation therapy is recommended for the treatment of acute PVT. For patients with either form of PVT, permanent anticoagulation therapy should be considered if they have a permanent risk factor. In patients with large varices, beta-adrenergic blockade or endoscopic therapy seems to prevent bleeding as a result of portal hypertension, even in patients on anticoagulation therapy. In patients with jaundice or recurrent biliary symptoms caused by cholangiopathy, insertion of a biliary endoprosthesis is the first treatment option.

To investigate its functions in vivo, we generated Taspase1(-/-) mice. Taspase1 deficiency results in noncleavage (nc) of MLL and MLL2 and homeotic transformations. Remarkably, our in vivo studies uncover an unexpected role of Taspase1 in the cell cycle. Taspase1(-/-) animals are smaller in size. Taspase1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit impaired proliferation, and acute deletion of Taspase1 leads to a marked reduction of thymocytes. Taspase1 deficiency incurs down-regulation of Cyclin Es, As, and Bs and up-regulation of p16(Ink4a) . We show that MLL and MLL2 directly target E2Fs for Cyclin expression. The uncleaved precursor MLL displays a reduced histone H3 methyl transferase activity in vitro. Accordingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate a markedly decreased histone H3 K4 trimethylation at Cyclin E1 and E2 genes in Taspase1(-/-) cells. Furthermore, MLL(nc/nc;2nc/nc) MEFs are also impaired in proliferation. Our data are consistent with a model in which precursor MLLs, activated by Taspase1, target to Cyclins through E2Fs to methylate histone H3 at K4, leading to activation.

The antitumor potential of AEG35156, a novel second-generation antisense oligonucleotide directed toward XIAP, was assessed in human cancer models when given as a single agent and in combination with clinically relevant chemotherapeutics. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: AEG35156 was characterized for its ability to cause dose-dependent reductions of XIAP mRNA and protein in vitro and in vivo, to sensitize cancer cell lines to death stimuli, and to exhibit antitumor activity in multiple human cancer xenograft models as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. RESULTS: AEG35156 reduced XIAP mRNA levels with an EC50 of 8 to 32 nmol/L and decreased XIAP protein levels by >80%. Loss of XIAP protein correlated with increased sensitization to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis in Panc-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells. AEG35156 exhibited potent antitumor activity relative to control oligonucleotides in three human cancer xenograft models (prostate, colon, and lung) and was capable of inducing complete tumor regression when combined with taxanes.

CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose cyclophosphamide and high-dose celecoxib is well tolerated and active in pretreated aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Close surveillance for arterial and venous thrombotic events is recommended. The decline in circulating endothelial cells and their precursors suggests that this combination may be working by inhibiting angiogenesis but should be validated in a larger patient sample.",,"['Buckstein, Rena', 'Kerbel, Robert S', 'Shaked, Yuval', 'Nayar, Rakesh', 'Foden, Cindy', 'Turner, Ruth', 'Lee, Christine R', 'Taylor, Diane', 'Zhang, Liying', 'Man, Shan', 'Baruchel, Sylvain', 'Stempak, Diana', 'Bertolini, Francesco', 'Crump, Michael']","['Buckstein R', 'Kerbel RS', 'Shaked Y', 'Nayar R', 'Foden C', 'Turner R', 'Lee CR', 'Taylor D', 'Zhang L', 'Man S', 'Baruchel S', 'Stempak D', 'Bertolini F', 'Crump M']","[""Medical Oncology, Toronto Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre, Sunnybrook and Women's College, Medical Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario, Canada. rena.buckstein@sw.ca""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Celecoxib', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/blood']",2006/09/05 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2006/09/05 09:00'],"['2006/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/17/5190 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0474 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Sep 1;12(17):5190-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0474.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase I/II study was done to determine safety and efficacy of everolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two dose levels (5 and 10 mg orally once daily continuously) were evaluated in the phase I portion of this study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus to be used in the phase II study. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (9 acute myelogenous leukemia, 5 myelodysplastic syndrome, 6 B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 4 mantle cell lymphoma, 1 myelofibrosis, 1 natural killer cell/T-cell leukemia, and 1 T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia) received everolimus. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Grade 3 potentially drug-related toxicities included hyperglycemia (22%), hypophosphatemia (7%), fatigue (7%), anorexia (4%), and diarrhea (4%). One patient developed a cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis requiring a skin graft. One patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts achieved a major platelet response of over 3-month duration. A second patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts showed a minor platelet response of 25-day duration. Phosphorylation of downstream targets of mTOR, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, and/or, p70 S6 kinase, was inhibited in six of nine patient samples, including those from the patient with a major platelet response. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus is well tolerated at a daily dose of 10 mg daily and may have activity in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.

Promoter hypermethylation as a mechanism of gene inactivation in renal cell carcinoma has been shown for only a small number of genes. We examined the usefulness of quantitative methylation analysis with a new set of p53 target genes for determining the clinical outcome and aggressiveness of the tumor disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The genes selected were APAF-1, CASPASE-8, DAPK-1, IGFBP-3, and PML. The tissue samples analyzed were taken from tumor specimens obtained from 90 consecutive patients with clear cell renal carcinoma and from 20 normal kidney specimens. Quantitative methylation analysis of CpG sites in the promoter region was done by methylation-specific real-time PCR and the normalized index of methylation (NIM) was determined for each sample. RESULTS: Hypermethylation of the promoter region was common for APAF-1 (97%) and DAPK-1 (41%) but not for IGFBP-3 (3%), PML (3%), or CASP-8 (0%). The tumor patients had a median follow-up of 55 months. A correlation was found between the methylation level of APAF-1 and tumor size and nodal status, but not for tumor stage, grade, and age of patient. Kaplan-Meier analysis was able to identify patients with a higher risk of recurrence and tumor-related death by using APAF-1 (>or=56% NIM) and DAPK-1 (>or=10% NIM) methylation levels. In multivariate analysis, APAF-1 and DAPK-1 methylation levels were independent prognostic markers for metastatic disease and death from renal cell carcinoma.

We proposed to define the prevalence of the two telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMM), to assess their association with histology, and to compare their prognostic relevance in a series of 93 patients with liposarcoma. ALT was detected by assaying ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and TA was assayed using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol. ALT or TA was found in 25.9% or 26.6% of 139 tested liposarcoma lesions, respectively. Three lesions were ALT+/TA+ whereas approximately 50% of lesions did not show any known TMM. TMM phenotype was consistent during disease progression. ALT was prevalent in dedifferentiated and in grade 3 liposarcomas whereas TA prevailed in most round-cell myxoid and in grade 2 liposarcomas. ALT and TA incidence was similar in primary and recurrent lesions whereas metastases were more frequently TA+ than ALT+ (59% versus 18%; P = 0.04). TMM presence negatively affected patient prognosis (P = 0.001): increased mortality was associated with positivity for TA (P = 0.038) or ALT (P < 0.0001) compared with TMM absence. ALT proved to be a stronger prognostic discriminant of increased mortality than TA even when adjusted for tumor location, grade, and histology (hazard ratio for cause-specific death, 3.58 versus 1.15).

A pilot study was carried out in eight refractory or high-risk AML patients not eligible for intensive therapy to assess the biological and therapeutic activities of the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) used to remodel chromatin, followed by the addition of ATRA, to activate gene transcription and differentiation in leukemic cells. Hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 was detectable at therapeutic VPA serum levels (>or=50 microg/mL) in blood mononuclear cells from seven of eight patients. This correlated with myelomonocytic differentiation of leukemic cells as revealed by morphologic, cytochemical, immunophenotypic, and gene expression analyses. Differentiation of the leukemic clone was proven by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showing the cytogenetic lesion +8 or 7q- in differentiating cells. Hematologic improvement, according to established criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes, was observed in two cases. Stable disease and disease progression were observed in five and one cases, respectively.

AMG 706 inhibited human endothelial cell proliferation induced by VEGF, but not by basic fibroblast growth factor in vitro, as well as vascular permeability induced by VEGF in mice. Oral administration of AMG 706 potently inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the rat corneal model and induced regression of established A431 xenografts. AMG 706 was well tolerated and had no significant effects on body weight or on the general health of the animals.

Examination of the plasma cell lines ARH-77, CAG, and AKR revealed two distinct subpopulations of cells, one displaying highly adhesive properties (type A) and the other consisting of poorly adhesive, floating cells (type F). In the ARH-77 cell line, type A cells attach better to fibronectin and to human bone fragments and form paxillin-rich focal adhesions, whereas type F cells are highly motile and exert integrin-dependent bone marrow homing capacity in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Flow cytometry indicated that type A cells express significantly higher levels of CD45 and CD56 and lower levels of CD138 compared with type F cells. Interestingly, culturing of either type A or type F cells under nonselective conditions resulted in the development of mixed cell population similar to the parental ARH-77 cells. Analysis of bone marrow aspirates of multiple myeloma patients revealed that spicules within the aspirates are enriched with type A-like cells. Nonadherent cells within the aspirate fluids express a marker profile similar to type F cells.

To understand the molecular etiology of the increase in mutant frequencies following chemotherapy, we investigated the HPRT mutation spectra and the extent of clonal proliferation in 562 HPRT T cell mutant isolates of 87 blood samples from 47 subjects at diagnosis, during chemotherapy, and postchemotherapy. We observed a significant increase in the proportion of CpG transitions following treatment (13.6-23.3%) compared with healthy controls (4.0%) and a significant decrease in V(D)J-mediated deletions following treatment (0-6.8%) compared with healthy controls (17.0%). There was also a significant change in the class type percentage of V(D)J-mediated HPRT deletions following treatment. In addition, there was a >5-fold increase in T cell receptor gene usage-defined mean clonal proliferation from diagnosis compared with the completion of chemotherapeutic intervention. These data indicate that unique genetic alterations and extensive clonal proliferation are occurring in children following treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia that may influence long-term risks for multifactorial diseases, including secondary cancers.",,"['Kendall, Heather E', 'Vacek, Pamela M', 'Rivers, Jami L', 'Rice, Sederick C', 'Messier, Terri L', 'Finette, Barry A']","['Kendall HE', 'Vacek PM', 'Rivers JL', 'Rice SC', 'Messier TL', 'Finette BA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/blood/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",2006/09/05 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2006/09/05 09:00'],"['2006/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/17/8455 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4015 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Sep 1;66(17):8455-61. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4015.,,,,"['1K01CA77737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA09094013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R29HD35309/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA22435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessment of cell cycle phase kinetics might be important for prediction of clinical behaviour and prognosis. METHODS: Distribution of neoplastic cells in CLL within the cell cycle was evaluated by determining the labelling indices (LI, i.e. percentage of positive cells) of markers specific for late G1-phase (cyclin E), S-phase (cyclin A), and G2/M-phase (cyclin B1), and Mcm2, a novel marker of proliferative potential, in a large cohort of patients (n = 79) using tissue microarray (TMA) technology. Utilising a combination of these markers, an algorithm was developed--subtracting the combined LIs of cyclin E, cyclin A and cyclin B1 from the LI of Mcm2--to determine the percentage of tumour cells residing in early G1-phase, which is probably a critical state for the malignant potential of CLL. RESULTS: 27.11% of cells had acquired proliferative potential as indicated by expression of Mcm2. Only a small number of cells were found to be in late G1-phase (7.16%), S-phase (3.31%) or G2/M-phase (0.98%), while 15.66% of cells were considered to be in early G1-phase. CONCLUSION: Cell cycle phase distribution can easily be assessed by immunohistochemistry in routinely processed paraffin-embedded specimens. A large number of neoplastic cells in CLL have proliferative potential, with a significant sub-population residing in early G1-phase. Estimates of these cells may identify cases likely to exhibit a more aggressive biological behaviour and adverse clinical course.",,"['Obermann, Ellen C', 'Went, Philip', 'Tzankov, Alexandar', 'Pileri, Stefano A', 'Hofstaedter, Ferdinand', 'Marienhagen, Joerg', 'Stoehr, Robert', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan']","['Obermann EC', 'Went P', 'Tzankov A', 'Pileri SA', 'Hofstaedter F', 'Marienhagen J', 'Stoehr R', 'Dirnhofer S']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany. ellen.obermann@klinik.uni-regensburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (MCM2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Female', '*G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Array Analysis/methods']",2006/09/05 09:00,2007/08/01 09:00,['2006/09/05 09:00'],"['2006/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcp.2006.040956 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2006.040956 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2007 Jul;60(7):794-7. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2006.040956.

In addition, results from antibody ligation and cell-surface biotinylation indicated that proform of NE was targeted to the plasma membrane, and then subjected to endocytosis.

However, the mechanism remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanism underlying its cytotoxicity by using human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562. We found that TCS induced apoptosis in K562 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and can be blocked by caspase-3 inhibitors. Interestingly, TCS treatment induced a transient elevation in intracellular calcium concentration and a slow increase in reactive oxygen species production, while calcium chelators and antioxidants had no obvious effect on TCS-induced apoptosis, suggesting that calcium changes and reactive oxygen species may not be involved in TCS-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells. Instead we found that TCS partly inhibited PKC activity. Indeed, the PKC activator, PMA, inhibited while the PKC inhibitor, calphostin c, enhanced TCS-induced apoptosis. These PKC modulators had similar effects on TCS-induced cleavage of caspase-3, and caspase-3 inhibitors prevented calphostin c-enhanced apoptosis induced by TCS.

Other mechanisms include genomic amplification of BCR-ABL and modulation of drug efflux or influx transporters. There is a pressing need, therefore, to develop and test novel drugs and strategies.

Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins are differentially expressed in B-cell lymphomas. The functions of some IAPs are counteracted by the cell death inducer, second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases/direct IAP binding protein with low pI (Smac/DIABLO). In this study, we investigated the expression levels of Smac/DIABLO in 14 lymphoma cell lines by Western blot analysis. We also assessed 247 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 40 Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) tumors using immunohistochemical methods. Smac/DIABLO was expressed in most NHL and all HL cell lines. In NHL, Smac/DIABLO was expressed in 117 (47%) tumors and was differentially expressed in various NHL types. In most NHLs, from 29% to 68% of tumors were positive; however, Smac/DIABLO was not detected in small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Burkitt lymphoma, and was rare in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. In HL, Smac/DIABLO was positive in 25 (63%) tumors. Unlike NHL, all types of HL were positive for Smac/DIABLO, although nodular sclerosis was least often positive. The differential expression of Smac/DIABLO in NHLs suggests that apoptotic mechanisms are differentially involved in their pathogenesis.

DESIGN: Prospective experimental study. SETTING: University laboratory. PATIENT(S): Four hESC cell lines. INTERVENTION(S): The effect of LIF on receptor expression level was studied in cultures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Gene expression in the hESC line HS237 was analyzed using microarrays. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the microarray results in four hESC lines (HS181, HS235, HS237, HS293). Immunohistochemistry was used to assay LIF, LIF receptor, and gp130 protein expression. Cell surface morphology was studied using scanning electron microscopy. RESULT(S): The expression of LIF, LIF receptor, and gp130 messenger RNA and protein was increased in spontaneously differentiated HS237 cells compared with undifferentiated cells, with high expression of an inhibitor of LIF-mediated signaling, suppressor of cytokine signaling-1, in undifferentiated hESCs. Genes, those expressed specifically and those shared in undifferentiated hESCs, differentiated cells, and in fibroblasts, were identified. Supplementation with LIF did not affect the LIF receptor expression. CONCLUSION(S): The expression of LIF and its receptors is low in undifferentiated hESCs but increases during differentiation. Added LIF does not prevent spontaneous differentiation.

In the present study, we evaluated changes in oxidative stress and human 8-hydroxyguanine glycosylase1 gene (hOGG1) expression in depressive patients with acute leukemia. Ninety two cases were assessed using the Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS) and multiple-item questionnaires. We measured total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and the concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) during a pre-treatment period. The steady-state expression of hOGG1 mRNA transcripts was monitored. The incidence of depression was 47.83%. There was a significant decrease in serum T-AOC and SOD concentrations in depressive patients compared to the control subjects, whereas the opposite was the case for serum concentrations of ROS, NO and MDA. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that hOGG1 mRNA expression was greater in depressive patients than in the controls. Person correlation analysis revealed that depression was correlated positively with sex, the course of the disease and hOGG1 mRNA expression; depression was correlated negatively with T-AOC. Based on these results, we conclude that the antioxidant system is impaired in leukemic patients with affective disorders.

However, leukemia risks at lower exposures are uncertain. Benzene occurs widely in the work environment and also indoor air, but mostly below 1 ppm, so assessing the leukemia risks at these low concentrations is important. Here, we describe a human physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that quantifies tissue doses of benzene and its key metabolites, benzene oxide, phenol, and hydroquinone after inhalation and oral exposures. The model was integrated into a statistical framework that acknowledges sources of variation due to inherent intra- and interindividual variation, measurement error, and other data collection issues. A primary contribution of this work is the estimation of population distributions of key PBPK model parameters. We hypothesized that observed interindividual variability in the dosimetry of benzene and its metabolites resulted primarily from known or estimated variability in key metabolic parameters and that a statistical PBPK model that explicitly included variability in only those metabolic parameters would sufficiently describe the observed variability.

The results of recent clinical trials seem to confirm these preclinical observations. METHODS: For the current study, the authors evaluated the feasibility, efficacy, and toxicity of combined regimens that consisted of either rituximab plus cladribine (2-CdA) (the RC regimen) or RC plus cyclophosphamide (the RCC regimen) in the treatment of patients with heavily pretreated, indolent lymphoid malignancies. Fifty-four adult patients with recurrent or refractory, low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (LG-NHL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) were treated according to the RC/RCC regimens. The RC protocol consisted of intravenous rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) on Day 1 and 2-CdA at a dose of .12 mg/kg per day on Days 2 through 6. The RCC protocol consisted of rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) on Day 1, 2-CdA at a dose of 0.12 mg/m(2) on Days 2 through 4, and intravenous cyclophosphamide at a dose of 250 mg/m(2) per day on Days 2 to 4. The RC/RCC courses were repeated at 4-week intervals. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with B-CLL, 12 patients with LG-NHL and 9 patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) entered the study. Thirty-three patients (61%) had recurrent disease after prior therapy, and 21 patients (39%) had refractory disease. Thirty-one patients were treated on the RC regimen, and 23 patients were treated on the RCC regimen. Six patients (11%) achieved a complete response, and 33 patients (60%) achieved a partial response. The median failure-free survival of responders was 10.5 months. The treatment revealed tolerability, with episodes of severe neutropenia (Grade 3 and 4 [according to World Health Organization criteria]) observed in 6 patients (11%), episodes of Grade 3 and 4 infections observed in 11 patients (20%), and episodes of Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia observed in 4 patients (7%).

Presently they are mainly produced using adherent cells. However, due to the restrictive nature of adherent cell culture, this mode of production is hampered by low cell-specific productivity and small production units. The large-scale production of retroviral vectors could benefit from the adaptation of retrovirus packaging cell lines to suspension culture. Here, we describe the ability of a 293 packaging cell line to produce retroviral vectors in suspension culture at high titer. Adherent 293GPG cells, producing a Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MoMLV) retrovirus vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSVG) envelope protein and expressing a TK-GFP fusion protein, were adapted to suspension culture in calcium-free DMEM. At a cell density similar to adherent cell culture, the suspension culture produced retroviral vector consistently in the range of 1 x 10(7) infectious viral particles/mL (IVP/mL), with a specific productivity threefold higher than adherent culture. Furthermore, at the same medium replacement frequency, the suspension producer cells could be cultured at higher density than their adherent counterparts, which resulted in virus titer of 3-4 x 10(7) IVP/mL at 11.0 x 10(6) cells/mL. This corresponds to a 10-fold increase in viral concentration compared to adherent cells. The capacity to up scale the retroviral vector production was also demonstrated by performing a 2 VVD perfusion culture for 9 days in a 3L Chemap bioreactor. The combination of suspension and perfusion led to a 20-fold increase in maximum virus productivity compared to the adherent culture.","['(c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ghani, Karim', 'Garnier, Alain', 'Coelho, Helene', 'Transfiguracion, Julia', 'Trudel, Pierre', 'Kamen, Amine']","['Ghani K', 'Garnier A', 'Coelho H', 'Transfiguracion J', 'Trudel P', 'Kamen A']","['Biotechnology Research Institute, National Research Council Canada, 6100 Royalmount Avenue, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H4P 2R2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Acoustics', 'Bioreactors/*virology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line/*virology', 'Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Filtration', 'Genetic Vectors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Retroviridae/growth & development', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",2006/09/02 09:00,2006/12/12 09:00,['2006/09/02 09:00'],"['2006/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.20947 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2006 Nov 5;95(4):653-60. doi: 10.1002/bit.20947.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to estimate the association between treatment with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and development of cancer in patients with RA. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study pooling administrative databases from 2 US states and 1 Canadian province. A cohort of patients who had received a diagnosis of RA on > or =1 occasion and had been prescribed DMARDs was identified. We categorized patients with a prescription for a biologic DMARD as biologic DMARD users, and those with a prescription for methotrexate (MTX) but no biologic DMARD as MTX users. We used time-varying propensity scores to adjust for the large number of possible confounders and stratified proportional hazards regression to estimate the effects of biologic DMARDs on cancer. The primary end points were hematologic malignancies (lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia) and common solid tumors (colorectal, lung, stomach, breast, prostate, uterine, ovarian, urinary tract/bladder, and melanoma). RESULTS: The pooled cohort included 1,152 biologic DMARD users and 7,306 MTX users. We identified 11 hematologic malignancies and 46 solid tumors during 2,940 person-years of biologic DMARD use, and 88 hematologic malignancies and 558 solid tumors during 30,300 person-years of MTX use. Comparing biologic DMARD users with MTX users, the propensity score-adjusted pooled hazard ratio was 1.37 (95% confidence interval 0.71-2.65) for hematologic malignancies and 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.65-1.26) for solid tumors. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that users of biologic agents are unlikely to have a substantial increase in the risk of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors as compared with MTX users.

Acute monoblastic leukemia was diagnosed. Two subsequent courses of consolidation chemotherapy consisted of conventional doses of cytarabine and intermediate-dose cytarabine.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed an increase in the number of cells to 31 mm(-3); the majority were lymphocytes. No infiltration of leukemia cells was seen. After 2 months, brain MRI findings were normal. The clinicoradiologic features of the case were consistent with reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). RPLS in the present case was unlikely to have been caused by direct neurotoxicity because (1) the doses of cytarabine (500 mg/m(2); total dose 9.2 g) were much smaller than those in reported cases and were repeatedly infused until RPLS developed; (2) the RPLS developed 21 days after the final infusion of cytarabine, a much longer period than previously reported; (3) the slight leukocytosis in the CSF observed on day 33 might also have been related to the cellular immune responses evoked by the infused cytarabine.

Recent studies, predominantly using actively dividing cell lines, have suggested that this compound could be used as a chemopreventative or therapeutic agent for epithelial tumors. As curcumin has been reported to inhibit the NIK/IKK complex, an activity that would be expected to induce apoptosis in B cell malignancies, we sought to determine whether curcumin induces apoptosis in vitro in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. Primary leukemic cells were incubated with varying dosages of curcumin, followed by assessment for apoptosis. The role of PPARgamma or NF-kappaB signaling in curcumin-induced apoptosis was examined by cotreatment with a PPARgamma antagonist or EMSA of nuclear NFkappaB complexes. We also examined whether a clinically achievable concentration of curcumin (1 microM) would augment the apoptotic effects of fludarabine, dexamethasone, vincristine or the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram. In B-CLL cells from 14 patients, curcumin-induced apoptosis with a mean EC(50) of 5.5 microM. In contrast, the EC(50) for whole mononuclear cells from a healthy donor was 21.8 microM.

Previously, we demonstrated that loss of the activator protein-2alpha (AP-2alpha) expression results in overexpression of the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) in human melanoma cell lines. Here, we used a tissue microarray platform that consisted of 64 melanocytic lesions, including dysplastic nevi (N=21), primary melanoma (N=20), and metastatic melanoma (N=23). We analyzed the expression of AP-2 and PAR-1 simultaneously by immunofluorescent microscopy with an automated quantification laser scanning cytometer. AP-2 was highly expressed in normal cutaneous melanocytes and dysplastic nevi but not in melanoma metastases. We observed a significantly higher number of AP-2-positive cells in the dysplastic nevi (P=0.0013) and primary melanoma (P=0.0023) compared to the metastatic melanoma. In contrast, we observed a significantly higher percentage of PAR-1-positive cells in the metastatic melanoma compared to dysplastic nevi (P=0.0072) and primary melanoma (P=0.0138). Increased expression of PAR-1 in metastatic melanomas contributes to tumor progression by modulating expression of genes, such as IL-8, matrix metalloproteinase-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and integrins. These findings support our hypothesis that loss of AP-2 is a crucial event in the progression of human melanoma and contributes to the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype via upregulation of PAR-1.",,"['Tellez, Carmen S', 'Davis, Darren W', 'Prieto, Victor G', 'Gershenwald, Jeffrey E', 'Johnson, Marcella M', 'McCarty, Marya F', 'Bar-Eli, Menashe']","['Tellez CS', 'Davis DW', 'Prieto VG', 'Gershenwald JE', 'Johnson MM', 'McCarty MF', 'Bar-Eli M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Receptor, PAR-1)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)']",IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Dysplastic Nevus Syndrome/metabolism/pathology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Laser Scanning Cytometry', 'Melanocytes/*metabolism', 'Melanoma/*metabolism/*pathology/secondary', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptor, PAR-1/*metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcription Factor AP-2/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/09/02 09:00,2007/02/13 09:00,['2006/09/02 09:00'],"['2006/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(15)33258-9 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.jid.5700539 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2007 Feb;127(2):387-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.jid.5700539.

Cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation assay. The ability to bind to human RXRalpha and to activate either human retinoic acid response element (RARE)-mediated gene expression or rat CRABPII retinoid X response element (RXRalpha)-mediated gene expression were determined using luciferase reporter plasmids. In terms of the magnitude of the regulatory activity for the proliferation and differentiation of HL-60 cells, the compounds ranked as follows: ATRA>13-ethyl ATRA>13-demethyl ATRA>13-phenylethyl ATRA>13-propyl ATRA>13-butyl ATRA (ATRA analogues) and 9CRA>13-ethyl 9CRA>13-demethyl 9CRA>13-propyl 9CRA>13-phenetyl 9CRA>13-butyl 9CRA (9CRA analogues).

Similar trends were observed in binding affinity for RXRalpha and transactivation activity toward RARE- or RXRE-mediated gene expression. The results clearly indicate that the presence of a methyl group at C-13 is essential for the antitumoral activity of ATRA and 9CRA, and that bulky substituents exceeding two carbon atoms or the absence of substitution at position 13 significantly reduce the binding affinity for RAR and RXR, leading to a decreased RAR/RARE and/or RXR/RXRE-mediated gene expression.",,"['Mizuguchi, Yukari', 'Wada, Akimori', 'Nakagawa, Kimie', 'Ito, Masayoshi', 'Okano, Toshio']","['Mizuguchi Y', 'Wada A', 'Nakagawa K', 'Ito M', 'Okano T']","['Department of Hygienic Sciences, Kobe Pharmaceutical University, Motoyamakitamachi, Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/drug effects/physiology', 'Retinoid X Receptors/chemistry/drug effects/physiology', 'Tretinoin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2006/09/02 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/09/02 09:00'],"['2006/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/29.1803 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.29.1803 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2006 Sep;29(9):1803-9. doi: 10.1248/bpb.29.1803.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that normal pre-B cells proliferating in the presence of interleukin (IL)-7 enter cell-cycle arrest after exposure to TGF-beta1. However, clonally related IL-7-independent tumors induced by oncogenes abl + myc or raf + myc have reduced sensitivity to TGF-beta1.

A report from the United Kingdom childhood cancer study (UKCCS).,1504-13,"BACKGROUND: It is widely believed that children of high socioeconomic status (SES) are more likely than those of low SES to develop acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Such observations have led to wide-ranging speculations about the potential aetiological role of factors associated with affluence and modernization. METHODS: Children (0-14 years) newly diagnosed with cancer in the UK between 1991 and 1996 were ascertained via a rapid hospital-based case finding system (n = 4430, of which 1578 were ALL). Children without cancer (controls) were randomly selected from primary care population registries for comparative purposes (n = 7763). Area-based deprivation scores were assigned as markers of SES at two time points - birth and diagnosis. An individual-based marker of SES - social class - was assigned using father's occupation as recorded on the child's birth certificate. RESULTS: No differences in area-based measures of deprivation were observed between cases and controls at time of diagnosis, either for all cancers combined [n = 4430, odds ratio (OR) = 1.00 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.98-1.01)] or for ALL alone (n = 1578 OR = 0.99, 95%CI 0.96-1.01). Findings were similar at time of birth (all cancers, OR = 0.99 95%CI 0.98-1.01, ALL OR = 0.98, 95%CI 0.96-1.00).

The clinical feasibility of implanting seeded stents depends on the ability to achieve adequate stent coverage within a clinically applicable time frame. We tested the hypothesis that this goal could be achieved by seeding stents with human ECs overexpressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and by using an efficient gene transfer system. METHODS AND RESULTS: Efficiency of gene transfer to human ECs using an amphotropic retroviral vector and a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) pseudo-typed retroviral vector was examined and compared. For assessment of transduction rates, LacZ-encoding vectors were used and beta-galactosidase activity was determined 48 h after gene transfer. The transduction rate of primary human ECs using the amphotropic retroviral vector encoding the LacZ gene was low (2.9+/-2% of cells). Under the same conditions, the GALV pseudo-typed vector encoding LacZ transduced 94+/-2% of cells (P<.001). To test the effect of VEGF gene transfer on stent coverage, we transduced ECs using a bicistronic GALV pseudo-typed retroviral vector encoding either GFP alone or both VEGF and GFP. Since all transduced cells expressed GFP, stent coverage by ECs could be assessed by fluorescent inverted microscopy, which demonstrated that stent coverage by ECs overexpressing VEGF was more rapid and effective than coverage by ECs overexpressing GFP. Progressively increasing quantities of VEGF protein were detected in the conditioned medium of stents seeded with endothelia cells expressing VEGF 2, 3, and 5 days after seeding. CONCLUSIONS: High-rate gene transfer to human primary ECs was observed 48 h after transduction with GALV pseudo-typed retroviral vectors, eliminating the need for the time-consuming process of cell selection. Seeding with ECs overexpressing VEGF improved stent coverage and was associated with continuing secretion of the protein. The findings provide support for the feasibility of implanting genetically engineered biologically active cellular-coated stents.",,"['Koren, Belly', 'Weisz, Anat', 'Fischer, Lukas', 'Gluzman, Zoya', 'Preis, Meir', 'Avramovitch, Naomi', 'Cohen, Tzafra', 'Cosset, Francois-Loic', 'Lewis, Basil S', 'Flugelman, Moshe Y']","['Koren B', 'Weisz A', 'Fischer L', 'Gluzman Z', 'Preis M', 'Avramovitch N', 'Cohen T', 'Cosset FL', 'Lewis BS', 'Flugelman MY']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center, Bruce Rappaport School of Medicine, Technion-IIT, Haifa 34362, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cardiovasc Revasc Med,Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,101238551,"['0 (Metals)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Blood Vessel Prosthesis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/metabolism/surgery', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Equipment Design', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lac Operon/genetics', '*Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', '*Metals', 'Saphenous Vein/cytology/metabolism/surgery', '*Stents', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",2006/09/02 09:00,2007/02/17 09:00,['2006/09/02 09:00'],"['2005/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1553-8389(05)00198-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.carrev.2005.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Revasc Med. 2006 Jul-Sep;7(3):173-8. doi: 10.1016/j.carrev.2005.12.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) is the major metabolite of inorganic arsenicals (iAs) in urine, it is not clear how DMA(V) is produced from iAs. In the present study we report that S-(dimethylarsino)-glutathione (DMA(III)(SG)), a putative precursor of dimethylarsinic acid DMA(V), was unstable in the culture medium without excess GSH and generated volatile substances which were highly cytotoxic for both rat heart microvascular endothelial cells and HL60, a human leukemia cell line. Cytotoxicity of DMA(III)(SG) was higher than that of iAs and its LC(50) value was calculated to be 7.8 microM in the endothelial cells. To our surprise DMA(III)(SG) effectively killed cells in the neighbor wells of the same multi-well dish, indicating that volatile toxic compounds generated from DMA(III)(SG) in the culture medium. High performance lipid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICPMS) analyses suggested that the freshly generated volatile compounds dissolved into aqueous solution and formed an unstable arsenic compound and the unstable compound was further converted to DMA(V).

In this study, therefore, the ability of T. sinensis to induce apoptosis was studied in cultured human premyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Treatment of the HL-60 cells with a variety of concentrations of the aqueous extracts of T. sinensis (TS extracts) (10-75 microg/ml) and gallic acid (5-10 microg/ml), the natural phenolic components purified from TS extracts, resulted in dose- and time-dependent sequences of events marked by apoptosis, as shown by loss of cell viability and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, apoptosis in the HL-60 cells was accompanied by the release of cytochrome c, caspase 3 activation and specific proteolytic cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). This increase in TS extracts- and gallic acid-induced apoptosis was also associated with a reduction in the levels of Bcl-2, a potent cell-death inhibitor, and an increase in those of the Bax protein, which heterodimerizes with and thereby inhibits Bcl-2. Interestingly, TS extracts- and gallic acid-induced dose-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HL-60 cells. We found that catalase significantly decreased TS extracts- or gallic acid-induced cytotoxicity, DNA fragmentation, and ROS production, however, slight reduction was observed with vitamins C and E. Our results indicate that TS extracts- or gallic acid-induced HL-60 apoptotic cell death could be due to the generation of ROS, especially H(2)O(2).

Recent studies have identified megakaryocytic acute leukemia (MAL), a serum response factor (SRF) co-activator, as a key component of a signaling pathway linking changes in the actin cytoskeleton to SRF-mediated transcription. To help define the role of this pathway in regulating dendritic morphology, we have characterized the pattern of MAL expression in the developing and adult brain, and have examined its role in regulating dendritic morphology in cultured cortical neurons. In histological studies of mouse brain, we found prominent expression of MAL in neurons in adult hippocampus and cerebral cortex. MAL immunostaining revealed localization of this protein in neuronal cell bodies and apical dendrites. During development, an increase in MAL expression occurs during the second post-natal week. Expression of dominant negative MAL constructs or MAL siRNA in cortical neurons grown in primary culture reduces the number of dendritic processes and decreases the basal level of SRF-mediated transcription. Taken together, these findings indicate that the MAL-SRF signaling pathway plays a key role in regulating dendritic morphology.",,"['Shiota, Jun', 'Ishikawa, Mitsuru', 'Sakagami, Hiroyuki', 'Tsuda, Masaaki', 'Baraban, Jay M', 'Tabuchi, Akiko']","['Shiota J', 'Ishikawa M', 'Sakagami H', 'Tsuda M', 'Baraban JM', 'Tabuchi A']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama City, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (megakaryocytic acute leukemia protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/drug effects/embryology/growth & development/*metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Cerebral Cortex/cytology', 'Dendrites/*metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neurons/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Tissue Distribution']",2006/09/02 09:00,2006/11/09 09:00,['2006/09/02 09:00'],"['2006/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['JNC3992 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03992.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2006 Sep;98(6):1778-88. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03992.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that detecting minimal residual disease is important in order to predict early clinical relapse. We followed 88 leukemic patients with pre- and posttransplant Wilms tumor gene (WT1) levels to predict relapse and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) for engraftment. We have found that high pretransplant WT1 levels correlated significantly with relapse in all patient groups, but more significantly in the acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) patients. Posttransplant WT1 level correlated with VNTR status such that low WT1 is associated invariably with VNTR of 100% donor origin, while high WT1 is associated with VNTR of 20%. The association is significant in all patients, specifically in ANLL patients. In this preliminary study, we demonstrate that patients harboring detectable levels of WT1 prior to stem cell transplant have a higher chance of relapse, and posttransplant WT1 and VNTR status appeared to be dependent parameters predicting relapse when present in the posttransplant period.

As a direct response to this increased environmental risk, itraconazole (ITC) was administered for primary prophylaxis in pediatric cancer patients for whom a particular high risk of IA was anticipated due to prolonged severe neutropenia (>10 days), autologous stem cell transplantation, acute myeloblastic leukemia or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or high-dose steroids >3 weeks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, prospective observational study, ITC was given in ITC solution or capsule. Trough concentrations were measured in plasma with high-performance liquid chromatography after at least 7 days of treatment. Doses were adjusted to target plasma trough ITC concentrations > or =0.5 mg/l. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2005, 39 pediatric cancer patients received 44 prophylactic ITC cycles; 102 trough plasma concentrations were measured after oral administration. Plasma target concentrations >0.5 mg/l were achieved with both formulations. A median dose of 8 mg kg(-1) day(-1) (3.5-16.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) was necessary in pediatric oncology patients. The bioavailability of the liquid formulation was significantly lower when the solution was given by a feeding tube. Adverse effects (gastrointestinal, elevated transaminases, and one hemolysis) which led to the cessation of the ITC prophylaxis were reported in 11% of all courses. No breakthrough infection was seen in this pediatric population. CONCLUSION: Oral ITC offers a feasible and inexpensive option for antifungal prophylaxis in selected pediatric cancer patients.

On the other side, MTHFR enzyme causes methylation of homocysteine into methionine, leading to methylation of DNA. Chemotherapeutic agents have different effects, but DNA is the target for most of them. Because folate is the cornerstone in DNA synthesis, we analysed herein if the polymorphisms in MTHFR gene can alter the susceptibility of lymphoproliferative disease risk and if it has an effect on chemotherapy response. One hundred fifty-six patients with lymphoid malignancies and 82 healthy controls were included into the study. Neither gene frequencies nor allel frequencies were found to increase lymphoproliferative disease risk significantly in both overall group and subgroups. Although it was not statistically significant, we found a 2.7-fold increased risk in acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL)/Burkitt lymphoma patients with TT genotype [odds ratio (OR), 2.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88-8.2] than CC genotype but a 1.7-fold decreased risk with TT genotype in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.17-1.88) and a 1.8-fold decreased risk in Hodgkin's lymphoma with TT genotype (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.10-2.87) than CC genotype. The chemotherapy response was analysed in DLBCL, Hodgkin's lymphoma and ALL/Burkitt's lymphoma because these patients received standard chemotherapy protocols. No significant difference was detected between responder and non-responders according to MTHFR T677C polymorphism, but the patients who had TT genotype respond 1.75-fold worse than CC (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.07-4.64) in ALL patients (p=0.59), and in DLBCL, CT genotype revealed a 1.8-fold worse response than CC genotype (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.17-1.7), but TT genotype revealed 2.6-fold better response rates than patients with CC genotype (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 0.26-26.8). As a conclusion, MTHFR C677T polymorphism does not increase the risk of lymphoproliferative disease, and it does not have an effect on chemotherapy response significantly; however, the patients with TT genotype have a slightly increased risk for ALL, and they also respond worse than CC genotype.

Mutations in human BCOR cause male lethal, X-linked oculofaciocardiodental syndrome. We identified a BCOR complex containing Polycomb group (PcG) and Skp-Cullin-F-box subcomplexes. The PcG proteins include RING1, RYBP, NSPC1, a Posterior Sex Combs homolog, and RNF2, an E3 ligase for the mono-ubiquitylation of H2A. BCOR complex components and mono-ubiquitylated H2A localize to BCL6 targets, indicating that the BCOR complex employs PcG proteins to expand the repertoire of enzymatic activities that can be recruited by BCL6. This also suggests that BCL6 can target PcG proteins to DNA. In addition, the BCOR complex contains components of a second ubiquitin E3 ligase, namely, SKP1 and FBXL10 (JHDM1B). We show that BCOR coimmunoprecipitates isoforms of FBXL10 which contain a JmjC domain that recently has been determined to have histone H3K36 demethylase activity.

Biopsy of cerebral lesions is often not feasible, and culture of Aspergillus spp. from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is frequently negative. New molecular methods have emerged for diagnosing IA. So far, there are only few reports of Aspergillus DNA detection in CSF. After modifying the DNA extraction protocol, we detected Aspergillus DNA in CSF samples by a previously described nested PCR assay. In six patients with hematologic malignancy and cerebral aspergillosis, CSF samples were investigated for Aspergillus DNA. IA was classified according to the EORTC/MSG 2002 criteria. Two patients each had proven, probable, and possible IA. Thirty-five CSF samples were investigated for Aspergillus DNA by nested PCR. Samples with positive results in the nested PCR assay were quantified by LightCycler PCR assay. Fourteen CSF samples showed positive results in the nested PCR assay. Of these, six samples gave positive results in real-time PCR. The range of CFU per ml was 2,154 to 63,100,000. The highest number of CFU per ml was found in a CSF sample of a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia and probable cerebral aspergillosis. Detection of Aspergillus DNA in CSF samples is thus possible and has the potential to improve diagnosis of cerebral aspergillosis.

HTLV-1 infection was confirmed with the detection of proviral DNA in recovered samples. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were found to harbor the provirus, although the latter population harbored provirus to a lesser extent. Proviral loads increased with time, and inverse PCR analysis revealed the oligoclonal proliferation of infected cells. Although tax gene transcription was suppressed in human PBMC-NOG mice, it increased after in vitro culture. This is similar to the phenotype of HTLV-1-infected cells isolated from HTLV-1 carriers. Furthermore, the reverse transcriptase inhibitors azidothymidine and tenofovir blocked primary infection in human PBMC-NOG mice. However, when tenofovir was administered 1 week after infection, the proviral loads did not differ from those of untreated mice, indicating that after initial infection, clonal proliferation of infected cells was predominant over de novo infection of previously uninfected cells.

Consequently, transcriptional activation of the virus requires overcoming the environment of chromatin and H1. To efficiently activate transcription, HTLV-1 requires the virally encoded protein Tax and cellular transcription factor CREB. Together Tax and CREB interact with three cis-acting promoter elements called viral cyclic-AMP response elements (vCREs). Binding of Tax and CREB to the vCREs promotes association of p300/CBP into the complex and leads to transcriptional activation. Therefore, to fully understand the mechanism of Tax transactivation, it is necessary to examine transcriptional activation from chromatin assembled with H1. Using a DNA template harboring the complete HTLV-1 promoter sequence and a highly defined recombinant assembly system, we demonstrate proper incorporation of histone H1 into chromatin. Addition of H1 to the chromatin template reduces HTLV-1 transcriptional activation through a novel mechanism. Specifically, H1 does not inhibit CREB or Tax binding to the vCREs or p300 recruitment to the promoter. Rather, H1 directly targets p300 acetyltransferase activity. Interestingly, in determining the mechanism of H1 repression, we have discovered a previously undefined function of Tax, overcoming the repressive effects of H1-chromatin. Tax specifically abrogates the H1 repression of p300 enzymatic activity in a manner independent of p300 recruitment and without displacement of H1 from the promoter.",,"['Konesky, Kasey L', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K', 'Laybourn, Paul J']","['Konesky KL', 'Nyborg JK', 'Laybourn PJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, 1870 Campus Delivery, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila', 'Drosophila Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, pX', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Virus Assembly', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors']",2006/09/01 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/09/01 09:00'],"['2006/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00631-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00631-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Nov;80(21):10542-53. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00631-06.

Malfunction of transcription factors may lead to diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and specific granule deficiency. In order to understand the molecular background for normal and malignant granulopoiesis, a good model system is required that faithfully mimics the in vivo transcription factor expression profiles. The two human leukemic cell lines HL60 and NB4 have been widely used as model cell lines for these purposes. Differentiation of HL60 and NB4 cells resulted in asynchronous differentiation to morphologically mature neutrophils over a period of 5-7 days. To obtain cell populations of more even maturity, cells at different stages of in vitro differentiation were purified by immunomagnetic isolation. This resulted in three cell populations that could be classified as promyelocytes, myelocytes/metamyelocytes, and mature neutrophils, respectively. Comparison of transcription factor mRNA profiles from these cell populations with those previously seen in normal human bone marrow, demonstrated that although all of the 14 transcription factors described in vivo, could be detected during in vitro differentiation, vast differences in their expression profiles was observed.

Twenty-five adult patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma who had been treated at Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea from June 1996 to June 2005 were analyzed retrospectively. As an initial remission induction chemotherapy, the hyper-CVAD regimen was performed in eight patients, the Stanford/Northern California Oncology Group (NCOG) regimen in five, the CAVOP regimen in four, the m-BACOP regimen in three, and the CHOP regimen in one patient. Patients were divided into two groups according to their therapeutic modalities. Twenty patients received conventional chemotherapy alone and five received subsequent PBSCT after conventional chemotherapy. Four patients of the PBSCT group underwent autologous PBSCT and one underwent allogeneic PBSCT. The overall response rate was 80% (60% showing a complete response, 20% showing a partial response) and the relapse rate was 73.3%. The overall survival (OS) rate was 55.1% at 1 year, 31.5% at 5 years, and 23.6% at 9 years. The disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 46.7% at 1 year and 30.0% at 7 years. The 5-year OS rate in relation to the regimens was 60% with the Stanford/NCOG regimen, 50% with the CAVOP regimen, and 33.3% with the m-BACOP regimen. The patients treated with the hyper-CVAD regimen had an 18.2% 2-year OS rate, and other patients with CHOP or COPBLAM-V expired early in their course. The OS rate in patients treated with conventional chemotherapy alone was 19.8%, whereas patients treated with subsequent PBSCT after chemotherapy showed 50% overall survival (p=0.25). The age at presentation influenced the outcome of the patients (p=0.01). The Stanford/NCOG regimen is an effective initial choice of therapy for lymphoblastic lymphoma patients, and is superior to the hyper-CVAD regimen in complete response rate and overall survival rate (p =0.36).

Ammonia therefore represents a direct metabolite of the biochemical reaction induced by this enzyme. However, data regarding the dynamics and clinical relevance of ammonia levels during L-Asp therapy are lacking. PROCEDURE: We prospectively followed the dynamics of ammonia levels during L-Asp containing induction therapy according to the ALL-BFM 2000 protocol in 10 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in order to assess the possible relevance of ammonia levels for clinical practice and its use as a possible surrogate parameter of L-Asp enzyme activity. RESULTS: We observed a significant elevation of ammonia levels 1 day after intravenous L-Asp administration with ammonia levels reaching up to the seventh fold of normal values, followed by a steep decline to basal values within another 2 days, resulting in an undulating course of ammonia concentrations during L-Asp containing induction treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are potential neurotoxic properties of ammonia, central nervous system (CNS) toxicity has not been observed in our study and is generally not seen as a common side effect of L-Asp therapy. Furthermore, due to the characteristic fluctuation profile, ammonia levels may represent a suitable surrogate parameter of L-Asp enzyme activity and may enable the monitoring of silent inactivation of L-Asp.","['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Steiner, M', 'Attarbaschi, A', 'Kastner, U', 'Dworzak, M', 'Haas, O A', 'Gadner, H', 'Mann, G']","['Steiner M', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Kastner U', 'Dworzak M', 'Haas OA', 'Gadner H', 'Mann G']","[""St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria. manuel.steiner@stanna.at""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7664-41-7 (Ammonia)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Ammonia/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy']",2006/08/31 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2006/08/31 09:00'],"['2006/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21022 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Oct 15;49(5):640-2. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether an association exists between paternal occupations at birth involving such exposures and cancer risk in offspring, using data from the Northern Region Young Persons' Malignant Disease Registry (NRYPMDR). PROCEDURE: Cases (n=4,723) were matched, on sex and year of birth, to controls from two independent sources: (i) all other patients from the NRYPMDR with a different cancer, (ii) 100 cancer-free individuals per case from the Cumbrian Births Database. An occupational exposure matrix was used to assign individuals to exposure groups. RESULTS: There was an increased risk of leukemia among the offspring of men employed in occupations likely to be associated with EMF or radiation exposures (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.02-1.69), particularly in males aged less than 6 years (OR 1.81, 95% 1.19-2.75). No significant association was seen in females. Increased risks were also seen for chondrosarcoma (OR 8.7, 95% CI 1.55-49.4) and renal carcinoma (OR 6.75, 95% CI 1.73-26.0). These associations were consistent between control groups and remained after adjustment for socio-economic status. CONCLUSIONS: This large case-control study identified a significantly increased risk of leukemia among the offspring of men likely to have been occupationally exposed to EMF, with differing associations between males and females. Increased risks of chondrosarcoma and renal carcinoma were also seen, although based on smaller numbers. Further detailed investigations in this area are required to understand this association.","['Copyright (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Pearce, Mark S', 'Hammal, Donna M', 'Dorak, M Tevfik', 'McNally, Richard J Q', 'Parker, Louise']","['Pearce MS', 'Hammal DM', 'Dorak MT', 'McNally RJ', 'Parker L']","['Paediatric and Lifecourse Epidemiology Research Group, School of Clinical Medical Sciences (Child Health), University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. m.s.pearce@ncl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Occupations', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution']",2006/08/31 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2006/08/31 09:00'],"['2006/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21021 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Sep;49(3):280-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve care and to decrease the length of hospitalisation of children being treated at the Dept. of Haematoloy/Oncology of the Gaslini Children's Hospital, a programme of Home Care was set up in April 2000. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In June 2003, rehabilitation was added to the procedures that were feasible at home and included i.v. therapy administration, blood examinations, transfusion and/or psychological support, as well as palliative care for terminally ill children. The physiotherapy sessions were done in the ward, in the Rehabilitation Unit Gym, or at home, depending on the clinical conditions and the needs of the child and the family. RESULTS: Between June 2003 and May 2005, 46 children, whose median age was 7 years (range 6 months-21 years) suffering from CNS tumours (13), leukaemia (13), neuroblastoma (7), bone tumours (6), sarcoma (4) and lymphoma (3), underwent 1,398 physiotherapy sessions for neuro-motor re-education (534), motor rehabilitation (485), strain re-education and training (250), respiratory care (79), or to improve comfort during the terminal phase of the disease (50). To maintain continuity of care, the treatments were performed at home (931), in the hospital ward (282), or in the gymnasium of our Physiotherapy Service (185). CONCLUSION: The physiotherapist was able to start or to continue assistance at home or in the hospital, and to keep up the programme based on the child's needs.

The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of cytarabine after intrathecal administration of 50 mg encapsulated cytarabine (DepoCy) in patients with neoplastic meningitis up to 336 h (14 days) after dosing. METHODS: This was an open-label study wherein two 50-mg doses of DepoCyt were administered 14 days apart via the intraventricular (IVT) route or by lumbar puncture (LP). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from eight adult patients at various times up to 14 days after each dose. Plasma samples were also collected within the same time period. CSF samples were analyzed for unencapsulated (free) and encapsulated cytarabine and the cytarabine metabolite, ara-U. Plasma samples were analyzed for free cytarabine and ara-U. The limit of detection was 0.003 microg/mL cytarabine and 0.016 microg/ml for ara-U. RESULTS: The concentration of free and encapsulated cytarabine in the ventricular and lumbar CSF ranged from 0.01 to 1500 microg/mL and were detectable up to 14 days post-dosing. Free cytarabine concentrations in plasma were only sporadically detectable. CSF and plasma concentrations of ara-U were low in all samples. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of intrathecal encapsulation cytarabine prolongs sustained tumor exposure to cytotoxic concentrations of cytarabine (>0.02 microg/ml) with a slow continuous release of cytarabine from the DepoFoam particles, so drug exposure is prolonged over time, resulting in lower peak cytarabine levels and a longer duration of exposure compared with standard cytarabine (Ara-C).",,"['Phuphanich, Surasak', 'Maria, Bernard', 'Braeckman, Rene', 'Chamberlain, Marc']","['Phuphanich S', 'Maria B', 'Braeckman R', 'Chamberlain M']","['Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA, surasak.phuphanich@emoryhealthcare.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Meningitis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged']",2006/08/31 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2006/08/31 09:00'],"['2006/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11060-006-9218-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2007 Jan;81(2):201-8. doi: 10.1007/s11060-006-9218-x.

The dilemma that confronts the management of MDS is illustrated by the presence of only one agent (5-azacitidine), which has been approved by the U.S.A. Food and Drug Administration, with an indication for all subtypes of this disease and another one (lenalidomide) for the management of a specific MDS subgroup, the 5q-syndrome. Current classifications and prognostic systems do not take into account the considerable clinical heterogeneity of MDS or their diverse biology. Supportive care, low-intensity treatment, acute myeloid leukemia-type therapy, and stem cell transplantation (SCT) produce unsatisfactory results because patients continue to be exposed to the inherent complications of worsening cytopenias and leukemic transformation. Recent years have witnessed an evolution in our understanding of pathophysiology pathways in MDS. At the same time, many novel and targeted therapies are being investigated in clinical trials, offering patients the prospect of sustained benefit and changing the natural course of the disease. Hypomethylating agents, immunomodulatory drugs, and farnesyl-tranferase inhibitors have produced very promising results in terms of response and survival in MDS patients.

With increasing number of survivors it is important to know the long-term and late effects of leukemia and leukaemia treatment. PATIENTS: Of the 31 children diagnosed with leukemia in Iceland from 1981 to 1990, twenty were enrolled in the study. Average age at enrollment was16 years and 8 months (16:8) and average time since treatment ended was 8:3. METHODS: The study was carried out at the Children's Hospital at the University Hospital Iceland where patients were examined and data was gathered on height, weight, hearing, cognitive functions, bloodvalues, immunoglobulins and renal, endocrine, heart, liver and respiratory functions. RESULTS: The children studied were on average 0.48 standard deviations below target height and their body-mass index was higher at the time of study than at diagnosis. Two children had obvious obstructive lung disease. No abnormalities were found in complete blood count nor heart, liver or kidney functions. Two patients were found to have impaired hearing not attributable to acoustic trauma. In some cases abnormal values were found in immunoglobulin classes and 12 patients had decreased serum IgG2. Six needed remedial reading lessons. Three patients needed hormone replacement therapy. DISCUSSION: Minor impact on height and weight was found but the effects on lungs and hearing were inconclusive. Despite markedly decreased serum IgG2 the patients were not more prone to infections. The most obvious effects were on the endocrine system and performance at school.

Here, we examined the role of the Env protein in virus-induced mammary tumorigenesis in vivo. Similar to the effect seen in vitro, Env expression in the mammary glands of transgenic mice bearing either full-length wild-type provirus or only Env transgenes showed increased lobuloalveolar budding. Introduction of the ITAM mutation into the env of an infectious, replication-competent MMTV or into MMTV/murine leukemia virus pseudotypes had no effect on incorporation of Env into virus particles or on in vitro infectivity. Moreover, replication-competent MMTV bearing the ITAM mutation in Env infected lymphoid and mammary tissue at the same level as wild-type MMTV and was transmitted through milk. However, mammary tumor induction was greatly attenuated, and the pattern of oncogene activation was altered.

Attempts to engineer this property into MLV have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of early events in the viral life cycle. We utilized a transposon-based method to generate saturated peptide insertion libraries of MLV gag-pol variants with nuclear localization signals randomly incorporated throughout these overlapping genes. High-throughput selection of the libraries via iterative retroviral infection of nondividing cells led to the identification of a novel variant that successfully transduced growth-arrested cells. Vector packaging by cotransfection of the gag-pol.NLS variant with wild-type gag-pol produced high-titer virions capable of infecting neurons in vitro and in vivo. The capacity of mutant virions to transduce nondividing cells could help to elucidate incompletely understood mechanisms of the viral life cycle and greatly broaden the gene therapy applications of retroviral vectors.

Analysis of in vitro IL-2-expanded NK cells from patients with myelocytic/monocytic acute myeloid leukemia (AML-NK cells) has revealed poor cytolytic functions because of deficient expression of pivotal activation molecules-the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46. To exclude the possibility that this observation was caused by the in vitro amplification of a small NCR(dull) population, we analyzed the AML-NK phenotype directly, without any in vitro expansion. We first confirmed that the NCR(dull) phenotype was not an in vitro artifact. Moreover, analysis of a large population of AML patients allowed us to demonstrate that phenotype was not restricted to a French-American-British (FAB) subtype and was not associated with a particular cytogenetic abnormality. Our longitudinal study of AML patients showed that the NCR(dull) phenotype was acquired during leukemia development because we observed its complete (for NKp46) or partial (for NKp30) reversibility in patients achieving complete remission (CR). Reversibility of the NCR(dull) phenotype after CR suggested that leukemia cells might be involved in NCR down-regulation. In agreement with this hypothesis, direct contact between leukemic blasts and NK cells (but not leukemia-cell supernatants) induced loss or decrease in NKp30 and NKp46 expression while impeding NKp44 induction by IL-2. We excluded the major implication of TGF-beta in NCR down-regulation. Although the clinical antitumor value of NK cells is clearly demonstrated in allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the role of NK cells in autologous transplantation is not proved. Interestingly, we observed a correlation between the NCR(dull) phenotype and poor survival in AML patients, suggesting that NK-deficient activation caused by NCR down-regulation could play a role in patient outcome.

These agents activate nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcriptional pathways while simultaneously repressing nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via a rapid intracellular amplification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The elevated ROS is associated with increased intracellular free calcium, rapid dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, disrupted mitochondrial structure, and caspase-independent cell death.

Surprisingly, some patients who reject donor grafts following nonmyeloablative HCT have sustained remissions of advanced, chemorefractory hematologic malignancies. In murine mixed chimeras prepared with nonmyeloablative conditioning, we previously showed that recipient leukocyte infusions (RLIs) induce loss of donor chimerism and mediate antitumor responses against host-type tumors. We assessed the clinical relevance of our mouse model. METHODS: Mixed chimeric mice were generated by a nonmyeloablative protocol and some of them received host-derived tumor cells and/or RLIs or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). We examined chimerism, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and tumor survival. RESULTS: RLI is still effective when the leukocytes are obtained from tumor-bearing mice. Established mixed chimerism is required prior to the induced rejection to achieve maximum antitumor effects. The antitumor effects of RLI are not dependent on a specific donor strain or conditioning protocol. In contrast to DLI, RLI leads to donor cell rejection without the risk of GVHD.

Shp-2 is a widely expressed nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that participates early in hematopoietic development. The following study was performed to examine the role of Shp-2 in HSC function. METHODS: Bone marrow low-density mononuclear cells were isolated from WT and Shp-2(+/-) littermate controls and utilized in competitive repopulation studies, homing analysis, cell-cycle analysis, and serial transplantation studies. RESULTS: Haploinsufficiency of Shp-2 causes a threefold reduction in HSC repopulating units following transplantation into lethally irradiated recipients. Homing of Shp-2(+/-) and WT cells to the bone marrow and spleen compartments was equal. Cell-cycle analysis studies revealed that the Shp-2(+/-) lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-kit(+) cells are less quiescent than WT cells, providing a potential etiology for the observed reduced engraftment of the Shp-2(+/-) cells.

CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that Shp-2 is required for the physiologic homeostasis of the HSC compartment and potentially provide insight into how oncogenic Shp-2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative disorders and leukemias.",,"['Chan, Rebecca J', 'Li, Yanjun', 'Hass, Meredith N', 'Walter, Amanda', 'Voorhorst, Cara S', 'Shelley, W Chris', 'Yang, Zhenyun', 'Orschell, Christie M', 'Yoder, Mervin C']","['Chan RJ', 'Li Y', 'Hass MN', 'Walter A', 'Voorhorst CS', 'Shelley WC', 'Yang Z', 'Orschell CM', 'Yoder MC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. rchan@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Cycle/genetics', '*Cell Movement/genetics', 'Graft Survival/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Heterozygote', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology']",2006/08/31 09:00,2006/11/01 09:00,['2006/08/31 09:00'],"['2006/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00266-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.04.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Sep;34(9):1230-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.04.017.,,,,"['R01HL63169/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL75660/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We redirected CIK cells cytotoxicity toward B-ALL with a chimeric receptor specific for the CD19 antigen and then explored if modified-CIK cells maintain the same chemotactic properties of freshly isolated NKT cells, whose trafficking machinery reflects their preferential localization into the sites of B-ALL infiltration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CIK cells were expanded ex vivo for 21 days and analyzed for expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors regulating adhesion and homing toward leukemia-infiltrated tissues. CIK cells were then transduced with the anti-CD19-zeta-internal ribosomal entry site-green fluorescent protein retroviral vector and characterized for their cytotoxicity against B-ALL cells in a (51)Cr-release assay and for their trafficking properties, including chemotactic activity, adhesion and transendothelial migration, and metalloproteases-dependent invasion of Matrigel. RESULTS: Similarly to freshly isolated NKT cells, CD49d and CD11a were highly expressed on CIK cells. Moreover, CIK cells expressed CXCR4, CCR6, and CCR7 (mean expression 72%, 60%, and 32%, respectively), presenting chemotactic activity toward their respective ligands. Anti-CD19 chimeric receptor-modified CIK cells became cytotoxic against B-ALL cells (mean lysis, 60%) and showed, after exposure to a CXCL12 gradient, high capacity to adhere and transmigrate through endothelial cells and to invade Matrigel. CONCLUSION: The potential capacity to localize into leukemia-infiltrated tissues of anti-CD19 chimeric receptor-redirected CIK cells, together with their ability to efficiently kill B-ALL cells, suggests that modified-CIK cells represent a valuable tool for leukemia immunotherapy.",,"['Marin, Virna', 'Dander, Erica', 'Biagi, Ettore', 'Introna, Martino', 'Fazio, Grazia', 'Biondi, Andrea', ""D'Amico, Giovanna""]","['Marin V', 'Dander E', 'Biagi E', 'Introna M', 'Fazio G', 'Biondi A', ""D'Amico G""]","['Centro Ricerca M.

We previously reported that expression of NUP98-TOP in murine bone marrow induces a lethal, transplantable leukemia. However, the long latency suggests the in vivo acquisition of additional mutations and/or time required for clonal outgrowth of rare transformed cells arising from the collaboration of NUP98-TOP1 and a cooperating event. The aim of this study was to test whether retroviral insertional mutagenesis contributes to disease onset and whether integration site analysis can identify collaborating genes. METHODS: The genomic sites of retroviral integration in NUP98-TOP1-induced leukemic mice were analyzed. This screen identified a proviral integration that disrupts expression of the Interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) tumor suppressor gene. Intriguingly, an ICSBP deficiency induces a chronic myeloid leukemia-like disease in mice and its reduced expression has been observed in several human leukemias. To ascertain whether an ISCBP deficiency collaborates with NUP98-TOP1 in leukemogenesis, we expressed NUP98-TOP1 in ICSBP(-/-) bone marrow. RESULTS: The in vivo myeloproliferation induced by NUP98-TOP1 was markedly exaggerated with the ICSBP(-/-) deficiency. Moreover, NUP98-TOP1/ICSBP(-/-) mice had a reduced survival compared with NUP98-TOP1/ICSBP(+/+) mice. CONCLUSION: These results reveal the novel finding of collaboration between the ICSBP tumor suppressor gene and NUP98-TOP1 in leukemogenesis. Moreover they further illustrate the power of retroviral integration site analysis for identifying novel cooperating tumor suppressor genes.",,"['Gurevich, Rhonna M', 'Rosten, Patty M', 'Schwieger, Maike', 'Stocking, Carol', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Gurevich RM', 'Rosten PM', 'Schwieger M', 'Stocking C', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (NUP98-TOP1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/genetics/methods', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', '*Retroviridae', '*Virus Integration']",2006/08/31 09:00,2006/11/01 09:00,['2006/08/31 09:00'],"['2006/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00268-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.04.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Sep;34(9):1192-201. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.04.020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We employed a flow cytometry protocol that enabled correlated measurement of pS6, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), and cluster differentiation surface markers. Baseline levels of pS6 in leukemic blasts were compared with those found when the samples were activated using stem cell factor, or exposed to rapamycin, LY294002, or the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor U0126. RESULTS: Results showed a considerable degree of intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity in the constitutive levels of pS6. Rapamycin and LY294002 suppressed pS6 in 10 of 11 cases that showed increased basal levels, consistent with phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling being the predominant upstream signaling pathway. However, in 6 of 11 cases pS6 was also suppressed by U0126, indicating that the ERK pathway can significantly input to pS6. CONCLUSIONS: The constitutive activation of pS6 in acute leukemia patients likely reflects alterations in growth factor signaling that can be mediated by the ERK as well as the mTOR pathway, and could potentially have prognostic significance. As well as identifying aberrant signal transduction in leukemia patients, the flow cytometry methodology has potential for the pharmacodynamic monitoring of novel agents that inhibit ERK or PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling.",,"['Chow, Sue', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Hedley, David W']","['Chow S', 'Minden MD', 'Hedley DW']","['Division of Applied Molecular Oncology, Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Ribosomal Protein S6)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (U 0126)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Male', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Ribosomal Protein S6/*metabolism', 'Sirolimus', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2006/08/31 09:00,2006/11/01 09:00,['2006/08/31 09:00'],"['2006/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2006/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00313-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Sep;34(9):1183-91. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.05.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, CD34+ myeloid precursors from CML patients displayed an increased proportion of S + G2/M-phase cells (P = 0.04), while no significant differences were found between CML and NBM for other BM cell subsets analysed. In BM cells separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, decreasing levels of BCR/ABL mRNA were found from CD34+/CD38+ myeloid precursors to myeloblasts; BCR/ABL expression increased afterwards with a peak at the myelocyte/metamyelocyte stage, decreasing in the more mature band/neutrophil compartment. Unexpectedly, BCR/ABL gene expression showed an inverse correlation with the proportion of S + G2/M-phase cells (R = -0.33; P = 0.04).

The overall levels of consensus for classification using the microarray compared with established criteria were 93.9% (495/527 patients) for peripheral blood and 97.6% (201/206 patients) for bone marrow aspirates, showing that the extensive phenotype alone was frequently able to classify the disease when the leukaemic clone was the dominant cell population present.

These complications prompt the design and completion of randomized, controlled trials to determine a safe and efficacious therapy to prevent these thromboses. The authors Ruud et al. have presented a well-designed, randomized, controlled trial which demonstrates the lack of utility of using low-dose warfarin to prevent catheter-related thrombosis in children with central lines and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The difficulties with warfarin in children are again demonstrated in this study.

A prognostic significance of the infiltration pattern in bone marrow trephine biopsy has been described before. The combined pattern analysis and detection of 70-kd zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70) expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow trephines has not been investigated so far. To evaluate the relationship between ZAP-70 expression, mutation status, and the infiltration pattern in B-CLL, we analyzed bone marrow trephine biopsies from B-CLL patients (n = 35). The expression of ZAP-70 was related to the infiltration type: in all samples with diffuse infiltration pattern, the leukemic cells showed ZAP-70 staining, whereas leukemic cells in a nodular infiltration pattern were negative. By contrast, the mixed-pattern type showed a variable ZAP-70 expression. Besides definitely negative or positive ZAP-70 expression, a few samples showed a faint ZAP-70 staining, and the classification into the positive or negative group was difficult. In addition, the infiltration type was related to the mutation status in a subset of samples: mutation of the IgVH gene was restricted to the nondiffuse infiltration pattern and was not found in cases with diffuse infiltration of bone marrow. The expression of ZAP-70, detected by an immunohistochemical assay and also by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assigned 83% of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases to the suspected immunoglobulin mutation subtype. In 2 patients with ZAP-70 expression, a mutated IgVH status was found. These cases exhibited a mixed pattern of infiltration. We conclude that the pure nodular type of marrow infiltration in B-CLL is associated with IgH hypermutation and ZAP-70 negativity, whereas the predominantly diffuse type of infiltration reveals unmutated IgH genes with ZAP-70 overexpression. The mixed type of infiltration is displayed by mutated as well as unmutated cases with a varying pattern of ZAP-70 expression.",,"['Schade, Ulrika', 'Bock, Oliver', 'Vornhusen, Sylke', 'Jager, Anna', 'Busche, Guntram', 'Lehmann, Ulrich', 'Kreipe, Hans']","['Schade U', 'Bock O', 'Vornhusen S', 'Jager A', 'Busche G', 'Lehmann U', 'Kreipe H']","['Institute of Pathology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*biosynthesis']",2006/08/30 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/08/30 09:00'],"['2005/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(06)00217-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2006.04.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2006 Sep;37(9):1153-61. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2006.04.016.

Lymphocytes obtained from healthy controls showed no or very low levels of mRNA expression of both decorin and biglycan. Biglycan expression was very low in CLL patients, values being close to those of controls. On the contrary, decorin mRNA was clearly expressed in patients with early B-cell CLL, while a low expression was found in advanced clinical stages. Furthermore, a significant higher decorin expression was found in patients with non-progressive CLL type in comparison with patients with aggressive type of the disease. Decorin expression resulted especially high in the low-progressive low-risk patients. The synthesis of decorin was also assessed by Western blot analysis. The peculiar occurrence of decorin in the non-aggressive type of CLL is consistent with its suggested anti-oncogenic role. Intracellular Bcl-2 level does not correlate with decorin mRNA transcription, suggesting that a Bcl-2 independent anti-cancer mechanism may occur. The measurement of galactosamine-containing proteoglycans concentration in plasma confirmed decorin expression results, with significant differences between CLL patients and controls. Significant changes were also seen between groups of patients of Rai stage 0 with recent diagnosis (less than 5 years, from analysis), (low amount of decorin) and less recent diagnosis (more than 5 years), (high amount of decorin).",,"['Campo, Salvatore', 'Campo, Giuseppe M', 'Avenoso, Angela', ""D'Ascola, Angela"", 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Calabro, Luana', 'Bellomo, Giacomo', 'Quartarone, Eugenia', 'Calatroni, Alberto']","['Campo S', 'Campo GM', 'Avenoso A', ""D'Ascola A"", 'Musolino C', 'Calabro L', 'Bellomo G', 'Quartarone E', 'Calatroni A']","['Department of Biochemical, Physiological and Nutritional Sciences, University of Messina, Messina, Italy. scampo@unime.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,"['0 (BGN protein, human)', '0 (Biglycan)', '0 (DCN protein, human)', '0 (Decorin)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biglycan', 'Blotting, Western', 'Decorin', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/blood/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Proteoglycans/blood/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",2006/08/30 09:00,2007/04/26 09:00,['2006/08/30 09:00'],"['2006/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-9084(06)00151-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biochi.2006.07.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 2006 Dec;88(12):1933-9. doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2006.07.010.

Imatinib is associated with a variety of adverse cutaneous reactions, including urticaria, maculopapular exanthem, generalized exanthematous pustulosis, exfoliative dermatitis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral desensitization by administering incremental dosages of imatinib mesylate to patients with leukemia who have had rashes associated with prior exposure. METHODS: Ten patients with leukemia and imatinib-associated recurrent rash underwent a 4-hour outpatient oral desensitization procedure. Beginning with 10 ng, we administered oral imatinib elixir in increasing dosages every 15 minutes. Patient outcomes were monitored by a return clinic visit and by telephone follow-up for a median of approximately 3 years. RESULTS: No episodes of anaphylaxis or serious adverse effects occurred during or immediately after desensitization. Four patients (all with urticaria) had no recurrence of rash after desensitization, and 4 had recurrent rash that resolved after temporary glucocorticosteroid and antihistamine administration.

METHODS: Inorganic arsenic (AsIII and AsV) and the major metabolites monomethylarsonic acid (MAA(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA(V)) in plasma and urine collected from 12 Japanese patients were quantified by HPLC/ICP-MS. RESULTS: The plasma concentrations of AsIII and AsV on day 1 reached the similar Cmax (12.4 +/- 8.4 and 10.2 +/- 3.9 ng/ml) immediately after completion of administration followed by a biphasic elimination. The AUC(0-infinity) of AsV was about twice that of AsIII. The appearance of methylated metabolites in the blood was delayed. During the repeated administration, the plasma concentrations of inorganic arsenic reached the steady state. In contrast, the MAA(V) and DMAA(V) concentrations increased in relation to increased administration frequency. The mean total arsenic excretion rate including inorganic arsenic and methylated arsenic was about 20% of daily dose on day 1 and remained at about 60% of daily dose during week 1-4.

Recently, Bcr-Abl has also been shown to activate an important regulator of protein synthesis, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which suggests that dysregulated translation may also contribute to CML pathogenesis. In this study, we found that both Bcr-Abl and the rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 complex contribute to the phosphorylation (inactivation) of 4E-BP1, an inhibitor of the eIF4E translation initiation factor. Experiments with rapamycin and the Bcr-Abl inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, in Bcr-Abl-expressing cell lines and primary CML cells indicated that Bcr-Abl and mTORC1 induced formation of the translation initiation complex, eIF4F. This was characterized by reduced 4E-BP1 binding and increased eIF4G binding to eIF4E, two events that lead to the assembly of eIF4F. One target transcript is cyclin D3, which is regulated in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells by both Bcr-Abl and mTORC1 in a translational manner. In addition, the combination of imatinib and rapamycin was found to act synergistically against committed CML progenitors from chronic and blast phase patients. These experiments establish a novel mechanism of action for Bcr-Abl, and they provide insights into the modes of action of imatinib mesylate and rapamycin in treatment of CML. They also suggest that aberrant cap-dependent mRNA translation may be a therapeutic target in Bcr-Abl-driven malignancies.",,"['Prabhu, S', 'Saadat, D', 'Zhang, M', 'Halbur, L', 'Fruehauf, J P', 'Ong, S T']","['Prabhu S', 'Saadat D', 'Zhang M', 'Halbur L', 'Fruehauf JP', 'Ong ST']","['The Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ccnd3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Eif4ebp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Benzamides', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F/*metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', '*Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proteins', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/08/29 09:00,2007/03/23 09:00,['2006/08/29 09:00'],"['2006/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209901 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209901 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Feb 22;26(8):1188-200. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209901.

We reasoned that phosphorylation of serines 608/612 by redundant CDKs could accelerate phospho group formation and determined which G1 CDK contributes to serine 612 phosphorylation. Here, we report that CDK4 complexes from Nalm-6 extracts phosphorylated in vitro the CDK2-preferred serine 612, which was inhibited by p16INK4a, and fascaplysin. In contrast, serine 780 and serine 795 were efficiently phosphorylated by CDK4 but not by CDK2. The data suggest that the redundancy in phosphorylation of RB by CDK2 and CDK4 in Nalm-6 extracts is limited. Serine 612 phosphorylation by CDK4 also occurred in extracts of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells but not in extracts of mobilized CD34+ hemopoietic progenitor cells. This phenomenon could contribute to the commitment of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia cells to proliferate and explain their refractoriness to differentiation-inducing agents.",,"['Schmitz, Nicole M R', 'Hirt, Andreas', 'Aebi, Markus', 'Leibundgut, Kurt']","['Schmitz NM', 'Hirt A', 'Aebi M', 'Leibundgut K']","[""Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, and the Department of Paediatrics, University Children's Hospital Inselspital, Switzerland.

Neurons have been thought to be the primary target of toxicity of these viruses. However the neurons themselves appear not to be infected, and the possible indirect mechanisms driving the neuronal toxicity have remained enigmatic. Here we have re-examined the cells that are damaged by these viruses, using lineage-specific markers. Surprisingly, these cells expressed the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Olig2, placing them in the oligodendrocyte lineage. Olig2+ cells were found to be infected, and many of these cells exhibited focal cytoplasmic vacuolation, suggesting that infection by spongiogenic retroviruses is directly toxic to these cells. As cytoplasmic vacuolation progressed, however, signs of viral protein expression appeared to wane, although residual viral RNA was detectable by in situ hybridization. Cells with the most advanced cytoplasmic effacement expressed the C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP). This protein is up-regulated as a late event in a cellular response termed the integrated stress response. This observation may link the cellular pathology observed in the brain with cellular stress responses known to be induced by these viruses.

METHODS: Bone marrow specimens were obtained from 42 children with bone marrow hypoplasia who were hospitalised in the Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland, between 1996 and 2003. Substance P and Ki-67 expression were evaluated using immunochemical and hybridocytochemical assays. RESULTS: The expression of substance P (as evidenced by both immunocytochemical and hybridisation techniques) was confirmed in the cytoplasm of B lymphocytes in 8 of 11 children who developed acute leukaemia in 45 (SD 12) days. The percentage of substance P-positive cells ranged from 67.6 to 95.8 (mean of 81.5% cells with immunocytochemistry and 84.3% with in situ hybridisation). The risk of development of leukaemia secondary to bone marrow hypoplasia was found to be significant (p<0.001) in those children who expressed substance P in normal-looking lymphocytes at the initial bone marrow evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of substance P in B lymphocytes of hypoplastic bone marrow may predict its neoplastic transformation.

Treatment of APL with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces disease remission by in vivo differentiation of APL cells. Differentiation requires cell cycle exit; yet how ATRA couples cell cycle exit to differentiation of APL remains largely unknown. We previously found that ATRA-induced cell differentiation accompanies ubiquitination-proteolysis of menage a trois 1 (MAT1), an assembly factor and targeting subunit of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) that regulates G1 exit. We report here that CAK binds to and phosphorylates PML/RARalpha in actively proliferating APL cells. In response to ATRA, PML/RARalpha is dissociated from CAK, leading to MAT1 degradation, G1 arrest, and decreased CAK phosphorylation of PML/RARalpha. CAK phosphorylation of PML/RARalpha is inhibited when MAT1 levels are reduced. Both MAT1 degradation and PML/RARalpha hypophosphorylation occur in ATRA-induced G1-arresting cells undergoing differentiation but not in the synchronized G1 cells that do not differentiate. These findings reveal a novel ATRA signaling on APL cell differentiation, in which ATRA coordinates G1 arrest and transition into differentiation by inducing MAT1 degradation and PML/RARalpha hypophosphorylation through disrupting PML/RARalpha binding and phosphorylation by CAK.",,"['Wang, Jian-guang', 'Barsky, Lora W', 'Davicioni, Elai', 'Weinberg, Kenneth I', 'Triche, Timothy J', 'Zhang, Xiao-kun', 'Wu, Lingtao']","['Wang JG', 'Barsky LW', 'Davicioni E', 'Weinberg KI', 'Triche TJ', 'Zhang XK', 'Wu L']","['Department of Pathology, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles Saban Research Institute, Los Angeles, California 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MNAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2006/08/29 09:00,2006/10/21 09:00,['2006/08/29 09:00'],"['2006/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['fj.06-5900fje [pii]', '10.1096/fj.06-5900fje [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2006 Oct;20(12):2142-4. doi: 10.1096/fj.06-5900fje.

Treatment with other agents, such as antithymocyte globulin, azacitidine, decitabine, thalidomide, and lenalidomide, has resulted in transfusion independence in some subsets of MDS patients.

Combining high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we compared the protein expression profiles between K562 and K562/A02. A total number of 22 protein spots with altered abundances of more than 2-fold were detected and 14 proteins were successfully identified. Consistent with our previous observations by cDNA microarray, sorcin, a 22-kDa calcium-binding protein, was also identified by this proteomic approach with a 10.4-fold up-regulation in K562/A02 cells. Overexpression of sorcin protein in K562 cells by gene transfection led to significantly reduced cytosolic calcium level and increased resistance to cell apoptosis. Further, leukemia cell lines over-expressing sorcin also showed up-regulation of Bcl-2, along with decreased level of Bax. Taken together, our results suggest that sorcin plays an important role in the emergence of MDR in leukemia cells via regulating cell apoptosis pathways, thus may represent both a new MDR marker for prognosis and a good target for anti-MDR drug development.",,"['Qi, Jing', 'Liu, Ning', 'Zhou, Yuan', 'Tan, Yaohong', 'Cheng, Yanhong', 'Yang, Chunzheng', 'Zhu, Zhenping', 'Xiong, Dongsheng']","['Qi J', 'Liu N', 'Zhou Y', 'Tan Y', 'Cheng Y', 'Yang C', 'Zhu Z', 'Xiong D']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China. qijing_cams@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (SRI protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2006/08/29 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/08/29 09:00'],"['2006/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)01840-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.08.042 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 Oct 13;349(1):303-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.08.042.

Here, we globally analyzed the genomic organization of all registered 326 human miRNA genes in miRNA registry 7.1 and found that 148 human miRNA genes appeared in a total of 51 clusters. Alignment of the miRNA sequences in different clusters revealed a significant number of miRNA paralogs among the clusters, implying an evolution process targeting the potentially conserved roles of these molecules. Then we performed Northern blot analysis for expression profiling of all clustered miRNAs in several human leukemia cell lines. Consistent expression of the miRNAs in a single cluster was revealed in 39 clusters, while inconsistent expression of members in a single cluster was detected in the other 12 clusters. Meanwhile, we identified several hematopoietic lineage-specific or -enriched miRNA clusters (e.g., the mir-29c, mir-302, mir-98, mir-29a, and let-7a-1 clusters) and individual miRNAs (e.g., mir-181c, mir-181d, mir-191, and mir-136).

A defect in this gene also causes neurodegeneration in humans and a less severe neurological phenotype in mice. There is some evidence that oxidative stress contributes to these defects, suggesting that antioxidants could alleviate the phenotype. We demonstrate here that the antioxidant 5-carboxy-1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl (CTMIO) dramatically delays the onset of thymic lymphomas in Atm(-/-) mice which is not due to an enhancement of apoptosis by CTMIO. We also show that this compound corrects neurobehavioral deficits in these mice and reduces oxidative damage to Purkinje cells. The likely mechanism of action of CTMIO is due to a reduction in oxidative stress, which is protective against both the tumor progression and the development of neurological abnormalities.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased angiogenesis are unknown. Here we show that malignant CTCL T cells spontaneously produce the potent angiogenic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Dermal infiltrates of CTCL lesions show frequent and intense staining with anti-VEGF antibody, indicating a steady, high production of VEGF in vivo. Moreover, the VEGF production is associated with constitutive activity of Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). Sp600125, an inhibitor of JNK activity and activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding to the VEGF promoter, downregulates the VEGF production without affecting Jak3 activity. Similarly, inhibitors of Jak3 inhibit the VEGF production without affecting JNK activity. Downregulation of Stat3 with small interfering RNA has no effect, whereas curcumin, an inhibitor of both Jak3 and the JNKs, almost completely blocks the VEGF production. In conclusion, we provide evidence of VEGF production in CTCL, which is promoted by aberrant activation of Jak3 and the JNKs.

In this study, we examined the role of topo IIbeta in all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of myeloid leukemia cell lines. Inhibition of topo IIbeta activity or downregulation of protein expression enhanced ATRA-induced differentiation/growth arrest and apoptosis. ATRA-induced apoptosis in topo IIbeta-deficient cells involved activation of the caspase cascade and was rescued by ectopic expression of topo IIbeta. Gene expression profiling led to the identification of peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) as a candidate gene that was downregulated in topo IIbeta-deficient cells. Reduced expression of PRDX2 validated at the mRNA and protein level, in topo IIbeta-deficient cells correlated with increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following ATRA-induced differentiation. Overexpression of PRDX2 in topo IIbeta-deficient cells led to reduced accumulation of ROS and partially reversed ATRA-induced apoptosis. These results support a role for topo IIbeta in survival of ATRA-differentiated myeloid leukemia cells. Reduced expression of topo IIbeta induces apoptosis in part by impairing the anti-oxidant capacity of the cell owing to downregulation of PRDX2. Thus, suppression of topo IIbeta and/or PRDX2 levels in myeloid leukemia cells provides a novel approach for improving ATRA-based differentiation therapy.",,"['Chikamori, K', 'Hill, J E', 'Grabowski, D R', 'Zarkhin, E', 'Grozav, A G', 'Vaziri, S A J', 'Wang, J', 'Gudkov, A V', 'Rybicki, L R', 'Bukowski, R M', 'Yen, A', 'Tanimoto, M', 'Ganapathi, M K', 'Ganapathi, R']","['Chikamori K', 'Hill JE', 'Grabowski DR', 'Zarkhin E', 'Grozav AG', 'Vaziri SA', 'Wang J', 'Gudkov AV', 'Rybicki LR', 'Bukowski RM', 'Yen A', 'Tanimoto M', 'Ganapathi MK', 'Ganapathi R']","['Experimental Therapeutics Program, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Diketopiperazines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', ""21416-68-2 (4,4'-(1,2-dimethyl-1,2-ethanediyl)bis-2,6-piperazinedione)"", '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Diketopiperazines', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Peroxidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Peroxiredoxins', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2006/08/26 09:00,2006/11/09 09:00,['2006/08/26 09:00'],"['2006/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404351 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404351 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Oct;20(10):1809-18. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404351.

Thymoglobulin (rabbit-derived polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin), by virtue of its method of preparation, contains antibodies against several B-cell and plasma cell antigens and offers an attractive option for immunotherapy of myeloma. Here, we demonstrate potent anti-myeloma activity of the rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin preparation Thymoglobulin in vitro and in vivo in an animal model of myeloma. Thymoglobulin was able to induce dose- and time-dependent apoptosis of several myeloma cell lines, including those resistant to conventional anti-myeloma agents. Importantly, the anti-myeloma activity was preserved even when myeloma cells were grown with different cytokines demonstrating the ability to overcome microenvironment-mediated resistance. Thymoglobulin induced apoptosis of freshly isolated primary myeloma cells from patients. Using a competitive flow cytometric analysis, we were able to identify the potential antigen targets for Thymoglobulin preparation.

We have investigated the effects of T regulatory cells on chimeric T cells specific for the B-cell antigen CD19, as B-cell malignancies are attractive targets for chimeric T-cell therapy. When a CD19 single-chain Fv antibody was coupled to the CD3 zeta (zeta) chain, there was sharply reduced activity on exposure to T regulatory cells, measured by CD19+ target-induced proliferation and cytotoxicity. By contrast, expression in T cells of a chimeric receptor consisting of the intracellular portion of the CD28 molecule fused to the zeta-chain and CD19 single-chain Fv not only produced a higher proliferative response and an increased nuclear factor kappaB activation but also sustained these activities in the presence of T regulatory cells.

In a DNA microarray analysis of 116 AML samples, we found a significant correlation between high mRNA levels of G250/CA9 and longer overall survival (P = .022), a similar trend with high mRNA levels of PRAME (P = .103), and a hint for RHAMM/HMMR. In contrast, for other TAAs like WT1, TERT, PRTN3, BCL2, and LAMR1, we found no correlation with clinical outcome. High expression of at least 1 of the 3 TAAs, RHAMM/HMMR, PRAME, or G250/CA9, provided the strongest favorable prognostic effect (P = .005). Specific T-cell responses were detected in 8 (47%) of 17 patients with AML in complete remission for RHAMM/HMMR-R3 peptide, in 7 (70%) of 10 for PRAME-P3 peptide, and in 6 (60%) of 10 for newly characterized G250/CA9-G2 peptide, a significant increased immune response compared with patients with AML patients who had refractory disease (P < .001). Furthermore, we could demonstrate specific lysis of T2 cells presenting these epitope peptides. In conclusion, expression of the TAAs RHAMM/HMMR, PRAME, and G250/CA9 can induce strong antileukemic immune responses, possibly enabling MRD control.

However, the therapeutic application of TNFalpha was largely limited due to its general toxicity and the fact that it activates the NF-kappaB-family transcription factors, which are proinflammatory and antiapoptotic. To overcome this problem in vitro, specific NF-kappaB inhibitors or transcription or protein synthesis inhibitors such as actinomycin D and cycloheximide are usually used in combination to increase TNFalpha killing of tumor cells. However, these agents also cause harmful side effects in vivo. We show here that wogonin, derived from the popular Chinese herb Huang-Qin, attenuates NF-kappaB activity by shifting TNFalpha-induced free radical .O(2)(-) to a more reduced nonradical product, H(2)O(2), and thereby sensitizes TNFalpha-resistant leukemia cells to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. Importantly, wogonin does not affect the viability of normal peripheral blood T cells. Wogonin also sensitizes TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest a potential use of wogonin as a TNFalpha or TRAIL adjuvant for cancer treatment.

Strategies allowing the selective depletion of alloreactive T cells as well as the enhancement of graft-versus-malignancy immunity would be beneficial. We generated donor CD8 T-cell lines in vitro using allogeneic recipient cells mismatched at a single HLA class I allele or haplotype as stimulators. Recipient cells were obtained from acute myeloid leukemias, renal-cell carcinomas, and CD40L-induced B lymphoblasts. Resulting alloreactive T cells were activated by incubating day 21 T-cell cultures with HLA-mismatch transfected K562 cells or recipient-derived fibroblasts. Selective allodepletion (SAD) was subsequently performed by a newly developed immunomagnetic depletion approach targeting the tumor necrosis factor receptor molecule CD137 (4-1BB). Compared with other activation-induced antigens, CD137 showed a superior performance based on a consistently low baseline expression and a rapid up-regulation following alloantigen stimulation. In 15 different SAD experiments, the frequency of alloreactive CD8 T cells was reduced to a median of 9.5% compared with undepleted control populations. The allodepleted T-cell subsets maintained significant antitumor and antiviral CD8 responses.

The V617F mutation is present in blood and marrow from a large proportion of patients with classic BCR/ABL-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders and of a few patients with other clonal hematological diseases such as myelodysplastic syndrome, atypical myeloproliferative disorders, and acute myeloid leukemia. The JAK2 V617F mutation causes constitutive activation of the kinase, with deregulated intracellular signaling that mimics continuous hematopoietic growth factor stimulation. Within 7 months of the first electronic publication describing this new mutation, clinical molecular diagnostic laboratories in the United States and Europe began offering JAK2 mutation testing on a fee-for-service basis. Here, I review the various techniques used by research groups and clinical laboratories to detect the genetic mutation underlying JAK2 V617F, including fluorescent dye chemistry sequencing, allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, DNA-melting curve analysis, pyrosequencing, and others.

Cytotoxic complications are clinically significant problems lacking mechanistic insight. To reveal tissue-specific molecular responses to this drug, mice were administered asparaginase from either Escherichia coli (clinically used) or Wolinella succinogenes (novel, glutaminase-free form). Both enzymes abolished serum asparagine, but only the E. coli form reduced circulating glutamine. E. coli asparaginase reduced protein synthesis in liver and spleen but not pancreas via increased phosphorylation of the translation factor eIF2. In contrast, treatment with Wolinella caused no untoward changes in protein synthesis in any tissue examined. Treating mice deleted for the eIF2 kinase, GCN2, with the E. coli enzyme showed eIF2 phosphorylation to be GCN2-dependent, but only initially. Furthermore, although eIF2 phosphorylation was not increased in the pancreas or by Wolinella asparaginase, expression of the amino acid stress response genes, asparagine synthetase and CHOP/GADD153, increased as a result of both enzymes, even in tissues demonstrating no change in eIF2 phosphorylation. Finally, signaling downstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase was repressed in liver and pancreas by E. coli but not Wolinella asparaginase. These data demonstrate that the nutrient stress response to asparaginase is tissue-specific and exacerbated by glutamine depletion.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: A 24h ECG-Holter recording system was used to obtain cardiac arrhythmias. Two milliliters HPC were collected from entrance site of venous access to evaluate the temperature of infused HPC. RESULTS: We have detected arrhythmias in 17 (48.58%) of our patients before, during and after infusion. Median temperature of the infusat was 21 degrees C (18-28.2). Arrhythmias during infusion were detected in 8 (22.85%) patients.

We investigated whether peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), which belongs to the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and is essential during development, could be influenced by the ischemia-reperfusion injury process when compared with leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF). STUDY DESIGN: PBR, LIF, and LIF receptor messengers and proteins were analyzed in adult normal and ischemic kidney under conditions mimicking cardiac arrest: 18 pigs were studied after 60 minutes of warm ischemia and reperfusion for 7 days and compared with sham-operated (Sham, n = 12) and control (CONT, n = 12) groups. The same messengers and proteins were assessed in fetal kidneys. RESULTS: In normal kidney, PBR was expressed in descending and ascending limbs of Henle and in distal tubules. After ischemia-reperfusion injury, PBR mRNA significantly increased between days 1 and 7 in cortex and outer medulla. PBR protein increased between days 1 and 7, and was transiently expressed in proximal tubules at days 1 and 3 and returned to basal level at day 7. LIF messenger and protein increased rapidly at day 1 in proximal tubules. In turn, LIF receptor messenger and protein were not changed during reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PBR may be implicated in ischemia-reperfusion injury and, particularly, in the regenerative process within proximal tubules with LIF.

The deletion at chromosome 9p21 removing the p16 tumor suppressor gene is a genetic alteration frequently observed in a variety of human cancers. Thus, structural analyses of breakpoints for p16 deletions in several kinds of human cancers have been performed to elucidate the molecular process of chromosome interstitial deletion consisting of formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and subsequent joining of DNA ends in human cells. The results indicated that DSBs triggering deletions in lymphoid leukemia are formed at a few defined sites by illegitimate action of the RAG protein complex, while DSBs in solid tumors are formed at unspecific sites by factors unidentified yet. In both types of tumors, the intra-nuclear architecture of chromatin was considered to affect the susceptibility of genomic segments of the p16 locus to DSBs. Broken DNA ends were joined by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair in both types of tumors, however, microhomologies of DNA ends were preferentially utilized in the joining in solid tumors but not in lymphoid leukemia. The configuration of broken DNA ends as well as NHEJ activity in cells was thought to underlie the features of joining.

The present data demonstrate that VT-1 (Shiga toxin) stimulation of macrophage-like THP-1 cells up-regulates the activity, antigen and mRNA levels of tissue factor (TF), a key cofactor of the coagulation-inflammation-thrombosis circuit. This up-regulation is accompanied by phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2). Changes in TF mRNA levels were in parallel with the activation of NF-kappaB/Rel and Egr-1 activation, but not with AP-1. Inhibition of PI3-kinase attenuated VT-1-induced phosphorylation of IKKbeta and ERK2, and the up-regulation of TF mRNA levels. VT-1 stimulation rapidly activated c-Yes tyrosine kinase, a member of the Src family. Treatment of the cells with c-Yes antisense oligos attenuated the VT-1-induced phosphorylation of PI3-kinase, IKKbeta and ERK2, activations of NF-kappaB/Rel and Egr-1, and up-regulation of TF mRNA levels. These results suggest that VT-1-induced macrophage stimulation activates c-Yes, which then up-regulates TF expression through activation of the IKKbeta/proteasome/NF-kappaB/Rel and MEK/ERK2/Egr-1 pathways via activation of PI3-kinase.

Natural killer (NK) cells have been originally characterized as cytolytic effector lymphocytes present in mouse spleen and human peripheral blood. The ""NK"" name was originally coined after the NK cell's ability to kill targets cells without requirement for a prior exposure to these targets, in contrast to cytolytic T cells (Kiessling, R., Klein, E., Wigzell, H. 1975. ""Natural"" killer cells in the mouse. I. Cytotoxic cells with specificity for mouse Moloney leukemia cells. Specificity and distribution according to genotype. Eur J Immunol 5:112-117). In this review, an attempt is made to revisit the basis for this vastly admitted definition of NK cells, and to enumerate some of the unsolved questions related to NK cell biology.

To examine whether mouse CD40 can play a role in signaling exogenously administered HSP70 in a fashion similar to that of human CD40, we established mouse CD40-transfectants of both human 293 cells and murine-pro-B cell line Ba/F3. A small portion of mouse CD40 expressed on 293-derived transfectants was the mature form with a signal-transducible C-terminal domain, whereas a majority of expressed antigen showed the molecular size smaller than we expect. Flow cytometry showed that mouse Hsp72, but neither its deletion variants nor the related Escherichia coli DnaK, bound to the 293-derived transfectants regardless of CD40 expression. CD40 molecules expressed on the transfectants showed the binding of soluble form of CD40L but this binding was not inhibited by excess amount of HSP70. CD40L, but not any HSP70 recombinant proteins, stimulated the production of chemokine RANTES in the transfectants. Furthermore, no RANTES production was induced by HSP70-RCMLA complex in the transfectants, although it binds to 293-derived cells in a CD40-independent manner. No interaction between mouse CD40 and HSP70 recombinant proteins was detected by using the Ba/F3-derived transfectants that express the mature form of mouse CD40. The present results imply that mouse CD40 expressed on the transfectants differs from its human homolog in the binding of exogenously administered HSP70.",,"['Tao, Yufeng', 'Nomura, Masayo', 'Kitabatake, Naofumi', 'Tani, Fumito']","['Tao Y', 'Nomura M', 'Kitabatake N', 'Tani F']","['Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Goka-sho, Uji, Kyoto 611-0011, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD40 Antigens/*genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL5/genetics/*metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding/genetics/immunology', '*Transfection']",2006/08/26 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2006/08/26 09:00'],"['2005/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-5890(06)00208-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2006.06.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2007 Feb;44(6):1262-73. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2006.06.002.

At necropsy, ascites, hepatic fibrosis and cardiomegaly were seen. Histologically, the most striking lesion was the presence of cytoplasmic basophilic inclusions in myocardial fibers. Immunostaining for ALV group specific antigen p27 revealed a diffuse presence of virus antigen in cardiac myofibers, in smooth muscle fibers of most of the organs, and in rare, pancreatic and ovarian theca cells. Ultrastructurally, myocardial inclusions consisted of clusters of 50-60 nm round particles with interspersed ribosome-like granules.

The first patient was a 16-yr-old girl who was treated with ATRA and then developed respiratory distress refractory to treatment with dexamethasone combined with anthracycline-cytarabine cytoreduction therapy. Treatment with Sivelestat, a small molecule inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, achieved rapid improvement in oxygenation and chest radiograph findings, and the patient has been in complete remission for 24 months.

Wild-type Fli-1 is involved in lineage commitment of megakaryocytes and myeloid progenitors through induction of Janus kinases (JAKs) following ligand binding to cytokine and growth factor receptors. Proliferation of atypical megakaryocytes is a predominant histopathological feature in Philadelphia chromosome negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (Ph(-) CMPD) and a potential aberrant expression of Fli-1 has not been investigated so far. METHODS: Fli-1 expression was investigated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in bone marrow cells derived from Ph(-) CMPD (n = 80) and non-neoplastic haematopoiesis (n = 21) following determination of the JAK2 status. RESULTS: Fli-1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) with JAK2 (V617F) compared with other Ph(-) CMPD and control (P < 0.001). By immunohistochemistry, Fli-1 protein could be detected in nuclei of atypical megakaryocytes in Ph(-) CMPD and, less accentuated, in non-neoplastic megakaryocytes. Fli-1 protein expression by myeloid progenitors was considerably heterogenous in Ph(-) CMPD independent of an underlying JAK2 (V617F) mutation and without notable differences to non-neoplastic haematopoiesis. CONCLUSION: Fli-1 is rather constitutively expressed by bone marrow cells in Ph(-) CMPD independent of the underlying JAK2 status. The overall stronger labelling for Fli-1 in megakaryocytes in Ph(-) CMPD most likely reflects the degree of polyploidisation but aberrant activation of nuclear target genes can not be excluded.",,"['Bock, Oliver', 'Hussein, Kais', 'Neusch, Michael', 'Schlue, Jerome', 'Wiese, Birgitt', 'Kreipe, Hans']","['Bock O', 'Hussein K', 'Neusch M', 'Schlue J', 'Wiese B', 'Kreipe H']","['Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. bock.oliver@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (FLII protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Ligands', 'Microfilament Proteins/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2006/08/26 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/08/26 09:00'],"['2006/08/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH744 [pii]', '10.1111/j.0902-4441.2006.t01-1-EJH2826.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Dec;77(6):463-70. doi: 10.1111/j.0902-4441.2006.t01-1-EJH2826.x.

Multidrug resistance can be caused by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The majority of these proteins have not yet been examined in T-ALL. Using a newly developed microarray for the simultaneous quantification of 38 ABC transporter genes, we observed a consistent overexpression of ABCA2/ABCA3 in clinical samples of ALL. Therefore, we analyzed the association of these two genes with drug resistance. Treatment of CCRF-CEM and Jurkat cells with methotrexate, vinblastine, or doxorubicin led to an induction of ABCA3 expression, whereas a significant increase of ABCA2 expression was only observed in Jurkat cells. To study the causal relationship of ABCA2/A3 overexpression with drug resistance, we applied RNA interference (RNAi) technology. RNAi specific for ABCA2 or ABCA3 led to a partial decrease of expression in these two ABC transporters. Upon cotreatment of RNAi for ABCA2 with methotrexate and vinblastine, a partial decrease of ABCA2 expression as well as a simultaneous increase of ABCA3 expression was observed. Vice versa, ABCA3 RNAi plus drugs decreased ABCA3 and increased ABCA2 expression. This indicates that down-regulation of one ABC transporter was compensated by the up-regulation of the other.

PERV has been shown to infect human cells in vitro, highlighting a potential zoonotic risk. No pathology is associated with PERV in its natural host, but the pathogenic potential might differ in the case of cross-species transmission and can only be inferred from knowledge of related gammaretroviruses. We therefore investigated the integration features of the PERV DNA in the human genome in vitro in order to further characterize the risk associated with PERV transmission. In this study, we characterized 189 PERV integration site sequences from human HEK-293 cells. Data showed that PERV integration was strongly enhanced at transcriptional start sites and CpG islands and that the frequencies of integration events increased with the expression levels of the genes, except for the genes with the highest levels of expression, which were disfavored for integration. Finally, we extracted genomic sequences directly flanking the integration sites and found an original 8-base statistical palindromic consensus sequence [TG(int)GTACCAGC]. All these results show similarities between PERV and murine leukemia virus integration site selection, suggesting that gammaretroviruses have a common pattern of integration and that the mechanisms of target site selection within a retrovirus genus might be similar.",,"['Moalic, Yann', 'Blanchard, Yannick', 'Felix, Helene', 'Jestin, Andre']","['Moalic Y', 'Blanchard Y', 'Felix H', 'Jestin A']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Virale et Biosecurite, AFSSA, BP53, 22440 Ploufragan, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"[""3' Flanking Region/genetics"", ""5' Flanking Region/genetics"", 'Cell Line', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2006/08/25 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/08/25 09:00'],"['2006/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00904-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00904-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Nov;80(22):10980-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00904-06.

Patients with essential thrombocytosis and polycythemia vera showed increased levels of reticulated platelets compared with healthy controls, and these levels persisted after normalization of the platelet count by hydroxyurea or interferon-alpha treatment.

This is because of the different pharmacokinetic parameters of systemically administered chemotherapeutic agents between the brain and the rest of the body. Specifically, before systemically administered drugs can distribute into the CNS, they must cross two membrane barriers, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCB). To some extent, these structures function to exclude xenobiotics, such as anticancer drugs, from the brain. An understanding of these unique barriers is essential to predict when and how systemically administered drugs will be transported to the brain. Specifically, factors such as physiological variables (e.g. blood flow), physicochemical properties of the drug (e.g. molecular weight), as well as influx and efflux transporter expression at the BBB and BCB (e.g. adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters) determine what compounds reach the CNS. A large body of preclinical and clinical research exists regarding brain penetration of anticancer agents. In most cases, a surrogate endpoint (i.e. CSF to plasma area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] ratio) is used to describe how effectively agents can be transported into the CNS. Some agents, such as the topoisomerase I inhibitor, topotecan, have high CSF to plasma AUC ratios, making them valid therapeutic options for primary and metastatic brain tumours. In contrast, other agents like the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, have a low CSF to plasma AUC ratio. Knowledge of these data can have important clinical implications. For example, it is now known that chronic myelogenous leukaemia patients treated with imatinib might need additional CNS prophylaxis. Since most anticancer agents have limited brain penetration, new pharmacological approaches are needed to enhance delivery into the brain. BBB disruption, regional administration of chemotherapy and transporter modulation are all currently being evaluated in an effort to improve therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, since many chemotherapeutic agents are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 3A enzyme system, minimising drug interactions by avoiding concomitant drug therapies that are also metabolised through this system may potentially enhance outcomes. Specifically, the use of non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs and curtailing nonessential corticosteroid use may have an impact.",,"['Motl, Susannah', 'Zhuang, Yanli', 'Waters, Christopher M', 'Stewart, Clinton F']","['Motl S', 'Zhuang Y', 'Waters CM', 'Stewart CF']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracyclines/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/*metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2006/08/25 09:00,2007/05/12 09:00,['2006/08/25 09:00'],"['2006/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['4592 [pii]', '10.2165/00003088-200645090-00002 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2006;45(9):871-903. doi: 10.2165/00003088-200645090-00002.,,,187,"['R01 GM071321/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM071321/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight were suffering from Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the rest were suffering from acute lymph plastic leukaemia. All were examined microscopically for protozoan parasites mainly, Cryptosporidium parvum and Cyclospora cayetanensis. Of the patients, 34 (69.4%) were positive and 15 (30.6%) were negative by both microscopy and nested PCR. An additional 12 (24.5%) who were negative by microscopy were positive by nested PCR. Stool examination revealed 16 cases with C. parvum, and 6 with C. cayetanensis, and 3 cases showed mixed infection. The results were compared with the established nested PCR assay to detect DNA directly from stool specimens. The patients <3 years old more affected by Cryptosporidium infection, unlike Cyclospora sp. Infection was in older age groups, which reflected the modes of parasite' transmission.. Diarrheal illness was stronger for Cyclospora than for Cryptosporidium. After the extraction of DNA from stool, a 402-bp fragment of C. parvum, and 602 bp fragment of C. cayetanensis was amplified. The amplified products, 194-bp DNA fragment for C. parvum, and 306 bp DNA fragment of C. cayetanensis were used for the second run. This study indicated that primers were specific for DNA of C. parvum and C. cayetanensis. PCR detected a total of 22 (44.9%) positives for C. parvum infection (6 negative by AF stool examination), and 12 (24.5%) positives for C. cavetanensis. Infection (6 negative by AF stool examination), 7 (14.3%) showed mixed infection (4 negative by AF stool examination), all microscopic negative specimens were positive by successive stool examination. Microscopy exhibited sensitivity of 72.7% for C. parvum, 50% for C. cayetanensis and 100% specificity for both parasites compared to 100% sensitivity and specificity with PCR.

JCV has a hyper-variable non-coding transcriptional control region (TCR), which contains the origin of replication and the promoters of viral transcription and replication. The archetype form of TCR-JCV is frequently found in the urine and kidneys of healthy and immunocompromised subjects. However, the rearranged forms, possibly generated by deletion and duplication of segments of the archetype sequence, are found in the peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain of PML patients. Most experience on this setting has come from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic. Little has been described on the JCV-TCR sequences from PML-HIV-negative patients affected by other immunosuppressive disorders. The aim of this study was to analyze the JCV-TCR detected in CSF samples from 12 HIV-negative immunosuppressed patients suffering from PML and to investigate the possible role of genomic organization in the different incidences of PML in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. The results confirm that the JCV-TCR rearrangements play a crucial role in the development of PML, although they do not account for the higher frequency of the disease in HIV infection. These data support the hypothesis that, independently of the rearrangement patterns of JCV-TCR, the direct action of HIV together with other as yet unidentified cellular determinants can be a key to explaining the high rate of PML in HIV infection with respect to other underlying immunosuppressive conditions.",,"['Fedele, Cesare Giovanni', 'Polo, Carolina', 'Tenorio, Antonio', 'Niubo, Jordi', 'Ciardi, Maria Rosa', 'Perez, Jose Luis']","['Fedele CG', 'Polo C', 'Tenorio A', 'Niubo J', 'Ciardi MR', 'Perez JL']","['Diagnostic Microbiology Service Centro Nacional de Microbiologia, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain. gfedele@isciii.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,['0 (Hydroxycorticosteroids)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycorticosteroids/adverse effects', 'Immunocompromised Host/drug effects', 'JC Virus/*genetics', 'Kidney Transplantation/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/cerebrospinal fluid/immunology/*virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2006/08/24 09:00,2006/10/14 09:00,['2006/08/24 09:00'],"['2006/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.20697 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2006 Oct;78(10):1271-5. doi: 10.1002/jmv.20697.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LAA induces the oxidation of glutathione to its oxidized form (GSSG) and this is followed by a concentration-dependent H(2)O(2) accumulation, which occurs in parallel to the induction of apoptosis. To identify early protein targets of LAA in leukemia cells, we used a differential proteomics approach in NB4 human leukemia cells treated with 0.5 mM of LAA for 30 min. This exposure was determined to efficiently block cellular proliferation and to activate oxidative stress-inducible apoptosis. We identified nine proteins that sensitively reacted to LAA treatment by using two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-MS. A subunit of protein-disulfide isomerase (a thiol/disulfide exchange catalyst) and immunoglobulin-heavy-chain binding protein (BiP, identical to Hsp70 chaperone) showed quantitative expression profile differences. A myeloid leukemia associated antigen protein (a tropomyosin isoform) showed changes in pI as a result of phosphorylation. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that the addition of LAA to cells results in an immediate change in the intracellular thiol/disulfide condition and that this includes an increase in the GSH oxidation with changes in the superfamily of thiol/disulfide exchange catalysts.

Here, we describe a new and efficient cryopreservation method, which permits long-term storage and recovery of large quantities of healthy cells that maintain high hepatospecific functions. In culture, the morphology of hepatocytes cryopreserved with wheat protein extracts (WPE) was similar to that of fresh cells. Furthermore, hepatospecific functions such as albumin secretion and biotransformation of ammonium to urea were well maintained during 4 days in culture. Inductions of CYP1A1 and CYP2B in hepatocytes cryopreserved with WPEs were similar to those in fresh hepatocytes. These findings clearly show that WPEs are an excellent cryopreservant for primary hepatocytes. The extract was also found to cryopreserve other human and animal cell types such as lung carcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, Chinese hamster ovary transfected with TGF-b1 cDNA, cervical cancer taken from Henrietta Lacks, intestinal epithelium, and T cell leukemia.

Leflunomide is an immunomodulatory agent that has been approved for treatment of active RA. In the past few years, uses other than RA treatment have appeared. Leflunomide has been reported to show antitumor potential through inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. We thus tested the antiproliferative potential of leflunomide on HEL and K562 erythroleukemia cells. The findings summarized in this report demonstrate for the first time that low dose leflunomide prolonged survival and reduced apoptosis induced by several anticancer agents in erythroleukemia cells. We showed that in treated cells, leflunomide reduced the signalling pathways involved in promoting apoptosis by reducing p38 MAPK and JNK basal activity. On the other hand, leflunomide transiently activated the ERK signalling pathway and induced a sustained activation of Akt.

One member of the family, antizyme-1, plays vital roles in molecular and cellular functions, including developmental regulation, cell cycle, proliferation, cell death, differentiation and tumorigenesis. However, the question of how does it participate in the cell apoptotic mechanism is still unsolved. To elucidate the contribution of human antizyme-1 in haematopoietic cell death, we examine whether inducible overexpression of antizyme enhances apoptotic cell death. Antizyme reduced the viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner of human leukemia HL-60 cells, acute T leukemia Jurkat cells and mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. The apoptosis-inducing activities were determined by nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, sub-G(1) appearance, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi( m )), release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytoplasm and proteolytic activation of caspase 9 and 3. Following conditional antizyme overexpression, all protein levels of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and cyclins are not significantly reduced, except cyclin D, before their entrance into apoptotic cell death. However, introduced cyclin D1 into Jurkat T tetracycline (Tet)-On cell system still couldn't rescue cells from apoptosis. Antizyme doesn't influence the expression of tumor suppressor p53 and its downstream p21, but it interferes in the expressions of Bcl-2 family. Inducible antizyme largely enters mitochondria resulting in cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol following Bcl-xL decrease and Bax increase. According to these data, we suggest that antizyme induces apoptosis mainly through mitochondria-mediated and cell cycle-independent pathway. Furthermore, antizyme induces apoptosis not only by Bax accumulation reducing the function of the Bcl-2 family, destroying the Deltapsi( m ), and releasing cytochrome c to cytoplasm but also by the activation of apoptosomal caspase cascade.",,"['Liu, G-Y', 'Liao, Y-F', 'Hsu, P-C', 'Chang, W-H', 'Hsieh, M-C', 'Lin, C-Y', 'Hour, T-C', 'Kao, M-C', 'Tsay, G J', 'Hung, H-C']","['Liu GY', 'Liao YF', 'Hsu PC', 'Chang WH', 'Hsieh MC', 'Lin CY', 'Hour TC', 'Kao MC', 'Tsay GJ', 'Hung HC']","['Institute of Immunology, Chung-Shan Medical University, No. 110, Sec. 1, Chien-Kuo N.

In this work, we demonstrate that irradiated riboflavin, when applied at microM concentrations, induces an orderly sequence of signaling events finally leading to leukemia cell death. The molecular mechanism involved is dependent on the activation of caspase 8 caused by overexpression of Fas and FasL and also on mitochondrial amplification mechanisms, involving the stimulation of ceramide production by sphingomyelinase and ceramide synthase. The activation of this cascade led to an inhibition of mitogen activated protein kinases: JNK, MEK and ERK and survival mediators (PKB and IAP1), upregulation of the proapoptotic Bcl2 member Bax and downregulation of cell cycle progression regulators. Importantly, induction of apoptosis by irradiated riboflavin was leukaemia cell specific, as normal human lymphocytes did not respond to the compound with cell death.

When CDCP1 promoter was transfected exogenously, Jurkat showed comparable promoter activity with K562, suggesting that the factor to enhance transcription was present but interfered to function in Jurkat. The reporter assay and si-RNA-mediated knockdown experiment revealed that zfp67, a zinc-finger protein, enhanced CDCP1 transcription. Amount of zfp67 in Jurkat was comparable with K562, but chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that zfp67 bound to CDCP1 promoter in K562 but not in Jurkat. There are CpG sequences around the promoter of CDCP1, which were heavily methylated in Jurkat but not in K562. Addition of demethylating reagent to Jurkat induced CDCP1 expression, and increased the zfp67 binding to CDCP1 promoter. Among normal hematopoietic cells such as CD34+CD38- cells, lymphocytes and granulocytes, inverse correlation between proportion of methylated CpG sequences and CDCP1 expression level was found. Demethylation of CpG sequences in lymphocytes, in which CpG sequences were heavily methylated, induced CDCP1 expression and its expression level further increased through zfp67 overexpression.

If successful, however, this approach would likely impair humoral immunity because T cells may persist long-term. Most low-grade lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells express monoclonal immunoglobulins carrying either kappa or lambda light chains. We, therefore, explored whether T lymphocytes could be genetically modified to target the tumor-associated light chain, sparing B lymphocytes expressing the reciprocal light chain, and consequently reduce impairment of humoral immunity. We found that T lymphocytes expressing the anti-kappa light chain CAR showed cytotoxic activity against Igkappa(+) tumor cell lines and B-CLL cells both in vitro and in vivo. We also found that the incorporation of the CD28 endodomain within the CAR enhanced the in vitro and in vivo expansion of transgenic T cells after tumor-associated antigen stimulation. Free Igkappa(+) did not compromise the ability of redirected T lymphocytes to eliminate Igkappa(+) tumors because these free immunoglobulins served to sustain proliferation of CAR-CD28 transgenic T cells.

Because Nucleophosmin (NPM) gene is frequently mutated in AML-NK and causes aberrant NPM cytoplasmic localization (NPMc+), it was used as an AML lineage clonality marker. Clonal NPM exon 12 mutations were detected in myeloid, monocytic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic cells but not in fibroblasts or endothelia that were laser-microdissected from 3 patients with NPMc+ AML. Aberrant cytoplasmic expression of mutated NPM proteins was identified with anti-NPM antibodies in 2 or more myeloid hemopoietic cell lineages in 99 (61.5%) of 161 of NPMc+ AML paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies; lymphoid involvement was excluded in 3 investigated cases. These findings suggest that NPMc+ AML derives from either a common myeloid or earlier progenitor. Immunohistochemical studies show that varying combinations and ratios of NPMc+ leukemic cells from distinct lineages are responsible for heterogeneity within each French-American-British (FAB) classification type and for NPMc+ AML falling into different FAB categories.

Numerous studies have shown that AML1 is a critical regulator of hematopoietic development. In addition, AML1 is a frequent target for chromosomal translocation in human leukemia. The activity of AML1 can be modulated by various types of posttranslational modification, including phosphorylation and acetylation. Phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is one of the mechanisms that dictate whether AML1 acts as either a transcriptional repressor or an activator of gene expression. Recently, a physiological role for AML1 in adult hematopoiesis was revealed by conditional gene targeting in mice. Remarkably, adult hematopoietic progenitors are maintained even in the absence of AML1, in stark contrast to the total disruption of definitive hematopoiesis during embryogenesis. AML1 is, however, critical for megakaryopoiesis and plays an important role in T-cell and B-cell development in adult mice.

We have previously shown that failing hearts have increased levels of the interleukin-6 related cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta family. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of activin A on cardiomyocytes and a potential interaction with LIF-mediated changes in cell signaling and growth. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1- to 3-day-old Wistar rats, and the cells were treated with LIF, activin A or a combination thereof. Our main findings were: (i) activin A treatment reduced the LIF-mediated increase in cardiomyocyte length, perimeter and sarcomeric organization and was accompanied by a substantially decreased alpha-skeletal actin gene expression. (ii) The activin A-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 was markedly enhanced by LIF. (iii) Activin A markedly induced SOCS3 gene expression, while LIF potently increased the expression of Smad7 mRNA, representing inhibitors of LIF and activin A signaling pathways, respectively. (iv) Inhibiting activation of the Smad2/3 pathway abolished the effects of activin A on LIF-induced changes in cell length, perimeter and sarcomeric organization.

However, these explanations do not account for the ubiquitous findings in ADHD of intra-individual performance variability, particularly on tasks that require continual responses to rapid, externally-paced stimuli. Nor do they consider attention as a temporal process dependent upon a continuous energy supply for efficient and consistent function. A consideration of this feature of intra-individual response variability, which is not unique to ADHD but is also found in other disorders, leads to a new perspective on the causes and potential remedies of specific aspects of ADHD. THE HYPOTHESIS: We propose that in ADHD, astrocyte function is insufficient, particularly in terms of its formation and supply of lactate. This insufficiency has implications both for performance and development: H1) In rapidly firing neurons there is deficient ATP production, slow restoration of ionic gradients across neuronal membranes and delayed neuronal firing; H2) In oligodendrocytes insufficient lactate supply impairs fatty acid synthesis and myelination of axons during development. These effects occur over vastly different time scales: those due to deficient ATP (H1) occur over milliseconds, whereas those due to deficient myelination (H2) occur over months and years. Collectively the neural outcomes of impaired astrocytic release of lactate manifest behaviourally as inefficient and inconsistent performance (variable response times across the lifespan, especially during activities that require sustained speeded responses and complex information processing). TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Multi-level and multi-method approaches are required. These include: 1) Use of dynamic strategies to evaluate cognitive performance under conditions that vary in duration, complexity, speed, and reinforcement; 2) Use of sensitive neuroimaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electroencephalography or magnetoencephalopathy to quantify developmental changes in myelination in ADHD as a potential basis for the delayed maturation of brain function and coordination, and 3) Investigation of the prevalence of genetic markers for factors that regulate energy metabolism (lactate, glutamate, glucose transporters, glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, glycolytic enzymes), release of glutamate from synaptic terminals and glutamate-stimulated lactate production (SNAP25, glutamate receptors, adenosine receptors, neurexins, intracellular Ca2+), as well as astrocyte function (alpha1, alpha2 and beta-adrenoceptors, dopamine D1 receptors) and myelin synthesis (lactate transporter, Lingo-1, Quaking homolog, leukemia inhibitory factor, and Transferrin). IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The hypothesis extends existing theories of ADHD by proposing a physiological basis for specific aspects of the ADHD phenotype - namely frequent, transient and impairing fluctuations in functioning, particularly during performance of speeded, effortful tasks. The immediate effects of deficient ATP production and slow restoration of ionic gradients across membranes of rapidly firing neurons have implications for daily functioning: For individuals with ADHD, performance efficacy would be enhanced if repetitive and lengthy effortful tasks were segmented to reduce concurrent demands for speed and accuracy of response (introduction of breaks into lengthy/effortful activities such as examinations, motorway driving, assembly-line production). Also, variations in task or modality and the use of self- rather than system-paced schedules would be helpful. This would enable energetic demands to be distributed to alternate neural resources, and energy reserves to be re-established. Longer-term effects may manifest as reduction in regional brain volumes since brain areas with the highest energy demand will be most affected by a restricted energy supply and may be reduced in size. Novel forms of therapeutic agent and delivery system could be based on factors that regulate energy production and myelin synthesis. Since the phenomena and our proposed basis for it are not unique to ADHD but also manifests in other disorders, the implications of our hypotheses may be relevant to understanding and remediating these other conditions as well.",,"['Russell, Vivienne A', 'Oades, Robert D', 'Tannock, Rosemary', 'Killeen, Peter R', 'Auerbach, Judith G', 'Johansen, Espen B', 'Sagvolden, Terje']","['Russell VA', 'Oades RD', 'Tannock R', 'Killeen PR', 'Auerbach JG', 'Johansen EB', 'Sagvolden T']","['Department of Human Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Anzio Road, Observatory 7925, South Africa. russell@curie.uct.ac.za']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Behav Brain Funct,Behavioral and brain functions : BBF,101245751,,,,2006/08/24 09:00,2006/08/24 09:01,['2006/08/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/24 09:01 [medline]', '2006/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1744-9081-2-30 [pii]', '10.1186/1744-9081-2-30 [doi]']",epublish,Behav Brain Funct. 2006 Aug 23;2:30. doi: 10.1186/1744-9081-2-30.,20060823,,,,PMC1624838,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, applying standard microarray normalization strategies to diagnostic microarrays causes new normalization problems. RESULTS: In this paper we point out the differences of normalizing large microarrays and small diagnostic microarrays. We suggest to include additional normalization genes on the small diagnostic microarrays and propose two strategies for selecting them from genomewide microarray studies. The first is a data driven univariate selection of normalization genes. The second is multivariate and based on finding a balanced diagnostic signature. Finally, we compare both methods to standard normalization protocols known from large microarrays. CONCLUSION: Not including additional genes for normalization on small microarrays leads to a loss of diagnostic information. Using house keeping genes from the literature for normalization fails to work for certain datasets. While a data driven selection of additional normalization genes works well, the best results were obtained using a balanced signature.",,"['Jaeger, Jochen', 'Spang, Rainer']","['Jaeger J', 'Spang R']","['Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Ihnestrasse 73, 14195 Berlin, Germany. jaeger@molgen.mpg.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', 'Statistics as Topic/*methods']",2006/08/24 09:00,2006/10/13 09:00,['2006/08/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-7-388 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-7-388 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2006 Aug 22;7:388. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-7-388.,20060822,,,,PMC1560169,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nelarabine (2-amino-9-beta-D-arabinosyl-6-methoxy-9H-guanine), a synthesised guanosine nucleoside and water-soluble prodrug of ara-G (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine), has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in adults and children. Similar to other nucleoside analogues, nelarabine acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis and inducing apoptosis in susceptible cells. Ara-G itself is a water-insoluble molecule, making its clinical use difficult. However, nelarabine is water soluble and rapidly converted to ara-G in vivo. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that ara-GTP accumulates more readily in T-cells than in B-cells, and this discovery created interest in the development of nelarabine for the treatment of T-cell malignancies.

The block of differentiation at the promyelocytic stage of the blasts and their increased survival induced by PML/RARalpha are the principal biological features of the disease. Therapies based on pharmacological doses of retinoic acid (RA, 10(-6) M) are able to restore APL cell differentiation in most cases, but not to achieve complete hematological remission because retinoic acid resistance occurs in many patients. In order to elaborate alternative therapeutic approaches, we focused our attention on the use of antisense oligonucleotides as gene-specific drug directed to PML/RARalpha mRNA target. We used antisense molecules containing multiple locked nucleic acid (LNA) modifications. The LNAs are nucleotide analogues that are able to form duplexes with complementary DNA or RNA sequences with highly increased thermal stability and are resistant to 3'-exonuclease degradation in vitro. The DNA/LNA chimeric molecules were designed on the fusion sequence of PML and RARalpha genes to specifically target the oncofusion protein. Cell-free and in vitro experiments using U937-PR9-inducible cell line showed that DNA/LNA oligonucleotides were able to interfere with PML/RARalpha expression more efficiently than the corresponding unmodified DNA oligo. Moreover, the treatment of U937-PR9 cells with these chimeric antisense molecules was able to abrogate the block of differentiation induced by PML/RARalpha oncoprotein.

The diagnosis of the types of acute leukemia (AL) may be accomplished immunologically, by using a 33-marker panel and without consideration of the morphocytochemical parameters of blast cells. But such an approach complicates and prolongs the examination of patients with AL. Moreover, morphocytochemical data more exactly define the stages of blast cell differentiation than does the immunological phenotype. Their preparation methods are simple and cost-effective. Only M0, M6, and M7 forms of leukemia require compulsory blast cell phenotyping, particularly in the differential diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Search for new markers of leukemia cells, including lesions at the chromosomal or molecular levels, is under way. Some of them are only of theoretical value while other markers have been already used by hematologists to diagnose leukemia. Standardization in this essence is the self-assessment of a facility and reference comparison, which are based on the principles of its orientation to the patient, the adjusted system for controlling the quality of health care that is up to the world standards rather than the compliance with the state-regulated standard.

Hospital pneumonia is under careful study, which is connected with its severity, complications, high lethargy, and a significantly higher cost of treatment. The morphological peculiarities of pneumonia in myelodepressed oncohematological patients deserve to be studied. In this study, 73 postmortem records of patients who had died of hemoblastoses and had had pneumonia were analyzed. The study showed that the first place in the clinical manifestations of pneumonia in myelo-depressed patients with hematoblastomas belongs to respiratory failure and toxic infective syndrome, which makes difficulties for diagnostic search of the infective process localization. Chest radiograms do not always make it possible to verify an inflammatory process in the lung tissue. Lung tissue infiltration in patients with myelodepression is within the limits of anatomic structures, which is also explained by the absence of cell elements forming the inflammatory bank. This morphological study demonstrates the absence of classic histological picture of pneumonia in the form of neutrophilic infiltration in patients with myelodepression, which often leads to the diagnosis of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.

The expression of DC markers on NB4 cells was potentiated by the overexpression of phospholipase D and upregulation was blocked by the addition of n-butanol, an inhibitor of PA production. The expression of CD11c, CD83, and CCR7 in PA-treated NB4 cells was further increased by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha treatment. Increased functional capacities were also found in PA-differentiated and TNF-alpha-activated NB4 cells with respect to changes in T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, endocytic activity, and cytolytic capacity against undifferentiated NB4 cells. PA alone increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2. The expression of DC markers was downregulated by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of ERK kinase or transient transfection of mutant-ERK. The level of PML-RAR alpha fusion protein was decreased by PA treatment and PD98059 blocked the decrease of PML-RAR alpha.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common B-cell malignancy in the Western world. Although overexpression and regulation of NF-kappaB has been described in CLL, its function remains unclear. Exposure of CLL cells to BAY117082 or Kamebakaurin, potent pharmacological inhibitors of the NF-kappaB pathway, accelerated apoptosis in approximately 70% of cases. Sensitivity to NF-kappaB pathway inhibitors was not related to the prognostic markers VH status, CD38 or Zap70 expression, or to the levels of nuclear NF-kappaB. Normal peripheral B cells were resistant to the apoptosis-inducing effects of these compounds. Cell death induced by the inhibitors was associated with activation of caspase-9 and -3, and loss of mitochondrial membrane polarization, but did not involve changes in the expression of Bcl-2 or Mcl-1. Inhibitors caused an increase in c-jun NH2-terminal kinase activity in CLL, but this did not appear to be important for apoptosis. Microarray analysis identified some potential novel NF-kappaB target genes, including interleukin-16- and the Bcl-2- related survival protein Bcl-w.

The cellular localization appears to be crucial for apoptin's selective toxicity. In normal cells apoptin remains in the cytoplasm, whereas in transformed cells it migrates into the nucleus and kills the cell. However, the manner by which apoptin is able to distinguish between tumor and normal cells is unknown. Here, we report for the first time that apoptin interacts directly with the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in tumor cells and accumulates in PML nuclear bodies (NBs), which are involved in apoptosis induction and viral replication. We also demonstrate that apoptin is sumoylated and that a sumoylation-deficient apoptin mutant is no longer recruited to PML-NBs, but localizes in the nuclear matrix. This mutant fails to bind PML, but can still induce apoptosis as efficiently as wild-type apoptin. Moreover, apoptin kills also PML-/- cells and promyelocytic leukemia cells with defective PML expression. Our results therefore suggest that apoptin kills tumor cells independently of PML and sumoylation, however, the interaction of apoptin with PML and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins might be relevant for CAV replication.",,"['Janssen, K', 'Hofmann, T G', 'Jans, D A', 'Hay, R T', 'Schulze-Osthoff, K', 'Fischer, U']","['Janssen K', 'Hofmann TG', 'Jans DA', 'Hay RT', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Fischer U']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (VP3 protein, Chicken anemia virus)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Capsid Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2006/08/23 09:00,2007/04/11 09:00,['2006/08/23 09:00'],"['2006/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209923 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209923 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Mar 8;26(11):1557-66. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209923.

It has been proposed that regulation of this protein's pleiotropic functions may be accomplished through phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues. We have conducted a phosphoryl mapping of mammalian-expressed Tax protein using a combination of affinity purification, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and site-directed substitution mutational analysis. We achieved physical coverage of 77% of the Tax sequence and identified four novel sites of phosphorylation at Thr-48, Thr-184, Thr-215, and Ser-336. Previously identified potential serine phosphorylation sites at Ser-10, Ser-77, and Ser-274 could not be confirmed by mass spectrometry. The functional significance of these novel phosphorylation events was evaluated by mutational analysis and subsequent evaluation for activity via both CREB and NF-kappaB-responsive promoters. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation at Thr-215 is associated with loss of both Tax functions, phosphorylation at Thr-48 was specifically deficient for activation via NF-kappaB, and phosphorylation at Thr-184 and Ser-336 had no effect on these Tax functions. Semiquantitation of phosphopeptides revealed that the majority of Tax was phosphorylated at Thr-48, Thr-184, Thr-215, and Ser-336, whereas only a minor population of Tax was phosphorylated at either Ser-300 or Ser-301.

CD34(+) stem cell boost (SCB) can restore marrow function but may induce or exacerbate GvHD. We therefore investigated the feasibility and efficacy of CD34(+)-selected SCB in some patients with poor graft function. We present the results for eight patients (median age 46 years) transplanted initially for myelofibrosis, acute leukemia, myeloma and NHL. Six patients had received HLA-matched and two mismatched grafts (PB, BM; n=5, 3). After a median of 128 days post-transplant, the median leukocyte and platelet counts were, respectively, 2.05/nL and 18/nL. None had achieved platelet counts >50/nL even though donor chimerism was >95% in seven recipients. METHODS: Positive selection of CD34(+) stem cells was performed on a CliniMACS device, observing GMP and achieving a median of 98.5% purity. The patients received a median of 1.7 x 10(6)/kg CD34(+) cells and 2.5 x 10(3)/kg CD3(+) T lymphocytes.

After a median follow-up of 144 days, five patients remained alive. No patient had developed acute or chronic GvHD. One patient died of leukemic relapse and two others of systemic mycosis.

Comparison of two methods for enriching monocytic precursors.,318-26,"BACKGROUND: The generation of Ag-loaded DC under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions is logistically challenging and further compounded when the starting precursors need to be purified from B-CLL patients who have overwhelming numbers of circulating B-CLL cells and decreased numbers of monocytes. METHODS: We have previously demonstrated that DC with endocytosed B-CLL apoptotic bodies are powerful stimulators of anti-leukemic T cells. In this study we compared counterflow elutriation and immunomagnetic separation for enriching monocyte precursors, and evaluated the feasibility of generating DC from B-CLL patients and the effects of cryopreservation. RESULTS: Monocyte yield from a single leukapheresis product of a B-CLL patient varied from 1 x 108 to 10 x 108 total cells, from which 40-200 x 106 mature DC could be produced. Adequate numbers of monocytes could not be enriched from one patient with 0.2% monocytes in the leukapheresis product, and the target of 50 x 106 DC was barely achieved in another patient with 0.9% monocytes in the pheresed cells. These results suggested that successful production of DC is dependent on a minimum frequency of 1% CD14(+) monocytes in the leukapheresis product. Cryopreservation of tumor cell-loaded DC yielded a recovery rate of 86+/-4.4% upon thawing, with a total viability of 90+/-2.8%.

Population I was enriched for CD34+ Lin- cells, whereas Population II was enriched for CD34+ CD38- Lin- cells. Both populations showed elevated proliferation and expansion potentials in serum-free liquid cultures, supplemented with a combination of eight different cytokines, with the latter displaying more immature features than the former. One has also characterized the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) counterparts of these two populations and demonstrated functional deficiencies in terms of their growth in culture. In keeping with this line of research, the goal of the present study was to obtain the same two populations (Populations I and II) from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bone marrow and to characterize their biological behavior under the same culture conditions. The results demonstrated that AML-derived Populations I and II were unable to proliferate in culture conditions that allowed significant proliferation of Populations I and II from normal marrow. Population I from AML also showed a deficient expansion capacity; in contrast, Population II cells were able to expand to a similar extent to the one observed for Population II from normal marrow. Both normal and AML populations were highly sensitive to the inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha; interestingly, whereas in normal fractions TNF-alpha showed a more pronounced inhibitory effect on more mature cells (Population I), this cytokine inhibited proliferation and expansion of AML Populations I and II in a similar degree. It is noteworthy that the functional deficiencies observed in AML cells were even more pronounced than those previously reported for cultures of CML cells.

This study reports four adults, two women (56 and 58 years old) and two men (35 and 41 years old) with lymphoblastic leukemia that displayed lambda, surface immunoglobulin restriction (sIg+). The leukemic cells were all dim CD45 positive with side scatter light characteristic of blasts. Two cases were positive with the blasts associated with antigens TdT and CD34.

Blood samples of 135 children with ALL and 142 matched controls were analysed. The presence of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms were screened using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism based approaches. The frequency of MTHFR 677CC, 677CT and 677TT genotypes were 37.77%, 57.03% and 5.18% in cases and 55.63%, 40.84% and 3.52% in controls, respectively. Frequencies of MTHFR 1298AA, 1298AC and 1298CC genotypes were 30.37%, 61.48% and 8.14% in cases and 45.77%, 47.88% and 6.33% in controls, respectively. The present study inidcates that there is an association between MTHFR gene polymorphisms and ALL. MTHFR variants also showed a gender bias. The frequencies of MTHFR 677CC and 677CT genotypes were 33.33% and 65.51% in males and 45.83% and 41.66% in females. Frequencies of MTHFR 1298AA, 1298AC and 1298CC genotypes were 26.43%, 67.81% and 5.74% in males and 37.5%, 50.0% and 12.5% in females, respectively. It is evident that the male children were more susceptible to ALL compared to female children. Associations found in these studies were significant with respect to gender bias; hence, it is possible that MTHFR C677T and A1298C can be good markers for ALL. Moreover, the possibility also exists that these variants may be influenced by the folate uptake of mothers during pregnancy, thereby influencing the enzyme activity and the ethnicity of the cases examined to date. The gender bias of MTHFR polymorphism in ALL is reported for the first time.",,"['Reddy, Haranatha', 'Jamil, Kaiser']","['Reddy H', 'Jamil K']","['Department of Genetics, Bhagwan Mahavir Medical Research Center, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],IM,"['Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk']",2006/08/23 09:00,2007/01/18 09:00,['2006/08/23 09:00'],"['2006/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['Q05G505280624174 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600562773 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Jul;47(7):1333-9. doi: 10.1080/10428190600562773.,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Jul;47(7):1203-4.

T-cell function was assessed by stimulation with purified protein derivative (PPD) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Despite a reduction in number, the expression of IFN-gamma/IL-4 in T-cells in patients was significantly higher than in healthy donors. The intensity of most signaling molecules in treated patients was relatively unaffected vs. healthy donors but lower than untreated-indolent patients. However, the total number of T cells which expressed each of the signaling molecules was decreased in patients, with no difference between fludarabine- and alemtuzumab-treated patients. The T-cell response to PHA but not PPD was reduced in treated patients.

METHODS: Cell cycle was analyzed by PI staining using flow cytometry. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin-V-FITC/PI double staining using flow cytometry. Differentiation was observed by morphological criteria, Wright-Giemsa staining and expression of cell surface markers CD11b and CD14. RESULTS: Variable GTP concentrations (25-200 micromol/L) at short treatment times (up to 24 h) showed significant anti-proliferative activities among both cell types. However, longer treatment times (up to 72 h) were required to trigger apoptosis. Cell-cycle analyses of the GTP-treated cells indicated an increase in S-phase population by 48 h followed by the appearance of a sub-G(1) peak after 72 h of treatment. The effects of GTP on U937 and KG1 cells were accompanied with differentiation toward monocyte/macrophage lineage. This was evidenced by a sharp increase in the extent of CD11b and CD14 expression after 24 h of exposure to GTP. The viability of both cell types did not significantly change during the first 24 h.

METHODS: The effects of four prenylflavonoids on the growth of CCRF-CEM and HaCa cells were studied by 3-(4,5)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis were detected through Hoechst 33258 staining. The effect of artonin B on the cell cycle of CCRF-CEM cells were studied by propidium iodide method. The change in mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by rohdamine 123 staining. The cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activity were checked by immunoassay kits, respectively. The expression of Bcl-2 family proteins was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Our data revealed that artonin B strongly induced human CCRF-CEM leukemia cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner by MTT assay, but not on normal epithelia cells (HaCa cells). Artonin B-induced cell death was considered to be apoptotic by observing the typical apoptotic morphological change by Hoechst 33258 staining. The induction of human CCRF-CEM leukemia cancer cell death was caused by an induction of apoptosis through mitochondrial membrane potential change, cytochrome c release, sub-G1 proportion increase, downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, upregulation of Bax and Bak expression and activation of caspase 3 pathways. CONCLUSION: These results clearly demonstrated that artonin B is able to inhibit proliferation by induction of hypoploid cells and cell apoptosis.

Because the primary defect of cystic fibrosis (CF) is the loss of chloride transport function of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), we hypothesized that CF neutrophils may be deficient in chlorination of bacterial components due to a limited chloride supply to the phagolysosomal compartment. Multiple approaches, including RT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and immunoblotting, were used to demonstrate that CFTR is expressed in resting neutrophils at the mRNA and protein levels. Probing fractions of resting neutrophils isolated by Percoll gradient fractionation and free flow electrophoresis for CFTR revealed its presence exclusively in secretory vesicles. The CFTR chloride channel was also detected in phagolysosomes, a special organelle formed after phagocytosis. Interestingly, HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, upregulated CFTR expresssion when induced to differentiate into neutrophils with DMSO, strongly suggesting its potential role in mature neutrophil function. Analyses by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed that neutrophils from CF patients had a defect in their ability to chlorinate bacterial proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa metabolically prelabeled with [(13)C]-l-tyrosine, unveiling defective intraphagolysosomal HOCl production. In contrast, both normal and CF neutrophils exhibited normal extracellular production of HOCl when stimulated with phorbol ester, indicating that CF neutrophils had the normal ability to produce this oxidant in the extracellular medium.

In the popular gamma frailty model the marginal hazard has the form of a Burr model. Although the Burr model is very useful and can offer insight on the data, it is far from perfect. The estimation of the covariate effects is linked to the baseline hazard and this makes the model coefficients hard to interpret. At the same time, the frailties are assumed constant over time, while biological reasoning in some cases may indicate that frailties may be time dependent. In this paper we present a relaxation of the Burr model which is based on loosening the link between the estimation of the covariate effects and the baseline hazard. This can be achieved by replacing the cumulative baseline hazard in the Burr model by a set of time functions, and the frailty variance by a vector of coefficients directly estimated from the data using a partial likelihood. We illustrate the similarities of the model with the Burr model and a further extension of the latter, a model with an autoregressive stochastic process for the frailty. We compare the models on simulated data sets with constant and time-dependent frailties and show how the relaxed Burr models performs on two different real data sets. We show that the relaxed Burr model serves as a good approximation to the Burr model when the frailty is constant, and furthermore it gives better results when the frailty is time dependent.","['Copyright 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Perperoglou, Aris', 'van Houwelingen, Hans C', 'Henderson, Robin']","['Perperoglou A', 'van Houwelingen HC', 'Henderson R']","['Leiden University Medical Center, University of Leiden, PO Box 9604, 2300 RC, The Netherlands. a.perperoglou@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Computer Simulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Statistical', 'Poverty', '*Proportional Hazards Models', '*Stochastic Processes', '*Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2006/08/22 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2006/08/22 09:00'],"['2006/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.2675 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2006 Dec 30;25(24):4253-66. doi: 10.1002/sim.2675.,,,,['G0400615/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

AF10 is one of more than 30 MLL fusion partners in leukaemia. We have recently demonstrated that the H3K79 methyltransferase hDOT1L contributes to MLL-AF10-mediated leukaemogenesis through its interaction with AF10 (ref. 5). In addition to MLL, AF10 has also been reported to fuse to CALM (clathrin-assembly protein-like lymphoid-myeloid) in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Here, we analysed the molecular mechanism of leukaemogenesis by CALM-AF10. We demonstrate that CALM-AF10 fusion is both necessary and sufficient for leukaemic transformation. Additionally, we provide evidence that hDOT1L has an important role in the transformation process. hDOT1L contributes to CALM-AF10-mediated leukaemic transformation by preventing nuclear export of CALM-AF10 and by upregulating the Hoxa5 gene through H3K79 methylation. Thus, our study establishes CALM-AF10 fusion as a cause of leukaemia and reveals that mistargeting of hDOT1L and upregulation of Hoxa5 through H3K79 methylation is the underlying mechanism behind leukaemia caused by CALM-AF10 fusion.",,"['Okada, Yuki', 'Jiang, Qi', 'Lemieux, Margot', 'Jeannotte, Lucie', 'Su, Lishan', 'Zhang, Yi']","['Okada Y', 'Jiang Q', 'Lemieux M', 'Jeannotte L', 'Su L', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7295, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (Mllt10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Methyltransferases/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/08/22 09:00,2006/10/19 09:00,['2006/08/22 09:00'],"['2006/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncb1464 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb1464 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2006 Sep;8(9):1017-24. doi: 10.1038/ncb1464.

Murine leukemia L1210 cells and human prostate Bax-deficient DU-145 cells were examined after PDT-induced photodamage to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Previous studies indicated that this treatment resulted in a substantial loss of Bcl-2 function. Both apoptosis and autophagy occurred in L1210 cells after ER photodamage with the latter predominating after 24 hr. These processes were characterized by altered cellular morphology, chromatin condensation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and formation of vacuoles containing cytosolic components. Western blots demonstrated processing of LC3-I to LC3-II, a marker for autophagy. In DU145 cells, PDT initiated only autophagy. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitors suppressed autophagy in both cell lines as indicated by inhibition of vacuolization and LC3 processing. Inhibitors of apoptosis and/or autophagy were then used to delineate the contributions of the two pathways to the effects of PDT.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one adults with inv(16) and 49 adults with t(8;21), assigned to postremission therapy with repetitive cycles of higher dose cytarabine were analyzed for mutKIT in exon 17 (mutKIT17) and 8 (mutKIT8) by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing at diagnosis. The median follow-up was 5.3 years. RESULTS: Among patients with inv(16), 29.5% had mutKIT (16% with mutKIT17 and 13% with sole mutKIT8). Among patients with t(8;21), 22% had mutKIT (18% with mutKIT17 and 4% with sole mutKIT8). Complete remission rates of patients with mutKIT and wild-type KIT (wtKIT) were similar in both cytogenetic groups. In inv(16), the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was higher for patients with mutKIT (P = .05; 5-year CIR, 56% v 29%) and those with mutKIT17 (P = .002; 5-year CIR, 80% v 29%) compared with wtKIT patients. Once data were adjusted for sex, mutKIT predicted worse overall survival (OS). In t(8;21), mutKIT predicted higher CIR (P = .017; 5-year CIR, 70% v 36%), but did not influence OS. CONCLUSION: We report for the first time that mutKIT, and particularly mutKIT17, confer higher relapse risk, and both mutKIT17 and mutKIT8 appear to adversely affect OS in AML with inv(16). We also confirm the adverse impact of mutKIT on relapse risk in t(8;21) AML.

The trials were conducted with either intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine (75 mg/m2/d for 7 days every 28 days). RESULTS: Complete remissions were seen in 10% to 17% of azacitidine-treated patients; partial remissions were rare; 23% to 36% of patients had hematologic improvement (HI). The median number of cycles to first response was three, and 90% of responses were seen by cycle 6. Using current WHO criteria, 103 patients had AML at baseline; 35% to 48% had HI or better responses. The median survival time for the 27 AML patients randomly assigned to azacitidine was 19.3 months compared with 12.9 months for the 25 patients assigned to observation.

For most patients, CRT has been replaced with intensified systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy, often including methotrexate (MTX). The impact of chemotherapy-only protocols on neurocognitive outcomes is unclear, and the importance of systemic MTX dose has not been established. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy nine of 120 eligible children diagnosed with high-risk ALL between the ages of 1.0 and 4.9 years participated in this retrospective cohort study. All patients were treated on a uniform chemotherapy protocol with one of three modalities of CNS prophylaxis, depending on their treatment era. In addition to intrathecal therapy, CNS-directed therapy consisted of CRT (18 Gy in 10 fractions) in 25 patients, high-dose intravenous (IV) MTX (8 g/m2 x 3 doses) in 32 patients and very high-dose IV MTX (33.6 g/m2 x 3 doses) in 22 patients. Participants completed tests of intelligence, academic achievement, attention, and memory. RESULTS: Neurocognitive assessment was conducted at least 5 years after diagnosis (mean, 10.5 years, standard deviation, 2.7 years). No difference was detected on any neurocognitive measure between children treated with high-dose or very high-dose IV MTX. The combined MTX groups scored near the population mean on 17/18 measures.

The hypothesis that poor physical health would be significantly associated with suicidality after adjusting for mental health variables was specifically tested. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-six adult survivors of childhood cancer (mean age, 28 years) seen in a survivor clinic completed the Short Form-36 and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), as well as suicide items from the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised, and Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation. Participants reporting current suicide ideation or any past suicide attempt were classified as suicidal. RESULTS: Twenty-nine participants (12.83%) reported suicidality, although only 11 of these were significantly depressed by BDI criteria. Univariate analyses found suicidality unrelated to age or sex but positively associated with younger age at diagnosis, longer time since diagnosis, cranial radiation treatment, leukemia diagnosis, depression, hopelessness, pain, and physical appearance concern. A hierarchical logistic regression showed that current physical functioning, including pain, was significantly associated with suicidality even after adjusting for treatment and depression variables. CONCLUSION: Suicidal symptoms, which are reported by a significant minority of adult survivors of childhood cancer, are related to cancer treatments and post-treatment mental and physical health. Association of suicidal symptoms with physical health problems is important because these represent treatable conditions for which survivors may seek follow-up care. The relationship of physical well-being to suicidality underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach to survivor care.",,"['Recklitis, Christopher J', 'Lockwood, Rebecca A', 'Rothwell, Monica A', 'Diller, Lisa R']","['Recklitis CJ', 'Lockwood RA', 'Rothwell MA', 'Diller LR']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115-6084, USA. christopher_recklitis@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Depression/*complications/etiology', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Stress, Psychological/*complications/etiology', 'Suicide/*statistics & numerical data', 'Suicide, Attempted/statistics & numerical data', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",2006/08/22 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/08/22 09:00'],"['2006/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/24/3852 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.06.5409 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Aug 20;24(24):3852-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.06.5409.,,"['J Clin Oncol. 2007 Feb 20;25(6):731-2; author reply 733-4.

However, it is often difficult to evaluate NKT cell function in patients with malignancies due to reduced numbers of NKT cells as well as the dysfunction of the APCs used as stimulators. We found that NKT cell function could not be evaluated by conventional ELISPOT assays, confirming the impaired function of APCs in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-chronic phase patients. To overcome this problem, we have established a sensitive assay using murine dendritic cells to evaluate the function of small numbers of human NKT cells independent of autologous APCs. We found that imatinib-treated CML-chronic phase patients showing a complete cytogenetic response had NKT cells capable of producing IFN-gamma, whereas NKT cells from patients who were only partially responsive to imatinib treatment did not produce IFN-gamma. Functional NKT cells found in imatinib-treated, CML-complete cytogenetic response patients may offer the promise of effective immunotherapy with ex vivo-generated alpha-galactosylceramide-pulsed dendritic cells.

PAFR couples to both pertussis toxin-sensitive and pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins to activate leukocytes. To define the role(s) of G(i) and G(q) in PAF-induced leukocyte responses, two G-protein-linked receptors were generated by fusing G alpha(i3) (PAFR-G alpha(i3)) or G alpha(q) (PAFR-G alpha(q)) at the C terminus of PAFR. Rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3) stably expressing wild-type PAFR, PAFR-G alpha(i3), or PAFR-G alpha(q) was generated and characterized. All receptor variants bound PAF with similar affinities to mediate G-protein activation, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, and secretion of beta-hexosaminidase. PAFR-G alpha(i3) and PAFR-G alpha(q) mediated greater GTPase activity in isolated membranes than PAFR but lower PI hydrolysis and secretion in whole cells. PAFR and PAFR-G alpha(i3), but not PAFR-G alpha(q), mediated chemotaxis to PAF. All three receptors underwent phosphorylation and desensitization upon exposure to PAF but only PAFR translocated beta arrestin to the cell membrane and internalized. In RBL-2H3 cells coexpressing the PAFRs along with CXCR1, IL-8 (CXCL8) cross-desensitized Ca2+ mobilization to PAF by all the receptors but only PAFR-G alpha(i3) activation cross-inhibited the response of CXCR1 to CXCL8. Altogether, the data indicate that G(i) exclusively mediates chemotactic and cross-regulatory signals of the PAFR, but both G(i) and G(q) activate PI hydrolysis and exocytosis by this receptor. Because chemotaxis and cross-desensitization are exclusively mediated by G(i), the data suggest that differential activation of both G(i) and G(q) by PAFR likely mediate specific as well as redundant signaling pathways.",,"['Brown, Stephan L', 'Jala, Venkatakrishna R', 'Raghuwanshi, Sandeep K', 'Nasser, Mohd W', 'Haribabu, Bodduluri', 'Richardson, Ricardo M']","['Brown SL', 'Jala VR', 'Raghuwanshi SK', 'Nasser MW', 'Haribabu B', 'Richardson RM']","['Department of Biochemistry, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN 37208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chemotaxis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Platelet Activating Factor/pharmacology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2006/08/22 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/08/22 09:00'],"['2006/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['177/5/3242 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.177.5.3242 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Sep 1;177(5):3242-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.5.3242.,,,,"['AI-38910/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-52381/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Refractoriness of the memory T cells to TCR activation was also reversed by the removal of TGF-beta1 by briefly pulsing the cells in a low pH buffer. Addition of exogenous TGF-beta1 to eluted T cells re-established their nonresponsive state.

CD22 ligand-blocking mAbs also inhibited the survival of adoptively transferred normal (73-88%) and malignant (90%) B cells in vivo.

Immune receptor expressed by myeloid cell-3 cDNA was cloned from a PHA-activated PBMC library and RT-PCR revealed the gene to be expressed preferentially in cells of myeloid origin. The CD300b cDNA open reading frame encodes a 201-aa type I protein composed of a single extracellular Ig V-type domain followed by a transmembrane region containing a positively charged residue (lysine) which is a common feature among receptors that associate with activating adaptor proteins. Indeed, CD300b was able to associate with DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP-12) and deliver different activating signals through this ITAM-based adaptor. Unusually for an activating receptor, the 29-aa cytoplasmic tail of CD300b contains a tyrosine-based motif that, upon c-Fyn phosphorylation, became a docking site for the intracellular signaling mediator growth factor receptor-bound protein 2. Moreover, in the absence of DAP-12, CD300b was able to activate NFAT/AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity in RBL-2H3 cells. This activity could be abolished only by mutating both the cytoplasmic tyrosine and the transmembrane lysine. Our data suggest the existence of an unidentified molecule capable of interacting with CD300b through a charged residue of the transmembrane region and allowing receptor signaling independent of DAP-12.

ET-1 treatment also resulted in a significant increase in total protein synthesis, mediated through both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors, cell size, as well as increased expression of myosin heavy chain, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and calponin. ET-1-induced hypertrophy was accompanied by activation of JAK1/STAT-3 and MAPK1/2 (ERK1/2) cell signaling pathways. Inhibition of JAK1/STAT-3 pathways by piceatannol or ERK1/2 by the MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2 inhibitor U0126 blunted the increase in total protein synthesis. The hypertrophic effect of ET-1 was equivalent to that of the gp130 cytokine oncostatin M and greater than that induced by cardiotrophin-1. ET-1 induced release of IL-6 but not IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, or cardiotrophin-1, although treatment of cells with IL-6 alone did not induce hypertrophy. These results suggest that ET-1 is a candidate mediator for the induction of increased smooth muscle mass in asthma and identify signaling pathways activated by this mediator.",,"['McWhinnie, Ralph', 'Pechkovsky, Dmitri V', 'Zhou, Danyi', 'Lane, David', 'Halayko, Andrew J', 'Knight, Darryl A', 'Bai, Tony R']","['McWhinnie R', 'Pechkovsky DV', 'Zhou D', 'Lane D', 'Halayko AJ', 'Knight DA', 'Bai TR']","[""James Hogg iCAPTURE Centre for Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Research, St. Paul's Hospital, University of British Columbia, 1081 Burrard St., Vancouver, BC, Canada V6Z 1Y6.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,American journal of physiology.

These are APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, APOBEC3C, APOBEC3DE, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, and APOBEC3H. Three of them, APOBEC3G, APOBEC3F, and APOBEC3B, block replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and many other retroviruses. In addition, APOBEC3A and APOBEC3C block intracellular retrotransposons and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), respectively. In opposition to APOBEC genes, HIV-1 and SIV contain a virion infectivity factor (Vif) that targets APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Herein, we studied the antiretroviral activities of the human APOBEC3DE and APOBEC3H. We found that only APOBEC3DE had antiretroviral activity for HIV-1 or SIV and that Vif suppressed this antiviral activity. APOBEC3DE was encapsidated and capable of deaminating cytosines to uracils on viral minus-strand DNA, resulting in disruption of the viral life cycle. Other than GG-to-AG and AG-to-AA mutations, it had a novel target site specificity, resulting in introduction of GC-to-AC mutations on viral plus-strand DNA. Such mutations have been detected previously in HIV-1 clinical isolates. In addition, APOBEC3DE was expressed much more extensively than APOBEC3F in various human tissues and it formed heteromultimers with APOBEC3F or APOBEC3G in the cell. From these studies, we concluded that APOBEC3DE is a new contributor to the intracellular defense network, resulting in suppression of retroviral invasion.",,"['Dang, Ying', 'Wang, Xiaojun', 'Esselman, Walter J', 'Zheng, Yong-Hui']","['Dang Y', 'Wang X', 'Esselman WJ', 'Zheng YH']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824-4320, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, vif)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC Deaminases', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/metabolism', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/*genetics/*physiology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Products, vif/physiology', 'HIV-1/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Point Mutation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/pathogenicity', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/physiology', 'Virus Replication', 'vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2006/08/22 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/08/22 09:00'],"['2006/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01123-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01123-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Nov;80(21):10522-33. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01123-06.

However, the role of beta-catenin in the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-induced transformation of T cells is unknown. Here we found that beta-catenin protein was overexpressed in the nucleus and that beta-catenin-dependent transcription was significantly enhanced in Tax-positive HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines compared to that in Tax-negative HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Transfection with beta-catenin-specific small interfering RNA inhibited the growth of the Tax-positive HTLV-1-infected T-cell line HUT-102. Transient transfection of Tax appeared to enhance beta-catenin-dependent transcription by stabilizing the beta-catenin protein via activation of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element-binding protein. HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines overexpressing beta-catenin also showed increased Akt activity via Tax activation of the cAMP response element-binding protein, resulting in the phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, which phosphorylates beta-catenin for ubiquitination. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 reduced beta-catenin expression in Tax-positive T-cell lines, and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta by lithium chloride restored beta-catenin expression in Tax-negative T-cell lines. Finally, we showed that dominant-negative Akt inhibited Tax-induced beta-catenin-dependent transcription. These results indicate that Tax activates beta-catenin through the Akt signaling pathway.

Polymorphisms in these enzymes have been shown to modify toxicity of methotrexate (MTX) after hematopoietic cell transplantation. In this study, we evaluated the risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) associated with genetic variation in recipient and donor MTHFR and TS genotypes to assess whether genotype alters the efficacy of MTX in acute GVHD prophylaxis. Data on the transplantation course were abstracted from medical records for 304 adults who received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants. MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) and TS (enhancer-region 28-base pair repeat, TSER, and 1494del6) genotypes were determined using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism and TaqMan assays. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the associations between genotypes and risk of acute GVHD. Compared with recipients with the wild-type MTHFR 677CC genotype, those with the variant 677T allele showed a decreased risk of detectable acute GVHD (677CT: odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-1.6; 677TT: odds ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.8; P for trend = .01).

No association with risk of acute GVHD was observed for donor MTHFR genotypes or for recipient or donor TS genotypes, with the exception of an increase in acute GVHD among recipients whose donors had the TSER 3R/2R genotype (odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-7.2). These findings indicate that host, but not donor, MTHFR genotypes modify the risk of acute GVHD in recipients receiving MTX, in a manner consistent with our previously reported associations between MTHFR genotypes and MTX toxicity. A direct trade-off between drug toxicity and drug efficacy may play a role.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are very potent stimulators of immune responses and these cells have been widely used to target other types of malignancies. This review discusses the function and the applicability of leukemia-derived DCs for active specific immunotherapy in myeloid leukemia including possible pitfalls, and describes options to optimize DC-based vaccines.",,"['Westers, Theresia M', 'Houtenbos, Ilse', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J']","['Westers TM', 'Houtenbos I', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Ossenkoppele GJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands. tm.westers@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/*transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*therapy']",2006/08/22 09:00,2006/12/28 09:00,['2006/08/22 09:00'],"['2006/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(06)00083-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imbio.2006.06.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 2006;211(6-8):663-76. doi: 10.1016/j.imbio.2006.06.003.

The approach taken to circumvent such problems involved first suspending viral pellets in water to allow any residual microvesicles to swell and perhaps lyse during overnight or longer incubation periods. Urea was then added to a concentration of 1.5-2.0 M to uncoil proteins that may protect nucleic acids from hydrolysis on the further addition of Micrococcal nuclease and ribonuclease A, both of which remain enzymatically active in molar urea solutions. The viral RNA was extracted and residual DNA removed by deoxyribonuclease I treatments. The utility of the method was demonstrated with two different retroviruses, a Moloney murine leukemia virus variant and Rous sarcoma virus, such that viral RNA thus purified was shown to be free of contamination by PCR-amplifiable cellular GAPDH mRNA and ribosomal RNA.

Although RA therapy is well tolerated, about 25% of APL patients develop a potentially fatal condition called retinoic acid syndrome (RAS). Molecular mechanisms underlying the development of RAS pathogenesis, especially those that result in the damage of endothelial cells remain elusive. In the present study, we found that RA treatment induces the expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in peripheral blast cells from APL patients. IFN-gamma and IL-1beta also exerted synergistic effect in driving human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) into apoptosis. RA also upregulated the expression of CD38, an ectoenzyme responsible for the generation of the calcium messenger cyclic ADP-ribose. Importantly, RA-induced CD38 expression promoted strong attachment of leukemia cells to endothelial cells, and incubation of endothelial cells with either high concentration (100 ng/ml) of IFN-gamma alone or low concentration of IL-1beta and IFN-gamma (10 ng/ml, each) induced strong apoptotic responses as revealed by caspase-8 activation and DNA fragmentation.

Report from the Automated Childhood Cancer Information System project.,2019-36,"Leukaemias constitute approximately one-third of cancers in children (age 0-14 years) and 10% in adolescents (age 15-19 years). Geographical patterns (1988-1997) and time trends (1978-1997) of incidence and survival from leukaemias in children (n=29,239) and adolescents (n=1929) were derived from the ACCIS database, including data from 62 cancer registries in 19 countries across Europe. The overall incidence rate of leukaemia in children was 44 per million person-years during 1988-1997. Lymphoid leukaemia (LL) accounted for 81%, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) for 15%, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) for 1.5% and unspecified leukaemia for 1.3% of cases. Adjusted for sex and age, incidence of childhood LL was significantly lower in the East and higher in the North than in the British Isles. The overall incidence among adolescents was 22.6 per million person-years. The incidence of LL was rising in children (0.6% per year) and adolescents (1.9% per year). During 1988-1997 5-year survival of children with leukaemias was 73% (95% CI 72-74) and approximately 44% for infants and adolescents. Similar differences in survival between children and adolescents were observed for LL, much less so for ANLL. Survival differed between regions; prognosis was better in the North and West than the East.

OBJECTIVE: To determine what potential research participants want to know about financial interests, their capacity to understand disclosed information and its implications, and the reactions of potential research participants to a proposed disclosure statement. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen focus groups in 3 cities, including 6 groups of healthy adults, 6 groups of adults with mild chronic illness, 1 group of parents of healthy children, 1 group of parents of children with leukemia or brain tumor, 1 group of adults with heart failure, and 1 group of adults with cancer. APPROACH: Focus group discussions covered a range of topics including financial relationships in clinical research, whether people should be told about them, and how they should be told. Audio-recordings of focus groups were transcribed, verified, and coded for analysis. RESULTS: Participants wanted to know about financial interests, whether or not those interests would affect their participation. However, they varied in their desire and ability to understand the nature and implications of financial interests. Whether disclosure was deemed important depended upon the risk of the research. Trust in clinicians was also related to views regarding disclosure. If given the opportunity to ask questions during the consent process, some participants would not have known what to ask; however, after the focus group sessions, participants could identify information they would want to know.

Its close relative, DNA polymerase (pol) pol lambda can synthesize DNA both in a template dependent (DNA polymerase) and template-independent (terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase) fashion.

Human cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) which could specifically lyse WT1-expressing tumor cells with HLA class I restriction were generated in vitro. We have also demonstrated that mice immunized with the WT1 peptide or WT1 cDNA rejected challenges by WT1-expressing tumor cells and survived with no signs of auto-aggression to normal organs which physiologically expressed WT1 in prophylactic and therapeutic models. Furthermore, we and others detected IgM and IgG WT1 antibodies in the patients with hematopoietic malignancies, indicating that WT1 protein was highly immunogenic, and that immunoglobulin class-switch-inducing WT1-specific cellular immune responses were elicited in the patients. CD8+ WT1-specific CTLs were also detected in peripheral blood or tumor-draining lymph nodes of cancer patients. These results provided us with the rationale for elicitation of CTL responses targeting the WT1 product for cancer immunotherapy. On the basis of the findings mentioned above, we performed a phase I clinical trial of WT1 peptide cancer vaccine for the patients with malignant neoplasms. These results strongly suggested that WT1 peptide cancer vaccine had efficacy in the clinical setting, because clinical responses, including reduction of leukemic blast cells or regression of tumor masses, were observed after the WT1 vaccination in patients with hematopoietic malignancies or solid cancers.

It is possible in one or more family members to observe chronic lymphocytic leukemia alone, other malignant disorders or combination of both of them. THE AIM: of our study was to analyze the association of family history of malignances with the onset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study through direct inquiry of the families of 126 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The control group consisted of 124 patients with benignant disorders. For statistic data processing we used Fisher's exact test in 2x2 table and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. RESULTS: 35.71% of the investigated individuals had first degree relatives with malignant disorders, while in the control group their percentage was 17.7%. Significant correlation between positive family history of malignancy and the onset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was found (P = 0.0016). The risk of development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in individuals with family history of malignant disorders was 1.69 times higher than in individuals with negative family history RR = 1.697, 95% C.I. [1.177; 2.448]. There was no significant difference in the general survival between groups with positive and negative family history of malignancy. Stomach cancer was particularly often diagnosed in families with individuals affected with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Other lymphoproliferative disorders were also registered in 3.9% of the families from the control group. CONCLUSION: Our data show that there is a high risk of getting chronic lymphocytic leukemia in close relatives of affected individuals with malignant disorders. There was no data for greater aggressiveness of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients with positive family history of malignancy.",,"['Nenova, Ivanka S', 'Karnolski, Istilian N', 'Mateva, Nonka G', 'Sotirova, Katya N']","['Nenova IS', 'Karnolski IN', 'Mateva NG', 'Sotirova KN']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital St George, Medical University, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Bulgaria,Folia Med (Plovdiv),Folia medica,2984761R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bulgaria/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Family Health', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2006/08/22 09:00,2006/09/22 09:00,['2006/08/22 09:00'],"['2006/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Med (Plovdiv). 2006;48(1):11-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-gp is an integral membrane protein which mediates ATP-dependent substrate efflux. We recently discovered a novel G --> T variant at 1199 nucleotide position of MDR1 which exhibits a 2.3% allelic frequency in leukemia patients. The functional effects of this MDR1-G1199T variant were evaluated with recombinant HEK cells that stably express the wild-type, G1199A, or G1199T variant of the MDR1 protein, P-gp, at comparable levels. A panel of cytotoxic P-gp substrates comprising doxorubicin, vinblastine, vincristine, paclitaxel, or topotecan (a poor P-gp substrate) was used to evaluate the functional impact of G1199 variations. Compared to MDR1(wt), MDR1(G1199A) exhibited an increased resistance to doxorubicin, paclitaxel, vinblastine, and vincristine. In contrast, MDR1(G1199T) reduced resistance to (1/4) that of MDR1(wt) for all drugs except topotecan. Expression of MDR1 exhibits some degree of resistance to topotecan, but 1199 variation has no impact. These data were consistent with the variation in intracellular doxorubicin concentrations measured in MDR1 recombinant cells. Our results suggest that patients with the novel MDR1-G1199T variant may exhibit a lower degree of MDR1 dependent chemoresistance, and those with the G1199A polymorphism may exhibit a higher degree of resistance, compared with MDR1 wild-type patients.","['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association']","['Crouthamel, Matthew H', 'Wu, Daniel', 'Yang, Ziping', 'Ho, Rodney J Y']","['Crouthamel MH', 'Wu D', 'Yang Z', 'Ho RJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism']",2006/08/19 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2006/08/19 09:00'],"['2006/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/jps.20743 [doi]', 'S0022-3549(16)32140-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 2006 Dec;95(12):2767-77. doi: 10.1002/jps.20743.,,,,"['AI52663/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM62883/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 39178/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treosulfan and busulfan reduced the growth of all tumor cell lines in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. In vitro treosulfan was consistently more cytotoxic than busulfan. Fifty percent growth inhibitions of 608-0.73 micromol/l were determined for treosulfan and of above 5,000-2.81 micromol/l for busulfan. Both drugs exhibited similar cytotoxicity profiles. Busulfan-sensitive/resistant cell lines were also sensitive/resistant to treosulfan. Overall, the leukemia cell lines were most sensitive to busulfan and treosulfan. The Ewing tumor cell lines were the second most sensitive followed by the neuroblastoma cell lines. The osteosarcoma cell lines were the most resistant cell lines. Although the in-vitro stability of both drugs makes direct comparison of their in-vitro toxicity difficult and does not allow any estimation of dosages needed clinically, the in-vitro results indicate substantial cytotoxicity of both drugs on leukemias, Ewing tumors and neuroblastomas. These data suggest further evaluation of treosulfan for high-dose chemotherapy of advanced Ewing tumors, neuroblastomas and high-risk leukemias.",,"['Lanvers-Kaminsky, Claudia', 'Bremer, Alexis', 'Dirksen, Uta', 'Jurgens, Heribert', 'Boos, Joachim']","['Lanvers-Kaminsky C', 'Bremer A', 'Dirksen U', 'Jurgens H', 'Boos J']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Munster, Germany. lanvers@uni-muenster.de""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'CO61ER3EPI (treosulfan)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*toxicity', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Busulfan/*analogs & derivatives/*toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2006/08/19 09:00,2007/01/20 09:00,['2006/08/19 09:00'],"['2006/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cad.0000215059.93437.89 [doi]', '00001813-200607000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2006 Jul;17(6):657-62. doi: 10.1097/01.cad.0000215059.93437.89.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity assay confirmed the high antiproliferative efficiency of MSFTZ in six leukemia cell lines (including two drug-resistant cell lines), with 50% inhibition of cell viability values ranging from 1.0 to 9.2 micromol/l. The results of flow cytometry assay showed that the percentage of apoptotic HL-60 cells was 68.3% after 48 h treatment with MSFTZ, suggesting that the activation of the apoptosis pathway was an anticancer property of MSFTZ. Furthermore, the protein changes related to apoptosis were investigated. Exposure of HL-60 cells to MSFTZ induced pro-caspase-9 and pro-caspase-3 cleavage, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and Bcl-X(L) downregulation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation. Treatment of cells with MSFTZ resulted in a time-dependent reduction in phosphorylation (activation) of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and an increase in phosphorylation (activation) of Jun N-terminal kinase. Taken together, our results demonstrated that activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and apoptotic cascade is involved in MSFTZ-induced antileukemia activity.

In nine samples (six chronic phase, three blast crisis), the drug sensitivities in tumor cells from blood versus from bone marrow and fresh tumor cells versus cryopreserved were compared. In 26 samples obtained in chronic phase (pretreatment), in six samples from patients in blast crisis and in the K 562 cell line, the activity of imatinib alone and in combination with cytarabine, vincristine, daunorubicin, interferon, arsenic trioxide and homoharringtonine was evaluated. All chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase samples were sensitive to imatinib, with a mean IC50 at 10.3 mumol/l. The chronic myeloid leukemia samples from blast crisis (n=6) were significantly more sensitive to imatinib than the samples from chronic phase (n=26) (P<0.05), with an IC50 mean at 0.4 mumol/l. In blast crisis samples, significant positive interaction effects were observed between imatinib and all other tested drugs except for interferon. In chronic phase samples, interferon, daunorubicin and arsenic trioxide were the drugs with the highest frequency of positive interactions with imatinib (P<0.05). We conclude that the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay may be a useful method for drug sensitivity testing in chronic myeloid leukemia patient samples from both chronic phase and blast crisis, and that testing primary tumor cells may have advantages over cell line studies. Imatinib shows a higher in vitro activity and more positive drug interactions in cells from blast crisis than chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Combinations between imatinib and interferon, daunorubicin and arsenic trioxide may be interesting for future clinical trials in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase.",,"['Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla', 'Aleskog, Anna', 'Bjornberg, Anneli', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Simonsson, Bengt', 'Bengtsson, Mats', 'Barbany, Gisela', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Lindhagen, Elin']","['Olsson-Stromberg U', 'Aleskog A', 'Bjornberg A', 'Hoglund M', 'Simonsson B', 'Bengtsson M', 'Barbany G', 'Larsson R', 'Lindhagen E']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. ulla.olsson.stromberg@akademiska.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Harringtonines/administration & dosage', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferons/administration & dosage', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2006/08/19 09:00,2007/01/20 09:00,['2006/08/19 09:00'],"['2006/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cad.0000217423.59831.db [doi]', '00001813-200607000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2006 Jul;17(6):631-9. doi: 10.1097/01.cad.0000217423.59831.db.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the years, many aspects of HTLV-1-induced cellular dysfunctions have been clarified. However, the detailed mechanism behind ATL occurrence remains unsolved. Presently, we are still unable to explain the absence of viral Tax protein (thought to play a central role in T-cell transformation) in more than 50% of ATL cells. A novel HTLV-1 HBZ protein, encoded on the negative strand, was characterized by our group and is currently the subject of intensive research efforts to determine its function in viral replication and/or pathophysiology. Recently, 4 studies reported on the existence of different HBZ isoforms and have investigated on their function in both ATL cells or animal models.

However, it is also expressed in subsets of lymphoblastic lymphoma, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and desmoplastic small round cell tumour (DSRCT). AIM: To determine expression of FLI-1 in various benign and malignant neoplasms, by immunohistochemical analysis on 4323 tumours using multiple tumour microarrays, as well as on whole sections. RESULTS: FLI-1 was expressed in 46/62 EWS/PNETs, 2/3 olfactory neuroblastomas, 7/102 small cell carcinomas of the lung, 10/34 MCCs, 1/14 rhabdomyosarcoma, 19/132 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 2/3 DSRCTs, and in 53/74 benign and malignant vascular tumours.

The sensitivity and specificity of FLI-1 to distinguish EWS/PNET from all types of malignancies were 74.2% and 96.0%, respectively. Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of FLI-1 to distinguish EWS/PNET from other small round cell tumours (SRCTs) were 74.2% and 91.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study was the first to show that FLI-1 can be seen in a variety of solid tumours, some of which had never been explored before. This finding should be kept in mind, especially when using FLI-1 as a marker for finding the primary origin of poorly differentiated metastatic tumour.

The expression of zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP70) is significantly associated with the more aggressive unmutated forms. AIMS: To assess the feasibility of the ZAP70 immunohistochemical test on bone-marrow biopsy (BMB) specimens and to compare the results with those of western blotting (WB) and IgV(H) mutational status assessed on neoplastic cells from peripheral blood. METHODS: 26 patients with CLL/SLL detected on BMB and with known IgV(H) mutational status were selected. ZAP70 was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) comparing three antibodies from different sources (Upstate, Cell Signaling, Santa Cruz, California, USA) and two different methods (APAAP and EnVision(+)). In 23 cases, ZAP70 WB results were also available. RESULTS: ZAP70 determination on BMB specimens turned out to be easily feasible with routine procedures with reagents from Upstate and Cell Signaling.

In this study, we report an unexpected role of TGIF in the inhibition of Smad2 phosphorylation, which occurs by a mechanism independent of its association with Smad2. This inhibitory function of TGIF is executed in concert with c-Jun, which facilitates the interaction of TGIF with cPML, resulting in the nuclear sequestration of cPML and the disruption of the cPML-SARA complex. Notably, knockdown of TGIF by siRNA caused increased association of cPML with SARA and cytoplasmic accumulation of cPML. Furthermore, c-Jun(-/-) fibroblasts exhibit enhanced association of cPML with SARA. c-Jun(-/-) fibroblasts also lose their sensitivity to TGIF-mediated disruption of the cPML-SARA complex and of nuclear sequestration of cPML.

Aim of this study was to evaluate whether TRAIL--in a soluble isoleucine zippered form--enhances the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on tumour cells with a blockade in the mitochondrial apoptosis route and/or a dysfunctional p53 pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The p53 mutant human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia line Jurkat transduced with the Bcl-2 gene was used as model system in vitro and in a subcutaneous transplant setting in immunodeficient mice. Sensitivity to single and combined treatment was read out by apoptosis hallmarks and clonogenic survival in vitro, and by bioluminescence and palpation in vivo. RESULTS: Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 did not undergo apoptosis after irradiation, but the combination with TRAIL synergistically induced apoptosis without breaking mitochondrial resistance. TRAIL also reduced clonogenic survival after irradiation. In vivo, radiotherapy or TRAIL alone delayed tumour outgrowth, but combination treatment had the most profound effect.

A logical and systematic approach to study co-expressed genes is to analyze their promoter sequences to identify transcription factors that may be involved in establishing specific profiles and that may be experimentally investigated. RESULTS: We introduce promoter clustering i.e. grouping of promoters with respect to their high scoring motif content, and show that this approach greatly enhances the identification of common and significant transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in co-expressed genes. We apply this method to two different dataset, one consisting of micro array data from 108 leukemias (AMLs) and a second from a time series experiment, and show that biologically relevant promoter patterns may be obtained using phylogenetic foot-printing methodology. In addition, we also found that 15% of the analyzed promoter regions contained transcription factors start sites for additional genes transcribed in the opposite direction. CONCLUSION: Promoter clustering based on global promoter features greatly improve the identification of shared TFBS in co-expressed genes.

However, it is not known whether neutrophil apoptosis is induced by live T. vaginalis. Therefore, we examined whether T. vaginalis can influence neutrophil apoptosis, and also whether caspase-3 and the Bcl-2 family members are involved in the apoptosis. Thus, human neutrophils were incubated with live T. vaginalis and neutrophil apoptosis was evaluated by Giemsa, annexin V-PI, and DiOC6 stainings. The neutrophil apoptosis was significantly higher in those incubated with T. vaginalis than in the control group. When trichomonads were pre-treated with mAb to AP65 (adhesin protein), or when trophozoites were separated from neutrophils using a Transwell chamber, neutrophil apoptosis was significantly reduced. The activation of caspase-3 was evident in neutrophils undergoing spontaneous apoptosis but was markedly enhanced during T. vaginalis-induced apoptosis.

Partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 16 is a cytogenetic abnormality first reported 20 years ago in patients with acute myeloid leukemia associated with bone marrow eosinophilia (AML-M4Eo). We report a case of a 45-year-old African-American male with hepatitis C and sustained peripheral blood eosinophilia who presented with gross hematuria, dyspnea on exertion, chills, decreased appetite and weight loss of 40 pounds associated with hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow biopsy showed clonal cytogenetic abnormality consisting of deletion of the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q22). Philadelphia chromosome t (9;22) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for C-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA) mutations were negative. The patient was treated with imatinib at 400 mg/d with improvement of symptoms, reduction of lymphadenopathy and normalization of the eosinophil count.

The term 'resistance' is used to denote the capacity of an animal to defend itself against disease or to withstand the effects of a harmful environmental agent. The Ovar-Mhc is poorly characterised when compared to MHCs of other domestic animals. However, its basic structure is similar to that of other animals, comprising Class I, II and III regions. Products of the Class I and II genes, the histocompatibility molecules, are of paramount importance as these present antigens to T-lymphocytes, thereby eliciting immune responses. Several studies have been conducted in sheep on the involvement of MHC genes/antigens in genetic resistance to diseases, the majority being concerned with gastrointestinal nematodes. Studies on resistance to footrot, Johne's disease and bovine leukaemia virus (BLV)-induced leukaemogenesis have also been reported. Genes of all three regions were implicated in the disease association studies. In addition to disease resistance, Ovar-Mhc genes have been found to be associated with traits such as marbling and birthweight. The use of genetic markers from within the Ovar-Mhc may be useful, via marker-assisted selection, for increasing resistance to various diseases provided they do not impact negatively on other economically-important traits.

The tumour-suppressive function of PML has been attributed to its ability to induce growth arrest, cellular senescence and apoptosis. Here we identify PML as a critical inhibitor of neoangiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) in vivo, in both ischaemic and neoplastic conditions, through the control of protein translation. We demonstrate that in hypoxic conditions PML acts as a negative regulator of the synthesis rate of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) by repressing mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). PML physically interacts with mTOR and negatively regulates its association with the small GTPase Rheb by favouring mTOR nuclear accumulation. Notably, Pml-/- cells and tumours display higher sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo to growth inhibition by rapamycin, and lack of PML inversely correlates with phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and tumour angiogenesis in mouse and human tumours.

We describe a 50-year-old male patient who had originally presented with pancytopenia in October 1992. The diagnosis of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) FAB subtype RAEB-t was established in April 1993 by histological bone marrow (BM) examination, and therapy with low-dose cytosine arabinoside was initiated. In a phase of partial hematological remission, cytogenetic assessment in August 1993 revealed a ring chromosome 1 in 13 of 21 metaphases beside BM cells with normal karyotypes [46,XY,r(1)(p35q31)/46,XY]. One month later, the patient progressed to an acute myeloid leukemia (AML), subtype M4 with 40% BM blasts and cytogenetic examination showed clonal evolution by the appearance of additional numerical aberrations in addition to the ring chromosome [46,XY,r(1),+8,-21/45,XY,r(1),+8,-21,-22/46, XY]. Intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy was applied to induce remission in preparation for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from the patient's HLA-compatible son. After BMT, complete remission was clinically, hematologically and cytogenetically (normal male karyotype) confirmed. A complete hematopoietic chimerism was demonstrated. A relapse in January 1997 was successfully treated using donor lymphocyte infusion and donor peripheral blood stem cells (PB-SC) in combination with GM-CSF as immunostimulating agent in April 1997, and the patient's clinical condition remained stable as of January 2005.

The N-terminal portion of E2A-PBX1, encoded by the E2A gene, is identical in sequence to the corresponding portion of the E proteins E12/E47 and includes transcriptional activation domains. The C terminus consists of most of the HOX interacting transcription factor PBX1, including its DNA-binding homeodomain. Structure-function correlative experiments have suggested that oncogenesis by E2A-PBX1 requires an activation domain, called AD1, at the extreme N terminus. We recently demonstrated that a potentially helical portion of AD1 interacts directly with the transcriptional coactivator protein cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CBP) and that this interaction is essential in the immortalization of primary bone marrow cells in tissue culture. Here we show that a conserved LXXLL motif within AD1 is required in the interaction between E2A-PBX1 and the KIX domain of CBP. We show by circular dichroism spectroscopy that the LXXLL-containing portion of AD1 undergoes a helical transition upon interacting with the KIX domain and that amino acid substitutions that prevent helix formation prevent both the KIX interaction and cell immortalization by E2A-PBX1. Perhaps most strikingly, substitution of a single, conserved leucine residue (L20) within the LXXLL motif impairs leukemia induction in mice after transplantation with E2A-PBX1-expressing bone marrow. The KIX domain of CBP mediates well-characterized interactions with several transcription factors of relevance to leukemia induction. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the side chain of L20 might interact with a deep hydrophobic pocket in the KIX domain.

Consistent with this, we previously demonstrated that ICSBP activates transcription of the gene encoding Nf1 (the NF1 gene). In the studies presented here, we determine that ICSBP tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for the activation of NF1 transcription. Since ICSBP is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to hematopoietic cytokines, these studies identify a novel pathway by which cytokine-induced posttranslational modification of ICSBP results in NF1 transcription. Nf1 subsequently inactivates cytokine-activated Ras, thereby creating a negative feedback mechanism for cytokine-induced proliferation. In these studies, we also determine that ICSBP is a substrate for SHP2 protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2-PTP). We find that wild-type SHP2-PTP dephosphorylates ICSBP only in undifferentiated myeloid cells. In contrast, a leukemia-associated, constitutively activated mutant form of SHP2-PTP dephosphorylates ICSBP in both myeloid progenitors and differentiating myeloid cells. Activated SHP2-PTP mutants thereby inhibit ICSBP-dependent NF1 transcription, impairing this negative feedback mechanism on cytokine-activated Ras. Therefore, these studies suggest that leukemia-associated ICSBP deficiency cooperates with leukemia-associated activating mutants of SHP2-PTP to contribute to the proliferative phenotype in myeloid malignancies.",,"['Huang, Weiqi', 'Saberwal, Gurveen', 'Horvath, Elizabeth', 'Zhu, Chunliu', 'Lindsey, Stephan', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Huang W', 'Saberwal G', 'Horvath E', 'Zhu C', 'Lindsey S', 'Eklund EA']","['Feinberg School of Medicine, 710 North Fairbanks Court, Olson Pavilion Room 8524, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Glutamine/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Lysine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutant Proteins/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Neurofibromin 1/*genetics', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/*genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2006/08/18 09:00,2006/09/26 09:00,['2006/08/18 09:00'],"['2006/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/17/6311 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00036-06 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2006 Sep;26(17):6311-32. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00036-06.,,,,,PMC1592828,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phase II: To determine the therapeutic efficacy of imatinib. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Phase I component used an interpatient dose escalation scheme. End points of the phase II component were 6-month progression-free survival and response. RESULTS: Fifty patients enrolled in the phase I component (27 EIAED and 23 non-EIAED). The maximum tolerated dose for non-EIAED patients was 800 mg/d. Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia, rash, and elevated alanine aminotransferase. EIAED patients received up to 1,200 mg/d imatinib without developing dose-limiting toxicity. Plasma exposure of imatinib was reduced by approximately 68% in EIAED patients compared with non-EIAED patients. Fifty-five non-EIAED patients (34 glioblastoma multiforme and 21 anaplastic glioma) enrolled in the phase II component. Patients initially received 800 mg/d imatinib; 15 anaplastic glioma patients received 600 mg/d after hemorrhages were observed. There were 2 partial response and 6 stable disease among glioblastoma multiforme patients and 0 partial response and 5 stable disease among anaplastic glioma patients. Six-month progression-free survival was 3% for glioblastoma multiforme and 10% for anaplastic glioma patients. Five phase II patients developed intratumoral hemorrhages. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent imatinib has minimal activity in malignant gliomas. CYP3A4 inducers, such as EIAEDs, substantially decreased plasma exposure of imatinib and should be avoided in patients receiving imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Methylation-specific PCR was used to analyze the methylation status of 38 genes involved in cell immortalization and transformation in 54 ETV6/RUNX1-positive samples in comparison with 190 ETV6/RUNX1-negative samples. RESULTS: ETV6/RUNX1-positive samples had at least one gene methylated in 89% of the cases. According to the number of methylated genes observed in each individual sample, 20 patients (37%) were included in the CIMP- group (0-2 methylated genes) and 34 (67%) in the CIMP+ group (>2 methylated genes). Remission rate did not differ significantly among either group of patients. Estimated disease-free survival and overall survival at 9 years were 92% and 100% for the CIMP- group and 33% and 73% for the CIMP+ group (P = 0.002 and P = 0.04, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that methylation profile was an independent prognostic factor in predicting disease-free survival (P = 0.01) and overall survival (P = 0.05). A group of four genes (DKK3, sFRP2, PTEN, and P73) showed specificity for ETV6/RUNX1-positive subset of samples.

Here, we report that knockdown of the Kruppel-like transcription factor ZBP-89 in zebrafish embryos results in a bloodless phenotype, caused by disruption of both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis, while leaving primary blood vessel formation intact. Injection of ZBP-89 mRNA into cloche zebrafish embryos, which lack both the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages, rescues hematopoiesis but not vasculogenesis. Injection of mRNA for Stem Cell Leukemia (SCL), a transcription factor that directs hemangioblast development into blood cell precursors, rescues the bloodless phenotype in ZBP-89 zebrafish morphants. Forced expression of ZBP-89 induces the expansion of hematopoietic progenitors in wild-type zebrafish and in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures but inhibits angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical aspects of the oral mucosa of children with ALL and to determine the effect of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate on the prevention of stomatologic complications in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three children treated for ALL ranging in age from 2 to 15 years, without distinction of gender or race, were submitted to visual examination, digital palpation of the oral mucosa and cytologic examination of the buccal mucosa, and divided into two groups: group I consisted of 23 children using an oral solution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate twice a day, and group II consisted of 10 children who did not receive this solution. All children received daily oral hygiene care guided by the dentist throughout treatment. RESULTS: Mucositis was observed in six children of group I and eight of group II, and was characterized by erythema, edema and ulcers. Uniform cytologic findings were obtained for the two groups, with a clear predominance of cells of the intermediate layer in all smears, in addition to a perinuclear halo in 18% of the smears.

The aim of this study is to determine the frequency and the clinical importance of PRAME expression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)/chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). PRAME mRNA was measured by real time RT-PCR in 88 cases with chronic leukemia (CL) and 42 controls. Seventy cases had CML/CMPD (56 had chronic phase (CP)-14 had accelerated/blastic phase disease (AP/BP) and 18 cases had CLL (11 had early stage (Rai 0-I-II) and 7 had late stage (Rai III-IV). Mann Whitney U, Wilcoxon and Kruskal Wallis tests were used for statistical analyses. Twenty-four of 70 (34%) cases with CML/CMPD and 5 of 18 (28%) cases with CLL showed PRAME expression. Totally 29 of 88 cases showed PRAME expression (33%). However, only two controls showed weak PRAME expression. The difference for PRAME mRNA between the CLs and controls was significant (p = 0.000). PRAME (+) and PRAME (-) cases were not different for age, Hb, Hct, WBC count, platelet count, stage of the disease and response to therapy. PRAME was monitorised in eight cases during follow-up: in three cases PRAME was negative at CP and expression developed at the AP/BP disease. PRAME was positive at the beginning in five cases (4 CML-1CLL) and expression disappeared after chemotherapy. In conclusion, PRAME is detected in one third of the cases with CLs.

In order to identify genes which are regulated by CNTF in the developing retina, we carried out a subtractive hybridization study. By this approach, we identified the Pleiotrophin (Ptn) as an upregulated gene in postnatal day 0 (P0) retinal explants upon addition of CNTF. Correlation of overall expression patterns between different retinal cell markers and Ptn in situ hybridization suggest that Ptn transcripts are initially expressed in progenitor cells then in postmitotic precursors of the INL expressing the Chx10 gene, and later in some differentiated retinal Muller glial (RMG) cells and rod-bipolar cells. Overexpression of Ptn by in vitro electroporation of P0 rat retinal explants partially blocks rod differentiation and promotes bipolar cell production, similar to effects of exogenous CNTF and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Furthermore, in P0 retinal explants from mice lacking Ptn, the inhibitory effect of CNTF and LIF on rod differentiation is partially reduced and the cytokine-induced bipolar cell differentiation is largely prevented. Together, these results demonstrate that influence of CNTF family of cytokines on the differentiation of late retinal progenitor cell population is partially mediated by the release of Ptn.",,"['Roger, Jerome', 'Brajeul, Valerie', 'Thomasseau, Sylvie', 'Hienola, Anni', 'Sahel, Jose-Alain', 'Guillonneau, Xavier', 'Goureau, Olivier']","['Roger J', 'Brajeul V', 'Thomasseau S', 'Hienola A', 'Sahel JA', 'Guillonneau X', 'Goureau O']","['Laboratoire de Physiopathologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire de la Retine, UMR S 592 INSERM, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris6, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '134034-50-7 (pleiotrophin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retina/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/08/18 09:00,2006/12/12 09:00,['2006/08/18 09:00'],"['2006/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2006/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-1606(06)00984-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.07.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2006 Oct 15;298(2):527-39. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.07.003.

We previously demonstrated that interferon type I (alpha/beta) and II (gamma) inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-9 (92kDa) gene expression on lymphocytes from patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia and human monocytes. Since all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can regulate some interferon -responsive genes, we studied here the effects of all-trans retinoic acid onto matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels in these cells. By using RT-PCR, ELISA and zymography experiments, we showed that all-trans retinoic acid down-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 synthesis (mRNA,protein) and secretion. The inhibitory action of all-trans retinoic acid toward matrix metalloproteinase-9 was however not associated with the STAT1/IRF-1 pathway involved in interferon-mediated matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibition indicating that all-trans retinoic acid did not bypass IFN receptor signaling. Using flow cytometry, we detected on the surface of monocytes low expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and Fc-gammaRI, and high expression of HLA-DR, beta1 and beta2 integrins. Enhancement of Fc-gammaRI and HLA-DR on monocytes by interferon-gamma, but not by all-trans retinoic acid, was accompanied by up-regulation of surface matrix metalloproteinase-9. Furthermore, we showed that all-trans retinoic acid down-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in lymphocytes of untreated patients with early stage B chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Together, our data suggest the potential relevance of all-trans retinoic acid as a pharmacological tool to attenuate matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion in pathological situations.",,"['Nguyen, J', 'Dumont, J', 'Bauvois, B']","['Nguyen J', 'Dumont J', 'Bauvois B']","['INSERM 507, Hopital Necker Batiment Lavoisier 161 rue de Sevres, 75015 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2006/08/18 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/08/18 09:00'],"['2005/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['51 [pii]'],epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2006 May 15;52(1):51-8.,20060515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFNgamma treatment of cells leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 followed by dimerization that accumulates in the nucleus. This is followed by DNA binding, activation of target gene transcription, dephosphorylation, and return to the cytoplasm. We have shown earlier that IFNgamma and As2O3 act synergistically in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells to upregulate IRF-1 expression and to induce apoptosis. Here, we show that in the human fibrosarcoma cell line 2fTGH, As2O3 prolongs IFNgamma-induced STAT1 phosphorylation resulting in persistent binding of STAT1 to GAS motif leading to an increase in IRF-1 expression which correlated with both higher anti-proliferative effect and increased apoptosis.

One 3-week course of treatment consisted of intravenous vinorelbine on Days 1 and 8 and oral capecitabine on Days 1 to 14, followed by a one-week rest. Vinorelbine was given at 20 mg/m(2) (Level 1) and 25 mg/m(2) (Level 2), and capecitabine was given at 1,650 mg/m(2)/day (in two divided doses, Levels 1 - 2).

PML, the NBs' organizer, is directly induced by interferon, and its expression is critical for antiviral host defense. We describe herein the molecular events following poliovirus infection that lead to PML-dependent p53 activation and protection against virus infection. Poliovirus infection induces PML phosphorylation through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, increases PML SUMOylation, and induces its transfer from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear matrix. These events result in the recruitment of p53 to PML NBs, p53 phosphorylation on Ser15, and activation of p53 target genes leading to the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, the knock-down of p53 by small interfering RNA results in higher poliovirus replication, suggesting that p53 participates in antiviral defense. This effect, which requires the presence of PML, is transient since poliovirus targets p53 by inducing its degradation in a proteasome- and MDM2-dependent manner. Our results provide evidence of how poliovirus counteracts p53 antiviral activity by regulating PML and NBs, thus leading to p53 degradation.",,"['Pampin, Mathieu', 'Simonin, Yannick', 'Blondel, Bruno', 'Percherancier, Yann', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K']","['Pampin M', 'Simonin Y', 'Blondel B', 'Percherancier Y', 'Chelbi-Alix MK']","['CNRS FRE 2944, Institut Lwoff, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Organelles/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poliovirus/*pathogenicity', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2006/08/17 09:00,2006/09/26 09:00,['2006/08/17 09:00'],"['2006/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/17/8582 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00031-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Sep;80(17):8582-92. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00031-06.,,,,,PMC1563870,,,,,,,,,,,,

TRIM5alpha consists of a tripartite motif (the RBCC domain) followed by a B30.2 domain. The B30.2 domain is thought to be involved in determination of restriction specificity and contains three variable regions. To investigate the relationship between the phylogeny of primate TRIM5alpha and retrovirus restriction specificity, a series of chimeric TRIM5alpha consisting of the human RBCC domain followed by the B30.2 domain from various primates was constructed. These constructs showed restriction profiles largely consistent with the origin of the B30.2 domain. Restriction specificity was further investigated with a variety of TRIM5alphas containing mixed or mutated B30.2 domains. This study revealed the importance of all three variable regions for determining restriction specificity. Based on the molecular structures of other PRYSPRY domains solved recently, a model for the molecular structure of the B30.2 domain of TRIM5alpha was developed. The model revealed that the variable regions of the B30.2 domain are present as loops located on one side of the B30.2 core structure.

The 1.6-Angstroms resolution structure resembles the known structures of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Escherichia coli RNase H. The structure revealed the coordination of a magnesium ion within the catalytic core comprised of the highly conserved acidic residues D524, E562, and D583. Surface charge mapping of the Mo-MLV structure revealed a high density of basic charges on one side of the enzyme. Using a model of the Mo-MLV structure superimposed upon a structure of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase bound to an RNA/DNA hybrid substrate, Mo-MLV RNase H secondary structures and individual amino acids were examined for their potential roles in binding substrate. Identified regions included Mo-MLV RNase H beta1-beta2, alphaA, and alphaB and residues from alphaB to alphaD and its following loop. Most of the identified substrate-binding residues corresponded with residues directly binding nucleotides in an RNase H from Bacillus halodurans as observed in a cocrystal structure with RNA/DNA. Finally, superimposition of RNases H of Mo-MLV, E. coli, and HIV-1 revealed that a loop of the HIV-1 connection domain resides within the same region of the Mo-MLV and E. coli C-helix.

In primary CD4(+) T cells, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are required for efficient entry of HTLV-1. Here, the roles of HSPGs and GLUT-1 in HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 Env-mediated binding and entry into primary T cells were studied. Examination of the cell surface of activated primary T cells revealed that CD4(+) T cells, the primary target of HTLV-1, expressed significantly higher levels of HSPGs than CD8(+) T cells. Conversely, CD8(+) T cells, the primary target of HTLV-2, expressed GLUT-1 at dramatically higher levels than CD4(+) T cells. Under these conditions, the HTLV-2 surface glycoprotein (SU) binding and viral entry were markedly higher on CD8(+) T cells while HTLV-1 SU binding and viral entry were higher on CD4(+) T cells. Binding studies with HTLV-1/HTLV-2 SU recombinants showed that preferential binding to CD4(+) T cells expressing high levels of HSPGs mapped to the C-terminal portion of SU. Transfection studies revealed that overexpression of GLUT-1 in CD4(+) T cells increased HTLV-2 entry, while expression of HSPGs on CD8(+) T cells increased entry of HTLV-1. These studies demonstrate that HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 differ in their T-cell entry requirements and suggest that the differences in the in vitro cellular tropism for transformation and in vivo pathobiology of these viruses reflect different interactions between their Env proteins and molecules on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells involved in entry.",,"['Jones, Kathryn S', 'Fugo, Kazunori', 'Petrow-Sadowski, Cari', 'Huang, Ying', 'Bertolette, Daniel C', 'Lisinski, Ivonne', 'Cushman, Samuel W', 'Jacobson, Steven', 'Ruscetti, Francis W']","['Jones KS', 'Fugo K', 'Petrow-Sadowski C', 'Huang Y', 'Bertolette DC', 'Lisinski I', 'Cushman SW', 'Jacobson S', 'Ruscetti FW']","['Basic Research Program, SAIC-Frederick, Inc., National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA. joneska@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'CHO Cells', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/*metabolism', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology']",2006/08/17 09:00,2006/09/26 09:00,['2006/08/17 09:00'],"['2006/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/17/8291 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00389-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Sep;80(17):8291-302. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00389-06.,,,,"['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1563841,,,,,,,,,,,,

SLP-65 controls not only B lymphopoiesis and humoral immunity but also possesses a yet poorly defined tumor suppressor activity that is lost in many cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We found that the 2 isoforms of human SLP-65 are differentially involved in positive and negative B-cell signaling. Reconstitution experiments revealed that an atypical SH3 domain-binding motif, which is present in the long but not in the short SLP-65 isoform, mediates association to Grb2 and suppresses activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and JNK as well as up-regulation of c-Fos expression.

Whereas KIT juxtamembrane domain mutations seen in most patients with GIST are highly sensitive to imatinib, the kinase activation loop mutant D816V, frequently encountered in SM, hampers the binding ability of imatinib. We investigated the inhibitory activity of the novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor EXEL-0862 against 2 subclones of human mast cell line-1 (HMC-1)-HMC-1.1, harboring the juxtamembrane domain mutation V560G, and HMC-1.2, carrying V560G and the activation loop mutation D816V, found in more than 80% of patients with SM. EXEL-0862 inhibited the phosphorylation of KIT in a dose-dependent manner and decreased cell proliferation in both mast cell lines with higher activity against HMC-1.2 cells. The phosphorylation of KIT-dependent signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) and STAT5 was abrogated upon exposure to nanomolar concentrations of EXEL-0862. In addition, EXEL-0862 induced a time- and dose-dependent proapoptotic effect in both mast cell lines and caused a significant reduction in mast-cell content in bone marrow samples from patients with SM harboring D816V and from those without the D816V mutation.

Recently, it has been shown in a mouse model that the fusion protein MN1-TEL can promote growth of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and, in cooperation with HOXA9, induce AML. We quantified MN1 expression by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 142 adult patients with AML with normal cytogenetics treated uniformly in trial AML-SHG 01/99. AML samples were dichotomized at the median MN1 expression.

In multivariate analysis, MN1 expression was an independent prognostic marker (P = .02) in addition to age and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Excluding patients with NPM1(mutated)/FLT3ITD(negative), high MN1 expression was associated with shorter relapse-free survival (P = .057). MN1 was highly expressed in some patients with acute lymphoblastic but not chronic lymphocytic or myeloid leukemia.

However, the mechanism that contributes to its regulation in B lymphomas remains unknown. This study shows that in follicular lymphoma (FL) cells, mTOR is active because the cells displayed rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and 4E-BP1. Moreover, immunohistochemistry applied on lymph node tissue sections obtained from patients with FL revealed that, in most cases, p70S6 kinase was highly phosphorylated compared to normal tonsillar tissue. In FL cells, mTOR was under control of both phospholipase D (PLD) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Moreover, we demonstrated that Syk plays a central role in mTOR activation because we found that both expression and activity are elevated compared to normal or chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells. We also provide evidence that Syk operates through PLD- and PI3K-independent pathways. Finally, Syk inhibition by piceatannol or by siRNA plasmids resulted in a potent inhibition of mTOR activity in FL cells, as well as in mantle cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Recently, we observed that inhibition of myeloid Src family kinase activity (e.g. Hck, Lyn, and Fyn) induces growth arrest and apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells, suggesting that cell transformation by Bcr-Abl involves Src family kinases (Wilson, M. B., Schreiner, S. J., Choi, H. J., Kamens, J., and Smithgall, T. E. (2002) Oncogene 21, 8075-8088). Here, we report the unexpected observation that Hck, Lyn, and Fyn strongly phosphorylate the SH3-SH2 region of Bcr-Abl. Seven phosphorylation sites were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry: Tyr89 and Tyr134 in the Abl-derived SH3 domain; Tyr147 in the SH3-SH2 connector; and Tyr158, Tyr191, Tyr204, and Tyr234 in the SH2 domain. SH3 domain Tyr89, the most prominent phosphorylation site in vitro, was strongly phosphorylated in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in a Src family kinase-dependent manner. Substitution of the SH3-SH2 tyrosine phosphorylation sites with phenylalanine substantially reduced Bcr-Abl-mediated transformation of TF-1 myeloid cells to cytokine independence.

Diagnosis of leukemia was based on clinical presentation, peripheral blood smear and bone marrow examination (as per FAB classification). PK activity was significantly high in case of CML and blastic CML (p<0.01). Red cell HK was high in all leukemia subtypes. There was no alteration in red cell G6PD. Notably there was no PK deficiency in AML or G6PD deficiency in ALL. Activities of G6PD and PK could be correlated in cases of CML, AML, (p<0.05) and ALL (p<0.01) i.e. when there was increased activity of G6PD, PK activity also tended to be higher. HK activity showed a positive correlation with PK and G6PD activity in cases of CML (p<0.05), however in acute leukemia there was no such correlation. Alteration of enzyme activities among red cells in leukemia occurred only during relapse. At the time of remission there has been no significant alteration in any of the enzyme activities. It would therefore, appear that enzyme alterations seen in leukemia patients is due to abnormal pluripotent stem cell that has given to a leukemia cell. The fact that enzyme alterations have primarily occurred at the time of relapse would further substantiate that abnormalities of red cell enzymes may be the result of a derivation some circulating red cells from the abnormal pluripotent stem cell.

METHODS: Eligibility included a Zubrod performance status from 0 to 2, no prior gemcitabine or fluoropyrimidine therapy, and normal organ function. Patients received gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 and capecitabine at a dose of 830 mg/m2 twice daily on Days 1 through 21 on a 28-day cycle with specified dose reductions for baseline renal insufficiency. The primary endpoint was the response rate, which was assessed every 8 weeks. The statistical plan tested the hypothesis that the response rate was 5% versus an alternative of 15%. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled, and 4 of those patients never started treatment. Of the 56 evaluable patients, 79% of patients underwent prior nephrectomy, 75% of patients received prior systemic therapy, and 75% of patients had clear cell histology. Risk stratification revealed that 34%, 43%, and 16% of patients were in Risk Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Toxicity (graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]) included Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in 45% of patients, Grade 2 or greater fatigue in 32% of patients, Grade 2 or greater nausea in 29% of patients, Grade 2 or greater hand-foot reaction in 39% of patients, and Grade 2 or greater diarrhea in 22% of patients. Six patients responded (11%; 95% confidence interval, 4-22%), and the overall median survival was 14.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine plus capecitabine had modest activity in patients with metastatic renal cancer, although the degree of activity and its associated toxicity would not support further evaluation in a Phase III trial of unselected patients.

The prescribing, dispensing, and parental administration of these medications to children receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were systematically reviewed to determine the rate and types of medication errors occurring in these patients. METHODS: During a 2-month study period, parents of children with ALL were contacted and asked to participate in the study before a regularly scheduled clinic appointment. At the visit, the parent demonstrated how each medication was administered. A pediatric oncologist reviewed the medical record to determine the correct treatment regimen for study patients. After comparing the correct treatment regimen with what was administered, a classification of ""no medication error,"" ""medication error,"" or ""cannot determine"" due to insufficient information was made for each indicated drug. Identified medication errors were subclassified as prescribing, dispensing, or administration errors. RESULTS: Data on 172 chemotherapeutic medications for 69 patients were analyzed. One or more errors occurred with 17 of the 172 (9.9%) medications; a classification of ""cannot determine"" was made for 12 (7.0%) medications. Among the 17 medication errors there were 12 (7.0%) administration errors and 5 (2.9%) prescribing errors. There were no pharmacy dispensing errors. All errors were due to incorrect dosing or failure to administer an indicated medication. At least 1 medication error occurred in 13 of the 69 (18.8%) study patients.

The v-Myb protein is nuclear and binds to specific DNA sequences. To identify genes regulated by v-Myb, we utilized primary cells transformed by a retrovirus encoding a v-Myb-estrogen receptor (ER) fusion protein. The Ets-2 gene was not expressed in v-Myb-ER transformed cells in the presence of estradiol, but was expressed within 4 h after estradiol withdrawal. The expression of Ets-2 also increased dramatically following phorbol ester-induced differentiation of the v-Myb-transformed BM2 cell line. Conversely, CRYP-alpha, encoding a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, was expressed in the presence but not the absence of estradiol in v-Myb-ER transformed cells. CRYP-alpha was downregulated during the phorbol ester-induced differentiation of BM2 cells. Although LIM-3 expression was estradiol-inducible in v-Myb-ER transformed monoblasts, LIM-3 was expressed neither in primary yolk sac cells transformed by unfused v-Myb nor in BM2 cells. We conclude that although v-Myb has been intensively studied as a transcriptional activator, v-Myb can repress biologically relevant genes such as Ets-2, which promotes macrophage differentiation.

Here, we show that this inhibitory effect takes place at the nuclear level and maps to the N-terminal 1-321 region of CIITA, where we identified a minimal domain, from positions 64-144, that is strictly required to suppress Tax-2 function. Furthermore, we show that Tax-2 specifically cooperates with cAMP response element binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300, but not with p300/CBP-associated factor, to enhance transcription from the viral promoter. This finding represents a unique difference with respect to Tax-1, which uses all three coactivators to transactivate the human T cell leukemia virus type 1 LTR. Direct sequestering of CBP or p300 is not the primary mechanism by which CIITA causes suppression of Tax-2. Interestingly, we found that the transcription factor nuclear factor Y, which interacts with CIITA to increase transcription of MHC-II genes, exerts a negative regulatory action on the Tax-2-mediated HTLV-2 LTR transactivation. Thus, CIITA may inhibit Tax-2 function, at least in part, through nuclear factor Y.

In the current study, we investigated the effect of THC on the upstream and downstream events that modulate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) module of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways primarily in human Jurkat leukemia T cells. The data showed that THC down-regulated Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK/RSK pathway leading to translocation of Bad to mitochondria. THC also decreased the phosphorylation of Akt. However, no significant association of Bad translocation with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and protein kinase A signaling pathways was noted when treated cells were examined in relation to phosphorylation status of Bad by Western blot and localization of Bad to mitochondria by confocal analysis. Furthermore, THC treatment decreased the Bad phosphorylation at Ser(112) but failed to alter the level of phospho-Bad on site Ser(136) that has been reported to be associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signal pathway. Jurkat cells expressing a constitutively active MEK construct were found to be resistant to THC-mediated apoptosis and failed to exhibit decreased phospho-Bad on Ser(112) as well as Bad translocation to mitochondria. Finally, use of Bad small interfering RNA reduced the expression of Bad in Jurkat cells leading to increased resistance to THC-mediated apoptosis. Together, these data suggested that Raf-1/MEK/ERK/RSK-mediated Bad translocation played a critical role in THC-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells.",,"['Jia, Wentao', 'Hegde, Venkatesh L', 'Singh, Narendra P', 'Sisco, Daniel', 'Grant, Steven', 'Nagarkatti, Mitzi', 'Nagarkatti, Prakash S']","['Jia W', 'Hegde VL', 'Singh NP', 'Sisco D', 'Grant S', 'Nagarkatti M', 'Nagarkatti PS']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Virginia Campus, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '7J8897W37S (Dronabinol)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Dronabinol/*pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/*metabolism/physiology']",2006/08/16 09:00,2006/10/13 09:00,['2006/08/16 09:00'],"['2006/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/8/549 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0193 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2006 Aug;4(8):549-62. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0193.,,,,"['P30CA16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI053703/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI058300/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DA016545/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES09098/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL058641/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21DA014885/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Nanog repression occurs at the outermost layer of ES cell aggregates independent of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/STAT3 pathway, it is largely undetermined what external cues and intracellular signals cause the event. Of interest, addition of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium vanadate, selectively repressed Nanog transcription without any detectable changes in upstream transcriptional regulators Oct3/4 and Sox2. Furthermore, sodium vanadate induced primitive endoderm differentiation, even in the inner cells of ES cell aggregates. Expression of Gata6 and Zfp42, two putative downstream Nanog effectors, was also increased and decreased by the addition of sodium vanadate, respectively, but these changes were eliminated by exogenous Nanog expression. The effects of sodium vanadate were abrogated by Grb2 deficiency or by the addition of the Mek inhibitor, PD98059. Indeed, PD98059 prevented Nanog repression induced by ES cell aggregation as well. Furthermore, transfection of a constitutive active Mek mutant into ES cells induced Nanog repression and primitive endoderm differentiation.

Although the skin is characteristically involved, it is not a well-recognized entity in the dermatologic literature. METHODS: Six cases of cutaneous T-PLL are presented from a clinical, light microscopic, and phenotypic perspective. RESULTS: The patient population comprised 2 women and 4 men, with a mean age of 69.8 years. The disease was associated in all with skin involvement with facial preference; edema, purpura, and lesional symmetry were characteristic. The skin biopsies demonstrated a largely non-epidermotropic angiocentric lymphocytic infiltrate with accompanying hemorrhage. The cells showed irregular- to reniform-shaped nuclei with small nucleoli and eosinophilic rims of cytoplasm. Phenotypic studies revealed three prevailing profiles: CD4 dominant in 4, CD8 dominant in one, and co-expression of CD4 and CD8 in one. CD3 loss was seen in one case. All expressed T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL-1) and CD7; cutaneous lymphocyte antigen expression was discernible in a dot-like perinuclear array. All cases tested excluding one expressed TCL-1 and CD52. In two cases tested, T-cell receptor beta rearrangements were observed. Cytogenetic studies demonstrated a paracentromeric chromosome 14 inversion. Polysomy 8 and MYC amplification was seen in one case, manifesting an aggressive clinical course. Four patients died from their disease within 18 months of diagnosis. LIMITATIONS: Cytogenetic MYC amplification, FISH, and TCR beta studies were conducted on each of 2 cases, respectively, due to limitations of tissue block samples and/or peripheral blood. cMYC translocation studies were conducted on 3 of the 6 cases, again due to limitations imposed by the tissue samples on the cases. The last case was recently diagnosed and, therefore, long-term follow-up is not possible. CONCLUSION: T-PLL is a distinctive post-thymic T-cell malignancy with frequent cutaneous tropism. A diagnosis is possible in almost all cases based on characteristic clinical, light microscopic, phenotypic, and cytogenetic features. While a chromosome 14 inversion is highly characteristic, additional inherent cytogenetic differences, such as trisomy 8 with CMYC over-amplification, may account for some case to case variation in clinical course.",,"['Magro, Cynthia M', 'Morrison, Carl D', 'Heerema, Nyla', 'Porcu, Pierluigi', 'Sroa, Novie', 'Deng, April C']","['Magro CM', 'Morrison CD', 'Heerema N', 'Porcu P', 'Sroa N', 'Deng AC']","['Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Face', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/genetics/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Skin/*pathology']",2006/08/16 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2006/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0190-9622(06)01240-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaad.2006.04.060 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2006 Sep;55(3):467-77. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2006.04.060.,,['J Am Acad Dermatol. 2007 Sep;57(3):533-4.

In 34 cases CCyR was obtained at an Imatinib dose of 400-600 mg/day and in 6 cases after a dose increase to 600-800 mg/day. At a median follow-up of 68 months, 6 cytogenetic relapses (15%) were observed. No progressions to more advanced phases of disease have been detected during the follow-up period. Cytogenetic relapse was predicted by either a decrease in the amount of BCR-ABL transcript of less than 2 logs after the achievement of CCyR (p=0.0041) or a time-to-CCyR of more than 12 months (p<0.0001).

The World Health Organization (WHO) suggested immunophenotype for pre-T ALL/LBL typically includes the expression of TdT, cCD3, and CD7, while CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, and CD10 are variably expressed. The myeloid antigens CD13 and CD33 are usually positive, whereas CD117 and cCD79a are infrequently expressed. Furthermore, there is frequent dual expression of CD4 and CD8. In the present investigation, 19 cases of pre-TALL/LBL were analyzed for selected CD marker expression. Fifteen of 19 cases studied were evaluated for TdT, cCD3, and cCD79a expression.

Of the 17 cases analyzed for CD7, CD5, and CD10 expression, CD7 and CD5 were positive in all 17 (100%) cases, whereas CD10 was positive in 8 (47.1%) cases. Of the 18 cases evaluated for CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, and dual expression of CD4 and CD8, CD2 was expressed in 14 (77.8%), while CD3 was expressed in 7 (38.9%) cases. CD4 was positive in 11 (61.1%), and CD8 was expressed in 9 (50%). Dual expression of CD4 and CD8 occurred in only 4 (22.2%) of the cases. Of the 16 analyzed for CD13, CD33, and CD117, only 1 case (6.3%) expressed CD13, while 2 (12.5%) cases expressed CD33 and CD117. Thus, these data point to the need for a more extensive study to reevaluate the current WHO defined immunophenotype used in the diagnosis of pre-TALL/LBL.",,"['Lewis, Robert E', 'Cruse, Julius M', 'Sanders, Catherine M', 'Webb, Rachel N', 'Tillman, Benjamin F', 'Beason, Kevin L', 'Lam, John', 'Koehler, Jonathan']","['Lewis RE', 'Cruse JM', 'Sanders CM', 'Webb RN', 'Tillman BF', 'Beason KL', 'Lam J', 'Koehler J']","['Department of Pathology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, 2500 North State Street, Jackson, Mississippi 39216, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*metabolism/pathology']",2006/08/16 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/08/16 09:00'],"['2006/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4800(06)00066-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2006.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2006 Oct;81(2):162-5. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2006.06.006.

The evaluation of an individual CLL patient's prognosis remains a problematic issue. The presence or absence of somatic mutations in the IgVH genes is currently the gold-standard prognostic factor, but this technique is labor intensive and costly. Genomic studies uncovered that 70 kDa zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70) expression was associated with unmutated IgVH genes and ZAP-70 protein expression was proposed as a surrogate for somatic mutational status. Among the available techniques for ZAP-70 detection, flow cytometry is most preferable as it allows the simultaneous quantification of ZAP-70 protein expression levels in CLL cells and residual normal lymphocyte subsets. However, several factors introduce variability in the results reported from different laboratories; these factors include the anti-ZAP-70 antibody clone and conjugate, the staining procedure, the gating strategy, and the method of reporting the results. The need for standardization of the approach led to the organization of an international working group focused on harmonizing all aspects of the technique. During this workshop, a technical consensus was reached on the methods for cell permeabilization and immunophenotyping procedures. An assay was then designed that allowed comparison of two clones of anti-ZAP-70 antibody and the identification of the expression of this molecule in B, T, and NK cells identified in a four multicolor analysis. This procedure was applied to three stabilized blood samples, provided by the UK NEQAS group to all participating members of this study, in order to minimize variability caused by sample storage and shipment. Analysis was performed in 20 laboratories providing interpretable data from 14 centers. Various gating strategies were used and the ZAP-70 levels were expressed as percentage positive (POS) relative to isotype control or normal B-cells or normal T-cells; in addition the levels were reported as a ratio of expression in CLL cells relative to T-cells. The reported level of ZAP-70 expression varied greatly depending on the antibody and the method used to express the results. The CLL/T-cell ZAP-70 expression ratio showed a much lower interlaboratory variation than other reporting strategies and is recommended for multicenter studies. Stabilization results in decreased expression of CD19 making gating more difficult and therefore stabilized samples are not optimal for multicentric analysis of ZAP-70 expression. We assessed the variation of ZAP-70 expression levels in fresh cells according to storage time, which demonstrated that ZAP-70 is labile but sufficiently stable to allow comparison using fresh samples distributed between labs in Europe. These studies have demonstrated progress toward a consensus reporting procedure, and further work is underway to harmonize the preparation and analysis procedures.",['(c) 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology.'],"['Letestu, Remi', 'Rawstron, Andy', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Boeckx, Nancy', 'Boettcher, Sebastian', 'Buhl, Anne Mette', 'Duerig, Jan', 'Ibbotson, Rachel', 'Kroeber, Alexander', 'Langerak, Anton', 'Le Garff-Tavernier, Magali', 'Mockridge, Ian', 'Morilla, Alison', 'Padmore, Ruth', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Ritgen, Matthias', 'Shehata, Medhat', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Staib, Peter', 'Ticchioni, Michel', 'Walker, Clare', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, Florence']","['Letestu R', 'Rawstron A', 'Ghia P', 'Villamor N', 'Boeckx N', 'Boettcher S', 'Buhl AM', 'Duerig J', 'Ibbotson R', 'Kroeber A', 'Langerak A', 'Le Garff-Tavernier M', 'Mockridge I', 'Morilla A', 'Padmore R', 'Rassenti L', 'Ritgen M', 'Shehata M', 'Smolewski P', 'Staib P', 'Ticchioni M', 'Walker C', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F']","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital Avicenne, Bobigny, France.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

METHODS: Flow cytometric analyses for ZAP-70 were performed in peripheral blood samples from 145 B-CLL (124 with IgV(H) mutations) by a standard three-color protocol. Identification of ZAP-70(+) cell population was based on an external negative control, i.e., the isotypic control (ISO method) or an internal positive control, i.e., the population of residual normal T/NK cells (TNK method). A comparison between these two approaches was performed. RESULTS: While 86/145 cases were concordant as for ZAP-70 expression according to the two methods (ISO(+)TNK(+) or ISO(-)TNK(-)), 59/145 cases had discordant ZAP-70 expression, mainly (56/59) showing a ISO(+)TNK(-) profile. These latter cases express higher levels of ZAP-70 in their normal T cell component. Moreover, discordant ISO(+)TNK(-) cases had a IgV(H) gene mutation profile similar to that of concordantly positive cases and different from ZAP-70 concordantly negative B-CLL. CONCLUSION: Analysis of ZAP-70 expression by B-CLL cells by using the ISO method allows to overcome the variability in the expression of ZAP-70 by residual T cells and yields a better correlation with IgV(H) gene mutations. A receiver operating characteristic analysis suggests to employ a higher cut-off than the commonly used 20%.

One of these parameters involves the measurement of the protein levels of zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70) in CLL cells. A standardized assay has not yet reached consensus in the clinical cytometry community. METHODS: We developed a system using the 8-peak Rainbow beads as our fluorescence calibrator along with a fixed cell control. Using a panel of CD19-PE, CD5-FITC, and ZAP-70-Alexa 647, we stained normal whole blood, and blood and bone marrow from patients with CLL to determine the level of ZAP-70 expression in T-cell, B-cell, and CLL-cell populations. ZAP-70 expression was reported in molecules equivalent fluorescence (MEFL) based on the calibration of the flow cytometer with the 8-peak Rainbow beads. RESULTS: Daily assay performance as well as operating MEFL defined ranges for ZAP-70 detection in CLL were developed. A rank-order, nonparametric approach to reference ranges was used to assign a cutoff for ""negative"" as well as ranges for ""intermediate"" and ""positive"" staining using T and B cells from a pool of 50 normal subjects, and CLL cells from 395 patients. The assay was validated in a multi-institutional study and has demonstrated correlation with published techniques. Since its initial development, the assay has been implemented at two additional laboratory sites and has been shown to produce reproducible, correlated data at all sites. CONCLUSIONS: Strict adherence to standardization can yield an assay that is predictable, reliable, and reproducible as well as capable of multisite implementation. The Rainbow beads provide a common platform for system calibration. The fixed cell culture controls provide a common target to test antibody. The final level of control tests the sensitivity of ZAP-70 detection in a normal peripheral blood sample stained along with the submitted CLL patients.

The zeta-chain (T-cell receptor) associated protein kinase 70 kDa (ZAP-70) has been reported to be a surrogate marker for IgV(H) mutation status, and its expression in leukemic cells correlates with unmutated IgV(H). However, ZAP-70 detection by flow cytometry varies significantly dependant on the antibodies used, the method of performing the assay, and the condition of the cells in the specimen. The clinical value of ZAP-70 testing when samples are shipped under poorly controlled conditions is not known. Furthermore, testing in a research environment may differ from testing in a routine clinical laboratory. We validated an assay for ZAP-70 by comparing results with clinical outcome and the mutation status of the IgV(H). Using stored samples, we show significant correlation between ZAP-70 expression and clinical outcome as well as IgV(H) mutation at a cut-off point of 15%. While positive samples (>15% positivity) remain positive when kept in the laboratory environment for 48 h after initial testing, results obtained from samples from CLL patients tested after shipping at room temperature for routine testing showed no correlation with IgV(H) mutation status when 15% cut-off was used. In these samples, cut-point of 10% correlated with the IgV(H) mutation (P = 0.0001). This data suggests that although ZAP-70 positivity correlates with IgV(H) mutation status and survival, variations in sample handling and preparation may influence results. We show that IgV(H) mutation results, unlike ZAP-70 remain correlated with CD38 expression and beta-2 microglobulin in shipped samples, and ZAP-70 testing should not be used as the sole criterion for stratifying patients for therapy.",['(c) 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology.'],"['Sheikholeslami, M R', 'Jilani, I', 'Keating, M', 'Uyeji, J', 'Chen, K', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Giles, F', 'Albitar, M']","['Sheikholeslami MR', 'Jilani I', 'Keating M', 'Uyeji J', 'Chen K', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles F', 'Albitar M']","['Quest Diagnostics, Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

METHODS: B-CLL cells were fixed with formaldehyde before surface staining with gating antibodies CD19PC5 and CD5FITC. The cells were permeabilized with saponin, and the ZAP-70 antigen was blocked in one tube with unlabeled antibody to ZAP-70 [clone 1E7.2]. Zap-70-PE was then added to this tube. ZAP-70-PE was added to a second tube without unlabeled antibody to ZAP-70. The mean fluorescence intensity of the ZAP-70 in the tube without unlabeled antibody divided by the mean fluorescence intensity of the ZAP-70 in the tube with unlabeled antibody equals the RATIO of total fluorescence to non-specific ZAP-70 fluorescence in the B-CLL cells. In a second method of analysis, a region is created in the histogram showing ZAP-70 fluorescence intensity in the tube with unlabeled antibody to ZAP-70. This region is set to 0.9% positive cells. This same region is then used to measure the % positive [%POS] ZAP-70 cells in the tube without unlabeled antibody to ZAP-70. The brighter the ZAP-70 fluorescence above the non-specific background, the higher the %POS. RESULTS: Due to the varying amount of non-specific staining between patient B-CLL cells and other cells, the blocking antibody method yielded a more quantitative and reproducible measure of ZAP-70 in B-CLL cells than other methods, which use the ratio of B-CLL fluorescence to normal B or T-cell fluorescence. Using this improved method, ZAP-70 was determined to be negative if the RATIO was less than 2:1 and positive if the RATIO was greater than 2:1. ZAP-70 was determined to be negative if the %POS was less than 5% and positive if the %POS was greater than 5%, a cut-off value lower than previous values published, due to exclusion of non-specific staining. Both cut-offs were based upon patient specimen distribution profiling. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a blocking antibody resulted in a robust, reproducible clinical B-CLL assay that is not influenced by the need to measure the amount of ZAP-70 in other cells.

The flow cytometric analysis of ZAP-70 suffers from difficulties in standardization and interpretation. We applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test to make analysis more straightforward. METHODS: We examined ZAP-70 expression by flow cytometry in 53 patients with CLL. Analysis was performed as initially described by Crespo et al. (New England J Med 2003; 348:1764-1775) and alternatively by application of the KS statistical test comparing T cells with B cells. Receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC)-curve analyses were performed to determine the optimal cut-off values for ZAP-70 measured by the two approaches. ZAP-70 protein expression was compared with ZAP-70 mRNA expression measured by a quantitative PCR (qPCR) and with the IgV(H) mutation status. RESULTS: Both flow cytometric analyses correlated well with the molecular technique and proved to be of equal value in predicting the IgV(H) mutation status. Applying the KS test is reproducible, simple, straightforward, and overcomes a number of difficulties encountered in the Crespo-method.

Studies published to date measuring levels of expression of ZAP-70 intracellular protein using flow cytometry have demonstrated poor performance, as defined by the difference in signal in known positive and negative lymphocyte populations. METHODS: A recently published method (Chow S, Hedley DW, Grom P, Magari R, Jacobberger JW, Shankey TV, Cytometry A 2005;67:4-17) to measure intracellular phospho-epitopes was optimized using a design of experiments (DOE) approach to provide the best separation of ZAP-70 expression in positive T- or NK-cells as compared to negative B-cells in peripheral blood samples. A number of commercially available anti-ZAP-70 antibody-conjugates were screened using this methodology, and the antibody-conjugate showing the best performance was chosen to develop a four-color, five antibody assays to measure ZAP-70 levels in whole blood specimens. RESULTS: Using the optimized fixation and permeabilization method, improvement in assay performance (signal-to-noise, S/N) was seen in most of the antibodies tested. The custom SBZAP conjugate gave the best S/N when used in conjunction with this optimized fixation /permeabilization method. In conjunction with carefully standardized instrument set-up protocols, we obtained both intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility in the analysis of ZAP-70 expression in whole blood samples from normal and CLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: The development of a sensitive, specific and highly reproducible ZAP-70 assay represents only the first essential step for any clinical assay.

This issue attests to the enormous effort and the steady progress made in overcoming technical challenges of testing for ZAP-70 expression and sets the foundation for a successful translation of this important marker into clinical practice. Despite the best effort, one will likely have to accept that not all cases can be clearly assigned to one or the other group, given that ZAP-70 expression between CLL patients falls along a continuum from absent to high.

Patients with mutated IgVH genes fare better than those with unmutated genes. Gene expression profiling studies identified the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 to be expressed in unmutated CLL samples. Flow cytometric examination of ZAP-70 expression in tumor cells has been proposed to be a convenient surrogate marker for IgVH mutational status. However, a few studies have shown a small number of discordant results between ZAP-70 positivity, IgVH mutational status, and clinical outcome. There have been no reported studies comparing bone marrow samples with peripheral blood for ZAP-70 expression in CLL patients. METHODS: : We searched our flow cytometry files from October 2004 through April 2006 and identified CLL in 311 bone marrow and peripheral blood specimens from 256 patients. We defined ZAP-70 positivity as greater than 30% of the CD19(+) B-cells above the isotype control value that coexpress ZAP-70. Statistical analyses were performed using the Fisher exact test and student t-test. RESULTS: : A significantly greater number of bone marrow specimens were positive for ZAP-70 when compared with the number of peripheral blood specimens. Of all the ZAP-70 negative specimens, CLL cells from bone marrow had a greater mean percentage of ZAP-70 positive cells when compared with the CLL cells from peripheral blood. Finally, six patients were identified who were ZAP-70 positive in the bone marrow but ZAP-70 negative in the peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: : These results may be due to either an increase in the false positive rate in bone marrow specimens or to an intrinsic feature of CLL cells in the compartment that is biologically distinct from peripheral tumor cells. As prognosis and treatment decisions may be based on ZAP-70 results from either specimen type, it is prudent to further examine this observation.

Crespo et al. proposed the detection of ZAP-70 by flow cytometry. Recently several novel monoclonal antibodies appeared on market. METHODS: We compared different staining methods utilizing monoclonal antibodies (moAb) against ZAP-70: anti-ZAP-70 PE, clone 1E7.2, anti-ZAP-70 PE, clone 17A/P-ZAP70 directly stained with flourochrome as well as anti-ZAP-70 antibody, clone 2F3.2 stained with Zenontrade mark Alexa Fluor(R) 488 Labeling Kit. Additionally different reagents for permeabilization such as IntraPrep, FIX & PERM, Perm/Wash and 70% ethanol/paraformaldehyde were used to find the most clinically relevant and easy assay to determine ZAP-70 expression in B-CLL. Moreover we compared results of ZAP-70 expression assessed by whole blood protocol with those obtained using-peripheral mononuclear cells isolated from whole blood. RESULTS: Anti-ZAP-70 moAb clone 17A/P-ZAP70 gave elevated results for all B-CLL patients as well as healthy controls. Staining with anti-ZAP-70 moAb clone 1E7.2 and anti-ZAP-70 moAb clone 2F3.2 was effective in distinguishing negative and positive cells for ZAP-70 protein expression. Not statistically significant discrepancies of ZAP-70 expression were noticed between different fixation and permeabilization methods.

ZAP-70 expression can be determined by direct antibody staining followed by flow cytometric analysis. However, there are currently several different gating strategies for analysis. We compared those strategies for ZAP-70 expression analysis. METHODS: One hundred and one patients with B-CLL were analyzed employing a directly labeled alexa-fluor-488-ZAP-70-antibody. In 27 cases, we additionally measured and analyzed ZAP-70 expression, together with healthy controls as described previously. RESULTS: Applying either T-/NK-cell isotype or healthy control analysis strategies on patient samples that were processed in parallel revealed discrepant results in 48% (12/25) of all cases. Taken together with the 74 B-CLL patients, who were analyzed with regard to average reference values, disconcordant results were obtained in 58% of the samples. We demonstrate that high variances in ZAP-70 T-/NK-cell staining within B-CLL patients, paired with a close proximity of ZAP-70 B-cell values to the suggested cut-off levels, may lead to interpretation difficulties of ZAP-70 status. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that different gating strategies for determining flow cytometric ZAP-70 expression status produce highly discordant results. Further standardization is required before ZAP-70 can be used as a reliable prognostic parameter in immunophenotyping of B-CLL.",['(c) 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology.'],"['Wilhelm, Christian', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Brendel, Cornelia']","['Wilhelm C', 'Neubauer A', 'Brendel C']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps-University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

ZAP-70 expression is believed to provide prognostic information. The flow cytometric detection of ZAP-70 is difficult because it is an intracellular antigen with weak expression in CLL. Consensus has not been reached as to the best method for measurement. METHODS: We analyzed 72 CLL patient samples for ZAP-70 expression and IgVH mutational status. Sensitivity and specificity of ZAP-70 expression against IgVH mutational status were assessed for two clones (2F3.2 and 1E7.2) and for four methods of analysis: percentage positivity (PP), comparing test to isotype control, ratio of geometric means of test and isotype control, and percentage and ratiometric methods comparing test and T/NK cell populations. The effects of anticoagulant, collection times, and time to analysis were also evaluated. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity were 85 and 88%, respectively, for Upstate PP; 70 and 88% for Caltag PP; 89 and 91% for Upstate ratio; 89 and 88% for Caltag ratio. Intraobserver variability was smaller when ZAP-70 expression was assessed using a ratiometric approach rather than the percentage method. By 48 h, we observed an average decrease of 13% in the Caltag ratio in the heparin preserved samples compared to an increase of 3% in those collected in EDTA. Within the first 24-h period, a greater percent variability was observed in those samples collected into EDTA compared with heparin. CONCLUSION: Our data support a rapid method for ZAP-70 measurement using commercially available fixation/permeabilization reagents, a conjugated antibody, and a ratiometric method of analysis that minimizes subjective interpretation of the results. This is a method of ZAP-70 assessment that could be included in a routine diagnostic CLL panel; however, the choice of anticoagulant and time of analysis after collection are critical factors in accurate assessment of ZAP-70 expression.",['(c) 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology.'],"['Best, O G', 'Ibbotson, R E', 'Parker, A E', 'Davis, Z A', 'Orchard, J A', 'Oscier, D G']","['Best OG', 'Ibbotson RE', 'Parker AE', 'Davis ZA', 'Orchard JA', 'Oscier DG']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

The role of ZAP-70 in immature B-cells is not well understood. Immature or precursor B lymphocytes (hematogones) often occur in clinical samples and coexpress CD10, CD38, and CD19 lacking surface immunoglobulin expression. The present study was carried out in an attempt to further elucidate the role of ZAP-70 in the spectrum of B-cells seen in clinical specimens. METHODS: ZAP-70 expression was evaluated on 25 patient samples that expressed greater than 2% of CD10(+)/CD38(bright)/CD19(+) coexpression during routine evaluation. In our sample set, the hematogone expression ranged from 2 to 18% of total leukocytes and occurred in a variety of conditions, including CLL, NHL, AML, MDS, Hodgkins Disease, and Multiple Myeloma. The method of ZAP-70 detection was that routinely applied to our clinical testing of CLL samples supplemented with the determination of ZAP-70 levels in the CD38(bright)/CD19(+) coexpressing cells. RESULTS: In all cases ZAP-70 was not expressed on the CD5 negative, CD38/CD19 coexpressing precusor B cells. In all cases hematogones were found to not express significant levels of ZAP-70.

AIMS: We conducted a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies of occupational TCE exposure and multiple myeloma (MM) or leukaemia. METHODS: We identified a total of eight cohort or case-control studies that enumerated a TCE-exposed study population and presented relative risk (RR) estimates for MM (n = 7) and/or leukaemia (n = 7). The individual studies included aerospace or aircraft workers (n = 3 studies), workers from a transformer manufacturing plant (n = 1 study) and workers from numerous occupations who, based on biomonitoring or extensive industrial hygiene exposure measurements, were likely exposed to TCE (n = 4). We used random effects models to calculate summary relative risk estimates (SRRE). In addition, we examined heterogeneity across studies and the relative influence of each individual study on the overall meta-analysis. RESULTS: No association was observed for MM (SRRE = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.80-1.38; P value for heterogeneity = 0.94) or leukaemia (SRRE = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.93-1.32; P value for heterogeneity = 0.50), based on TCE-exposed subgroup meta-analyses.

BCR/ABL-positive K562 and -negative CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells were investigated. MTT survival assay and clonogenic test of the cell proliferation ability were used to estimate resistance against idarubicin. DNA damage after cell treatment with the drug at the concentrations from 0.001 to 3 microM with or without STI571 pre-treatment were examined by the alkaline comet assay. We found that the level of DNA damages was lower in K562 cells after STI571 pre-treatment. It is suggested that BCR/ABL activity may promote genomic instability, moreover K562 cells were found to be resistant to the drug treatment. Further, we provided evidence of apoptosis inhibition in BCR/ABL-positive cells using caspase-3 activity colorimetric assay and DAPI nuclear staining for chromatin condensation.

Three kinds of data were used to examine the effect of the outcome of current BCR-ABL inhibitor treatment compared to early allogeneic stem cell transplantation: (1) the life expectancy of the general population of the United States as a function of age, (2) the life expectancy of CML patients as a function of the age of patients treated with imatinib mesylate (imatinib) who achieve a complete cytogenetic remission, and (3) the life expectancy of patients with CML treated with matched-related or matched-unrelated stem cell transplantation as a function of age, derived from data provided by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). We also considered separately the transplant results of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), which are substantially better than the ""average"" outcome from the CIBMTR. We have calculated the projected life expectancy from the age at which patients with CML enter complete cytogenetic remission with imatinib and that of those who receive allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The outcome with imatinib therapy of newly diagnosed patients with CML has been documented for only 4 and 1/2 years, whereas transplant data were available for up to 25 years. Thus, in order to compare life expectancy and 10-year survival probability, it was necessary to extrapolate the imatinib data. A basis for extrapolation is offered and conservative estimates have been used for comparison. Our best estimate is that patients receiving imatinib who have a complete cytogenetic remission have a higher projected probability of 10-year survival than patients who are transplanted, based on results provided by the CIBMTR, and have about the same probability compared to the data from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center for patients in the 30- to 60-year-old range.

Such systems typically include the population of stem cells that provides an inexhaustible supply of cells necessary for maintaining the cellular composition of a tissue. A stem cell may be induced to transform (differentiate) into a progenitor cell. Progenitor cells retain the ability to proliferate and their function is believed to provide a quick proliferative response to an increased demand for cells in the population. There may be several sub-types of progenitor cells. Terminally differentiated cells do not divide under normal conditions; they are responsible for maintaining tissue-specific functions. Recent advancements in experimental techniques offer considerable scope for quantitative studies of in vivo cell kinetics based on stochastic modeling of renewing cell populations.

The patient was referred to the departament of Oncology where he received polychemotherapy and radiotherapy. The patient is currently followed by regular visits to Urology outpatients service.

CONCLUSIONS: Of the cases reviewed, mean age at diagnosis was 57 years. Clinical debut was with prostate symptoms, with or without AUR and sometimes manifestations of renal failure due to obstructive uropathy, as well as general symptoms (astenia, anorexia, weight loss). PSA values remain unaltered in prostate lymphoma patients. Histologic diagnosis may be made by transrectal prostate biopsy, although transurethral resection (TUR) may be necessary for confirmation. Ultrasound and CT scan are of great utility for diagnosis of both local and distant tumors. From a therapeutic point of view, surgery for the obstruction of the lower urinary tract (TURP or retropubic prostatectomy) may be necessary, as well as the cyclophosphamide based polychemotherapy with corticosteroids and other cytostatic agents, and radiotherapy; intratecal chemotherapy has also been used adjuvant bone marrow transplantation.",,"['Ochoa Undargarain, Otto', 'Hermida Perez, Jose A', 'Ochoa Montes de Oca, Johannes', 'Felix Leon, Juan M']","['Ochoa Undargarain O', 'Hermida Perez JA', 'Ochoa Montes de Oca J', 'Felix Leon JM']","['Hospital Provincial Manuel Ascunce Domenech, Camaguey, Cuba.']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Arch Esp Urol,Archivos espanoles de urologia,0064757,,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology']",2006/08/15 09:00,2006/11/02 09:00,['2006/08/15 09:00'],"['2006/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.4321/s0004-06142006000500015 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Esp Urol. 2006 Jun;59(5):538-41. doi: 10.4321/s0004-06142006000500015.,,,26,,,,,,,,"Linfoma linfocitico, bien diferenciado de la prostata, presentacion de un caso y breve revision de la literatura.",,,,,,

Tandutinib was given orally in doses ranging from 50 mg to 700 mg twice daily The principal dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of tandutinib was reversible generalized muscular weakness, fatigue, or both, occurring at doses of 525 mg and 700 mg twice daily. Tandutinib's pharmacokinetics were characterized by slow elimination, with achievement of steady-state plasma concentrations requiring greater than 1 week of dosing. Western blotting showed that tandutinib inhibited phosphorylation of FLT3 in circulating leukemic blasts. Eight patients had FLT3-ITD mutations; 5 of these were evaluable for assessment of tandutinib's antileukemic effect. Two of the 5 patients, treated at 525 mg and 700 mg twice daily, showed evidence of antileukemic activity, with decreases in both peripheral and bone marrow blasts.

A critical issue is whether T cells generated against heteroclitic peptides retain the ability to recognize and kill tumor cells expressing the original weak TAAs, and whether there is a lower threshold of binding affinity of the native peptides, below which such CTLs can still kill primary tumor cells. To examine this we used a model examining the ability of native and heteroclitic immunoglobulin (Ig)-derived peptides to generate CTLs that can kill chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. We demonstrate that CTLs generated against heteroclitic peptides have enhanced killing of CD40-activated B cells pulsed with either heteroclitic (P < .001) or native peptide (P = .04) and primary CLL cells (P = .01). The novel finding reported here is that the rate-limiting factor appears to be the ability to generate CTLs and that once generated, CTL lysis of primary tumor cells is independent of the binding affinity of the native peptide.

In addition, overexpression of the constitutively active PKCdelta catalytic fragment (PKCdelta-cat) is sufficient to trigger Bax activation, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. While PKCdelta is a key apoptotic effector, the downstream target(s) responsible for the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade are not known. We found that expression of the active PKCdelta-cat in HaCaT cells triggers a reduction in the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, similar to UV radiation. The down-regulation of Mcl-1 induced by PKCdelta-cat was not at the mRNA level but was due to decreased protein half-life. Overexpression of Mcl-1 protected HaCaT cells from both UV and PKCdelta-cat-induced apoptosis and blocked the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, indicating that Mcl-1 down-regulation was required for apoptosis signaling. Indeed, down-regulation of Mcl-1 with siRNA slightly increased the basal apoptotic rate of HaCaT cells and dramatically sensitized them to UV or PKCdelta-cat-induced apoptosis. HaCaT cells with down-regulated Mcl-1 had higher activated Bax protein, as measured by Bax cross-linking, indicating that Mcl-1 down-regulation is sufficient for Bax activation. Finally, recombinant PKCdelta could phosphorylate Mcl-1 in vitro, identifying Mcl-1 as a direct target for PKCdelta. Overall our results identify Mcl-1 as an important target for PKCdelta-cat that can mediate its pro-apoptotic effects on mitochondria to amplify the apoptotic signaling induced by a wide range of apoptotic stimuli.",,"['Sitailo, Leonid A', 'Tibudan, Shalini S', 'Denning, Mitchell F']","['Sitailo LA', 'Tibudan SS', 'Denning MF']","['Department of Pathology and the Oncology Institute, Skin Cancer Research Program, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Catalytic Domain/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cytochromes c/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Feedback, Physiological/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/enzymology/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2006/08/12 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/08/12 09:00'],"['2006/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)33877-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M607351200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Oct 6;281(40):29703-10. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M607351200.

Treatment approaches have been derived mostly from small case studies and retrospective reports. Therefore, a uniform management strategy cannot be recommended. The best strategy appears to be an individualized approach to each case given the wide spectrum of presentation. There is general agreement that early management should be conservative and should consist of bowel rest, intravenous fluid administration, total parenteral nutrition, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and normalization of neutrophil counts.

Localized neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells presents as solitary plasmacytoma of bone or extramedullary plasmacytoma. Involvement of orbit can occur as a solitary plasmacytoma, or as part of systemic involvement in multiple myeloma, the clinical outcome being significantly worse in the latter setting. Orbital involvement in multiple myeloma is very rare with less than 50 cases reported in the literature. Early cytological diagnosis of such lesions is vital for timely institution of appropriate therapy. As far as we are aware only six previous cases of cytological diagnosis of multiple myeloma involving the orbit are on record. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37 year old male presented with low grade fever showing evening rise, headache, diplopia and swelling in the right periorbital and temporal region. Imaging studies revealed destructive lesion of sphenoid, frontal bone and zygomatic arch with soft tissue component extending to infratemporal fossa and orbit. A fine needle aspirate from the temporal region swelling showed features of a plasmacytoma, and subsequent workup confirmed the presence of systemic disease. A final diagnosis of multiple myeloma with orbital involvement at presentation was made. CONCLUSION: Present case describes the extremely rare presentation of multiple myeloma with orbital involvement and highlights the utility of cytology in such lesions. Fine needle aspiration diagnosis of plasmacytoma at extramedullary sites offers an opportunity for non-invasive verification of systemic involvement, and thus plays a major role in early diagnosis and management of these patients.",,"['Sharma, Alok', 'Kaushal, Manju', 'Chaturvedi, Nishith K', 'Yadav, Rajbala']","['Sharma A', 'Kaushal M', 'Chaturvedi NK', 'Yadav R']","['Department of Pathology, Dr, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, India. dr_aalok@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytojournal,CytoJournal,101231642,,,,2006/08/12 09:00,2006/08/12 09:01,['2006/08/12 09:00'],"['2006/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/12 09:01 [medline]', '2006/08/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-6413-3-19 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-6413-3-19 [doi]']",epublish,Cytojournal. 2006 Aug 10;3:19. doi: 10.1186/1742-6413-3-19.,20060810,,,,PMC1564147,,,,,,,,,,,,

With increasing knowledge about the biology, molecular genetics, and prognostic factors of the disease, the philosophy of care for patients with CLL has evolved from palliation to aiming for a potential cure, especially in younger patients. Furthermore, multiple treatment options have emerged, including purine analogues, monoclonal antibodies, and potentially stem cell transplantation. These have been associated with higher frequencies of CRs and longer durations of responses compared to conventional chemotherapy. In addition, a subset of patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy can achieve durable CRs and molecular remissions. This may translate into improved disease-free survival and potentially a ""cure.""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty evaluable patients who received vincristine-laden platelets for refractory thrombocytopenia were included in this retrospective study. Vincristine (1 mg) was added to the platelets and incubated for one hour prior to transfusion. Serial platelet counts following vincristine-laden platelet transfusion and units of platelets transfused in the week prior to and the week after transfusion of vincristine-laden platelets were evaluated. RESULTS: The underlying diseases of the patients were lung cancer (n =4), breast cancer following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and acute myeloid leukemia (n=3 each), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=2), acute lymphoid leukemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, aspergillosis, cytomegalovirus infection and systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1 each). The median rate of change of platelet count after transfusion of vincristine-laden platelets was 550/microL/day (range, -1,000 to 12,8001/microL/day; p=0.003). The median change in the number of units of platelets transfused in the week following vincristine-laden platelet transfusion was -1.5 as compared to the week prior to the transfusion (p=0.031). Patients with a primary marrow disorder exhibited no difference in either the rate of change in platelet count or in the difference in the units of platelets transfused compared to those without a primary bone marrow disorder.

After administration of mulberry juice one or two weeks before the stress loading, the lipid peroxidation was completely blocked. Administration of mulberry juice after the stress loading, without pre-administration, was also protective. ESR spectroscopy revealed that mulberry juice scavenged superoxide anion (generated by hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase reaction), hydroxyl radical (produced by the Fenton reaction) and NO radical (generated by a NO donor) at approximately 50% efficiency of blueberry juice. Mulberry juice produced smaller amounts of radical at neutral to alkaline pH. The cytotoxic and anti-HIV activities of mulberry juice were 18% and >4-fold those of blueberry juice, respectively.

The main long term effect of this exposure is an increase in the risk for developing benign and malignant tumors in the exposed population. This review summarizes the existing data on the possible effects of ionizing radiation on the second generation, focusing on cancer risk. The two mechanisms through which parents' exposure to radiation could affect their children's health are intrauterine exposure of the fetus and preconception exposure of the gonads. Intrauterine exposure to ionizing radiation has teratogenic and carcinogenic effects. Most case-control studies have shown a 40-50% increase in the risk of cancer following intrauterine exposure to medical diagnostic radiation at doses of 10-20mGy. Results of these studies have greatly contributed to the strict radiation protection guidelines at pregnancy existing today. Although animal studies have shown that gonadal exposure to high doses can cause heritable genetic changes, this effect has not been demonstrated unequivocally in epidemiological studies. A case-control study suggested an association between preconception irradiation and leukemia/non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in children of male workers at a nuclear plant in the UK (the Gardner hypothesis). This report generated substantial interest and research; however, subsequent occupational studies failed to confirm the association. Negative results were also reported in studies of the atomic bomb survivors and survivors of childhood cancer.

Our purpose was to investigate the mechanism of MZ3's cytotoxicity. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT method, apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. DNA fragmentation was tested by agarose gel electrophoresis. Mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) was detected by JC1 staining and flow cytometry, while intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2'-7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate staining and flow cytometry. Protein expression was analyzed by western blotting. In vivo activity of MZ3 was assayed through severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice model of human leukemia engrafts. RESULTS: MZ3 exhibited high anti-cancer activity in six leukemia cell lines, including two drug-resistant cell lines. MZ3 induced DNA fragmentation, and caused an elevation of ROS and a loss of DeltaPsim in HL60 cells. MZ3 also induced the activation of caspase-3, influenced the expression of Bcl-2 family members, MAPKs and other proteins relative to mitochondria-induced apoptosis.

The number of children accumulating at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for 5 or more days of the week was 3 for the control group, whereas no children with ALL met this criterion. Significantly lower levels of total weekly time of MVPA were seen in children being treated for ALL (328 +/- 107 min) than in controls (506 +/- 175 min) (p < 0.05). When weekday data was analyzed, the ALL patients also had significantly lower mean daily times of MVPA (49 +/- 23 min vs. 79 +/- 25 min).

Coculturing of CD9-negative 5T33MMvitro cells with BM endothelial cells (BMECs) resulted in a partial retrieval of CD9. Laser microdissection followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry performed on bone sections of 5T33MMvivo diseased mice demonstrated strong local expression of CD9 on MM cells in contact with BMEC compared to MM cells further away. These findings were also confirmed by immunohistochemistry in MM patients. Neutralizing anti-CD9 antibodies inhibited transendothelial invasion of CD9-expressing human MM5.1 and murine 5T33MMvivo cells.

The crucial role of NPM-ALK in the regulation of serpin A1 expression was further demonstrated by using both ectopic expression and downregulation, by RNA interference, of the NPM-ALK oncogene. In addition, in ALK+ tumors, serpin A1 expression appeared to be correlated with the clinical status of the patients as the serpin A1 mRNA level was higher in patients presenting with extranodal dissemination.

Similar chemoattractants may also regulate metastasis of cancer stem cells (CSC). Growing experimental evidence indicates that both NSC and CSC express G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane span receptor CXCR4 and respond to its specific ligand alpha-chemokine stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), which is expressed by stroma cells from different tissues. In addition, a population of very small embryonic-like (VSEL) stem cells that express CXCR4 and respond robustly to an SDF-1 gradient was recently identified in adult tissues. VSELs express several markers of embryonic and primordial germ cells. It is proposed that these cells are deposited early in the development as a dormant pool of embryonic/pluripotent NSC. Expression of both CXCR4 and SDF-1 is upregulated in response to tissue hypoxia and damage signal attracting circulating NSC and CSC.

This classification scheme is probably an imprecise predictor of the prognosis of an individual patient. Indeed, approximately 25 percent of patients with stage IA disease have a recurrence after surgery, suggesting the need to identify patients in this subgroup for more effective therapy. METHODS: We identified gene-expression profiles that predicted the risk of recurrence in a cohort of 89 patients with early-stage NSCLC (the lung metagene model). We evaluated the predictor in two independent groups of 25 patients from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0030 study and 84 patients from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9761 study. RESULTS: The lung metagene model predicted recurrence for individual patients significantly better than did clinical prognostic factors and was consistent across all early stages of NSCLC. Applied to the cohorts from the ACOSOG Z0030 trial and the CALGB 9761 trial, the lung metagene model had an overall predictive accuracy of 72 percent and 79 percent, respectively. The predictor also identified a subgroup of patients with stage IA disease who were at high risk for recurrence and who might be best treated by adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The lung metagene model provides a potential mechanism to refine the estimation of a patient's risk of disease recurrence and, in principle, to alter decisions regarding the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage NSCLC.",['Copyright 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society.'],"['Potti, Anil', 'Mukherjee, Sayan', 'Petersen, Rebecca', 'Dressman, Holly K', 'Bild, Andrea', 'Koontz, Jason', 'Kratzke, Robert', 'Watson, Mark A', 'Kelley, Michael', 'Ginsburg, Geoffrey S', 'West, Mike', 'Harpole, David H Jr', 'Nevins, Joseph R']","['Potti A', 'Mukherjee S', 'Petersen R', 'Dressman HK', 'Bild A', 'Koontz J', 'Kratzke R', 'Watson MA', 'Kelley M', 'Ginsburg GS', 'West M', 'Harpole DH Jr', 'Nevins JR']","['Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Genetic', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis']",2006/08/11 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/08/11 09:00'],"['2006/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['355/6/570 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa060467 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2006 Aug 10;355(6):570-80. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa060467.,,"['N Engl J Med. 2007 Jan 11;356(2):189-90; author reply 190-1.

In this phase I study, LBH589 was administered i.v. as a 30-minute infusion on days 1 to 7 of a 21-day cycle. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifteen patients (median age, 63 years; range, 42-87 years) with acute myeloid leukemia (13 patients), acute lymphocytic leukemia (1 patient), or myelodysplastic syndrome (1 patient) were treated with LBH589 at the following dose levels (mg/m(2)): 4.8 (3 patients), 7.2 (3 patients), 9.0 (1 patient), 11.5 (3 patient), and 14.0 (5 patients). The levels of histone acetylation were measured using quantitative flow cytometry and plasma LBH589 concentrations were assayed. RESULTS: Four dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 QTcF prolongation) were observed, four at 14.0 mg/m(2) and one at 11.5 mg/m(2). QTcF prolongation was asymptomatic and reversed on LBH589 discontinuation. Other potentially LBH589-related toxicities included nausea (40%), diarrhea (33%), vomiting (33%), hypokalemia (27%), loss of appetite (13%), and thrombocytopenia (13%). In 8 of 11 patients with peripheral blasts, transient reductions occurred with a rebound following the 7-day treatment period. H3 acetylation increase was significant in B-cells (CD19(+); P = 0.02) and blasts (CD34(+); P = 0.04). The increase in H2B acetylation was highest in CD19(+) and CD34(+) cells [3.8-fold (P = 0.01) and 4.4-fold (P = 0.03), respectively]. The median acetylation of histones H2B and H3 in CD34(+) and CD19(+) cells significantly increased on therapy as did apoptosis in CD14(+) cells. Area under the curve increased proportionally with dose with a terminal half-life of approximately 11 hours. CONCLUSION: Intravenous administration of LBH589 was well tolerated at doses <11.5 mg/m(2) with consistent transient antileukemic and biological effects.",,"['Giles, Francis', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Beck, Joachim', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Masson, Eric', 'Rae, Patricia', 'Laird, Glen', 'Sharma, Sunil', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Dugan, Margaret', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Bhalla, Kapil']","['Giles F', 'Fischer T', 'Cortes J', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Beck J', 'Ravandi F', 'Masson E', 'Rae P', 'Laird G', 'Sharma S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Dugan M', 'Albitar M', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030, USA. frankgiles@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cinnamates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cinnamates/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Indoles', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Panobinostat', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/08/11 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2006/08/11 09:00'],"['2006/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/15/4628 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0511 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Aug 1;12(15):4628-35. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0511.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recurrent disease, despite intensified therapy, overall cure rates of 40% remain unsatisfactory and survival rates are particularly poor in certain subgroups. The probability of long-term survival after relapse is predicted from well-established prognostic factors (i.e., time and site of relapse, immunophenotype, and minimal residual disease). However, the underlying biological determinants of these prognostic factors remain poorly understood. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Aiming at identifying molecular pathways associated with these clinically well-defined prognostic factors, we did gene expression profiling on 60 prospectively collected samples of first relapse patients enrolled on the relapse trial ALL-REZ BFM 2002 of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster study group. RESULTS: We show here that patients with very early relapse of ALL are characterized by a distinctive gene expression pattern. We identified a set of 83 genes differentially expressed in very early relapsed ALL compared with late relapsed disease. The vast majority of genes were up-regulated and many were late cell cycle genes with a function in mitosis. In addition, samples from patients with very early relapse showed a significant increase in the percentage of S and G(2)-M phase cells and this correlated well with the expression level of cell cycle genes. CONCLUSIONS: Very early relapse of ALL is characterized by an increased proliferative capacity of leukemic blasts and up-regulated mitotic genes. The latter suggests that novel drugs, targeting late cell cycle proteins, might be beneficial for these patients that typically face a dismal prognosis.",,"['Kirschner-Schwabe, Renate', 'Lottaz, Claudio', 'Todling, Jorn', 'Rhein, Peter', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Ungethum, Ute', 'Kostka, Dennis', 'Kulozik, Andreas E', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Henze, Gunter', 'Spang, Rainer', 'Hagemeier, Christian', 'Seeger, Karl']","['Kirschner-Schwabe R', 'Lottaz C', 'Todling J', 'Rhein P', 'Karawajew L', 'Eckert C', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Ungethum U', 'Kostka D', 'Kulozik AE', 'Ludwig WD', 'Henze G', 'Spang R', 'Hagemeier C', 'Seeger K']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, HELIOS Klinikum Berlin, Robert-Roessle-Clinic, Laboratory for Functional Genomics, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'G2 Phase/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2006/08/11 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2006/08/11 09:00'],"['2006/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/15/4553 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0235 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Aug 1;12(15):4553-61. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0235.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported the establishment of a new anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell line, Thena, and its mouse xenograft, Thena-Nu, which induced cachexia in athymic nude mice. Subsequent studies showed that the addition of clodronate to Thena-Nu cultures reduced cell proliferation as well as cytokine production in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Weekly administration of clodronate induced tumor cytostasis, attenuation of cachexia, as well as prolongation of survival in Thena-Nu-bearing mice. Reduced serum interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor levels were detected, whereas, serum leukemia inhibitory factor levels were not reduced. Liver necrosis, observed in tumor-bearing mice, was also improved following clodronate treatment. Discontinuation of clodronate treatment, however, resulted in progressive tumor growth and weight loss. Our results demonstrated that clodronate could exert therapeutic efficacy on amelioration of cancer cachexia in the hosts.

In addition to Fyn, Src and Lck also interact with magicin. Upon stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody, magicin is phosphorylated in the T lymphocyte leukemia Jurkat cell line. Magicin phosphorylation is not observed in an Lck-deficient line, J.CaM1.6, indicating that Lck is the major Src family kinase for phosphorylating magicin in Jurkat cells. Employing site-directed mutagenesis along with in vitro kinase assays, we found that Y64 of magicin is phosphorylated by Lck creating a SH2-Grb2 binding motif.

Medical records were reviewed for relevant clinical information. Expression of VEGFR-1 (+) and VEGFR-2 (+) were seen in 25% (7/28) and 43% (12/28) respectively. Forty-six percent (13/28) were dual-negatives for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2; 14% (4/28) were dual-positives for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. An inferior survival was observed in patients whose myeloblasts express either VEGFR-1 (+) or VEGFR-2 (+), or both. Determination of expression of VEGF receptors (1 and 2) by IHS in PE-BM tissue is feasible. Prospective comparison of IHC to flow cytometry or other molecular techniques, and assessment of the prognostic significance of VEGF receptors in AML patients is warranted.",,"['Kharfan-Dabaja, M A', 'Patel, S A', 'Osunkoya, A O', 'Kojouri, K', 'Kamble, R', 'Yang, J', 'Hashmi, M', 'Ozer, H', 'Selby, G B']","['Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Patel SA', 'Osunkoya AO', 'Kojouri K', 'Kamble R', 'Yang J', 'Hashmi M', 'Ozer H', 'Selby GB']","['Section of Hematology-Oncology and OU cancer Center, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA. kharfama@moffitt.usf.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/*analysis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*analysis']",2006/08/11 09:00,2006/10/13 09:00,['2006/08/11 09:00'],"['2006/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLH802 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2257.2006.00802.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2006 Aug;28(4):254-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2257.2006.00802.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 10-23 DNAzyme was found to hydrolyze RNA in a sequence-specific manner both in vitro and in vivo. Although single-stranded DNAzymes may represent the most effective nucleic acid drug to date, they are nevertheless sensitive to nuclease degradation and require modifications for in vivo application. However, previously used stabilization of DNAzymes by site-specific phosphorothioate (PT) modifications reduces the catalytic activity, and the PTO displays toxic side effects when applied in vivo. Thus, improving the stability of DNAzymes without reducing their catalytic activity is essential if the potential of these compounds should be realized in vivo. RESULTS: The Circozyme was tested targeting the mRNA of the most common genetic rearrangement in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia TEL/AML1 (ETV6/RUNX1). The Circozyme exhibits a stability comparable to PTO-modified DNAzymes without reduction of catalytic activity and specificity and may represent a promising tool for DNAzyme in vivo applications. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of the catalytic site and the specific mRNA binding sequence of the DNAzyme into a circular loop-stem-loop structure (Circozyme) of approximately 70 bases presented here represents a new effective possibility of DNAzyme stabilization.",,"['Seifert, Georg', 'Taube, Tillmann', 'Paal, Kriztina', 'von Einsiedel, Hagen Graf', 'Wellmann, Sven', 'Henze, Gunter', 'Seeger, Karl', 'Schroff, Matthias', 'Wittig, Burghardt']","['Seifert G', 'Taube T', 'Paal K', 'von Einsiedel HG', 'Wellmann S', 'Henze G', 'Seeger K', 'Schroff M', 'Wittig B']","['Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Otto-Heubner Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine (OHC), Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Catalytic)', '0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Catalysis', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA, Catalytic/*chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA, Circular/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",2006/08/11 09:00,2006/09/19 09:00,['2006/08/11 09:00'],"['2006/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15257770600726075 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2006;25(7):785-93. doi: 10.1080/15257770600726075.,,,,,,,,,,,,['RefSeq/NM_001987'],,,,,

Nevertheless, they are diverse on the molecular level. At present, two genes are known in 11q23 and four in 17q12-25 that generate five distinct fusion genes: MLL-MLLT6/AF17, MLL-LASP1, MLL-ACACA or MLL-SEPT9/MSF, and ZBTB16/PLZF-RARA. We analyzed 14 cases with a t(11;17) by fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular genetic techniques and determined the molecular characteristics of their fusion genes. We identified six different gene fusions that comprised seven cases with a MLL-MLLT6/AF17, three with a MLL-SEPT9/MSF, and one each with MLL-LASP1, MLL-ACACA, and ZBTB16/PLZF-RARA fusions. In the remaining case, a MLL-SEPT6/Xq24 fusion suggested a complex rearrangement. The MLL-MLLT6/AF17 transcripts were extremely heterogeneous and the detection of seven different in-frame transcript and splice variants enabled us to predict the protein domains relevant for leukemogenesis. The putative MLL-MLLT6 consensus chimeric protein consists of the AT-hook DNA-binding, the methyltransferase, and the CXXC zinc-finger domains of MLL and the highly conserved octapeptide and the leucine-zipper dimerization motifs of MLLT6. The MLL-SEPT9 transcripts showed a similar high degree of variability. These analyses prove that the diverse types of t(11;17)-associated fusion genes can be reliably identified and delineated with a proper combination of cytogenetic and molecular genetic techniques. The heterogeneity of transcripts encountered in cases with MLL-MLLT6/AF17 and MLL-SEPT9/MSF fusions clearly demonstrates that thorough attention has to be paid to the appropriate selection of primers to cover all these hitherto unrecognized fusion variants.","['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Strehl, Sabine', 'Konig, Margit', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Schneider, Bjorn', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'von Bergh, Anne R M', 'Loncarevic, Ivan F', 'Jarosova, Marie', 'Schmidt, Helmut H', 'Moore, Steven D P', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Haas, Oskar A']","['Strehl S', 'Konig M', 'Meyer C', 'Schneider B', 'Harbott J', 'Jager U', 'von Bergh AR', 'Loncarevic IF', 'Jarosova M', 'Schmidt HH', 'Moore SD', 'Marschalek R', 'Haas OA']","[""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, Kinderspitalgasse 6, Vienna, Austria. sabine.strehl@ccri.at""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2006/08/10 09:00,2006/10/20 09:00,['2006/08/10 09:00'],"['2006/08/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20372 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Nov;45(11):1041-9. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20372.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed the synthesis and (124)I-radiolabeling of the (E)-But-2-enedioic acid [4-(3-[(124)I]iodoanilino)-quinazolin-6-yl]-amide-(3-morpholin-4-yl-propyl)-amide (morpholino-[(124)I]-IPQA), which selectively, irreversibly, and covalently binds the adenosine-triphosphate-binding site to the activated (phosphorylated) EGFR kinase, but not to the inactive EGFR kinase. The latter was demonstrated using in silico modeling with crystal structures of the wild type and different gain-of-function mutants of EGFR kinases. Also, this was demonstrated by selective radiolabeling of the EGFR kinase domain with morpholino-[(131)I]-IPQA in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells and Western blot autoradiography. In vitro radiotracer accumulation and washout studies demonstrated a rapid accumulation and progressive retention postwashout of morpholino-[(131)I]-IPQA in A431 epidermoid carcinoma and in U87 human glioma cells genetically modified to express the EGFRvIII mutant receptor, but not in the wild-type U87MG glioma cells under serum-starved conditions. Using morpholino-[(124)I]-IPQA, we obtained noninvasive PET images of EGFR activity in A431 subcutaneous tumor xenografts, but not in subcutaneous tumor xenografts grown from K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia cells in immunocompromised rats and mice. Based on these observations, we suggest that PET imaging with morpholino-[(124)I]-IPQA should allow for identification of tumors with high EGFR kinase signaling activity, including brain tumors expressing EGFRvIII mutants and nonsmall-cell lung cancer expressing gain-of-function EGFR kinase mutants.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), uncommon in the Chinese, is a disease characterized by impaired apoptosis, of the neoplastic lymphocytes. Hypermethylation of p14, DAP kinase and Apaf-1 was studied by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) with primers for methylated (M-MSP) and unmethylated (U-MSP) alleles in 50 diagnostic marrow samples from patients with CLL. Chinese CLL patients had an indolent course similar to Caucasians with median overall survival (OS) of 96 months, which was adversely affected by advanced Rai stage (projected 5-year OS = 72% and 39% for Rai < or = 2 and Rai > 2; P = 0.01). DAP kinase was methylated in 18 (36%) patients while p14 and Apaf-1 were completely unmethylated in all the primary CLL samples. There was no correlation between DAP kinase hypermethylation and age, sex, poor-risk karyotype, lymphocyte count and Rai stage at diagnosis. Projected OS for patients with and without DAP kinase hypermethylation were 59 and 57% (P = 0.91). DAP kinase, but not p14 and Apaf-1, of the DAP kinase/p14/HDM2/p53/Apaf-1 pathway is frequently hypermethylated in CLL, but not of prognostic significance.

RESULTS: Risk factors were derived from epidemiologic studies of patients treated with irradiation for nonmalignant diseases to be used for selecting treatment options and optimizing treatment procedures.

Diagnosis is based upon elevated platelet counts, morphologically and functionally altered platelets and characteristic bone marrow alterations as well as the exclusion of related myeloproliferative disorders which can also be accompanied by increased platelet counts. Possible disease complications are thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events as well as a transformation into myelofibrosis or acute leukemia. Inhibition of platelet aggregation with aspirin for the prevention of thromboembolic complications is first-line therapy; cytoreductive therapy with drugs such as hydroxyurea or interferon-alpha or thromboreductive therapy with the platelet-reducing agent anagrelide is required when thromboembolic complications are already present at diagnosis (secondary prevention) or when platelet counts are steadily increasing or various additional risk factors are present (primary prevention). Because of the potential adverse effects of the various therapies upon long-term application a strict risk-benefit analysis is mandatory before initiation of therapy. In up to 50% of the patients the recently discovered V617F mutation in the JAK2 gene can be identified which is supposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. CLINICAL STUDIES: Because of the rarity of primary thrombocythemia thus far only two prospectively randomized studies have been carried out to compare cyto- and thromboreductive therapies. In the British PT1 study the mandatory combination of anagrelide with aspirin was compared with the combination of hydroxyurea and aspirin, in the European ANAHYDRET study monotherapy with hydroxyurea was compared with that of anagrelide. This different study design has caused an intense controversy about the results of these studies obtained thus far. CONCLUSION: Due to the existence of randomized clinical studies expert opinion will, in the future, be increasingly replaced by evidence-based therapy guidelines. The improved knowledge of the molecular basis of the disease because of the discovery of the V617F mutation in the JAK2 gene has improved the molecular diagnosis and opened new avenues to molecular-targeted therapies.",,"['Petrides, Petro E']",['Petrides PE'],"['Hamatologisch-Onkologische Schwerpunktpraxis, Munchen, Germany. petrides@onkologiemuenchen.de']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aspirin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Platelet Count', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', '*Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Time Factors']",2006/08/10 09:00,2006/11/14 09:00,['2006/08/10 09:00'],"['2005/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00063-006-1092-y [doi]'],ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 2006 Aug 15;101(8):624-34. doi: 10.1007/s00063-006-1092-y.,,,45,,,,,,,,Primare Thrombozythamie: Diagnose und Therapie.,,,,,,

However, a high recurrence rate after medical treatment has been the most significant problem. BAY 11-7085, a soluble inhibitor of NK-kappaB activation, has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis of a variety of cells. To examine the potential application of BAY 11-7085 in the treatment of endometriosis, we investigated the effects of this agent on the cell proliferation and apoptosis of cultured ovarian endometriotic cyst stromal cells (ECSCs) by a modified methylthiazole tetrazolium assay, a 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation assays. The effect of BAY 11-7085 on the cell cycle of ECSCs was also determined by flow cytometry. The expression of apoptosis-related molecules was examined in ECSCs with Western blot analysis. BAY 11-7085 significantly inhibited the cell proliferation and DNA synthesis of ECSCs and induced apoptosis and the G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest of these cells. Additionally, downregulation of the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-X(L) expression with simultaneous activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 was observed in ECSCs after treatment with BAY 11-7085. These results suggest that BAY 11-7085 induces apoptosis of ECSCs by suppressing antiapoptotic proteins, and that caspase-3-, -8-, and -9-mediated cascades are involved in this mechanism. Therefore, BAY 11-7085 could be used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of endometriosis.",,"['Nasu, Kaei', 'Nishida, Masakazu', 'Ueda, Tami', 'Yuge, Akitoshi', 'Takai, Noriyuki', 'Narahara, Hisashi']","['Nasu K', 'Nishida M', 'Ueda T', 'Yuge A', 'Takai N', 'Narahara H']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan. nasu@med.oita-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,American journal of physiology.

We estimated the long-term risk of subsequent primary tumors after a first primary MCC (1,306 patients) and the risk of second primary MCC following other first primary cancers (2,048,739 patients) within 11 population-based cancer registries which report to the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (1986-2002). Patients with first primary MCC were at significantly increased risk of developing a subsequent cancer [standardized incidence ratio (SIR), 1.22; 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 1.01-1.45; observed (O = 122)], with significant excesses restricted to the first year after diagnosis (SIR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.21-2.33; O = 39). Significantly elevated site-specific risks were observed for cancers of salivary gland (SIR, 11.55; 95% CI, 2.32-33.76; O = 3), biliary sites other than liver and gallbladder (SIR, 7.24; 95% CI, 1.46-21.16; O = 3), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.23-4.71; O = 10). Nonsignificantly increased risks of 2-fold or higher were seen for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and cancers of the small intestine and brain. A significantly increased 1.36-fold risk (95% CI, 1.19-1.55; O = 221) of MCC as a second primary malignancy was observed among patients with all other first primary cancers taken together. In particular, significant 3- to 7-fold excesses of MCC followed multiple myeloma (SIR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.01-9.47; O = 4), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR, 6.89; 95% CI, 3.77-11.57; O = 14), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.93-5.47; O = 16), and malignant melanoma (SIR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.74-4.95; O = 16). Although enhanced medical surveillance may play a role, increased reciprocal risks suggest that MCC may share etiologic influences with other malignancies. Heightened awareness of the associations of lymphohematopoietic malignancies with MCC may facilitate early clinical recognition.",,"['Howard, Regan A', 'Dores, Graca M', 'Curtis, Rochelle E', 'Anderson, William F', 'Travis, Lois B']","['Howard RA', 'Dores GM', 'Curtis RE', 'Anderson WF', 'Travis LB']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD 20892-7238, USA. reganho@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*etiology', 'Registries', 'SEER Program', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis']",2006/08/10 09:00,2006/12/13 09:00,['2006/08/10 09:00'],"['2006/08/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['15/8/1545 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0895 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2006 Aug;15(8):1545-9. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0895.,,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although much attention has been paid to modifying the latter for target cell specificity, the initial binding interaction has been overlooked, despite its opposing involvement both in providing the virus available for receptor binding and in depleting free virus. As a first step towards modifying primary attachment, both to provide specificity and to enhance vector availability, we sought to determine the nature of this interaction. Following an initial screen of GAGs (glycosaminoglycans) for their ability to inhibit virus binding and transduction, we have shown that production of virus from cells in which GAG sulfation is inhibited, or treatment of virus with heparinase III, reduces both particle attachment and infection. Detection in purified virus preparations of a neo-epitope generated by heparinase III confirmed the presence of virus-associated HSPG [HS (heparan sulfate) proteoglycan], acquired from the producer cell. We propose that host-acquired cell-surface HSPG (potentially including syndecan-2) provides a means of virus attachment to target cells that precedes specific receptor interaction and membrane fusion. Inhibition of HS biosynthesis may provide a sufficiently reduced background of primary binding such that novel mechanisms of attachment, ideally with appropriate target cell specificity, can be introduced.",,"['Kureishy, Nina', 'Faruque, Daisy', 'Porter, Colin D']","['Kureishy N', 'Faruque D', 'Porter CD']","['The Institute of Cancer Research, 237 Fulham Road, London SW3 6JB, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,['0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding']",2006/08/10 09:00,2006/12/28 09:00,['2006/08/10 09:00'],"['2006/08/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20060825 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20060825 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2006 Dec 15;400(3):421-30. doi: 10.1042/BJ20060825.,,,,,PMC1698599,,,,,,,,,,,,

When HRQL scores differ between cultural/linguistic groups, it is important to determine whether this reflects real group differences, or is the result of systematic measurement variability. PURPOSE: To investigate the linguistic measurement equivalence of a cancer-specific HRQL questionnaire, and to conduct a sensitivity analysis of treatment differences in HRQL in a clinical trial. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 1049) completed serial HRQL assessments in an international Phase III trial. Two types of differential item functioning (uniform and non-uniform) were evaluated using item response theory and classical test theory approaches. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare HRQL between treatment arms using items without evidence of differential functioning. RESULTS: Among 27 items, nine (33%) did not exhibit any evidence of differential functioning in both linguistic comparisons (English versus French, English versus German). Although 18 items functioned differently, there was no evidence of systematic bias. In a sensitivity analysis, adjustment for differential functioning affected the magnitude, but not the direction or interpretation of clinical trial treatment arm differences. LIMITATIONS: Sufficient sample sizes were available for only three of the eight language groups. Identification of differential functioning in two-thirds of the items suggests that current psychometric methods may be too sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced methodologies are needed to differentiate trivial from substantive differential item functioning. Systematic variability in HRQL across different groups can be evaluated for its effect upon clinical trial results; a practice recommended when data are pooled across cultural or linguistic groups to make conclusions about treatment effects.",,"['Hahn, Elizabeth A', 'Bode, Rita K', 'Du, Hongyan', 'Cella, David']","['Hahn EA', 'Bode RK', 'Du H', 'Cella D']","['Center on Outcomes, Research and Education, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, Evanston, Illinois, USA. e-hahn@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Trials,"Clinical trials (London, England)",101197451,,IM,"['*Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*psychology', '*Linguistics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychometrics', '*Quality of Life', '*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sample Size', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards', 'Translations']",2006/08/10 09:00,2006/11/11 09:00,['2006/08/10 09:00'],"['2006/08/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1191/1740774506cn148oa [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Trials. 2006;3(3):280-90. doi: 10.1191/1740774506cn148oa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy years ago increased medical radiation caused radiologists in the US an excess risk of leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Now medical radiation is rather safe for the physician but the question remains if proper prophylactic measures are being taken to make it safe for the subjects examined. Roughly, first trimester of pregnancy radiography has a much greater fatal cancer risk than that of exposures taken later in pregnancy. It is suggested that women should be administered the minimum activity consistent with achieving the desired clinical information, whether or not they are known to be pregnant. The best available risk estimates suggest that pediatric CT diagnostic procedures will induce significantly increased lifetime radiation risk in children. Professor Roger Clarke wrote that there may be a need to reduce or prevent doses of medical radiation up to 3 mSv if there is no benefit to the individual. 30 mSv is described as ""a dose which should not be exceeded"" and can be approached only if there is a benefit to individuals and the dose is difficult to reduce or prevent. In WHO Category III a) Static brain imaging with technetium-99m pertechnetate, b) Gated cardiac imaging c) Bone imaging with technetium-99m MDP, c) Quantitative haemodynamics with technetium-99m pertechnetate, d) myocardial imaging with thallous-201 chloride and e) abscess imaging with gallium-67 citrate, induce an effective dose equivalent of 5-9 mSv. A CT scan commonly gives 25 mSv to the subject examined.

As HIV-infected individuals live longer due to highly active antiretroviral therapy, their risk of dying from one of these cancers is increased. The recent literature pertaining to non-AIDS-defining cancers is reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent epidemiological studies have identified higher rates of carcinoma of the anus, lung, breast, skin, conjunctiva, liver and prostate; hematopoietic malignancies such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, plasma-cell neoplasia and leukemia; and other neoplasms like melanoma and leiomyosarcoma in HIV-positive patients. The role of HIV-induced immunosuppression in the development of these non-AIDS-defining cancers appears less important than lifestyle habits like smoking and sun exposure, as well as coinfection with human papilloma, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Epstein-Barr viruses. SUMMARY: It is unclear whether the growing number of reports on non-AIDS-defining cancers reflects a true increased incidence or merely the product of increased surveillance, detection and reporting. Highly active antiretroviral therapy not only promotes longevity in the HIV-positive population, but may increase their risk of developing cancer like Hodgkin's lymphoma. Assertive prevention strategies are needed to adequately deal with non-AIDS-defining cancers in an aging and growing HIV-positive population.",,"['Pantanowitz, Liron', 'Schlecht, Hans P', 'Dezube, Bruce J']","['Pantanowitz L', 'Schlecht HP', 'Dezube BJ']","['Department of Pathology, Baystate Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine, Springfield, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Retroviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'Causality', 'Comorbidity', 'HIV Infections/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*virology', 'Risk Factors']",2006/08/09 09:00,2006/12/13 09:00,['2006/08/09 09:00'],"['2006/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cco.0000239886.13537.ed [doi]', '00001622-200609000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2006 Sep;18(5):469-78. doi: 10.1097/01.cco.0000239886.13537.ed.,,,95,['P30 AI 060354/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to determine the role of the E element in ALV-induced pathogenicity, a comparison was made of the oncogenicity of viruses derived from the provirus clones of parental and E element-deleted HPRS-103 viruses in two genetically distinct lines of birds. In line 15I birds, deletion of the E element had profound effects on virus replication in vivo, as only 55 % of birds showed evidence of infection, compared with 100 % infection by the parental virus. Furthermore, none of the line 15I birds infected with this virus developed tumours, indicating that the E element does contribute to the oncogenicity of the virus. On the other hand, deletion of the E element had only a marginal effect on the incidence of tumours in line 0 birds.

More recently, their potential involvement in carcinomas, i.e. prostate cancer, has been recognized. They are among the most important factors in determining disease prognosis, and in many cases, identification of these chromosome abnormalities is crucial in selecting appropriate treatment protocols. Chromosome translocations are frequently observed in both de novo and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The mechanisms that result in such chromosome translocations in leukemia and other cancers are largely unknown. Genomic breakpoints in all the common chromosome translocations in leukemia, including t(4;11), t(9;11), t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), t(12;21), t(1;19) and t(9;22), have been cloned. Genomic breakpoints tend to cluster in certain intronic regions of the relevant genes including MLL, AF4, AF9, AML1, ETO, CBFB, MYHI1, PML, RARA, TEL, E2A, PBX1, BCR and ABL. However, whereas the genomic breakpoints in MLL tend to cluster in the 5' portion of the 8.3 kb breakpoint cluster region (BCR) in de novo and adult patients and in the 3' portion in infant leukemia patients and t-AML patients, those in both the AML1 and ETO genes occur in the same clustered regions in both de novo and t-AML patients. These differences may reflect differences in the mechanisms involved in the formation of the translocations. Specific chromatin structural elements, such as in vivo topoisomerase II (topo II) cleavage sites, DNase I hypersensitive sites and scaffold attachment regions (SARs) have been mapped in the breakpoint regions of the relevant genes. Strong in vivo topo II cleavage sites and DNase I hypersensitive sites often co-localize with each other and also with many of the BCRs in most of these genes, whereas SARs are associated with BCRs in MLL, AF4, AF9, AML1, ETO and ABL, but not in the BCR gene. In addition, the BCRs in MLL, AML1 and ETO have the lowest free energy level for unwinding double strand DNA. Virtually all chromosome translocations in leukemia that have been analyzed to date show no consistent homologous sequences at the breakpoints, whereas a strong non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair signature exists at all of these chromosome translocation breakpoint junctions; this includes small deletions and duplications in each breakpoint, and micro-homologies and non-template insertions at genomic junctions of each chromosome translocation. Surprisingly, the size of these deletions and duplications in the same translocation is much larger in de novo leukemia than in therapy-related leukemia. We propose a non-homologous chromosome recombination model as one of the mechanisms that results in chromosome translocations in leukemia. The topo II cleavage sites at open chromatin regions (DNase I hypersensitive sites), SARs or the regions with low energy level are vulnerable to certain genotoxic or other agents and become the initial breakage sites, which are followed by an excision end joining repair process.",,"['Zhang, Yanming', 'Rowley, Janet D']","['Zhang Y', 'Rowley JD']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, 5841 S.

Late complications may impair the patients' quality of life after cessation of therapy. This study presents evaluation of health status of persons who underwent therapy for pediatric Hodgkin's disease in centers of Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group. The special questionnaire was established to collect data concerning hematopoietic system function, damage of soft tissues and skeletal system, thyroid and reproductive organs function, respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous system function, liver and kidney function, status of dentition, occurrence of infections, immunologic system function, and psychological and social problems. The project included patients treated in 9 pediatric oncology centers.

In 42 patients no diagnostic procedures were performed. In this group 20 patients are currently under care of adult oncology clinics, 21 failed to come for a visit, and one patient is treated because of HD progression.

This article tries to summarize recent efforts to analyze chromosomal changes that trigger the development of human acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemias. The aim of this study was to establish an universal method that enables the identification and characterization of chromosomal translocations of the human MLL gene at the genomic nucleotide level. Chromosomal translocations of the MLL gene are the result of illegitimate recombination events in hematopoietic stem or precursor cells, strictly associated with the onset of highly malignant leukemic diseases. The applied technology was able to identify specific fusion alleles that were generated by chromosomal translocations, chromosomal deletions, chromosomal inversions and partial tandem duplications. Moreover, it allowed us to investigate even highly complex genetic changes by applying systematic breakpoint analyses. On the basis of these analyses, patient-specific molecular markers were established that turned out to be a very good source for monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD). MRD analyses control the efficiency and efficacy of current treatment protocols and have become a very sensitive molecular tool to monitor therapeutic success or failure in individual leukemia patients.",,"['Meyer, Claus', 'Kowarz, Eric', 'Schneider, Bjorn', 'Oehm, Clarissa', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Dingermann, Theo', 'Marschalek, Rolf']","['Meyer C', 'Kowarz E', 'Schneider B', 'Oehm C', 'Klingebiel T', 'Dingermann T', 'Marschalek R']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, ZAFES, Diagnostic Center of Acute Leukemia, JWG-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Biotechnol J,Biotechnology journal,101265833,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology/genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors']",2006/08/08 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/08/08 09:00'],"['2006/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/biot.200600037 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol J. 2006 Jun;1(6):656-63. doi: 10.1002/biot.200600037.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed three haematopoietic stem cell donor sources used for alternative donor transplantation pointing out drawbacks of these approaches including inherent selection bias. Matched unrelated donor allografts most often are performed in Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease and in second complete remission (CR2); a nearly 30% event-free survival (EFS) can be anticipated in select patients. Transplants using haploidentical donors are most successful if undertaken in CR1 and CR2 and appear to produce EFS rates of about 25%. Limited umbilical cord blood transplant data suggest efficacy, but marked patient and treatment heterogeneity hamper conclusions. Each of these three strategies has unique potential benefits and disadvantages. The growing use of minimal residual disease detection may identify subgroups of patients unlikely to be cured by chemotherapy alone; these patients are candidates for upfront high-dose chemoradiotherapy and cellular immunotherapy.

The most commonly known AML1-ETO fusion protein (full-length AML1-ETO) from this translocation has 752 amino acids and contains the N-terminal portion of RUNX1 (also known as AML1, CBFalpha2 or PEBP2alphaB), including its DNA binding domain, and almost the entire RUNX1T1 (also known as MTG8 or ETO) protein. Although alterations of gene expression and hematopoietic cell proliferation have been reported in the presence of AML1-ETO, its expression does not lead to the development of leukemia. Here, we report the identification of a previously unknown alternatively spliced isoform of the AML1-ETO transcript, AML1-ETO9a, that includes an extra exon, exon 9a, of the ETO gene. AML1-ETO9a encodes a C-terminally truncated AML1-ETO protein of 575 amino acids. Expression of AML1-ETO9a leads to rapid development of leukemia in a mouse retroviral transduction-transplantation model. More importantly, coexpression of AML1-ETO and AML1-ETO9a results in the substantially earlier onset of AML and blocks myeloid cell differentiation at a more immature stage.

The growth pattern of cells in microcapsule was examined by phase-contrast micrography. The cell viability, proliferation, organization, and gene expression were evaluated by 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, hematoxylin and eosin staining, live/dead staining, 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine labeling, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Cell metabolism was determined by measuring glucose and lactate concentrations in medium. The results demonstrate that APA microcapsule with liquefied core provides a microenvironment for both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent cells to grow into a large cell aggregate and maintain cell viability at a constant level for a period of time.

However, some tumor cells, including leukemia cells, exhibit resistance to this molecule. To investigate the basis for resistance of leukemia cells to the zinc-bound form of Apo2 ligand (Apo2L)/TRAIL, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trial, we isolated several resistant HL60 clones from parental HL60 cells by selection using the recombinant Apo2L/TRAIL. Differing resistance mechanisms were identified and characterized in these Apo2L/TRAIL-resistant clones. In one case, the level of the cell-surface death receptor DR4, but not DR5, was significantly decreased. However, these cells did undergo apoptosis in response to another form of recombinant TRAIL, histidine-tagged TRAIL, suggesting differing contributions of DR4 and DR5 in the response to these two forms of TRAIL. In the case of other clones, expression of procaspase-8 protein was lost and this was associated with a novel Leu(22)-->Phe(22) point mutation in CASP-8 gene.

However, the reversible proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (PS-341; Velcade) did not display substantial antitumor activity in CLL patients. Here, we compared the effects of bortezomib and a new irreversible proteasome inhibitor (NPI-0052) on 20S chymotryptic proteasome activity and apoptosis in isolated CLL cells in vitro. Although their steady-state (3 hours) IC(50)s as proteasome inhibitors were similar, NPI-0052 exerted its effects more rapidly than bortezomib, and drug washout experiments showed that short exposures to NPI-0052 resulted in sustained (> or =24 hours) 20S proteasome inhibition, whereas 20S activity recovered in cells exposed to even 10-fold higher concentrations of bortezomib. Thus, brief (15 minutes) pulses of NPI-0052 were sufficient to induce substantial apoptosis in CLL cells, whereas longer exposure times (> or =8 hours) were required for commitment to apoptosis in cells exposed to equivalent concentrations of bortezomib. Commitment to apoptosis seemed to be related to caspase-4 activation, in that cells exposed to bortezomib or NPI-0052 could be saved from death by addition of a selective caspase-4 inhibitor up to 8 hours after drug exposure.

On the other hand, death receptor 5 (DR5) is a specific receptor for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which is one of the most promising candidates for new cancer therapeutics. Here, we report that 15d-PGJ(2) induces DR5 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, resulting in the synergistic sensitization of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human neoplastic cells, such as Jurkat human leukemia cells or PC3 human prostate cancer cells. 15d-PGJ(2) significantly increased DR5 mRNA stability, whereas it did not activate DR5 promoter activity. Synthetic PPARgamma agonists, such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, did not mimic the DR5-inducing effects of 15d-PGJ(2), and a potent PPARgamma inhibitor GW9662 failed to block DR5 induction by 15d-PGJ(2), suggesting PPARgamma-independent mechanisms. Cotreatment with 15d-PGJ(2) and TRAIL enhanced the sequential activation of caspase-8, caspase-10, caspase-9, caspase-3, and Bid. DR5/Fc chimera protein, zVAD-fmk pancaspase inhibitor, and caspase-8 inhibitor efficiently blocked the activation of these apoptotic signal mediators and the induction of apoptotic cell death enhanced by cotreatment with 15d-PGJ(2) and TRAIL. Moreover, a double-stranded small interfering RNA targeting DR5 gene, which suppressed DR5 up-regulation by 15d-PGJ(2), significantly attenuated apoptosis induced by cotreatment with 15d-PGJ(2) and TRAIL.

This gives the transformed cells a proliferative advantage over normal hematopoietic cells. Silencing the BCR/ABL oncogene by treatment with specific drugs remains an important therapeutic goal. In this work, we used locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified oligonucleotides to silence BCR/ABL and reduce CML cell proliferation, as these oligonucleotides are resistant to nucleases and exhibit an exceptional affinity for cognate RNA. The anti-BCR/ABL oligonucleotides were designed as LNA-DNA gapmers, consisting of end blocks of 3/4 LNA monomers and a central DNA stretch of 13/14 deoxyribonucleotides. The gapmers were complementary to the b2a2 and b3a2 mRNA junctions with which they form hybrid duplexes that have melting temperatures of 79 degrees C and 75 degrees C, respectively, in a 20 mmol/L NaCl-buffered (pH 7.4) solution. Like DNA, the designed LNA-DNA gapmers were capable of activating RNase H and promote cleavage of the target b2a2 and b3a2 BCR/ABL mRNAs. The treatment of CML cells with junction-specific antisense gapmers resulted in a strong and specific reduction of the levels of BCR/ABL transcripts ( approximately 20% of control) and protein p210(BCR/ABL) ( approximately 30% of control). Moreover, the antisense oligonucleotides suppressed cell growth up to 40% of control and induced apoptosis, as indicated by the increase of caspase-3/7 activity in the treated cells. Finally, the b2a2-specific antisense gapmer used in combination with STI571 (imatinib mesylate), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of p210(BCR/ABL), produced an enhanced antiproliferative effect in KYO-1 cells, which compared with K562 cells are refractory to STI571.

APL patients are initially treated with retinoic acid, but most develop resistance and relapse. In contrast, ATO induces prolonged remissions even in the relapsed cases. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ATO kills the leukemic cells are not fully understood. We find that ATO induces apoptosis, at least in part, by activating proapoptotic kinase Chk2. ATO does this by stimulating ATR (ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related) kinase, a Chk2-activating kinase. In conjunction, ATO degrades PML-RARalpha, resulting in the restoration of PML, which is required for autophosphorylation and full activation of Chk2. As a result, the p53-dependent apoptosis pathway is activated. Based on this, we propose that a pathway composed of ATR, PML, Chk2, and p53 plays a role in ATO-mediated apoptosis, a notion that is consistent with the observation that Chk2 is genetically intact and mutations in the p53 gene are extremely rare in APL.",,"['Joe, Yeonsoo', 'Jeong, Jae-Hoon', 'Yang, Shutong', 'Kang, Hyeog', 'Motoyama, Noburu', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Chung, Jay H', 'Kim, Myung K']","['Joe Y', 'Jeong JH', 'Yang S', 'Kang H', 'Motoyama N', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Chung JH', 'Kim MK']","['Laboratory of Biochemical Genetics, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Atr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",2006/08/08 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/08/08 09:00'],"['2006/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)33968-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M604392200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Sep 29;281(39):28764-71. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M604392200.

OBJECTIVE: To identify a 5p-linked asthma or bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) locus. METHODS: We performed fine mapping and positional candidate studies of this region in the Hutterites and an outbred case-control sample from Germany by genotyping 89 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 22 genes. SNP and haplotype analyses were performed. RESULTS: Three genes in a distal region (zinc finger RNA binding protein [ZFR], natriuretic peptide receptor C, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin type 1 motif [ADAMTS12]) were associated with BHR, whereas 4 genes in a proximal region (prolactin receptor, IL-7 receptor [IL7R], leukemia inhibitory factor receptor [LIFR], and prostaglandin E4 receptor [PTGER4]) were associated with asthma symptoms in the Hutterites. Furthermore, nearly the entire original linkage signal in the Hutterites was generated by individuals who had the risk-associated alleles in ZFR3, natriuretic peptide receptor C, ADAMTS12, LIFR, and PTGER4. Variation in ADAMTS12, IL7R, and PTGER4 were also associated with asthma in the outbred Germans, and the frequencies of long-range haplotypes composed of SNPs at ZFR, ADAMTS12, IL7R, LIFR, and PTGER4 were significantly different between both the German and Hutterite cases and controls. There is little linkage disequilbrium between alleles in these 2 regions in either population. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a broad region on 5p, separated by >9 Mb, harbors at least 2 and possibly 5 asthma or BHR susceptibility loci. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that regions providing evidence for linkage in multiple populations may, in fact, house more than 1 susceptibility locus, as appears to be the case for the linked region on 5p.

HIV-1 Vif protein counteracts A3G via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In the case of a simple retrovirus such as the murine leukemia virus (MLV), it remains unclear why it can replicate in cells expressing APOBEC3 (A3) even though it doesn't possess any accessory proteins such as Vif. In this study, we demonstrate that MLV escapes from murine A3 (mA3) via two distinct novel mechanisms. First, viral RNA (vRNA) blocks the binding of mA3 to Gag, resulting in the exclusion of mA3 from MLV virions. Second, viral protease (vPR) cleaves mA3 after maturation of virions. Here, we suggest that each virus has its own strategy to escape from A3 proteins and that these mechanisms might be used by other viruses that do not possess Vif-like protein. On the other hand, mice possess another form of mA3, delta exon5, that escapes from the cleavage by vPR to show more antiviral activity than the wild type mA3. This also suggests that battles between host intrinsic immunity and viruses have led to the evolution of proteins on both sides.",,"['Abudu, Aierken', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Izumi, Taisuke', 'Shirakawa, Kotaro', 'Kobayashi, Masayuki', 'Sasada, Amane', 'Fukunaga, Keiko', 'Uchiyama, Takashi']","['Abudu A', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Izumi T', 'Shirakawa K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Sasada A', 'Fukunaga K', 'Uchiyama T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-Kawaracho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Virion/*genetics']",2006/08/08 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/08/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(06)01782-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cub.2006.06.055 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 2006 Aug 8;16(15):1565-70. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2006.06.055.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The RAD51 135 and 172 variants were in strong linkage disequilibrium, with three out of the four possible haplotypes being observed in the population.

HTLV-1 pX ORF-II encodes two proteins, p13II and p30II, which are incompletely defined in virus replication or pathogenesis. We have demonstrated that pX ORF-II mutations block virus replication in vivo and that ORF-II encoded p30II, a nuclear-localizing protein that binds with CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, represses CREB and Tax responsive element (TRE)-mediated transcription.

Within amino acids 100-179 of p30II, a region important for repression of LTR-mediated transcription, we identified a single lysine residue at amino acid 106 (K3) that significantly modulates the ability of p30II to repress TRE-mediated transcription. Exogenous p300, in a dose-responsive manner, reverses p30II-dependent repression of TRE-mediated transcription, in the absence or presence of the provirus, In contrast to wild type p300, p300 HAT mutants (defective in histone acetyltransferase activity) only partially rescued p30(II)-mediated LTR repression. Deacetylation by histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1) enhanced p30II-mediated LTR repression, while inhibition of deacetylation by trichostatin A decreases p30(II)-mediated LTR repression. Collectively, our data indicate that HTLV-1 p30II modulates viral gene expression in a cooperative manner with p300-mediated acetylation.",,"['Michael, Bindhu', 'Nair, Amrithraj M', 'Datta, Antara', 'Hiraragi, Hajime', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Lairmore, Michael D']","['Michael B', 'Nair AM', 'Datta A', 'Hiraragi H', 'Ratner L', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (tof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)']",IM,"['CREB-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/virology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors']",2006/08/08 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/08/08 09:00'],"['2005/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2006/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(06)00440-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2006.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2006 Oct 25;354(2):225-39. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.07.002.

NER was measured in several human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, before and after differentiation into macrophage-like cells. Repair of cisplatin intrastrand GTG crosslinks in differentiated cells was strongly attenuated. There were also some variations between repair levels in naive cells, but these were not correlated with the degree of differentiation. By contrast, the proficient repair of UV-induced (6-4)pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts [(6-4)PPs] was not affected by differentiation. Although cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) were poorly repaired at the global genome level in all cell lines, differentiated or not, they were very efficiently removed from the transcribed strand of an active gene, indicating that transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is proficient in each cell line. CPDs were also removed from the non-transcribed strand of an active gene better than at the overall global genome level. This relatively efficient repair of the non-transcribed strand of active genes, when compared with global genomic repair (GGR), has been described previously in neuron-like cells and termed differentiation-associated repair (DAR).

Herein, we examined the effects of violacein on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during the apoptotic colon cancer cell death. We demonstrate that violacein mediates ROS production followed by activation of Caspase-3, release of cytochrome c, and calcium release to citosol in Caco-2 cells. Moreover, presence of ROS scavengers such as N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) diminishes ROS cytotoxicity induced by violacein in Caco-2 cells, indicating that violacein mediates cellular critical mechanisms in the triggering of apoptotic tumor cell death. These data also imply that violacein-induced ROS are collectively key mediators of mitochondrial membrane collapse, leading to cytochrome c release, and culminating in tumor apoptosis. Unlike in Caco-2 cells, violacein was incapable of increasing ROS levels in HT29 cells, suggesting the existence of violacein cell-type specific mechanisms.

By cytogenetics two major groups of AML can be discriminated: One group with detectable chromosomal aberrations accounting for approximately 52 % of all de novo AML and the second group without cytogenetically detectable karyotype abnormalities. In the first group two major subtypes can be further distinguished. The first group comprises AML with balanced aberrations mainly consisting in t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16). The second group comprizes cases with unbalanced aberrations including particularly 5q-, 17q- -5 and AML with complex karyotypes. AMLs with balanced aberrations have a good prognosis with long term survival being achieved in approximately 60 %-80 % of cases. AMLs with non-balanced aberrations on the other hand have a poor prognosis with only 10 %-15 % long-term survivors. AMLs with no detectable abnormalities or other cytogenetic aberrations comprise a group with an intermediate prognosis in which long term survival is achieved in approximately 25 %-30 % of cases. Biologically, AMLs with balanced aberrations regularly involve the deregulation of transcription factors resulting in an impairment of cell differentiation and proliferation. AMLs with unbalanced aberrations are mostly characterized by a loss of genetic material resulting in an alteration of cell cycle control and DNA repair. A new view on the biology of AML has recently been made possible through the analysis of gene expression profiles. This technique is still under investigation. First results, however, already show that gene expression patterns have a high diagnostic potential and allow to detect biology subgroups with a high accuracy. Furthermore, by this technique pathways can be identified that are altered in the leukemic process.

CsA was started at 3.0 mg/kg/day and the dose was adjusted to maintain the blood CsA concentration between 250 and 350 ng/ml. The actual dose of CsA averaged 1.9 mg/kg/day at the 3rd week after transplantation. The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 29.9%. Patient age and sex were identified as independent significant risk factors for acute GVHD. The CsA concentration during the 3rd week after transplantation most strongly affected the incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (RR 0.995 for an increase in CsA concentration by 1 ng/ml, P = 0.037) adjusted for other risk factors.

We performed a systematic review on literature concerning vaccination data of children with ALL published since 1980. Eight studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Regarding antibody titers after treatment, the number of children who had preserved the defined protection level for antibodies differed widely, ranging from 17 to 98% for diphtheria, 27 to 82% for Bordetella pertussis, 20 to 98% for tetanus, 62 to 100% for poliomyelitis, 35 to 100% for Haemophilus influenzae type B (HiB), 29 to 92% for mumps, 29 to 60% for measles and 72 to 92% for rubella.

Whereas patients who receive either allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplants for multiple myeloma have similar 3-5-year survival, only allograft recipients appear to enjoy long-term disease-free survival. High transplant-related mortality (TRM) associated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation is currently the major limitation to wider use of this potentially curative modality. This high mortality has been the major impetus for exploration of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens designed to allow engraftment of allogeneic stem cells. With follow-up now extending to 7 years, it is clear that when compared to myeloablative transplants, RIC allografts are associated with lower TRM; however, reduced mortality comes at a cost of higher rates of disease progression and relapse. Strategies designed to improve the therapeutic index of allografts include the use of more intensive, yet still non-myeloablative conditioning regimens, tandem autologous plus RIC allografts, peripheral blood cells rather than bone marrow, graft engineering to improve the GVM activity while reducing graft-versus-host disease, post-transplant maintenance and targeted conditioning therapies such as bone-seeking radioisotopes.",,"['Bensinger, W I']",['Bensinger WI'],"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. wbensing@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/*trends', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/08/05 09:00,2006/11/09 09:00,['2006/08/05 09:00'],"['2006/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404333 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404333 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Oct;20(10):1683-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404333.

Immature sub-populations of human CD34+38- hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) can be identified in vitro based on their growth kinetics and telomere length. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry (flow-FISH) has been used to characterize telomere length dynamics as a surrogate marker for HSC turnover in vivo. Investigations in normal steady-state hematopoiesis provided the basis for follow-up studies in model scenarios characterized by increased HSC turnover. Disorders with underlying malignant transformation of HSC (e.g., chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)) can be discriminated from disease states with increased HSC turnover rates secondary to depletion of the stem cell compartment, for example, as in defined bone marrow failure syndromes. In some of these model scenarios, the degree of telomere shortening can be correlated with disease duration, disease stage and severity as well as with response to disease-modifying treatment strategies. Whether increased telomere shortening represents a causal link between HSC turnover, replicative senescence and/or the induction of genetic instability in acquired HSC disorders remains to be shown. However, data from congenital disorders, like dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), suggest that disturbed telomere maintenance may play a role for replicative exhaustion of the HSC pool in vivo.",,"['Brummendorf, T H', 'Balabanov, S']","['Brummendorf TH', 'Balabanov S']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology with Sections Bone Marrow Transplantation and Pneumology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. t.bruemmendorf@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Telomere/*pathology']",2006/08/05 09:00,2006/11/09 09:00,['2006/08/05 09:00'],"['2006/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404339 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404339 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Oct;20(10):1706-16. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404339.

However, routine detection of MYC translocations is often hampered by the wide variation in breakpoint location within the MYC region, particularly when a gene other than IGH, such as IGK or IGL, is involved. To address this issue, we developed and validated four fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes: two break apart probes to detect IGK and IGL translocations, and two dual-color, dual-fusion FISH (D-FISH) probes to detect IGK-MYC and IGL-MYC. MYC rearrangements (four IGK-MYC, 12 IGL-MYC and four unknown partner gene-MYC) were correctly identified in 20 of 20 archival BCL specimens known to have MYC rearrangements not involving IGH. Seven specimens, all of which lacked MYC rearrangements using a commercial IGH/MYC D-FISH probe, were found to have 8q24 breakpoints within a cluster region >350-645 kb 3' from MYC, provisionally designated as Burkitt variant rearrangement region 2 (BVR2). FISH is a useful ancillary tool in identifying MYC rearrangements.

Here we report the use of the known immunosuppressive neuropeptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), as a new approach to inducing tolerogenic DCs with the capacity to prevent acute GVHD. DCs differentiated with VIP impair allogeneic haplotype-specific responses of donor CD4+ T cells in transplanted mice by inducing the generation of Tr in the graft. Importantly, VIP-induced tolerogenic DCs did not abrogate the graft versus leukemia response, probably because they do not abrogate cytotoxicity of transplanted T cells against the leukemic cells.

We found that low CXCR4 expression on AML cells correlated with a better prognosis, resulting in a longer relapse-free and overall survival of 24.3+/-2.9 months for low CXCR4-expressing patients, compared with 17.4+/-3.4 months for intermediate and 12.8+/-2 months (mean+/-SEM) for patients with high expression. In univariate analyses, CXCR4 expression, cytogenetics, white blood cell count, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) predicted for shorter survival. Multivariate analysis revealed CXCR4 expression and unfavorable cytogenetics as independent prognostic factors.

However, relatively few studies of hematopoiesis have focused on the role of the retinoid X receptors (RXRs), the obligate heterodimeric partners of the RARs. We sought to establish whether conditional targeting of RXRalpha in early hematopoietic progenitors, ideally to the level of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), would compromise hematopoiesis. For hematopoietic targeting of RXRalpha, we characterized IFN-inducible MxCre mice for use in studying the role of RXRalpha in hematopoiesis. We established that MxCre executes recombination of loxP-flanked RXRalpha in hematopoietic progenitors immunophenotypically enriched for HSC, leading to widespread and sustained targeting of RXRalpha in hematopoietic cells. However, we found no evidence of hematologic compromise in mice lacking RXRalpha, suggesting that RXRalpha is dispensable for normal murine hematopoiesis. Nonetheless, RXRalpha null bone marrow cells cultured in methylcellulose form colonies more efficiently than bone marrow cells obtained from control mice. This result suggests that although RXRalpha is not required for murine hematopoiesis, there may be hematopoietic signaling pathways that respond selectively to RXRalpha or settings in which combined expression of RXR (alpha, beta, and gamma) is limiting.",,"['Ricote, Mercedes', 'Snyder, Cynthia S', 'Leung, Ho-Yin', 'Chen, Ju', 'Chien, Kenneth R', 'Glass, Christopher K']","['Ricote M', 'Snyder CS', 'Leung HY', 'Chen J', 'Chien KR', 'Glass CK']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, La Jolla, San Diego, USA. mricote@cnic.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Retinoid X Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptor beta)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptor gamma)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoiesis/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Integrases/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'RNA/genetics', 'Retinoid X Receptor alpha/genetics/*immunology', 'Retinoid X Receptor beta/genetics/immunology', 'Retinoid X Receptor gamma/genetics/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",2006/08/05 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2006/08/05 09:00'],"['2006/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0206097 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0206097 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2006 Oct;80(4):850-61. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0206097.

Type I mutations generated two truncated molecules, one intracellular (IC) (Notch1(IC)) and one extracellular (Notch1(EC)), while in type II mutations Notch1 was deleted of its C terminus (Notch1(DeltaCT)). We expressed these mutants in Tg mice using the CD4 promoter. Both Notch1(IC) and Notch1(DeltaCT), but not Notch1(EC), Tg mice developed double-positive (DP) thymomas. These disseminated more frequently in Notch1(DeltaCT) Tg mice. Double (Notch1(IC) x myc) or (Notch1(DeltaCT) x myc) Tg mice developed thymoma with a much shorter latency than single Tg mice, providing genetic evidence of a collaboration between these two oncogenes. FACS analysis of preleukemic thymocytes did not reveal major T cell differentiation anomalies, except for a higher number of DP cells and an accumulation of TCR(high)CD2(high)CD25(high) DP cells in Notch1(IC), and less so in Notch1(DeltaCT) Tg mice. This was associated with enhanced in vivo thymocyte proliferation. However, Notch1(IC), but not Notch1(DeltaCT), DP thymocytes were protected against apoptosis induced in vivo by dexamethasone and anti-CD3 and in vitro by anti-CD3/CD28 Abs. This indicates that the C terminus of Notch1 and/or the conserved regulation by its ligands have a significant impact on the induced T cell phenotype.

Using natural history cohorts and tissue culture systems, we examined the effect of polymorphism in human TRIM5alpha on HIV-1 infection. In African Americans, the frequencies of two non-coding SNP variant alleles in exon 1 and intron 1 of TRIM5 were elevated in HIV-1-infected persons compared with uninfected subjects. By contrast, the frequency of the variant allele encoding TRIM5alpha 136Q was relatively elevated in uninfected individuals, suggesting a possible protective effect. TRIM5alpha 136Q protein exhibited slightly better anti-HIV-1 activity in tissue culture than the TRIM5alpha R136 protein. The 43Y variant of TRIM5alpha was less efficient than the H43 variant at restricting HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus infections in cultured cells.

Lack of health economics data on aspects of pharmacogenetics is perceived as one of the barriers hindering its implementation for improving drug safety. Thus, a recent Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) study, entitled 'Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics: state-of-the-art and potential socio-economic impact in the EU' included an explorative cost-effectiveness review for a pharmacogenetic treatment strategy compared with traditional medical practice. The selected case study examined the cost-effectiveness of thiopurine methyltransferase (TMPT) genotyping prior to thiopurine treatment in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Information for the cost-effectiveness model parameters was collected from literature surveys and interviews with experts from four European countries (Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK). The model has established that TPMT testing in ALL patients has a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio. This conclusion was based on parameters collected for TPMT genotyping costs, estimates for frequency of TMPT deficiency, rates of thiopurine-mediated myelosuppression in TPMT-deficient individuals, and myelosuppression-related hospitalization costs in each of the four countries studied. The mean calculated cost per life-year gained by TPMT genotyping in ALL patients in the four study countries was euro 2100 (or euro 4800 after 3% discount) based on genotyping costs of euro 150 per patient. Cost per life-year gained is expected to further improve following the introduction of the wider use of TMPT genotyping and the availability of lower cost genotyping methods.

Germline variants of these 'leukemia pathway' genes may cooperate with somatic mutations to induce both de novo and therapy-related AML. Several cancer susceptibility syndromes have been identified that cause an inherited predisposition to de novo and t-AML. The genes responsible for these syndromes are also somatically mutated in sporadic AML.

Calcitriol has strong antiproliferative effects in prostate, breast, colorectal, head/neck and lung cancer, as well as lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma model systems. Antiproliferative effects are seen in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms of these effects are associated with G0/G1 arrest, induction of apoptosis, differentiation and modulation of growth factor-mediated signaling in tumor cells. In addition to the direct effects on tumor cells, recent data strongly support the hypothesis that the stromal effects of vitamin D analogs (e.g., direct effects on tumor vasculature) are also important in the antiproliferative effects. Antitumor effects are seen in a wide variety of tumor types and there are few data to suggest that vitamin D-based approaches are more effective in any one tumor type. Glucocorticoids potentiate the antitumor effect of calcitriol and decrease calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia. In addition, calcitriol potentiates the antitumor effects of many cytotoxic agents. Preclinical data indicate that maximal antitumor effects are seen with pharmacological doses of calcitriol and that such exposure can be safely achieved in animals using a high dose, intermittent schedule of administration. AUC and C(max) calcitriol concentrations of 32 ng.h/ml and 9.2 ng/ml are associated with striking antitumor effects in a murine squamous cell carcinoma model and there is increasing evidence from clinical trials that such exposures can be safely attained in patients. Another approach to maximizing intra-tumoral exposure to vitamin D analogs is to inhibit their catabolism. The data clearly indicate that agents which inhibit the major vitamin D catabolizing enzyme, CYP24 (24 hydroxylase), potentiate calcitriol killing of prostate tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Phase I and II trials of calcitriol, either alone or in combination with carboplatin, taxanes or dexamethasone, as well as the non-specific CYP24 inhibitor, ketoconazole, have been initiated in patients with androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer and other advanced cancers. The data indicate that high-dose calcitriol is feasible on an intermittent schedule, no dose-limiting toxicity has been encountered, but the optimal dose and schedule remain to be delineated. Clinical responses have been seen with the combination of high-dose calcitriol + dexamethasone in androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) and, in a large randomized trial in men with AIPC, potentiation of the antitumor effects of docetaxel were seen.",,"['Trump, Donald L', 'Muindi, Josephia', 'Fakih, Marwan', 'Yu, Wei-Dong', 'Johnson, Candace S']","['Trump DL', 'Muindi J', 'Fakih M', 'Yu WD', 'Johnson CS']","['Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. donald.trump@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,['FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*prevention & control']",2006/08/05 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/08/05 09:00'],"['2006/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2006 Jul-Aug;26(4A):2551-6.,,,,"['CA112914/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA67267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms and selected clinical implications of different cancer vaccines used in pediatric and adult leukemias are discussed. Escape of neoplasmatic cells from elimination by host cells can be caused by immunological disturbances, such as the production of immunosuppressive cytokines and downregulation of costimulatory and adhesion molecules. Cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia can be induced into antigen-presenting cells with the CD40 ligation system. After CD40 stimulation, leukemic cells achieve the phenotypic and functional characteristics of dendritic cells. In many studies it was confimed that these cells stimulate auto- and/or allogeneic T-cell response. Immunological response can be of cellular and humoral origin and is extensively examined. Similar effects using different cytokines such as GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, and IL-4 can be observed in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Clinical experience with such vaccines is limited, but the results of some preliminary reports are quite promising.

To investigate the mechanism underlying this differentiation and the synergistic effect of ATRA and GM-CSF, we used cDNA microarray to examine gene expression profiles of ML-1 cells treated with ATRA and/or GM-CSF. We identified 22 up-regulated genes in ML-1 cells treated with both reagents and examined the expression of these genes in cells treated with ATRA and/or GM-CSF by Northern blot analysis. Comparison of cells treated with both reagents and cells treated with ATRA or GM-CSF alone revealed that expression of nine of the 19 genes was induced synergistically by combined treatment with ATRA and GM-CSF. Expression of most of these genes was increased only slightly by ATRA alone, and this induction was enhanced by the addition of GM-CSF. These results indicate that GM-CSF enhances ATRA-induced gene expression. Moreover, studies with inhibitors of signaling molecules suggested that activation of JAK2 is associated with the synergistic induction of several genes by ATRA and GM-CSF. JAK2 inhibitor suppressed induction of NBT-reducing activity in ML-1 cells treated with both reagents. It is likely that the enhancer effect of GM-CSF on ATRA-induced gene expression leads to the differentiation induced synergistically by ATRA combined with GM-CSF.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the clinical, therapeutic, and pathogenetic importance of c-Abl in this disease. We show that the malignant cells of CLL predominantly express the type 1b splice variant of c-Abl and that the expression of c-Abl protein is higher in CLL cells than in normal peripheral blood B cells. Moreover, we show that the levels of c-Abl protein expression correlate positively with tumor burden and disease stage, and negatively with IgV(H) mutation. We also show that STI-571, an inhibitor of c-Abl kinase activity, induces apoptosis of CLL cells with high c-Abl expression levels through a mechanism involving inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB.

In this study, we evaluated the role of B cells in the development of antitumor immunity using Friend murine leukemia virus gag-expressing mouse EL-4 (EL-4 gag), D5 mouse melanoma, or MCA304 mouse sarcoma cells. To screen tumors for susceptibility to B-cell-deficient immune environments, spleen cells from naive C57BL/6 [wild-type (WT)] and B-cell knockout (BKO) mice were cultured with irradiated tumor cells in vitro. When cells were stimulated with EL-4 gag or D5 (but not MCA304 tumors), IFN-gamma production from CD8 T cells and natural killer cells was markedly decreased in WT compared with BKO cultures. IFN-gamma production was correlated with CD40 ligand expression on the tumor and inversely with interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by B cells. Sorted WT B cells produced more IL-10 than CD40 knockout (CD40KO) B cells when cocultured with EL-4 gag or D5 (but not MCA304). IFN-gamma production by BKO cells was reduced by the addition of sorted naive WT B cells (partially by CD40KO B cells) or recombinant mouse IL-10. In vivo tumor progression mirrored in vitro studies in that WT mice were unable to control tumor growth whereas EL-4 gag and D5 tumors (but not MCA304) were eliminated in BKO mice. Robust in vivo antitumor CTLs developed only in BKO tumor-challenged mice. Our studies provide the first mechanistic basis for the concept that B-cell depletion could therapeutically enhance antitumor immune responses to certain tumors by decreasing IL-10 production from B cells.",,"['Inoue, Satoshi', 'Leitner, Wolfgang W', 'Golding, Basil', 'Scott, Dorothy']","['Inoue S', 'Leitner WW', 'Golding B', 'Scott D']","['Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Division of Hematology, Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (CD8alpha antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Interleukin-10/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology']",2006/08/04 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/08/04 09:00'],"['2006/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/15/7741 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3766 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Aug 1;66(15):7741-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3766.,,['Cancer Res. 2007 May 15;67(10):5058-9; author reply 5059.

DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted between 1999 and 2003 to 18 hematology wards in Italy. Each participating center provided information on all patients with newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies admitted during the survery period and on all episodes of IFI experienced by these patients. RESULTS: The cohort was formed of 11,802 patients with hematologic malignacies: acute leukemia (myeloid 3012, lymphoid 1173), chronic leukemia (myeloid 596, lymphoid 1104), lymphoma (Hodgkin's 844, non-Hodgkin's 3457), or multiple myeloma (1616). There were 538 proven or probable IFI (4.6%); 373 (69%) occurred in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Over half (346/538) were caused by molds (2.9%), in most cases Aspergillus spp. (310/346). The 192 yeast infections (1.6%) included 175 cases of candidemia. Overall and IFI-attributable mortality rates were 2% (209/11802) and 39% (209/538), respectively. The highest IFI-attributable mortality rates were associated with zygomycosis (64%) followed by fusariosis (53%), aspergillosis (42%), and candidemia (33%). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hematologic malignancies are currently at higher risk of IFI caused by molds than by yeasts, and the incidence of IFI is highest among patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Aspergillus spp are still the most common pathogens, followed by Candida spp. Other agents are rare. The attributable mortality rate for aspergillosis has dropped from 60-70% to approximately 40%. Candidemia-related mortality remains within the 30-40% range reported in literature although the incidence has decreased.",,"['Pagano, Livio', 'Caira, Morena', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Offidani, Massimo', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Pastore, Domenico', 'Picardi, Marco', 'Bonini, Alessandro', 'Chierichini, Anna', 'Fanci, Rosa', 'Caramatti, Cecilia', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela', 'Mattei, Daniele', 'Mitra, Maria Enza', 'Melillo, Lorella', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Van Lint, Maria Teresa', 'Falcucci, Paolo', 'Valentini, Caterina Giovanna', 'Girmenia, Corrado', 'Nosari, Annamaria']","['Pagano L', 'Caira M', 'Candoni A', 'Offidani M', 'Fianchi L', 'Martino B', 'Pastore D', 'Picardi M', 'Bonini A', 'Chierichini A', 'Fanci R', 'Caramatti C', 'Invernizzi R', 'Mattei D', 'Mitra ME', 'Melillo L', 'Aversa F', 'Van Lint MT', 'Falcucci P', 'Valentini CG', 'Girmenia C', 'Nosari A']","['Istituto di Ematologi, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Largo Francesco Vito, 1, I-00168 Rome, Italy. lpagano@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Candidiasis/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/classification/complications/*immunology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Mycoses/classification/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/08/04 09:00,2006/09/28 09:00,['2006/08/04 09:00'],"['2006/08/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Aug;91(8):1068-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, treatment must be tailored to the patient's living conditions and the availability of supportive care. In some cases, a more intense regimen will decrease survival since the increase in death from toxicity may exceed any decrease in relapse. Attempts to practice evidence-based pediatric oncology are thwarted by the lack of evidence derived from local experience in LIC to determine optimal therapy. This report summarizes treatment regimens used by pediatric oncologists from 15 countries of the Caribbean, Central and South America who participate in the Monza International School of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (MISPHO). Patients with hepatoblastoma, Wilms tumor, and histiocytosis treated on unmodified published protocols had outcomes comparable to those in high-income countries (HIC). Those with rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia treated with unmodified regimens had event-free survival estimates 10%-20% lower than those reported in HIC due to higher rates of toxic death, abandonment of therapy, and relapse. Treatment of retinoblastoma is complicated by advanced stages and extraocular disease at diagnosis; improved outcomes depend on education of pediatricians and the public to recognize early signs of this disease. Use of unmodified protocols for Burkitt lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been associated with unacceptable toxicity in LIC, so MISPHO centers have modified published regimens by giving lower doses of methotrexate and reducing use of anthracyclines.

WT1 expression in a subpopulation of early CD34+ cells has suggested its involvement in hematopoiesis. WT1 is aberrantly expressed in leukemias. High expression of WT1 at diagnosis has been associated with unfavorable prognosis in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The prognostic relevance of WT1 expression in pediatric AML was evaluated in only one study, including 47 patients, which showed that very low levels of WT1 at presentation were associated with an excellent outcome. To test the validity of these findings we measured levels of WT1 in 41 newly diagnosed pediatric AML of the non-M3 FAB subtype. PROCEDURE: Patients were treated according to an AML-BFM 83-based protocol in a single institution. Mononucleated cells obtained from presentation BM aspirates were cryopreserved and later thawed and used for total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. The quantitative assessment of WT1 transcripts was made by real-time PCR (RQ-PCR). WT1 transcripts values were normalized with respect to the number of ABL transcripts. RESULTS: WT1 levels were significantly higher in patients bearing favorable chromosome abnormalities, t(8;21) and inv(16) (P = 0.002). Higher levels of WT1 expression were unexpectedly associated with a higher probability of overall survival by Cox regression analysis (P = 0.002). Multivariate regression analysis could not discriminate between the effects of WT1 and cytogenetics on survival. CONCLUSIONS: Higher WT1 expression was associated with favorable cytogenetics subtypes and accordingly with better outcome in children with AML in this study.",,"['Rodrigues, Patricia C', 'Oliveira, Satiro N', 'Viana, Marcos B', 'Matsuda, Eduardo I', 'Nowill, Alexandre E', 'Brandalise, Silvia R', 'Yunes, Jose A']","['Rodrigues PC', 'Oliveira SN', 'Viana MB', 'Matsuda EI', 'Nowill AE', 'Brandalise SR', 'Yunes JA']","['Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAV regimen']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/ultrastructure', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'WT1 Proteins/biosynthesis']",2006/08/03 09:00,2007/08/25 09:00,['2006/08/03 09:00'],"['2006/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20953 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Aug;49(2):133-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20953.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One possible candidate is Raf-1, which is known to signal cell proliferation and neoplastic transformation through MEK, ERK, and downstream targets. It can also participate in the regulation of cell survival and various forms of cell differentiation, though the precise pathways are less well delineated. Here we report that Raf-1 has a role in monocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemia HL60, which is not mediated by MEK and ERK, but likely by direct interaction with p90RSK. Specifically, we show that Raf-1 and p90RSK are increasingly activated in the later stages of differentiation of HL60 cells, at the same time as activation of MEK and ERK is decreasing. Transfection of a wild-type Raf-1 construct enhances 1,25D-induced differentiation, while antisense Raf-1 or short interfering (si) Raf-1 reduces 1,25D-induced differentiation. In contrast, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) and siRNAs to MEK or ERK have no detectable effect on differentiation. In late stage differentiating cells Raf-1 and p90RSK are found as a complex, and inhibition of Raf-1, but not MEK or ERK expression reduces the levels of phosphorylated p90 RSK. These findings support the thesis that Raf-1 signals cell proliferation and cell differentiation through different intermediary proteins.","['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Wang, Xuening', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Wang X', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2006/08/03 09:00,2006/10/27 09:00,['2006/08/03 09:00'],"['2006/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20731 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2006 Nov;209(2):253-60. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20731.,,,,"['R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA44722-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2814417,['NIHMS169815'],,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed at studying seroprevalence of 3 herpes viruses Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV 1 and 2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: We conducted this study on 68 newly diagnosed pediatric patients with ALL presented to the Pediatric Oncology Service of National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt from November 2001 to June 2003. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in detecting HSV 1 and 2, CMV, EBV antibodies of both types immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG detection of DNA for both CMV and EBV by polymerase chain reaction was carried out. RESULTS: High seroprevalence of HSV-1 and 2, CMV and EBV IgG antibodies in both leukemic children and their control was observed (69%, 100%, 83%) and (80%, 100%, 95%). Significantly higher percentage of HSV-1 and 2 IgM or reactivated infection was found among leukemic children 17/68 (25%) compared with normal control 0%. Analysis showed that prevalence of HSV 1 and 2 IgG increased from 18/33 (54%) in children <5 years to 11/13 (77%) in children >10 years, and reactivation of HSV-1 and 2 increased with increasing age from 1/33 (3%) in children <5 years to 4/13 (30%) in children >10 year. This was in contrast to seroprevalence of CMV and EBV IgG which were 100% and 83% in children <5 years. No difference in seroprevalence was found among both gender, and no difference was found in leukemic patients with granulocytopenia. CONCLUSION: The data show a higher exposure to HSV-1 and 2 both primary infections and reactivation among ALL children.

Variation in the HTLV-1 envelope nucleotide sequence has been extensively documented and has been used to classify HTLV-1 isolates into different subtypes. The virus occurs in at least 3 subtypes, which have been named A, B, and C. We conducted this study to compare the antigenic proprieties of the Iranian isolate of HTLV-1 with the homologous region of different subtypes of the virus. METHODS: This study took place in the Department of Biology, College of Sciences, Shiraz University, Iran in 2005. The predicted antigenic sites and secondary structure of the envelope glycoprotein of HTLV-1, present in Iran, have been compared with the antigenic sites and secondary structure of the homologous domains in subtypes A, B, C of the virus. To predict the epitopes of glycoproteins, 21 different scales were used. RESULTS: The number of helices in the Iranian isolate was equal to the number of these regions in all 3 subtypes, but the number of beta-sheets was more than other viruses. One potential glycosylation site, on all these studied envelope glycoproteins, was predicted. Antigenic sites in the Iranian isolate were almost similar to subtype A of the virus and the Iranian isolate of HTLV-1 may be belongs to subtype A. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the similarities and differences between the Iranian and other subtypes of HTLV-1. Antigenic sites represent potential candidates for use in a peptide vaccine against HTLV-1 glycoproteins and since most of the properties of a particular protein depend on its structural properties, this type of study can help in better understanding of HTLV-1 isolates present in Iran.",,"['Mohabatkar, Hassan', 'Sadeghi, Sahar']","['Mohabatkar H', 'Sadeghi S']","['Department of Biology, College of Sciences, Shiraz University, Shiraz 71454, Iran. mohabatkar@susc.ac.ir']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Saudi Med J,Saudi medical journal,7909441,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody/genetics/*immunology', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*analysis']",2006/08/03 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/08/03 09:00'],"['2006/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']","[""20060148' [pii]""]",ppublish,Saudi Med J. 2006 Aug;27(8):1121-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the biodistribution of 111In-labeled anti-CD45 antibody in humans using the rat IgG2a monoclonal antibody YAML568 that recognizes a common CD45 epitope present on all human leukocytes. METHODS: Eight patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation received YAML568 labeled with 122 +/- 16 MBq of 111In intravenously followed by serial blood sampling, urine collection, and conjugated view planar gamma-camera imaging up to 144 h after injection. Time-activity curves were obtained using region-of-interest analysis in the accumulating organs and residence times were calculated. An estimate for the radiation-absorbed doses for each organ per unit of administered activity of 90Y was calculated using software for internal dose assessment. The first patient received no unlabeled antibody preloading. The second 2 patients received a preloading dose of 10 mg (0.15 mg/kg). The last 5 patients received a preloading dose of 30-47 mg (0.5 mg/kg). RESULTS: No significant administration-related side effects were seen. The 3 patients receiving no antibody or low antibody preloading had an unfavorable biodistribution with a high initial accumulation of activity in the liver (37%) and the spleen (34%). For the patients receiving 0.5-mg/kg antibody preloading, the estimated radiation-absorbed doses for red bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and total body were 6.4 +/- 1.2, 19 +/- 5, 3.9 +/- 1.4, 1.1 +/- 0.4, and 0.6 +/- 0.1 mGy/MBq, respectively, demonstrating preferential red marrow targeting.

CONCLUSION: This study shows that the anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody YAML568 is suitable for delivering selectively radiation to hematopoietic tissues when labeled with 90Y provided that a preloading dose of about 0.5 mg/kg unlabeled antibody is given.",,"['Glatting, Gerhard', 'Muller, Marguerite', 'Koop, Bernd', 'Hohl, Kathrin', 'Friesen, Claudia', 'Neumaier, Bernd', 'Berrie, Eleanor', 'Bird, Pru', 'Hale, Geoffrey', 'Blumstein, Norbert M', 'Waldmann, Herman', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Reske, Sven N']","['Glatting G', 'Muller M', 'Koop B', 'Hohl K', 'Friesen C', 'Neumaier B', 'Berrie E', 'Bird P', 'Hale G', 'Blumstein NM', 'Waldmann H', 'Bunjes D', 'Reske SN']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Ulm, Ulm, Germany. gerhard.glatting@uniklinik-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (YAML568 monoclonal antibody)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/biosynthesis/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/08/03 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/08/03 09:00'],"['2006/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['47/8/1335 [pii]'],ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2006 Aug;47(8):1335-41.,,,,['G7904009/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed of 37 patients with CLL who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT at our institution between March 2003 and July 2005. All PET/CT scans were reviewed in consensus by 2 diagnostic radiologists. Sites of abnormal 18F-FDG uptake with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of greater than 5 were considered highly suggestive of Richter's transformation. The PET/CT findings were correlated with histologic findings from bone marrow or lymph node biopsy performed within 6 wk of PET/CT and with clinical follow-up. RESULTS: The 37 patients (26 men and 11 women; mean age, 61 y, range, 40-82 y) underwent 57 PET/CT scans. In 10 (91%) of 11 patients with Richter's transformation, PET/CT detected sites of abnormal 18F-FDG uptake having an SUVmax of greater than 5. Richter's transformation was missed in 1 patient who had only low-grade 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax < 5). Nine patients had false-positive PET/CT findings; in 3 of these patients, alternative malignancies were diagnosed (Hodgkin's disease; metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma; non-small cell lung cancer). In all remaining patients, PET/CT correctly excluded Richter's transformation. For the specific diagnosis of Richter's transformation of CLL to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, PET/CT had overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 91%, 80%, and 53% and 97%, respectively. CONCLUSION: PET/CT can detect Richter's transformation of CLL to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with a high sensitivity and a high negative predictive value.",,"['Bruzzi, John F', 'Macapinlac, Homer', 'Tsimberidou, Apostolia M', 'Truong, Mylene T', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Marom, Edith M', 'Munden, Reginald F']","['Bruzzi JF', 'Macapinlac H', 'Tsimberidou AM', 'Truong MT', 'Keating MJ', 'Marom EM', 'Munden RF']","['Division of Diagnostic Imaging, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030-4009, USA. jbruzzi@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/*methods', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods']",2006/08/03 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/08/03 09:00'],"['2006/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['47/8/1267 [pii]'],ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2006 Aug;47(8):1267-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibitors of Hsp90 are being examined as cancer therapeutic agents, but the molecular mechanism of their anticancer activity is still unclear. We investigated Hsp90 as a therapeutic target for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by use of the Hsp90 inhibitor shepherdin (a novel peptidyl antagonist of the interaction between Hsp90 and survivin, which is a regulator of cell proliferation and cell viability in cancer). METHODS: We studied protein interactions by molecular dynamics simulations and conducted competition experiments by use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Shepherdin[79-83], a novel variant carrying the survivin sequence from Lys-79 through Gly-83, or its scrambled peptide was made permeable to cells by adding the antennapedia helix III carrier sequence. Apoptosis, Hsp90 client protein expression, and mitochondrial dysfunction were evaluated in AML types (myeloblastic, monocytic, and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis), patient-derived blasts, and normal mononuclear cells. Effects of shepherdin on tumor growth were evaluated in AML xenograft tumors in mice (n = 6). Organ tissues were examined histologically. RESULTS: Shepherdin[79-83] bound to Hsp90, inhibited formation of the survivin-Hsp90 complex, and competed with ATP binding to Hsp90. Cell-permeable shepherdin[79-83] induced rapid (within 30 minutes) and complete (with concentrations inducing 50% cell death of 24-35 microM) killing of AML types and blasts, but it did not affect normal mononuclear cells. Shepherdin[79-83] made contact with unique residues in the ATP pocket of Hsp90 (Ile-96, Asp-102, and Phe-138), did not increase Hsp70 levels in AML cells, disrupted mitochondrial function within 2 minutes of treatment, and eliminated the expression of Hsp90 client proteins. Shepherdin[79-83] abolished growth of AML xenograft tumors (mean of control group = 1698 mm3 and mean of treated group = 232 mm3; difference = 1466 mm3, 95% confidence interval = 505.8 to 2426; P = .008) without systemic or organ toxicity and inhibited Hsp90 function in vivo.

However, the mechanism(s) of action whereby BU injures normal cells has not been well defined and, therefore, was investigated in the present study by using the normal human diploid WI38 fibroblasts as a model system. We found that WI38 fibroblasts incubated with BU (from 7.5-120 microM) for 24 h underwent senescence but not apoptosis in a dose-independent manner, whereas cells incubated with 80 and 20 microM etoposide (Etop) were committed to apoptosis and senescence, respectively. The induction of WI38 cell senescence by Etop was associated with p53 activation and could be attenuated by down-regulation of p53 using alpha-pifithrin (alpha-PFT) or p53 small interference RNA (siRNA). In contrast, WI38 cell senescence induced by BU was associated with prolonged activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38), and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and could be suppressed by the inhibition of Erk and/or p38 with PD98059 (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone) and/or SB203580 [4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole], respectively. However, inhibition of p53 with alpha-PFT or p53 siRNA or JNK with SP600125 (1,9-pyrazoloanthrone) failed to protect WI38 cells from BU-induced senescence.

Even though clinical pharmacists are actively involved in patient care, many of their efforts remain undocumented, resulting in an underestimation of the importance of their services and missed opportunities for improvements and new directions. OBJECTIVE: To document and evaluate the services of a hematology/oncology clinical pharmacy in the outpatient setting. METHODS: Pendragon Forms 3.2 software was used to design the documentation template. The template was designed to collect diagnoses, supportive care issues, drug-specific interventions, and prescriptions written. This template was uploaded to the personal digital assistant (PDA) for documentation. Patient-specific information was documented in a password-protected PDA. Data collected from November 1, 2002, to October 31, 2003, were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Clinical pharmacists were involved in 423 patient visits for chemotherapy follow-up or disease management. Cancer diagnoses included colorectal (n = 99), multiple myeloma (59), non-small cell lung (56), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (44), myelodysplastic syndromes (22), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (19). During the 423 patient visits, 342 supportive care issues were addressed including anemia (34%), pain management (22%), constipation/diarrhea (15%), and nausea/vomiting (8%). Major drug-specific interventions included drug addition (41%), discontinuation (23%), and adjustment (21%). Four hundred forty-five prescriptions were filled, of which 181 were new and 150 were refilled. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study, as of July 25, 2006, to document considerable contribution of an outpatient clinical pharmacist in direct cancer patient care. Although the disease management and supportive care issues addressed here may differ based on institution and patient population, the results of our study show that clinical pharmacists have ever-growing roles in the management of these patients.",,"['Shah, Sachin', 'Dowell, Jonathan', 'Greene, Shane']","['Shah S', 'Dowell J', 'Greene S']","['Hematology/Oncology Specialty Residency Program School of Pharmacy, Texas Tech University Health Science Center, Veterans Affairs North Texas Health Care System, Dallas, TX 75216-7167, USA. sachin.shah@ttuhsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,,IM,"['Ambulatory Care/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematology/methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Oncology Service, Hospital', '*Outpatient Clinics, Hospital', '*Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy Service, Hospital/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",2006/08/03 09:00,2006/10/20 09:00,['2006/08/03 09:00'],"['2006/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['aph.1H162 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1H162 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2006 Sep;40(9):1527-33. doi: 10.1345/aph.1H162.

Both fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) were used to quantify expression of the IL-3Ralpha and beta(c) subunits on AML cells. QRT-PCR for both subunits was most predictive of killing of AML colony-forming cells (AML-CFCs) by diphtheria toxin-IL-3 fusion protein (DT(388)IL3). Among 19 patient samples, the relative level of the IL-3Ralpha was higher than the IL-3Rbeta(c) and highest in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD71(-) cells, enriched for candidate leukemia stem cells, compared with cell fractions depleted of such progenitors. Overall, the amount of IL-3Rbeta(c) subunit did not vary among sorted subpopulations. However, expression of both subunits varied by more than 10-fold among different AML samples for all subpopulations studied. The level of IL-3Rbeta(c) expression versus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (set at 1000) ranged from 0.14 to 13.56 in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD71(-) cells from different samples; this value was correlated (r = .76, P = .05) with the ability of DT(388)IL3 to kill AML progenitors that engraft in beta(2)-microglobin-deficient nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice (n = 7).

Randomization followed a Bayesian adaptive design. Ninety-five patients were treated (77 with MDS, and 18 with CMML). Overall, 32 patients (34%) achieved a complete response (CR), and 69 (73%) had an objective response by the new modified International Working Group criteria. The 5-day intravenous schedule, which had the highest dose-intensity, was selected as optimal; the CR rate in that arm was 39%, compared with 21% in the 5-day subcutaneous arm and 24% in the 10-day intravenous arm (P < .05). The high dose-intensity arm was also superior at inducing hypomethylation at day 5 and at activating P15 expression at days 12 or 28 after therapy.

Here, we have investigated the target and mechanism of action of a cholesterol-binding compound, the polyene antifungal antibiotic amphotericin B methyl ester (AME). We found that AME potently inhibited the replication of a highly divergent panel of HIV-1 isolates in various T-cell lines and primary cells irrespective of clade or target cell tropism. The defects in HIV-1 replication caused by AME were due to profoundly impaired viral infectivity as well as a defect in viral particle production. To elucidate further the mechanism of action of AME, we selected for and characterized AME-resistant HIV-1 variants. Mutations responsible for AME resistance mapped to a highly conserved and functionally important endocytosis motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. Interestingly, truncation of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail in the context of either HIV-1 or rhesus macaque simian immunodeficiency virus also conferred resistance to AME. The infectivity of HIV-1 virions bearing murine leukemia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins was unaffected by AME.

In the present paper, we studied how the healthcare needs, both subjectively and objectively, were fulfilled for our former patients.

RESULTS: The response rate was 73%. A majority (60%) of the survivors had no regular follow-up visits, and 42% of these reported that they missed not having one. More than one third were thus far dissatisfied with the follow-up programme. Only 3% of those who had regular follow-ups found them ""unnecessary"". Complaints subjectively related to their diseases or treatments were reported by 47%. Out of all responders, 34% did not miss having regular follow-up visits.

OBJECTIVE: This finding, together with findings of associations between other organophosphate pesticides and cancer more broadly, prompted us to examine phorate exposure and overall cancer incidence in the AHS. Adding 3 years of follow-up and using more detailed exposure information allowed us to see whether the prostate cancer finding held. METHODS: The AHS is a prospective study of licensed restricted-use pesticide applicators from North Carolina and Iowa. To our knowledge, this is the largest examination of workers occupationally exposed to phorate. Pesticide exposure and other information was collected using two self-administered questionnaires completed from 1993 to 1997. Poisson regression was used to calculate rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Phorate use was not related to the incidence of all cancers combined or to any individual cancer, although we had insufficient numbers to study non-Hodgkin lymphoma or leukemia, which have been linked to organophosphates in other studies. Although prostate cancer risk was not significantly related to phorate use overall or among those without a family history, the risk tended to increase among applicators with a family history of prostate cancer. The interaction RR was 1.53 (95% CI, 0.99-2.37).

In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of As2O3 on cell growth inhibition and cell death in human T-lymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cell lines. As2O3 significantly inhibited the proliferation of Molt-4 and Mutz-1 cells in dose- and time-dependent manner. Autophagic cell death (programmed cell death type II) and apoptosis (programmed cell death type I) were activated together in leukemia cell lines after exposed to As2O3. Numerous large cytoplasmic inclusions and vacuoles were observed in As2O3-treated cells using electron microscope. Furthermore, 3-methyladenine (an autophagy inhibitor) significantly reduced autophagic cell death and sequentially induced apoptosis. Finally, leukemia cells treated with 4 microM As2O3 showed a considerable up-regulation of Beclin-1 (a Bcl-2-interacting protein) expression, which was independent of transcription of mRNA and required protein synthesis. In addition, Molt-4 cells treated with As2O3 exhibited the down-regulation of Bax protein expression, suggesting that Bax may be involved in accumulating of Beclin-1 and triggering autophagic cell death in As2O3-treated leukemia cells. These results may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of As2O3, and provide a suggestion that As2O3 may be of therapeutic value for the treatment of patients with human T-lymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.",,"['Qian, Wenbin', 'Liu, Junqing', 'Jin, Jie', 'Ni, Wanmao', 'Xu, Weilai']","['Qian W', 'Liu J', 'Jin J', 'Ni W', 'Xu W']","['Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China. qianwenb@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Beclin-1', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/drug effects/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2006/08/03 09:00,2007/11/02 09:00,['2006/08/03 09:00'],"['2006/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2006/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00247-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.06.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Mar;31(3):329-39. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.06.021.

Most descriptions are isolated case reports and case series are strikingly sparse. OBJECTIVES: To detect cases of mycosis fungoides associated with B-cell malignancies or Hodgkin's lymphoma and to analyse the characteristics of and the interplay between the lymphoproliferative neoplasms. METHODS: Patients with mycosis fungoides who had B-cell malignancies or Hodgkin's lymphoma were selected from among 398 patients either treated or followed up in two tertiary medical centres during a 7-year period. RESULTS: Eleven patients with mycosis fungoides and B-cell malignancy were detected (seven of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, three of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, one of multiple myeloma). No case of Hodgkin's lymphoma was found. In seven patients the mycosis fungoides preceded the B-cell malignancy whereas in four it was the B-cell malignancy which occurred first. The time elapsed between onset of the two malignancies ranged from 4 to 22 years (average: 12 years). Patients who had mycosis fungoides as the first neoplasm presented with earlier stages of mycosis fungoides (four of seven: IA, three of seven: IB) than those who had mycosis fungoides as their second neoplasm (of four, one: IB, one: folliculotropic, two: IIB). Among the four patients in whom the appearance of mycosis fungoides followed the B-cell malignancy, three had been treated with multiagent chemotherapy. Two patients who presented with early-stage mycosis fungoides (IA) as the first lymphoma developed mycosis fungoides tumours after becoming immunosuppressed. In two patients infiltrates composed of both malignant T- and B-cell populations were found in a single biopsy. One showed two distinct populations of the malignant cells in the skin tumour, thus constituting a classical composite lymphoma of mycosis fungoides and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, while in the other patient the two malignant populations of marginal B-cell lymphoma and mycosis fungoides (as evidenced by both phenotypic and genotypic findings) were intermingled. CONCLUSIONS: This case series indicates that while the coexistence of Hodgkin's lymphoma and mycosis fungoides is extremely rare, the association of mycosis fungoides and B-cell malignancies is not as rare as reflected in the literature, with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma constituting the most common associated B-cell malignancy. In this series as well as in the cases reported in the literature mycosis fungoides usually preceded the development of B-cell malignancies, which may be in accordance with previous reports of an increased risk of developing a second haematological neoplasm. The importance of a competent immune system for patients with mycosis fungoides is well demonstrated in these cases. It is suggested that for greater precision the criteria for diagnosis of composite lymphoma of the skin should include both phenotypic and genotypic features.",,"['Barzilai, A', 'Trau, H', 'David, M', 'Feinmesser, M', 'Bergman, R', 'Shpiro, D', 'Schiby, G', 'Rosenblatt, K', 'Or, R', 'Hodak, E']","['Barzilai A', 'Trau H', 'David M', 'Feinmesser M', 'Bergman R', 'Shpiro D', 'Schiby G', 'Rosenblatt K', 'Or R', 'Hodak E']","['Dermatology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/immunology/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology']",2006/08/03 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/08/03 09:00'],"['2006/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJD7346 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2133.2006.07346.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2006 Aug;155(2):379-86. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2006.07346.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He received a cumulative dose of 240 mg/m(2) of cisplatin, and 1123 mg/m(2) of carboplatin before developing CMML. The cytogenetic study revealed trisomy 8. This is the first reported case that links platinum-based therapy with development of CMML with trisomy 8. Although the relationship between platinum therapy and the development of CMML is difficult to assess due to combinational nature of therapy in most cases, physicians should consider the possibility of CMML in patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of haematologic malignancy after platinum therapy.",,"['Kim, K B', 'Faderl, S', 'Hwang, C S', 'Khuri, F R']","['Kim KB', 'Faderl S', 'Hwang CS', 'Khuri FR']","['Department of Melanoma Medical Oncology, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. kkim@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy', 'Cisplatin/*adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2006/08/03 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/08/03 09:00'],"['2006/08/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCP748 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2710.2006.00748.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2006 Aug;31(4):401-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2710.2006.00748.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, this may be the case in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Little is known about lymphocyte apoptosis in this disease. Recently, we reported significantly enhanced apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes (JIA-PBL) compared to synovial fluid (JIA-SFL) or healthy lymphocytes, with downregulation of p53 in JIA-SFL. In this study we assessed other possible molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon. METHODS: PBL from 31 children with JIA and 26 healthy children were examined. SFL obtained from 18 patients was also studied. Apoptosis was assessed by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method. Expression of several apoptosis-regulating proteins was analyzed, including myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), cross-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), or Bcl-xL inhibitors and proapoptotic p53, Bcl-w, Bak, and Bid. RESULTS: We found significant overexpression of Mcl-1 and XIAP in JIA-SFL (p < 0.001 and p < 0.02, respectively). Expression of Mcl-1 and XIAP in SFL correlated inversely with the apoptotic index (p < 0.002 and p < 0.01, respectively). FLIP expression was also distinctly higher in SFL than in JIA-PBL; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.061). No statistically significant differences were found in the expression of other proteins between SFL and PBL. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study showing that upregulation of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and XIAP proteins, along with downregulation of p53 protein, is correlated with inhibition of JIA-SFL apoptosis.",,"['Smolewska, Elzbieta', 'Stanczyk, Jerzy', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Smolewski, Piotr']","['Smolewska E', 'Stanczyk J', 'Robak T', 'Smolewski P']","['Department of Pediatric Cardiology and Rheumatological Clinic for Children, Institute of Pediatrics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,J Rheumatol,The Journal of rheumatology,7501984,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Apoptosis/physiology', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Synovial Fluid/*cytology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*metabolism']",2006/08/02 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/08/02 09:00'],"['2006/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['0315162X-33-1684 [pii]'],ppublish,J Rheumatol. 2006 Aug;33(8):1684-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, the degree of inflammatory response in subcutaneous tissue in rats around the 220-CNTs was slight in comparison with that around the 825-CNTs. These results indicated that the degree of inflammation around 825-CNTs was stronger than that around 220-CNTs since macrophages could envelop 220-CNTs more readily than 825-CNTs.

Ligand binding induces proteolytic cleavages in NOTCH1 that release its intracellular domain (ICN1), which translocates to the nucleus and activates target genes by forming a short-lived nuclear complex with two other proteins, the DNA-binding factor CSL and a Mastermind-like (MAML) coactivator. Recent work has shown that human T-ALL is frequently associated with C-terminal NOTCH1 truncations, which uniformly remove sequences lying between residues 2524 and 2556. This region includes the highly conserved sequence WSSSSP (S4), which based on its amino acid content appeared to be a likely site for regulatory serine phosphorylation events. We show here that the mutation of the S4 sequence leads to hypophosphorylation of ICN1; increased NOTCH1 signaling; and the stabilization of complexes containing ICN1, CSL, and MAML1. Consistent with these in vitro studies, mutation of the WSSSSP sequence converts nonleukemogenic weak gain-of-function NOTCH1 alleles into alleles that cause aggressive T-ALLs in a murine bone marrow transplant model.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1998 to 2003, 253 patients with de novo AML, received transplants with RIC and peripheral blood from a genoidentical donor. Median age was 55 years (range, 18 to 72) and the median follow-up was 17 months (range, 2 to 67). One hundred forty one patients received transplants in first remission (CR1), 47 received transplants in second remission (CR2), and 65 patients received transplants in a more advanced phase. Fludarabin-based RIC was used in 91% of patients and low-dose (< 4 Gy) total-body radiation in 23% of patients. The median nucleated and CD34 cell dose infused were 9.1x 10(8)/kg and 5.8x 10(6)/kg, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 41% +/- 4% and it was 46% +/- 5% for patients receiving a higher cell dose (> 9.1x 10(8)/kg) and 37% +/- 5% for the remainders (P = .03). Higher cell doses exclusively benefited patients who received transplantations in CR2 or beyond, with LFS of 47 +/- 8 versus 20 +/- 8, with no detectable effect for patients who received transplants in CR1. In a multivariate analysis of the overall patient population, higher nucleated cell dose cells were associated with higher LFS (P = .04), higher incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (P = .01), and there was a trend towards a lower relapse incidence (P = .06). Interestingly, CD34+ cell dose was not associated with any outcomes. CONCLUSION: Nucleated cell dose is an important factor that can be modified to improve results of RIC for patients with AML transplanted later than in CR1.",,"['Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Boiron, Jean-Michel', 'Theorin, Niklas', 'Littlewood, Tim', 'Slavin, Shimon', 'Greinix, Hildegard', 'Cahn, Jean Yves', 'Alessandrino, E Paolo', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Polge, Emmanuelle', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Gorin NC', 'Labopin M', 'Boiron JM', 'Theorin N', 'Littlewood T', 'Slavin S', 'Greinix H', 'Cahn JY', 'Alessandrino EP', 'Rambaldi A', 'Nagler A', 'Polge E', 'Rocha V']","['Department of Haematology and Cell Therapy, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Asistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris and Universite Paris 6, Pierre et Marie Curie, France. norbert-claude.gorin@sat.aphp.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antigens, CD34/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/08/02 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/08/02 09:00'],"['2006/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2006.05.5855 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.05.5855 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Aug 20;24(24):3959-66. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.05.5855.

In contrast, when donor T cells are transferred to established mixed chimeras (MCs), GVHD is not induced despite a robust graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction that eliminates normal and malignant host hematopoietic cells. We demonstrate here that donor GVH-reactive T cells transferred to MCs or freshly irradiated mice undergo similar expansion and activation, with similar up-regulation of homing molecules required for entry to nonlymphoid tissues. Using dynamic two-photon in vivo microscopy, we show that these activated T cells do not enter GVHD target tissues in established MCs, contrary to the dogma that activated T cells inevitably traffic to nonlymphoid tissues. Instead, we show that the presence of inflammation within a nonlymphoid tissue is a prerequisite for the trafficking of activated T cells to that site.

The subpopulation of CD4+CD25hi regulatory T cells, initially identified as crucial players in the regulation of autoimmune processes, might also play a role in the control of alloreactivity. Experimental studies in mice indicate that donor regulatory T cells indeed control alloreactive responses and reduce graft-versus-host disease. Recent clinical reports also suggest that higher numbers of CD4+CD25hi cells within the transplant or in the blood of grafted patients might be associated with reduced graft-versus-host disease.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Bone marrow samples were taken from 120 children diagnosed with ALL. An indirect immunocytochemical procedure was performed with the use of monoclonal mouse anti-human antibodies against VEGF-C, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 (diluted 1 : 100). The immunocytochemical expression of VEGF-C was confirmed exclusively in the cytoplasm of ALL lymphoblasts (the mean percentage was 36.4 +/- 7.2). It was absent from the cytoplasm of normal haematopoietic cells in the control group. No VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 expression was detected in the children of either the study or control groups. The risk of induction failure or leukaemic relapse was found to be significant in all VEGF-C+ patients (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.02, respectively; Fisher's exact test).

In these patients, the occurrence of blastic crisis (BC) is rare, and its clinical biologic characteristics are not well known. METHODS: Among 164 patients who received imatinib and were followed for a median of 35 months, 11 patients (6.7%) developed a BC; this was sudden (i.e., it occurred within 3 months of a documented CCR) in 6 patients (54.5%). Those patients were analyzed with respect to their clinical and biologic features and were compared with previous reports. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, there were 3 low-risk patients and 3 intermediate-risk patients; 4 patients had received pretreatment with interferon, and 2 patients received only imatinib. The median CP was 18 months, and the median duration of imatinib therapy was 7 months. The median time to CCR was 3 months, and the median time from CCR to BC was 4 months. BC phenotype was lymphoid in 2 patients, myeloid in 3 patients (including 2 patients who had extramedullary localization), and biclonal in 1 patient. Karyotype evolution was detected in 4 patients, whereas a Ph-positive/Ph-negative mosaicism was evident in all 6 patients. One patient presented an M351T mutation. The overall median survival was 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Sudden BC generally is an uncommon phenomenon that may be relatively frequent in patients with CML who receive imatinib.

A common feature of several H3K4 methyltransferase complexes is the presence of three structural components (RbBP5, Ash2L and WDR5) and a catalytic subunit containing a SET domain. Here we report the first biochemical reconstitution of a functional four-component mixed-lineage leukemia protein-1 (MLL1) core complex.

The present investigation aimed to evaluate the association between exposure to solvents and lymphomas (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin) in a large population-based, multicenter, case-control study in Italy. METHODS: All newly diagnosed cases of malignant lymphoma in men and women age 20 to 74 years in 1991-1993 were identified in 8 areas in Italy. The control group was formed by a random sample of the general population in the areas under study stratified by sex and 5-year age groups. We interviewed 1428 non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases, 304 Hodgkin disease cases, and 1530 controls. Experts examined the questionnaire data and assessed a level of probability and intensity of exposure to a range of chemicals. RESULTS: Those in the medium/high level of exposure had an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with exposure to toluene (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% confidence interval = 1.1-2.8), xylene 1.7 (1.0-2.6), and benzene 1.6 (1.0-2.4). Subjects exposed to all 3 aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, and xylene; medium/high intensity compared with none) had an odds ratio of 2.1 (1.1-4.3). We observed an increased risk for Hodgkin disease for those exposed to technical solvents (2.7; 1.2-6.5) and aliphatic solvents (2.7; 1.2-5.7).

However, the optimal time points for investigation, the best antibody combinations, and most importantly, the clinical impact of RD analysis remain unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred forty-two specimens of 150 children enrolled in the AML-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) 98 study were analyzed by four-color immunophenotyping at up to four predefined time points during treatment. For each of the 12 leukemia-associated immunophenotypes and time points, a threshold level based on a previous retrospective analysis of another cohort of children with AML and on control bone marrows was determined. RESULTS: Regarding all four time points, there is a statistically significant difference in the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) in those children presenting with immunologically detectable blasts at 3 or more time points. The levels at bone marrow puncture (BMP) 1 and BMP2 turned out to have the most significant predictive value for 3-year-EFS: 71% +/- 6% versus 48% +/- 9%, P(Log-Rank) = .029 and 70% +/- 6% versus 50% +/- 7%, P(Log-Rank) = .033), resulting in a more than two-fold risk of relapse. In a multivariate analysis, using a combined risk classification based on morphologically determined blasts at BMP1 and BMP2, French-American-British classification, and cytogenetics, the influence of immunologically determined RD was no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION: RD monitoring before second induction has the same predictive value as examining levels at four different time points during intensive chemotherapy.

We reviewed our experience in 526 patients with lymphoma treated by ASCT to determine whether difficult stem-cell harvests predict for an increased risk of t-MDS/AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Autologous peripheral stem cells were initially mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) alone (n = 334), etoposide and G-CSF (n = 166), or cyclophosphamide and G-CSF with or without etoposide (n = 26). Difficult harvests were those that required more than 5 days to collect enough stem cells and those that required additional attempts with etoposide and/or cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF (n = 52). All patients were then treated with high-dose chemotherapy alone and observed for outcome. RESULTS: With a median follow-up time for surviving patients of 69 months, 20 patients developed t-MDS/AML, for an actuarial incidence of 6.8% at 10 years. Pretransplantation characteristics, including age, diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease, bone marrow involvement, prior radiation therapy, prior exposure to chemotherapy, lactate dehydrogenase at the time of ASCT, disease status, and method of stem-cell mobilization, were then analyzed with respect to the subsequent development of t-MDS/AML. By multivariable analysis, prior exposure to radiation therapy, four or more chemotherapy regimens, and more than 5 days of apheresis needed to harvest enough stem cells were identified as independent risk factors for t-MDS/AML. Bootstrap analysis confirmed these results. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that identifiable pretransplantation factors predict for t-MDS/AML after ASCT.",,"['Kalaycio, Matt', 'Rybicki, Lisa', 'Pohlman, Brad', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Andresen, Steven', 'Kuczkowski, Elizabeth', 'Bolwell, Brian']","['Kalaycio M', 'Rybicki L', 'Pohlman B', 'Sobecks R', 'Andresen S', 'Kuczkowski E', 'Bolwell B']","['Department of Hematology, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH, USA. kalaycm@ccf.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2006/08/01 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/08/01 09:00'],"['2006/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/22/3604 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.06.0673 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Aug 1;24(22):3604-10. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.06.0673.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we show that a variety of HDI trigger in hematopoietic cells not only widespread histone acetylation and DNA damage responses but also actual DNA damage, which is significantly increased in leukemic cells compared with normal cells. Thus, increase in H2AX and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylation, early markers of DNA damage, occurs rapidly following HDI administration. Activation of the DNA damage and repair response following HDI treatment is further emphasized by localizing DNA repair proteins to regions of DNA damage. These events are followed by subsequent apoptosis of neoplastic cells but not normal cells.

However, a high recurrence rate after medical treatments has been the most significant problem. Beta-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin (beta-HIVS) is an ATP non-competitive inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases and is considered an apoptosis-inducing agent. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of beta-HIVS on the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of endometriotic stromal cells. METHODS: We investigated the effects of beta-HIVS on cultured ovarian endometriotic cyst stromal cells (ECSC) by a modified methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) assay, a 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation assays. The effect of beta-HIVS on the cell cycle of ECSC was determined by flow cytometry. The expression of apoptosis-related molecules was examined in ECSC using western blot analysis. RESULTS: Beta-HIVS significantly inhibited the proliferation and DNA synthesis of ECSC and induced apoptosis and G0/G1 phase cell-cycle arrest of these cells. Down-regulation of the B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 (Bcl-2) expression with the activation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 was observed in ECSC after beta-HIVS treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that beta-HIVS induces apoptosis of ECSC by suppressing anti-apoptotic proteins.

Paradoxically, arsenic also induces pro-myelomonocytic leukemia cell differentiation, and at higher concentrations, apoptosis. The present study investigated the effects of AsO(2) on preosteoclasts. When treated with 2.5-5microM AsO(2), RAW264.7 cells underwent osteoclast differentiation as evidenced by an increase in the number of multinucleate cells expressing tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). The appearance of these phenotypic markers was preceded by a low level increase in extracellular production of H(2)O(2) and was prevented by the addition of catalase (4.5microg/ml), an enzyme that removes H(2)O(2). Only at high concentrations (10-25microM) of AsO(2) was a significant loss of cell viability and a high level increase in H(2)O(2) production (1.5microM) observed. Apoptosis was blocked by pretreatment with diphenylene iodonium chloride (2microM), a NAD(P)H-flavoprotein inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of NADPH-oxidase. The data show that AsO(2), dose-dependently, stimulates increasing amounts of H(2)O(2) production. Moreover, at concentrations found in tissues of individuals exposed to geochemical AsO(2), osteoclasts underwent an H(2)O(2)-dependent differentiation. Therefore, chronic exposure to low-level amounts of AsO(2) could result in increased bone resorption and contribute to bone related pathologies.",,"['Szymczyk, K H', 'Kerr, B A E', 'Freeman, T A', 'Adams, C S', 'Steinbeck, M J']","['Szymczyk KH', 'Kerr BA', 'Freeman TA', 'Adams CS', 'Steinbeck MJ']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Thomas Jefferson University, 1015 Walnut Street, Suite 501 Curtis, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

We have also studied the ultrastructure of the red cell surface membranes by transmission electron microscopy. For all experiments, erythrocytes from normal individuals served as controls. We have shown direct evidence of the altered red cell (RBC) membrane morphology irrespective of the hemoglobin status of the patients which includes (1) presence of large central holes in RBCs of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), (2) presence of thorn- and horn-like structure in RBCs of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and (3) flaccid appearance of RBCs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. A mixture of the above mentioned structures were found in the red cells of patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in case of patients of HPA the RBCs lost the normal biconcave structures. TEM studies revealed presence of pores with diameters ranging from 100 to 200nm on the RBC membrane surface of myeloid leukemia with AML being the most prominent among others.

Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated the incidence of and outcome associated with these subtypes of ALL. In 620 children with ALL diagnosed between 1988 and 1999, the leukemic cells were near-triploid (DNA index, 1.50-1.73) in 4 and near-tetraploid (DNA index, 1.79-2.28) in 14. Of 15 patients with B-lineage ALL, 11 (73.3%) had an ETV6-RUNX1 (previously TEL-AML1 and then ETV6-CBFA2) fusion. No differences in age (P = 0.99), leukocyte count (P = 0.99), or immunophenotype (P = 0.99) were observed between patients with near-triploidy and those with near-tetraploidy. Patients with near-triploidy or near-tetraploidy were more likely than those with high-hyperdiploidy (51-67 chromosomes) (n = 159) to be female (P = 0.05) and have T-lineage ALL (P = 0.02), L2 morphology (P < 0.0001), or the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (P < 0.0001). The median follow-up period was 10.4 years. The 5-year event-free survival estimates (+/- SE) were 75% +/- 19% for patients with near-triploidy, 93% +/- 7% for those with near-tetraploidy, and 84% +/- 3% for those with high-hyperdiploidy. Although near-triploidy and near-tetraploidy are biologically different from high-hyperdiploidy, the favorable outcomes of patients with any one of these abnormalities suggest that patients with B-lineage ALL and a DNA index >or= 1.16 can be included in the low-risk arm of treatment protocols.

Translocation (11;19)(q23;p13) in both the original sample and TRL-01 generated MLL-ENL chimeric transcripts joining exon 6 and exon 4, respectively, which has a novel isoform. In cultures of TRL-01, addition of GM-CSF, SCF, and G-CSF and adhesion to fibronectin-coated plates promoted transient proliferation and survival, although they did not support long-term culture. Subcutaneous injection caused a tumor to form only when HESS-5 was coinjected at the same site.

METHODS: From January 1998 to May 2003, 193 patients with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled on protocol ALL-XH-99. The patients were classified into 4 groups according to the karyotype of the leukemia cells: normal karyotype, hypodiploid, hyperdiploid and pseudodiploid. Event-free survival (EFS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the distributions of EFS were compared using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: (1) Of 193 ALL patients, 115 had cytogenetic data. There were 53 (46.09%) with normal karyotype, 29 (25.22%) hyperdiploid, 9 (7.83%) hypodiploid, 4 coexpression of hypodiploid/hyperdiploid and 20 (17.39%) pseudodiploid. The probability of 5-year EFS for the four subgroups were (78.28 +/- 6.34)%, (86.07 +/- 6.47)%, (53.85 +/- 13.83)% and (40.10 +/- 12.17)%, respectively (P = 0.0041). (2) The clinical presentation and early response to treatment had no difference among the four groups, but the events are significantly different. (3) The probability of 5-year EFS for the combined hypodiploid group and the non-hypodiploid group was (53.85 +/- 13.83)% and (69.98 +/- 5.94)%, respectively (P = 0.1281). (4) The probability of 4-year EFS was significantly worse for patients with Philadelphia chromosome than for no Philadelphia chromosome patients [(28.57 +/- 17.07)% vs (70.85 +/- 5.60)%, P = 0.0009]. (5) Multivariate analysis suggested that the karyotypic characteristics, Philadelphia chromosome, age < 1-year or > 12-year, and white blood cell counts were independent prognostic factors.

METHODS: Multiplex FISH was used in combination with conventional cytogenetics (CC) and interphase FISH to study 14 cases of AML with complex karyotypic abnormalities. RESULTS: In the 14 cases of AML studied, conventional cytogenetics detected 23 numerical and 56 structural chromosome abnormalities. Among them 4 gained whole chromosome and 4 lost whole chromosome which were confirmed by multiplex FISH. Twelve chromosome losses detected by CC were revised as derivative chromosomes resulted from various structural aberrations, and 26 derivative and 19 marker chromosomes were characterized precisely by multiplex FISH.

METHODS: Kasumi-1, U937 and NB4 cell lines were exposed to a histone deacetylase inhibitor, phenyl butyrate (PB), for 24, 48 and 72 hrs. Cells were harvested for cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. Gene expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, was determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (semi-quantitative RT-PCR). Promoter activity of p21WAF1/CIP1 was determined by luciferase-reporter assay in 293T cell line. RESULTS: PB inhibited cell cycle of Kasumi-1, U937 and NB4 cell lines, showing G(0)/G(1) phase arrest and S-phase fraction reduction with a dose and time dependent manner. After Kasumi-1, U937 or NB4 cells exposed to 3 mmol/L PB for 72 hrs, G(0)/G(1)-phase fraction was increased by 42.03%, 44.36% and 26.82%, and S-phase fraction was decreased by 31.86%, 38.9% and 26.77%, respectively.

PB could stimulate p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity (by luciferase-reporter assay) and the effect was dose dependent.

Flow cytometry was used to measure intracellular mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of daunorubicin (DNR). P-gp expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR technique was used to examine the mdr1 mRNA level. RESULTS: IC(50) of ADM in K562/A02 cells was decreased when treated with Cur or EM, and the reversal times (RvT) was 4.9, 3.7 respectively. The RvT reached to 11.3 when treated with Cur (2.5 microg/ml) combined with EM (120 microg/ml). The DNR MFI in K562/A02 cells was significantly lower than that in K562 cells (P < 0.01), and was increased significantly when treated with Cur (2.5 microg/ml) or EM (120 microg/ml) (P < 0.05).

P-gp expression of K562/A02 cells treated with each drug for 5 days were lower than that for 3 days (P < 0.01), and lowered further when treated with Cur and EM together (P < 0.01). Mdr1 mRNA level in K562/A02 cells was higher than in K562 cells (P < 0.01), and was decreased when treated with each of the drugs (P < 0.01).

METHODS: The recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA3.1-VEGF-C and the vacant pcDNA3.1 vector were introduced separately into NB4 cells by lipofectamine mediation. The positive clones were screened by G418 and identified by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. The proliferation capacity of NB4/VEGF-C cells was analysed by MTT assay and colony forming assay in vitro. After NB4/VEGF-C cells were induced by ATRA, the expression level of C/EBPalpha gene, CD11b on cells surface and morphological alteration were analysed by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR), flow cytometry (FCM), and Wright-Giemsa staining, respectively. FCM Annexin V-FITC/PI dual labeling technique was performed to investigate the etoposide (Vp16) induced NB4/VEGF-C cells apoptosis and bcl-2 gene expression level in these cells was analysed by RQ-PCR. The NB4/pcDNA3.1 cells was used as control in the above experiments. RESULTS: A stable NB4 cell line that secrets VEGF-C and its control lines were established. The proliferation capacity of the former was stronger than that of the latter. The expression level of C/EBPalpha gene of NB4/VEGF-C cells on ATRA treatment was only 1/32 that of NB4/pcDNA3.1 cells. The CD11b level and the degree of differentiation of NB4/VEGF-C were weaker than that of NB4/pcDNA3.1 cells. The percentage of apoptotic NB4/VEGF-C cells induced by Vp16 [(7.20 +/- 2.52)%] was significantly lower than that of NB4/pcDNA3.1 cells [(16.07 +/- 3.58)%] (P = 0.005), but the bcl-2 gene expression level of NB4/VEGF-C cells is 2.28-fold that of NB4/pcDNA3.1 cells.

Novel treatment modalities exploiting donor-derived natural killer (NK) cells generate an alloreactive graft-versus-leukaemia response and eliminate the residual malignant clones in transplanted patients. NK cells are components of the innate immunity playing an important role in the surveillance of human tumours. Recognition of malignant cells depends on a dynamic balance between antagonistic functions of an array of NK activating and inhibitory receptors. The natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) are NK cell-specific and together with the NKG2D receptor are responsible for NK cell activation and tumour cell killing. The killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) recruit phosphatases and can antagonise the activating signals and prevent the cytolytic NK cell programme. Understanding of the integration of these multiple signals at the molecular level is central for exploring the cytolytic function of NK cells.

METHODS: We describe procedures based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) designed to assess functional titres of murine leukaemia virus (MLV) vectors, determine proviral copy numbers in transduced cells, and estimate retroviral transgene expression in both target cell lines and mice with transduced chimeric haematopoiesis. RESULTS: Compared to EGFP titration, proviral DNA detection by qPCR was more accurate in assessing the number of infective particles in supernatants, such that average viral titres in terms of proviral copies per cell were two-fold higher. Transgene mRNA expression was directly determined from the vectors used without the need for reporter assays. A new parameter, defined here as the 'transcription index' (TI), served to establish the association between transcribed transgenic mRNA and each proviral insertion. The TI represents the potential expression of every vector or insertion in each cell type, and is thus useful as a control parameter for monitoring preclinical or clinical protocols. CONCLUSIONS: The practical use of qPCR is demonstrated as a valuable alternative to reporter genes for the assessment and surveillance of insertion numbers and transgene expression. In combination with protein expression, this approach should be capable of establishing safer therapeutic gene doses, avoiding the potential side effects of high transduction and expression levels.","['Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Meza, N W', 'Puyet, A', 'Perez-Benavente, S', 'Quintana-Bustamante, O', 'Diez, A', 'Bueren, J A', 'Segovia, J C', 'Bautista, J M']","['Meza NW', 'Puyet A', 'Perez-Benavente S', 'Quintana-Bustamante O', 'Diez A', 'Bueren JA', 'Segovia JC', 'Bautista JM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology IV, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2006/07/29 09:00,2006/11/10 09:00,['2006/07/29 09:00'],"['2006/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.951 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2006 Sep;8(9):1097-104. doi: 10.1002/jgm.951.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We considered three design options: a full case-control study (Option I), a case-only study (Option II), and a partial case-control study (Option III), in which information on controls is limited to environmental exposure only. PROCEDURE: For each design option we determined its ability to measure the main effects of environmental factor E and genetic factor G, and the interaction between E and G. Using the leukemia study example, we calculated sample sizes required to detect and odds ratio (OR) of 2.0 for E alone, an OR of 10 for G alone and an interaction G x E of 3. RESULTS: Option I allows measuring both main effects and interaction, but requires a total sample size of 1,500 cases and 1,500 controls. Option II allows measuring only interaction, but requires just 121 cases. Option III allows calculating the main effect of E, and interaction, but not the main effect of G, and requires a total of 156 cases and 133 controls. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, the partial case-control study (Option III) appears to be more efficient with respect to its ability to answer the research questions for the amount of resources required. The design options considered in this example are not limited to observational epidemiology and may be applicable in studies of pharmacogenomics, survivorship, and other areas of pediatric ALL research.",,"['Goodman, Michael', 'Dana Flanders, W']","['Goodman M', 'Dana Flanders W']","['Department of Epidemiology Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA. goodm2@sph.emory.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Age of Onset', '*Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Cocarcinogenesis', 'Control Groups', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immune System/growth & development/immunology', 'Infections/epidemiology/immunology', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Models, Biological', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/physiology', 'Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Research Design/standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Software']",2006/07/29 09:00,2007/04/28 09:00,['2006/07/29 09:00'],"['2006/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20933 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Apr;48(4):375-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20933.,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Apr;48(4):373-4.

Consistent with the concept of distinct pathogenetic mechanisms, we show that patients with and without the JAK2 mutation have different patterns of cytogenetic abnormality, with virtually all patients carrying the 20q deletion or trisomy 9 being V617F(+). We also investigated the existence of a ""pre-JAK2"" phase by comparing the proportion of clonally derived granulocytes, estimated from X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIPs), with the proportion of V617F(+) granulocytes. Our results demonstrate that inherent XCIP variability between granulocytes and T cells produces a systematically biased pattern of results that may be misinterpreted as evidence for an excess of clonally derived granulocytes, an observation that limits the utility of XCIP analysis in this context.

Primary cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses were not impaired in imatinib-treated mice after infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or after immunization with a tumor cell line expressing LCMV glycoprotein (LCMV-GP). Similarly, neutralizing antibody responses to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were not affected. In contrast, secondary expansion of LCMV-specific memory CTLs was reduced in vitro and in vivo, resulting in impaired protection against reinfection. In addition, imatinib treatment delayed the onset of diabetes in a CTL-induced diabetes model. In summary, imatinib treatment in vivo selectively inhibits the expansion of antigen-experienced memory CTLs without affecting primary T- or B-cell responses.

However, unsupervised methods are scarce. Examples are using the variance of data collected for each feature, or the projection of the feature on the first principal component. We propose a novel unsupervised criterion, based on SVD-entropy, selecting a feature according to its contribution to the entropy (CE) calculated on a leave-one-out basis. This can be implemented in four ways: simple ranking according to CE values (SR); forward selection by accumulating features according to which set produces highest entropy (FS1); forward selection by accumulating features through the choice of the best CE out of the remaining ones (FS2); backward elimination (BE) of features with the lowest CE. RESULTS: We apply our methods to different benchmarks. In each case we evaluate the success of clustering the data in the selected feature spaces, by measuring Jaccard scores with respect to known classifications. We demonstrate that feature filtering according to CE outperforms the variance method and gene-shaving. There are cases where the analysis, based on a small set of selected features, outperforms the best score reported when all information was used. Our method calls for an optimal size of the relevant feature set. This turns out to be just a few percents of the number of genes in the two Leukemia datasets that we have analyzed.

The authors carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of workers in the rubber-producing industry.

Since only viral DNA deposited at ND10 initiates transcription, ND10 structures were hypothesized to be essential for viral replication. On the other hand, interferon treatment induces an up-regulation of ND10 structures and viruses have evolved polypeptides that disperse the dot-like accumulation of ND10 proteins, suggesting that ND10 could also be part of an intrinsic defense mechanism. In order to obtain evidence for either a proviral or an antiviral function of ND10, we generated primary human fibroblasts with a stable, short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown (kd) of PML. In these cells, other ND10-associated proteins like hDaxx showed a diffuse nuclear distribution. Interestingly, we observed that HCMV infection induced the de novo formation of ND10-like hDaxx and Sp100 accumulations that colocalized with IE2 and were disrupted, in the apparent absence of PML, in an IE1-dependent manner during the first hours after infection. Furthermore, infection of PML-kd cells with wild-type HCMV at a low multiplicity of infection resulted in enhanced replication. In particular, a significantly increased plaque formation was detected, suggesting that more cells are able to support initiation of replication in the absence of PML. While there was no difference in viral DNA uptake between PML-kd and control cells, we observed a considerable increase in the number of immediate-early (IE) protein-positive cells, indicating that the depletion of PML augments the initiation of viral IE gene expression.

PML has been implicated in many cellular processes, and ND10 are frequently associated with the replicating genomes of DNA viruses. During herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, the viral regulatory protein ICP0 localizes to ND10 and induces the degradation of PML, thereby disrupting ND10 and dispersing their constituent proteins. ICP0-null mutant viruses are defective in PML degradation and ND10 disruption, and concomitantly they initiate productive infection very inefficiently. Although these data are consistent with a repressive role for PML and/or ND10 during HSV-1 infection, evidence in support of this hypothesis has been inconclusive. By use of short interfering RNA technology, we demonstrate that depletion of PML increases both gene expression and plaque formation by an ICP0-negative HSV-1 mutant, while having no effect on wild-type HSV-1.

Rare mononuclear cells acting as centers of BLV infection in culture were present within 4 to 6 days in efferent lymph and within 6 to 10 days in blood. Soon after BLV injection, immunoglobulin M+ (IgM+) and CD8+ cells increased in efferent lymph and oscillated reciprocally in frequency. CD8+ blasts increased on days 4 to 6, when infectious centers increased 100-fold in lymph. On days 6 and 7, both lymph and blood were enriched with CD8+ cells that were labeled late on day 5 with an intravenous pulse of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Lymph, but not blood, was enriched with BrdU+ B cells on day 7. Capsid-specific antibodies became detectable in efferent lymph on days 6 to 8 and surface glycoprotein-specific antibodies on day 9, preceding their detection in serum by 9 to 14 days. Systemic dissemination of BLV-infected cells was thus accompanied by an increase in proliferating CD8+ cells and the onset of BLV-specific antibodies in lymph. Infectious centers reached maximum frequencies of 0.2% in lymph by days 11 to 13, and then their frequencies increased by 5- to 40-fold in blood cells, suggesting that many infected blood cells do not recirculate back into lymph. Beginning on days 10 to 13, a subpopulation of B cells having high levels of surface IgM increased sharply in peripheral blood. Such cells were not present in lymph.

PML loss occurs frequently in human tumors through unknown posttranslational mechanisms. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is oncogenic and frequently upregulated in human tumors. Here we show that CK2 regulates PML protein levels by promoting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation dependent on direct phosphorylation at Ser517. Consequently, PML mutants that are resistant to CK2 phosphorylation display increased tumor-suppressive functions. In a faithful mouse model of lung cancer, we demonstrate that Pml inactivation leads to increased tumorigenesis. Furthermore, CK2 pharmacological inhibition enhances the PML tumor-suppressive property in vivo. Importantly, we found an inverse correlation between CK2 kinase activity and PML protein levels in human lung cancer-derived cell lines and primary specimens.

The incidence of aspergillosis has increased during the past two decades and is a frequently lethal complication of acute leukemia patients that occurs following both chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. The diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) according to the criteria that are established by European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group raise difficulties in severely ill patients. Despite established improvements in field of diagnosis (galactomannan antigen, quantitative PCR, real-time PCR for Aspergillus spp., and findings of computed tomography) and treatment with new antifungals, it is still a major problem in patients with acute leukemia. However, prompt and effective treatment of IPA is crucial because most patients will need subsequent chemotherapy for underlying hematologic disease as soon as possible. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 33-year-old male patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia diagnosed in 1993 that developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to A. flavus at relapse in 2003. The patient was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B and underwent surgical pulmonary resection. The operative course was uneventful. CONCLUSION: This report emphasizes the clinical picture, applicability of recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for IPA. For early identification of a patient infected with IPA, a high index of suspicion and careful clinical and radiological examinations with serial screening for galactomannan should be established. If aspergillosis is suspected, anti-aspergillosis drug should be administered immediately, and if a unique pulmonary lesion remains, surgical resection should be considered to prevent reactivation during consecutive chemotherapy courses and to improve the outcome.",,"['Ali, Ridvan', 'Ozkalemkas, Fahir', 'Ozcelik, Tulay', 'Ozkocaman, Vildan', 'Ozkan, Atilla', 'Bayram, Sami', 'Ener, Beyza', 'Ursavas, Ahmet', 'Ozal, Guze', 'Tunali, Ahmet']","['Ali R', 'Ozkalemkas F', 'Ozcelik T', 'Ozkocaman V', 'Ozkan A', 'Bayram S', 'Ener B', 'Ursavas A', 'Ozal G', 'Tunali A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Uludag University School of Medicine, Bursa, Turkey. ridvanali@uludag.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,Annals of clinical microbiology and antimicrobials,101152152,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*surgery', '*Aspergillus flavus', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Lung Diseases/diagnosis/drug therapy/*microbiology/surgery', 'Male', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/07/29 09:00,2006/09/19 09:00,['2006/07/29 09:00'],"['2006/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['1476-0711-5-17 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-0711-5-17 [doi]']",epublish,Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob. 2006 Jul 27;5:17. doi: 10.1186/1476-0711-5-17.,20060727,,,,PMC1550418,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differential diagnosis of malignant and benign thyroid tissues is one such case, and supplementary diagnosis such as that by gene expression profile is expected. RESULTS: With four thyroid tissue types, i.e., papillary carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, follicular adenoma, and normal thyroid, we performed gene expression profiling with adaptor-tagged competitive PCR, a high-throughput RT-PCR technique. For differential diagnosis, we applied a novel multi-class predictor, introducing probabilistic outputs. Multi-class predictors were constructed using various combinations of binary classifiers. The learning set included 119 samples, and the predictors were evaluated by strict leave-one-out cross validation. Trials included classical combinations, i.e., one-to-one, one-to-the-rest, but the predictor using more combination exhibited the better prediction accuracy. This characteristic was consistent with other gene expression data sets. The performance of the selected predictor was then tested with an independent set consisting of 49 samples. The resulting test prediction accuracy was 85.7%. CONCLUSION: Molecular diagnosis of thyroid tissues is feasible by gene expression profiling, and the current level is promising towards the automatic diagnostic tool to complement the present medical procedures. A multi-class predictor with an exhaustive combination of binary classifiers could achieve a higher prediction accuracy than those with classical combinations and other predictors such as multi-class SVM. The probabilistic outputs of the predictor offer more detailed information for each sample, which enables visualization of each sample in low-dimensional classification spaces.

Although there in no epidemiological evidence of relation between X-ray developer, fixer and replenisher liquids and AML, these included glutaraldehyde which has weakly associated with lymphocytic leukemia in rats and hydroquinone has been increasingly implicated in producing leukemia, causing DNA and chromosomal damage, inhibits topo-isomerase II, alter hematopoiesis and inhibit apoptosis of neoplastic cells. CASE PRESENTATION: Two white females (A and B) hired in 1985 as medical radiation technologists in a primary care center, in Greece. In July 2001, woman A, 38-years-old, was diagnosed as having acute monocytic leukaemia (FAB M5). The patient did not respond to therapy and died three weeks later. In August 2001, woman B, 35-year-old, was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (FAB M3). Since discharge, she is in continuous complete remission. Both women were non smokers without any medical history. Shortly after these incidents official inspectors and experts inspected workplace, examined equipment, archives of repairs, notes, interviewed and monitored employees. They concluded that shielding was inadequate for balcony's door but personal monitoring did not show any exceeding of TLV of 20 mSv yearly and cytogenetics analysis did not reveal findings considered to be characteristics of ionizing exposure. Equipment for developing photos had a long list of repairs, mainly leakages of liquids and increases of temperature. On several occasions the floor has been flooded especially during 1987-1993 and 1997-2001. Inspection confirmed a complete lack of ventilation and many spoiled medical x-ray films.

This study investigated the epidemiology of cutaneous lymphoma subtypes in Japan and compared it with other countries. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with cutaneous lymphoma attending the Department of Dermatology, National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Cancer Center were reviewed. The World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies was adopted. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients, 31 had primary cutaneous lymphoma (PCL) and 31 had secondary cutaneous lymphoma (SCL). T- and natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma accounted for 80% of PCL, of which, mycosis fungoides accounted for almost 35%. Of the 31 patients with secondary cutaneous lymphoma, 17 patients (54%) had T- and NK-cell lymphoma, including nine adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma patients, and 14 patients (46%) had B-cell lymphoma, including 11 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients. The majority of patients with SCL and NK-cell lymphoma with primary or secondary skin lesions had a poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: PCL in this study showed a similar incidence to that of other institutions in Japan, while also demonstrating different frequencies from that of other countries, suggesting that the relative frequency of different PCL subtypes differ according to geographical location, similar to previous reports of systemic malignant lymphoma.",,"['Yasukawa, Kana', 'Kato, Naoko', 'Kodama, Kazuo', 'Hamasaka, Asuka', 'Hata, Hiroo']","['Yasukawa K', 'Kato N', 'Kodama K', 'Hamasaka A', 'Hata H']","['Department of Dermatology, National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Cancer Center, Sapporo, Japan. kanay@med.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/classification/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/epidemiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/classification/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/classification/epidemiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sezary Syndrome/classification/epidemiology/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'World Health Organization']",2006/07/29 09:00,2006/09/15 09:00,['2006/07/29 09:00'],"['2006/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['CUP460 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0560.2006.00460.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2006 Jul;33(7):487-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.2006.00460.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sumoylation and neddylation as posttranslational modifications of proteins and their ubiquitinylation and its significance].",619-27,"Posttranslational protein modifications are effective devices that cells use to control the functions of proteins. Ubiquitin-like protein modifiers (Ubls) are posttranslationally attached to proteins by enzymatic reactions that are similar to ubiquitin conjugation. SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) family proteins are the most intriguing Ubls. Sumoylation is the covalent attachment of SUMO to target proteins. Neddylation is the process that conjugates the ubiquitin-like polypeptide Nedd8 to the conserved lysines of cullins. Cullin family proteins organize ubiquitin ligase complexes to target numerous cellular proteins for polyubiquitinylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Despite the similarities in their structure and in enzymatic reactions Ubls and ubiquitin have distinct functions. In contrast with polyubiquitinylation that targets modified proteins to proteasome degradation, the biological consequences of sumoylation include the increase of protein stability. Sumoylation also helps in the protein transport from the cytoplasm to nucleus of cells, regulates transcriptional activities of proteins and mediates the binding of the protein to other proteins. Neddylation has importance for cell cycle control, signal transmission, cell differentiation and DNA repair. Recent studies linked sumoylation and neddylation of several proteins to important diseases (neurodegenerative diseases, acute promyelocytic leukemia, type I diabetes and other disorders).

The aim of the current study was to test the applicability of an easy flow cytometry protocol for ZAP-70 measurement in CLL samples. Samples from 61 CLL patients and 44 normal subjects were analyzed using a commercial ZAP-70 monoclonal antibody (1E7.2 clone) conjugated with phycoerythrin (PE) and Alexa 488 fluorochromes. Modifications of the published methods led to the structure of a simplified in-house method of ZAP-70 measurement. A three-color approach was used with CD19, CD3 gating comparing with the isotype control provided by the same manufacturer. The cutoff levels for ZAP-70 positivity were defined from a receiver operator characteristic curve in relation to the IgV(H) mutational status and from the ln normalized mean value +2 SD of normal controls. Using the 20% cutoff value for ZAP-70 positivity in CLL patients defined by the literature, ZAP-PE had a sensitivity of 55% and a specificity of 98% in predicting the IgV(H) mutational status, whereas the corresponding values for ZAP-Alexa were 55% and 84%, respectively. Using the 7% cutoff value for CD38 positivity, the sensitivity was 55%, whereas the specificity was 76%. ZAP-70-positive patients showed a shorter time to disease progression in comparison with ZAP-70-negative patients (p < 0.001).

SHP1, a tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates JAK/STAT, is frequently absent in ALK+ ALCL owing to gene methylation. To test the hypothesis that loss of SHP1 contributes to JAK3/STAT3 activation in ALK+ ALCL cells, we induced SHP1 expression using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, in ALK+ ALCL cell lines, and correlated with changes in the JAK3/STAT3 pathway. 5-AZA gradually restored SHP1 expression in Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cells over 5 days. The initially low level of SHP1 expression did not result in significant changes to the expression or tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT3. However, higher levels of SHP1 seen subsequently correlated with substantial decreases in JAK3 and pJAK3, followed by pSTAT3 (but not STAT3). Importantly, the decrease in JAK3 was abrogated by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. 5-AZA induced no significant increase in apoptosis but it sensitized ALCL cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Our findings support the concept that loss of SHP1 contributes to the constitutive activation of JAK3/STAT3 in ALK+ ALCL cells.

Treatment-related mortality appears less with RIC than that observed with conventional myeloablative regimens. Available data support the fact that a myeloablative regimen is not required for successful engraftment and some patients appear to be cured of their disease. Despite the plethora of clinical reports, however, no prospective studies have been conducted that establish this procedure as the preferred option in AML. On the other hand, patients formerly excluded from a myeloablative procedure such as the 'elderly' and those with significant comorbid conditions, often may be RIC transplant candidates.

However, membrane transport mechanisms mediating Mg(2+) influx in mammalian cells are poorly understood. Here, we show that mechanosensitive (MS) cationic channels activated by stretch are permeable for Mg(2+) ions at different extracellular concentrations including physiological ones. Single-channel currents were recorded from cell-attached and inside-out patches on K562 leukaemia cells at various concentrations of MgCl(2) when Mg(2+) was the only available carrier of inward currents. At 2 mM Mg(2+), inward mechanogated currents representing Mg(2+) influx through MS channels corresponded to the unitary conductance of about 5 pS. At higher Mg(2+) levels, only slight increase of single-channel currents and conductance occurred, implying that Mg(2+) permeation through MS channels is characterized by strong saturation. At 20 and 90 mM Mg(2+), mean conductance values for inward currents carried by Mg(2+) were rather similar, being equal to 6.8 +/- 0.5 and 6.4 +/- 0.5 pS, respectively. The estimation of the channel-selective permeability according to constant field equation is obviously limited due to saturation effects. We conclude that the detection of single currents is the main evidence for Mg(2+) permeation through membrane channels activated by stretch.

In human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, the IE1 (for ""immediate-early 1"") protein has a marked effect on PML bodies via de-SUMOylation of PML protein. Here, we report a novel real-time monitoring system for HCMV-infected cells using a newly established cell line (SE/15) that stably expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP)-PML protein. In SE/15 cells, HCMV infection causes specific and efficient dispersion of GFP-PML bodies in an IE1-dependent manner, allowing the infected cells to be monitored by fluorescence microscopy without immunostaining. Since a specific change in the detergent solubility of GFP-PML occurs upon infection, the infected cells can be quantified by GFP fluorescence measurement after extraction. With this assay, the inhibitory effects of heparin and neutralizing antibodies were determined in small-scale cultures, indicating its usefulness for screening inhibitory reagents for laboratory virus strains. Furthermore, we established a sensitive imaging assay by counting the number of nuclei containing dispersed GFP-PML, which is applicable for titration of slow-growing clinical isolates. In all strains tested, the virus titers estimated by the GFP-PML imaging assay were well correlated with the plaque-forming cell numbers determined in human embryonic lung cells. Coculture of SE/15 cells and HCMV-infected fibroblasts permitted a rapid and reliable method for estimating the 50% inhibitory concentration values of drugs for clinical isolates in susceptibility testing. Taken together, these results demonstrate the development of a rapid, sensitive, quantitative, and specific detection system for HCMV-infected cells involving a simple procedure that can be used for titration of low-titer clinical isolates.",,"['Ueno, T', 'Eizuru, Y', 'Katano, H', 'Kurata, T', 'Sata, T', 'Irie, S', 'Ogawa-Goto, K']","['Ueno T', 'Eizuru Y', 'Katano H', 'Kurata T', 'Sata T', 'Irie S', 'Ogawa-Goto K']","['Nippi Research Institute of Biomatrix, Adachi, Tokyo 120-8601, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (immediate-early proteins, cytomegalovirus)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['Anticoagulants/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Viral/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*metabolism/virology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism/virology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/*metabolism', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lung/cytology/embryology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2006/07/28 09:00,2006/10/07 09:00,['2006/07/28 09:00'],"['2006/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['50/8/2806 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.01641-05 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006 Aug;50(8):2806-13. doi: 10.1128/AAC.01641-05.,,,,,PMC1538688,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, aspiration of BM involves invasive procedures. We isolated MSC from human full term umbilical cord tissues (UC). The biological characteristics of MSC derived from UC (UC-MSC) were further determined and compared with normal adult bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC). DESIGN AND METHODS: MSC were isolated from UC by enzyme digestion and cultured in appropriate growth medium. The isolation efficiency, cell yield, colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) frequency, growth kinetics, phenotypic characteristics, multi-lineage differentiation capacity, cytokine spectrum as well as hematopoiesis-supportive function of UC-MSC were determined and compared with those of BM-MSC. RESULTS: MSC were successfully isolated from all 36 UC and six BM samples we collected for this study. The mean number of nucleated cells isolated from UC was 1yen106/cm and the yield of adherent cells was 8.6yen105/cm. UC-MSC shared most of the characteristic of BM-MSC, including fibroblastic-like morphology, immunophenotype, cell cycle status, adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potentials, and hematopoiesis-supportive function. The CFU-F frequency was higher in UC nucleated cells (1:1609 +/- 0.18) than in BM nucleated cells (1:35700 +/- 0.01) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, in comparison with BM-MSC, the UC-MSC had a higher proliferation capacity and lower levels of expression of CD106 and HLA-ABC (p < 0.05). Immunofluoresent and western blot assays revealed that UC-MSC had a higher percentage of neuron specific enolase-positive cells than had BM-MSC after neuronal induction. Finally, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that UC-MSC had a cytokine spectrum very similar to that of BM-MSC, including expression of the mRNA of stem cell factor, leukemia inhibitor factor, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, Flt3-ligand, interleukin-6, vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal-derived factor-1, but UC-MCS additionally expressed mRNA of granulocyte macrophage and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. After co-culture with CD34+ cord blood cells for 5 weeks, no significant difference in colony-forming cells was observed between the CD34+ cells/UC-MSC and CD34+ cells/BM-MSC co-cultures (p > 0.05). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We have established a protocol to isolate abundant MSC from human umbilical cords with a 100% success rate.

METHODS: Phenotype of cells infiltrated into arthritic joints in env-pX rats was analyzed using flow cytometry and cell-transfer experiments were done using env-pX and wild-type WKAH rats. RESULTS: The majority of T cells infiltrated into arthritic joints in env-pX rats exhibited a CD4 and activated phenotype. Transfer of these T cells into articular space in wild-type WKAH rats succeeded to induce arthritis similarly seen in env-pX rats. However, injection of the cells into sites other than joints did not induce inflammation. Transfer of in vitro-stimulated lymph node cells from disease-free env-pX rats into articular space did not induce arthritis in wild-type WKAH rats. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that articular tissues carrying the env-pX transgene are required for generation of arthritogenic T cells in env-pX rats. However, the constitutive antigens other than the transgene products are recognized as immunological targets by the arthritogenic T cells in the advanced arthritic joints.

Examining the anti- and proapoptotic proteins in constitutively activated FLT3 signalling in BaF3/ITD and MV4-11 cells, we found that the level of Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (BAD) phosphorylation was greatly decreased in response to FLT3 inhibition. Both Ser-112 and Ser-136 of BAD are rapidly dephosphorylated after treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor CEP-701 in BaF3/ITD and MV4-11 cells. In confirmation of the cell line data, BAD was highly phosphorylated in both constitutively activated wild-type and mutant FLT3 primary AML samples, and rapidly dephosphorylated after treatment of the primary samples with CEP-701. Upstream proteins known to phosphorylate BAD include Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk/ MAPK), Pim-1 and Pim-2. We and other groups have shown that constitutively activated FLT3 induces multiple signalling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, Erk/MAPK and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/STAT). Thus, BAD may be a nexus point upon which these multiple signalling pathways converge in FLT3-mediated cell survival. In support of this, siRNA knockdown of BAD expression in MV4-11 cells conferred resistance to CEP-701-mediated apoptosis. Our data suggests that Pim-1 is one of the principal kinases mediating the anti-apoptotic function of FLT3/ITD signalling via the phosphorylation of BAD.",,"['Kim, Kyu-Tae', 'Levis, Mark', 'Small, Donald']","['Kim KT', 'Levis M', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/07/28 09:00,2006/11/15 09:00,['2006/07/28 09:00'],"['2006/07/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6225 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06225.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Sep;134(5):500-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06225.x.,,,,"['CA095600/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mouse models have often allowed us to achieve insight into the pathogenesis of the human disease as well as to test novel therapeutic modalities in preclinical studies. However, one of the most rewarding cultural shifts triggered by these modeling efforts stems from what was originally perceived as background noise or modeling inaccuracy. Manipulation of the involved genes often triggered cancer susceptibility in cell types other than the hematopoietic lineages. This prompted us to challenge a fundamental misconception in cancer genetics that the approximately 200 genes directly involved in chromosomal translocations associated with hematopoietic malignancies are specifically and functionally restricted to leukemia/lymphoma pathogenesis only. The genetics underlying the pathogenesis of leukemia and lymphoma have historically been regarded as distinct from those underlying the pathogenesis of solid tumors because hematopoietic malignancies are often associated with characteristic chromosomal translocations that are leukemia- or lymphoma-specific. In this paper, we discuss how leukemia/lymphoma genes indeed participate in fundamental proto-oncogenic and growth-suppressive networks and may play a wider role in cancer pathogenesis.

The data source was a longitudinal (2000-2003) inpatient database from 28 US hospitals. Data on 275 AML patients aged 60 and older were analyzed for demographic and treatment characteristics, hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), overall days of stay (DOS), and charges across multiple admissions. Multivariate modeling was performed to determine factors that influenced outcomes. Overall, 115 (41.8%) patients received inpatient chemotherapy (CT); most (90.4%) received it on the first admission. Of all initial CT regimens 40.9% consisted of a single agent. The mean LOS for initial hospitalization was 23.0 (SD 21.8) days for patients who received CT and 6.7 (SD 7.5) days for those who did not. One quarter (25.3%) of initial hospitalizations resulted in death. On initial hospitalization, mean total charges were $113,118 (SD $220,417) for patients who received CT and $43,999 (SD $190,533) for those who did not; for both groups mean charges were higher than respective subsequent admission charges. Overall, in-hospital mortality did not differ significantly between on-CT and off-CT groups (43.5 and 38.8%, respectively).

In 1895 Wilhelm Rontgen discovered the X-rays. In 1896 H. Becquerel described the phenomenon of radioactivity. He showed that a radioactive uranium salt was emitting radioactivity which passing through a metal foil darkened a photographic plate. An analogous experiment performed by S.Thomson in London was announced to the president of the Royal Society of London before the time H.Becquerel announced his discovery but Thomson never claimed priority for his discovery. Muarie Sklodowska Curie (1867-1934) was undoubtedly the most important person to attribute to the discovery of radioactivity. In 1898 she discovered radium as a natural radioactive element. This is how she describes the hard time she had, working with her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) for the discovery of radium and polonium: ""During the first year we did not go to the theater or to a concert or visited friends. I miss my relatives, my father and my daughter that I see every morning and only for a little while. But I do not complain..."". In presenting her discovery of radium, Madame Curie said: "" ...in the hands of a criminal, radium is very dangerous. So we must often ask ourselves: will humanity earn or lose from this discovery? I, myself belong to those who believe the former..."". The notebooks that Madame Curie had when she was working with radium and other radioactive elements like polonium, thorium and uranium are now kept in Paris. They are contaminated with radioactive materials having very long half-lives and for this reason anyone who wishes to have access to these notes should sign that he takes full responsibility. There are some more interesting points in Madame Curie's life which may not be widely known like: Although her full name is Maria Sklodowska-Curie, she is not known neither by that full name nor as Maria Sklodowska but as Marie Curie. Madame Curie was the second of five children. At the age of 24 she went to Sorbonne-Paris after being invited by her sister Bronja to study for about 2-3 years; instead she stayed in Paris for her whole life. Her doctorate was on the subject: ""Research on radioactive substances"" which she completed in six years under the supervision of H. Becquerel. Pierre Curie was Director of the Physics Laboratory of the Ecole Municipale of Physics and Industrial Chemistry when he married M. Curie in 1895. Pierre Curie left his other research projects and worked full time with his wife. In this laboratory M. Curie and her husband Pierre discovered radium and polonium. In 1901 Pierre Curie induced a radiation burn on his forearm by applying on his skin radiferous barium chloride for 10 hours. During World War I, M.Curie organized for the Red Cross a fleet of radiological ambulances each with X-ray apparates which were called ""Little Curies"". The X-ray tubes of these apparates were unshielded and so M.Curie was exposed to high doses of radiation. Once an ambulance fell into a ditch and M.Curie who was inside the ambulance was badly bruised and stayed at home for 3 days. M. Curie with her daughters, Irene and Eve, was invited and visited America in 1921. She led a successful campaign to collect radium for her experiments. Before leaving America, President Harding donated through her to the Radium Institute of Paris 1 g of radium for research purposes. At that time the process to obtain 0.5 g of pure radium bromide required 1 ton of ore and 5 tons of chemicals. No measures of radiation protection were taken back then. In 1929 Madame Curie visited the United States for a second time. She met with President Hoover and with the help of the Polish women's association in America collected funds for another gram of radium. Madame Curie died of leukemia on July 4, 1934. Sixty years after her death her remnants were laid to rest under the dome of the Pantheon. Thus she became the first woman under her own merit, to rest in the Pantheon. In 1934 at the Institute of Radiology in Paris, Frederique Joliot and Irene Curie-Joliot discovered artificial radiation. They studied alpha particles and beta;-radiation.",,"['Grammaticos, Philip C']",['Grammaticos PC'],"['Professor Emeritus of Nuclear Medicine, Thessaloniki, Greece. fgrammat@med.auth.gr.']",['eng'],['Editorial'],Greece,Hell J Nucl Med,Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine,101257471,,,,2006/07/27 09:00,2006/07/27 09:01,['2006/07/27 09:00'],"['2006/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/27 09:01 [medline]', '2006/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hell J Nucl Med. 2004 Jan-Apr;7(1):30-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on the geographic variation in the occurrence of childhood cancer in Jordan. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cases were identified from the Jordan National Cancer Registry. We collected data on age, sex, type, primary site, and stage of cancer. Tumor topography and morphology were coded according to the accepted international standard. For all cases registered, 95.2% were histologically diagnosed. Incidence rates were calculated as annual rates per million population. The denominator is the 1997 estimate of the childhood population at ages 0-4, 5-9, and 10-14 years. RESULTS: There were 646 registered primary malignant neoplasms during the three-year study period (1996-1998). The annual incidence rate for all types of cancer combined was 113 per million children. The rate among children less than 5 years of age was 134.5 per million, for 5-9 years it was 97.8 per million, and for 10-14 years it was 104.1 per million. Overall, the age-standardized annual incidence rate was 113.8 per million. The most common diagnostic group was leukemia, accounting for more than a third of all cases, followed by brain tumors and lymphoma. The highest rate was in the capital, Amman. CONCLUSION: The pattern of childhood cancer in Jordan seems to be generally similar to other countries in the region, particularly the observed excess of lymphoma.

Activating mutations of FLT3 are present in approximately one-third of patients, while many nonmutants show evidence of FLT3 activation, which appears to play a significant role in leukemogenesis. We studied the effects of lestaurtinib (CEP701) and PKC412, 2 small molecule inhibitors of FLT3, on 65 diagnostic AML blast samples. Both agents induced concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in most cases, although responses to PKC412 required higher drug concentrations. Cytotoxic responses were highly heterogeneous and were only weakly associated with FLT3 mutation status and FLT3 expression. Importantly, lestaurtinib induced cytotoxicity in a synergistic fashion with cytarabine, particularly in FLT3 mutant samples. Both lestaurtinib and PKC412 caused inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation in all samples. Translation of FLT3 inhibition into cytotoxicity was influenced by the degree of residual FLT3 phosphorylation remaining and correlated with deactivation of STAT5 and MAP kinase. FLT3 mutant and wild-type cases both varied considerably in their dependence on FLT3 signaling for survival.

Of the 8 patients who did not show detectable CTLp frequency while in remission after induction chemotherapy, 7 subsequently experienced leukemia relapse. In patients undergoing A-BMT, molecular fingerprinting of the TCR-Vbeta repertoire, performed on antileukemia lines, demonstrated that selected antileukemia T-cell clonotypes, detectable in bone marrow before transplantation, survived ex vivo pharmacologic purging and were found in the recipient after A-BMT.

CASE SUMMARY: TLS developed in 2 neonates born at 38 weeks' gestational age; both were managed in part with rasburicase. One patient was a 21-day-old infant who received 2 days of induction chemotherapy for the treatment of congenital Stage IV-S neuroblastoma. With a single 0.2 mg/kg dose of rasburicase, the serum urate level normalized and the infant completed therapy without incident. The second patient was a 4-day-old neonate with congenital precursor-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who presented with spontaneous TLS complicated by renal dysfunction. Despite several doses of intravenous rasburicase (2 doses of 0.1 mg/kg and 4 doses of 0.2 mg/kg), as well as aggressive supportive therapy, the infant died of complications arising from uncontrolled TLS. DISCUSSION: Neonates may be at particular risk for TLS given their immature renal function and its predisposition toward metabolic derangements. While rasburicase has the potential to provide a rapid reversal of TLS in this patient population, when TLS is complicated by pre-existing acute renal failure, additional interventions and alternative anti-tumor strategies may be necessary for a successful outcome. When managing TLS in infancy, clinicians must consider the relative degree of renal immaturity and its predisposition toward metabolic derangements. CONCLUSIONS: Rasburicase appears to be well tolerated and effective in lowering serum urate concentrations in the treatment of therapy-related TLS in neonates. However, in instances of spontaneous TLS complicated by the normally low glomerular filtration rate in the newborn infant, the use of rasburicase and other supportive care measures may still be inadequate, warranting further study.",,"['McNutt, Deborah M', 'Holdsworth, Mark T', 'Wong, Craig', 'Hanrahan, Jeffery D', 'Winter, Stuart S']","['McNutt DM', 'Holdsworth MT', 'Wong C', 'Hanrahan JD', 'Winter SS']","['University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Adrenal Gland Neoplasms/blood/complications/congenital/drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/blood/complications/congenital/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/blood/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Urate Oxidase/*therapeutic use', 'Uric Acid/blood']",2006/07/27 09:00,2007/02/22 09:00,['2006/07/27 09:00'],"['2006/07/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['aph.1G670 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1G670 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2006 Jul-Aug;40(7-8):1445-50. doi: 10.1345/aph.1G670.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key feature of this protein is its ability to induce the assembly of nuclear compartments termed PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs).

Confocal real-time imaging of cells expressing YFP-tagged PML did not reveal de novo formation of new PML-NBs following UV-irradiation, which shows that ssDNA focus formation occurred within pre-existing PML-NBs. Moreover, siRNA-mediated depletion of PML prevented ssDNA focus formation and sensitized cells to UV-induced apoptosis. PML-dependent ssDNA focus formation was found to be particularly efficient during S-phase of the cell cycle, and PML-depleted cells became retarded in S-phase upon growth in the presence of etoposide. In addition, we found that caffeine and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor NU1027 enhanced UV-induced recruitment of ssDNA to PML-NBs.

We studied structure-activity relationships of these compounds using biological experiments specific for tubulin binding. The modification of cell cycle progression induced by compounds 1 and 2 was characterized by an apoptotic induction on human breast cells (HBL100). In addition, these two molecules disturbed cell survival by depolymerizing the microtubule network, leading to a mitotic block. We then determined the thermodynamic parameters of their interaction with purified tubulin by fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal microcalorimetry.

Smad4, a tumor suppressor, functions as an essential intracellular signal transducer of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that some tumor-derived mutations of Smad4 are associated with protein instability; however, the precise mechanism by which mutated Smad4 proteins undergo rapid degradation remains to be elucidated. A missense mutation of the SMAD4 gene in the Mad homology 1 (MH1) domain (c.305C>T, Pro102Leu) and one frameshift mutation resulting in termination in the Mad homology 2 (MH2) domain (c.1447_1448insAATA, Delta483-552) have been identified in acute myelogenous leukemia. It is not known whether protein instability of these SMAD4 mutants is one of the contributors to TGF-beta signaling disruption in acute myelogenous leukemia. Here we report that these two acute myelogenous leukemia-derived SMAD4 mutants are degraded rapidly when compared to their wild-type counterpart. We have demonstrated that both mutated proteins exhibit enhanced polyubiquitination (or polyubiquitylation) and proteasomal degradation. Importantly, we found that beta-transducin-repeat-containing protein 1 (beta-TrCP1), an F-box protein in the ubiquitin E3 ligase Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) complex, directly interacts with and acts as a critical determinant for degradation of both mutated SMAD4 proteins. In addition, small interference RNA (siRNA)-triggered endogenous beta-TrCP1 suppression increased the protein expression level of both overexpressed SMAD4 mutants and endogenous mutated SMAD4 protein in acute myelogenous leukemia cells. These data suggest that mutated SMAD4 proteins undergo rapid degradation in acute myelogenous leukemia cells via SCF(beta-TrCP1) E3 ligase-mediated protein ubiquitination (or ubiquitylation) and subsequent proteasomal degradation.",,"['Yang, Lei', 'Wang, Ning', 'Tang, Yi', 'Cao, Xu', 'Wan, Mei']","['Yang L', 'Wang N', 'Tang Y', 'Cao X', 'Wan M']","[""School of Medicine, Shihezi University, Shihezi, Xinjiang, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,"['0 (BTRC protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SMAD4 protein, human)', '0 (Smad4 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Smad4 Protein/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2006/07/26 09:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['2006/07/26 09:00'],"['2006/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/humu.20387 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2006 Sep;27(9):897-905. doi: 10.1002/humu.20387.,,,,"['CA101955-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA112942-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK53757/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia cell lines (i.e., Daudi and Jurkat) with undetectable m-calpain were more susceptible to the apoptotic effects in response to calpain inhibition, while apoptosis was not detected in PC-3 prostate cancer cells, which highly express m-calpain. The extent of apoptosis in HeLa cells was moderate under identical conditions. Apoptosis induced by calpain inhibition was accompanied by caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis showed that aldehyde calpain inhibitors arrested cells at the G2/M boundary in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that aldehyde calpain inhibitors exhibit their cytotoxic effects via induction of G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Importantly, the compounds failed to exert any inhibitory effects toward 20S proteasome. Collectively, our results suggest that calpain is a novel target for the treatment of a variety of cancer diseases and provide leads for further discovery and development of calpain inhibitors.",,"['Guan, Na', 'Korukonda, Rajani', 'Hurh, Eunju', 'Schmittgen, Thomas D', 'Donkor, Isaac O', 'Dalton, James T']","['Guan N', 'Korukonda R', 'Hurh E', 'Schmittgen TD', 'Donkor IO', 'Dalton JT']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Aldehydes/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calpain/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors']",2006/07/26 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2006/07/26 09:00'],"['2006/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2006 Sep;29(3):655-63.,,,,['1R21CA104982-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results demonstrated that the CV extract dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation of HL-60 cells (IC50 = 150.6 microg/ml), with increased nucleosome production from apoptotic cells. Expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax was significantly up-regulated in HL-60 cells treated with the CV extract, especially after 16 and 24 h. Meanwhile, expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was concomitantly down-regulated, as reflected by the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The CV extract markedly, but transiently, promoted the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol after 24-h incubation. In vivo studies in the athymic nude mouse xenograft model also confirmed the growth-inhibitory activity of the CV extract on human leukemia cells.

We have therefore re-examined the temperature-sensitive uptake of anandamide in ND7/23 mouse neuroblastoma x rat dorsal root ganglion neurone hybrid cells and RBL2H3 rat basophilic leukaemia cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Cellular uptake of [(3)H] anandamide was measured in the presence of bovine serum albumin at different incubation temperatures and times. Rates of uptake were also measured in wells alone. Free anandamide concentrations were calculated by published methods. KEY RESULTS: Anandamide showed a time-dependent saturable uptake into ND7/23 cells. The uptake was greater at 37 degrees C than at 4 degrees C for a given added anandamide concentration following a 5 min incubation. However, this temperature-dependency reflected temperature-dependent effects on the concentration of anandamide available for uptake, rather than the uptake process itself. A similar conclusion could be drawn for the rapid ( approximately 1 min) uptake of anandamide into RBL2H3 cells. In contrast, re-analysis of published data for P19 cells indicated a clear temperature-dependency of the uptake at long (15 min) incubation times. The level of anandamide retained by wells alone provided a better measure of free anandamide concentrations than calculated values. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: ND7/23 cells may be a useful model system for the study of anandamide uptake.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty AML cases with complex karyotypes were analyzed using array-CGH; parallel analysis of gene expression was performed in a subset of cases. RESULTS: Genomic losses were found more frequently than gains. The most frequent losses affected 5q (77%), 17p (55%), and 7q (45%), and the most frequent genomic gains 11q (40%) and 8q (38%). Critical segments could be delineated to genomic fragments of only 0.8 to a few megabase-pairs of DNA. In lost/gained regions, gene expression profiling detected a gene dosage effect with significant lower/higher average gene expression levels across the genes located in the respective regions. Furthermore, high-level DNA amplifications were identified in several regions: 11q23.3-q24.1 (n = 7), 21q22 (n = 6), 11q23.3 (n = 5), 13q12 (n = 3), 8q24 (n = 3), 9p24 (n = 2), 12p13 (n = 2), and 20q11 (n = 2). Parallel analysis of gene expression in critical amplicons displayed overexpressed candidate genes (eg, C8FW and MYC in 8q24).

In this disease, the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is intimately linked to disease severity, because patients with BCRs, comprised of unmutated V(H) genes, follow a much more aggressive course. This and related observations suggest that B-CLL derives from a B cell subset comprised of restricted BCR structural diversity and that antigen-selection and drive are major factors promoting the disease. Nevertheless, the initiating event(s) that lead to the development of B-CLL are still unclear, in part because of the lack of an animal model that spontaneously evolves the molecular abnormalities that occur in the human disease. Because overexpression of the TCL1 gene in murine B cells leads to a CD5(+) B cell lymphoproliferative disorder with many of the features of human B-CLL, we studied leukemias emerging in these mice to examine the extent to which their BCRs resemble those in B-CLL. Our data indicate that the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain rearrangements in TCL1 mice display minimal levels of somatic mutations and exhibit several molecular features found in the human disease. Like human B-CLL, TCL1 leukemic rearrangements from different mice can be very similar structurally and closely resemble autoantibodies and antibodies reactive with microbial antigens. Antigen-binding analyses confirm that selected TCL1 clones react with glycerophospholipid, lipoprotein, and polysaccharides that can be autoantigens and be expressed by microbes.

Topical application of caffeine-SB or caffeine (each has UVB absorption properties) 0.5 h before irradiation with a high dose of UVB decreased UVB-induced thymine dimer formation and sunburn lesions (sunscreen effect). Caffeine-SB was more active than an equimolar amount of caffeine in exerting a sunscreen effect. In additional studies, caffeine-SB strongly inhibited the formation of tumors in UVB-pretreated 'high-risk mice' and in tumor-bearing mice, and the growth of UVB-induced tumors was also inhibited.

These cells are a convenient model for such study since the number of myeloblasts in diagnostic bone marrow smears of investigated patients is larger than in not-leukemic persons because of the increased granulopoiesis. The nucleolar diameter was measured in myeloblasts after various cytochemical procedures such as methods for visualisation of RNA, DNA and proteins of AgNORs using digitized images and image processing. The results clearly demonstrated that values of the nucleolar diameter depended on the procedures used for visualising nucleoli. It seems to be also clear that a close relationship exists between the diameter of nucleoli and their number since the larger the number of nucleoli per cell the smaller their mean size. However, one of multiple nucleoli present in the nucleus is usually significantly larger. Moreover, the possibility exists that the variability of nucleolar diameter of leukemic myeloblasts and thus the heterogeneity of these cells might depend on various stages of the cell cycle as supported by nucleolar measurements on aging leukemic myeloblasts (K 562 cells) in vitro. Since the staining density of small and large nucleoli did not differ substantially after staining for RNA, it seems to be likely that the nucleolar size is directly related to the total RNA content in myeloblasts.

Patients may acquire viral infections through several mechanisms including transfusion, community exposure or via the donor origin in the case of stem cell transplant. Endogenous reactivation of latent viruses is also commonly observed. Viral replication may lead directly to viral diseases or induce indirect effects such as increased incidence of opportunistic infections and decreased patient survival.

In addition to situations that are well known or that are gradually being recognized related both to the underlying disease and to treatment, such as neutropenia, neutrophil dysfunction, mucosal damage, concomitant monocytopenia and lymphopenia, abnormalities within the host cellular and humoral compartments, impairments in cytokine networks, alterations in T lymphocytes/tumor interactions, crosstalks between neoplastic cells and accessory cells, etc, over the last few years we are witnessing important changes in the overall management of patients with hematologic malignancies. Historically, the categories at risk were represented by patients with acute leukemia and patients undergoing an allogeneic stem cell transplant. In both, the likelihood of eradicating the disease requires necessarily a myeloablative therapeutic strategy, complicated in the allografted patients by the risks of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), the required immunosuppressive treatment and the recently documented role that cytokines may play in the development of acute GvHD. Considerable changes have occurred in recent years. From the identification of ""new"" diseases at risk (e.g. lymphomas occurring in HIV+ individuals), to the progressive and constant increase in allotransplant procedures, to the development of new transplant procedures (cord blood, matched-unrelated or mismatched donor transplant, mini-transplant, the administration of donor lymphocytes), to the development of new drugs that can induce immunosuppression, to the clinical use of certain monoclonal antibodies (MoAb), to the combined use of chemotherapy plus MoAb. These developments are associated with other general considerations. Within these: 1) the growing use of ablative therapies in diseases for which for many years the approach has been less aggressive or indeed conservative; 2) the progressive recognition of categories of patients with unfavorable prognosis for whom an aggressive approach is required; 3) the constant improvement in mean life expectancy and ""biologic"" age of patients; thus, the progressive changes in the definition of ""old age"".
