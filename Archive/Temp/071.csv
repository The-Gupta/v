All-trans-retinoic acid, the natural ligand for RARs, is used therapeutically for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), whereas the synthetic rexinoid bexarotene (a representative member of the aromatic retinoids or arotinoids) is approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Other retinoids have found applications in the topical treatment of skin disorders. In continuation of previous work on the naphthalene-based arotinoid scaffold, we synthesized a new series of (3-halo)benzoic acids connected to C5- or C8-substituted naphthyl rings via (E)-ethenyl and amide and, for the C5 series, (E)-chalcone linkers. These compounds were evaluated as RAR modulators in comparison with previously described dihydronaphthalene arotinoids with the same substitution pattern. Transactivation studies in this series revealed an absence of synergy between small halogen atoms (F, Cl) at C3 and the groups at C5 or C8, as had been observed on some of the dihydronaphthalene analogues. Instead, non-halogenated 4-(2-naphthamido)benzoic acid derivatives transactivated toward the RARbeta subtype in preference to the paralogues. The derivatives with bulkier substituents at C8 were characterized as dual RARbeta/RARalpha antagonists, and (E)-4-[(8-(phenylethynyl)naphthalene-2-yl)ethenyl]benzoic acid (11 c), with an ethenyl connector, was shown to be a potent antagonist of RARalpha.","['(c) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Reasons for these disparities are multifactorial including differences in genetics, stage at presentation, access to care, and socioeconomic factors. Less is documented on racial/ethnic differences in subsequent risk of second primary cancers (SPC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk of SPC among different racial/ethnic groups of women with BC. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 134,868 Non-Hispanic White, 17,484 Black, 18,034 Hispanic, and 19,802 Asian/Pacific Islander (API) women with stages I-III BC in twelve Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program registries between 2001 and 2010. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR), 95 % confidence intervals (CI), and absolute excess risks were calculated by comparing incidence of SPC in the cohort to incidence in the general population for specific cancer sites by race/ethnicity and stratified by index BC characteristics. All women were at increased risks of second primary BC and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with higher risk among more advanced stage index BC. Black and API women had higher SIRs for AML [4.86 (95 % CI 3.05-7.36) and 5.00 (95 % CI 3.26-7.32)], respectively] which remained elevated among early-stage (I) BC cases. Women with a history of invasive BC have increased risk of SPC, most notable for second primary BC and AML. These risks for secondary cancers differ by race/ethnicity. Studies evaluating possible genetic and biobehavioral mechanisms underlying these differences are warranted. Strategies for BC adjuvant treatment and survivorship care may require further individualization with consideration given to race/ethnicity.",,"['Calip, Gregory S', 'Law, Ernest H', 'Ko, Naomi Y']","['Calip GS', 'Law EH', 'Ko NY']","['Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomic Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, 833 South Wood Street M/C 871, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA, gcalip@uic.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150527,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', '*Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'SEER Program', '*Survivors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/05/28 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/05/28 06:00'],"['2015/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10549-015-3439-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2015 Jun;151(3):687-96. doi: 10.1007/s10549-015-3439-7.

In view of the crucial role of TNF and intestinal cell death in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the ability of TWEAK to enhance TNF-induced cell death, we tested here the therapeutic potential of Fn14 blockade on allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT)-induced intestinal GVHD. An Fn14-specific blocking human immunoglobulin G1 antibody variant with compromised antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity strongly inhibited the severity of murine allo-HCT-induced GVHD. Treatment of the allo-HCT recipients with this monoclonal antibody reduced cell death of gastrointestinal cells but neither affected organ infiltration by donor T cells nor cytokine production. Fn14 blockade also inhibited intestinal cell death in mice challenged with TNF. This suggests that the protective effect of Fn14 blockade in allo-HCT is based on the protection of intestinal cells from TNF-induced apoptosis and not due to immune suppression. Importantly, Fn14 blockade showed no negative effect on graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) activity. Thus, ADCC-defective Fn14-blocking antibodies are not only possible novel GVL effect-sparing therapeutics for the treatment of GVHD but might also be useful for the treatment of other inflammatory bowel diseases where TNF-induced cell death is of relevance.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Chopra, Martin', 'Brandl, Andreas', 'Siegmund, Daniela', 'Mottok, Anja', 'Schafer, Viktoria', 'Biehl, Marlene', 'Kraus, Sabrina', 'Bauerlein, Carina A', 'Ritz, Miriam', 'Mattenheimer, Katharina', 'Schwinn, Stefanie', 'Seher, Axel', 'Grabinger, Thomas', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Brunner, Thomas', 'Beilhack, Andreas', 'Wajant, Harald']","['Chopra M', 'Brandl A', 'Siegmund D', 'Mottok A', 'Schafer V', 'Biehl M', 'Kraus S', 'Bauerlein CA', 'Ritz M', 'Mattenheimer K', 'Schwinn S', 'Seher A', 'Grabinger T', 'Einsele H', 'Rosenwald A', 'Brunner T', 'Beilhack A', 'Wajant H']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany;

Our results suggest that in the whole group of patients, low levels of both WT1 and BAALC were associated with a favorable outcome (3-year LFS 74.5%, median not reached), whereas patients presenting high expression levels of both genes had the worst prognosis (3-year LFS 0%, median 12 months, p<0.001). More specifically, molecular profiling was especially useful for intermediate 1 and intermediate-2/high risk groups. This study suggests that evaluating WT1 and BAALC gene expression at diagnosis may improve standard risk stratification and possibly refine the therapeutic approach for MDS patients.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The function of RUNDC3B has yet to be determined, although its dysregulated expression has been associated with malignant potential of both breast and lung carcinoma. To elucidate the potential of using DNA methylation in RUNDC3B as a biomarker in lymphoid malignancies, the methylation status of six regions spanning the CpG island in the promoter region of RUNDC3B was determined in cancer cell lines. Lymphoid malignancies were found to have more prominent methylation and did not express RUNDC3B compared with myeloid malignancies and solid tumours, supporting the potential use of DNA methylation in this region as a biomarker for lymphoid malignancies. RUNDC3B contains a RUN domain in its N-terminal region that mediates interaction with Rap2, an important component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation. The protein sequence of RUNDC3B also contains characteristic binding sites for MAPK intermediates. Therefore, it is possible that RUNDC3B serves as a mediator between Rap2 and the MAPK signalling cascade. Three genes with MAPK-inducible expression were downregulated in a methylated leukaemia cell line (HSPA5, Jun and Fos). Jun and Fos combine to form the activating protein 1 transcription factor, and loss of this factor is associated with the dysregulation of genes involved in differentiation and proliferation. We hypothesize that the loss of RUNDC3B secondary to aberrant hypermethylation of the early growth response 3 transcription factor binding site results in dysregulated MAPK signalling and carcinogenesis in lymphoid malignancies.

CEMP1 promotes cell attachment, differentiation, deposition rate, composition, and morphology of hydroxyapatite crystals formed by human cementoblastic cells. Its expression is restricted to cementoblasts and progenitor cell subpopulations present in the periodontal ligament. CEMP1 transfection into non-osteogenic cells such as adult human gingival fibroblasts results in differentiation of these cells into a ""mineralizing"" cell phenotype. Other studies have shown evidence that CEMP1 could have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of bone defects and regeneration of other mineralized tissues. To better understand CEMP1's biological effects in vitro we investigated the consequences of its expression in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) growing in non-mineralizing media by comparing gene expression profiles. We identified several mRNAs whose expression is modified by CEMP1 induction in HGF cells. Enrichment analysis showed that several of these newly expressed genes are involved in oncogenesis. Our results suggest that CEMP1 causes the transformation of HGF and NIH3T3 cells. CEMP1 is overexpressed in cancer cell lines. We also determined that the region spanning the CEMP1 locus is commonly amplified in a variety of cancers, and finally we found significant overexpression of CEMP1 in leukemia, cervix, breast, prostate and lung cancer.

AYA patients with cancer typically present with diseases that span the spectrum from 'paediatric' cancers (such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [ALL] and brain tumours) to 'adult' tumours (such as breast cancer and melanoma), as well as cancers that are largely unique to their age group (such as testicular cancer and bone tumours). Research indicates that outcomes of AYA patients with cancer are influenced not only by the treatment provided, but also by factors related to 'host' biology. In addition to the potential biological and cancer-specific differences between AYAs and other patients with cancer, AYA patients also often have disparate access to clinical trials and suffer from a lack of age-appropriate psychosocial support services and health services, which might influence survival as well as overall quality of life.

Various drugs and fluids are used during the leukapheresis. Aging itself and associated factors such as increased comorbidity, decreased tolerance to drugs, increased drug toxicity give rise to the application of other treatment modalities in elderly patients. Treatment of acute leukemia in the elderly differs from young patients. Consequently, we assumed that outcome, effectiveness, and side effects of leukapheresis treatment used for acute leukemia patients with hyperleukocytosis may be different in elderly compared to younger patients. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated a total of 39 patients. Eighteen patients were 65 years and older. Indications for leukapheresis were determined as symptoms of leukostasis and prophylaxis. Acid citrate dextrose-A, calcium gluconate, and plasma were used during the leukapheresis. Age, sex, diagnosis, count, and indications of leukapheresis procedures, leukocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase level were analyzed at the onset of and after leukapheresis; side effects, causes of death, early and total mortality rates were also analyzed. We compared the two groups with regard to effectiveness, clinical outcomes, and side effects. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to sex, diagnosis, initial leukocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase level, number of leukapheresis procedures, rates of side effects, or early and total mortality (P > 0.05). Leukapheresis treatment was effective in both groups (P < 0.05) and no significant difference was found in its effectiveness between two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Leukapheresis is an effective and safe treatment modality in elderly acute leukemia patients with hyperleukocytosis.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Berber, Ilhami', 'Erkurt, Mehmet Ali', 'Kuku, Irfan', 'Kaya, Emin', 'Gozukara Bag, Harika', 'Nizam, Ilknur', 'Koroglu, Mustafa', 'Yigit, Ali', 'Ozgul, Mustafa']","['Berber I', 'Erkurt MA', 'Kuku I', 'Kaya E', 'Gozukara Bag H', 'Nizam I', 'Koroglu M', 'Yigit A', 'Ozgul M']","['Hematology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Inonu University School of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Hematology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Inonu University School of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Hematology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Inonu University School of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Hematology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Inonu University School of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Inonu University School of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Hematology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Inonu University School of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Hematology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Inonu University School of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Inonu University School of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.', 'Hematology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Inonu University School of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150523,United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/blood/*therapy', 'Leukostasis/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'elderly patients', 'hyperleukocytosis', 'leukapheresis']",2015/05/27 06:00,2016/10/13 06:00,['2015/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jca.21402 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2016 Feb;31(1):53-8. doi: 10.1002/jca.21402.

A 14-year-old male neutered Staffordshire Bull Terrier presented with a 6-week history of progressive inappetence and lethargy (Case 2). CLINICAL FINDINGS: On presentation, Case 1 was dehydrated and had repeatable cranial abdominal pain. Mild hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia, and electrolyte disturbances were found on biochemistry profile. Abdominal ultrasonography showed moderate diffuse small intestinal wall irregularity and moderate local lymphadenopathy. Haematology was repeated 2 days after initial presentation and showed a marked leucocytosis associated with an elevated circulating neoplastic cell population. On presentation, Case 2 was dehydrated, had palpable hepatomegaly and a mild generalised lymphadenopathy. A low number of large, atypical lymphocytes were found on haematology. Sonographically there was hepatomegaly with diffuse parenchymal changes and severe mesenteric lymphadenopathy. LABORATORY FINDINGS: Aspirates from the abdominal lymph nodes (Cases 1 and 2) and liver (Case 2), and blood smears revealed atypical neoplastic lymphoid populations, predominantly comprising large lymphocytes. Immunocytochemistry failed to determine the lymphoid phenotype in Case 1 but supported a T cell phenotype in Case 2. Immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FF-PE) blood clots was able to identify a T cell phenotype in both cases. PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement results from both cases were consistent with an expanded T cell population. DIAGNOSIS: In both cases, immunohistochemistry on FF-PE blood clots revealed a circulating T cell lymphocyte population, consistent with T cell lymphoproliferative neoplasia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Immunohistochemistry on FF-PE blood clots offers clinicians a reliable, inexpensive and minimally invasive method of phenotyping neoplastic cells in circulation. Compared to other available methods, prolonged sample stability allowing for transport and retrospective examination is a distinct advantage. This technique should be considered a useful adjunct to the currently available methods for the phenotypic evaluation of lymphoid leukaemia in dogs.",,"['Finlay, J R', 'Wyatt, K M']","['Finlay JR', 'Wyatt KM']","['a Perth Veterinary Oncology , 305 Selby St, Osborne Park , Western Australia 6017 , Australia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20150706,England,N Z Vet J,New Zealand veterinary journal,0021406,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dog Diseases/blood/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods/*veterinary', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/blood/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male']",['NOTNLM'],"['Immunohistochemistry', 'blood', 'dogs', 'lymphocytes', 'neoplastic']",2015/05/27 06:00,2015/11/07 06:00,['2015/05/27 06:00'],"['2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/00480169.2015.1052765 [doi]'],ppublish,N Z Vet J. 2015 Nov;63(6):335-9. doi: 10.1080/00480169.2015.1052765.

Development of effective treatments has been impeded by limited insight into pathogenic pathways. In this study, we applied RNA-seq technology to study the transcriptome on 20 MDS patients and 5 age-matched controls, and developed a pipeline for analyzing this data. After analysis, we identified 38 mutated genes contributing to MDS pathogenesis. 37 out of 38 genes have not been reported previously, suggesting our pipeline is critical for identifying novel mutated genes in MDS. The most recurrent mutation happened in gene IFRD1, which involved 30% of patient samples. Biological relationships among these mutated genes were mined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and the results demonstrated that top two networks with highest scores were highly associated with cancer and hematological diseases, indicating that the mutated genes identified by our method were highly relevant to MDS. We then integrated the pathways in KEGG database and the identified mutated genes using our novel rule-based mutated driver pathway scoring approach for detecting mutated driver pathways. The results indicated two mutated driver pathways are important for the pathogenesis of MDS: pathway in cancer and in regulation of actin cytoskeleton. The latter, which likely contributes to the hallmark morphologic dysplasia observed in MDS, has not been reported, to the best of our knowledge. These results provide us new insights into the pathogenesis of MDS, which, in turn, may lead to novel therapeutics for this disease.",,"['Liu, Liang', 'Wang, Hongyan', 'Wen, Jianguo', 'Tseng, Chih-En', 'Zu, Youli', 'Chang, Chung-che', 'Zhou, Xiaobo']","['Liu L', 'Wang H', 'Wen J', 'Tseng CE', 'Zu Y', 'Chang CC', 'Zhou X']","['Center for Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Division of Radiologic Sciences, Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA. lliu@wakehealth.edu wanghongyan.pku@gmail.com xizhou@wakehealth.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Mol Biosyst,Molecular bioSystems,101251620,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Computational Biology', 'Female', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA/genetics', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",,,2015/05/27 06:00,2016/04/12 06:00,['2015/05/27 06:00'],"['2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4mb00663a [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biosyst. 2015 Aug;11(8):2158-66. doi: 10.1039/c4mb00663a.,['5R01LM010185-04/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The low-level exposure of these workers requires pooling of large cohorts studied over many years to obtain risk estimates with appropriate latency and good precision. We assembled a pooled cohort of 119,195 U.S. nuclear workers at four Department of Energy nuclear weapons facilities (Hanford site, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Savannah River site) and at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The cohort was followed at the start of the workers beginning their radiation work (at earliest, between 1944 and 1952) through 2005, and we compared its mortality to that of the U.S. POPULATION: We also conducted regression-modeling analysis to evaluate dose-response associations for external radiation exposure and outcomes: all cancers, smoking- and nonsmoking-related cancers, all lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers, leukemia (excluding chronic lymphocytic), multiple myeloma, cardiovascular disease and others. The mean dose observed among the cohort was 20 mSv. For most outcomes, mortality was below expectation compared to the general population, but mesothelioma and pleura cancers were highly elevated. We found an excess relative risk (ERR) per 10 mSv of 0.14% [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.17%, 0.48%] for all cancers excluding leukemia. Estimates were higher for nonsmoking-related cancers (0.70%, 95% CI: 0.058%, 1.5%) and lower for smoking-related cancers (-0.079%, 95% CI: -0.43%, 0.32%). The ERR per 10 mSv was 1.7% (95% CI: -0.22%, 4.7%) for leukemia, which was similar to the estimate of 1.8% (95% CI: 0.027%, 4.4%) for all lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers. The ERR per 10 mSv for multiple myeloma was 3.9% (95% CI: 0.60%, 9.5%). The ERR per 10 mSv for cardiovascular disease was 0.026% (-0.25%, 0.32%). Little evidence of heterogeneity was seen by facility, birth cohort or sex for most outcomes. The estimates observed here are similar to those found in previous large pooled nuclear worker studies and also (with the exception of multiple myeloma) to those conducted in the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The tendency of observed risks to persist many years after exposure for most outcomes illustrates the importance of continued follow-up of nuclear worker cohorts.",,"['Schubauer-Berigan, Mary K', 'Daniels, Robert D', 'Bertke, Stephen J', 'Tseng, Chih-Yu', 'Richardson, David B']","['Schubauer-Berigan MK', 'Daniels RD', 'Bertke SJ', 'Tseng CY', 'Richardson DB']","['a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, Cincinnati, Ohio; and.', 'a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, Cincinnati, Ohio; and.', 'a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, Cincinnati, Ohio; and.', 'a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, Cincinnati, Ohio; and.', 'b University of North Carolina School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150526,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/*mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Nuclear Weapons', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,2015/05/27 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2015/05/27 06:00'],"['2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1667/RR13988.1 [pii]', '10.1667/RR13988.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2015 Jun;183(6):620-31. doi: 10.1667/RR13988.1.

We studied the immunophenotype, the status of the MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 genes and the clinical features of a series of 42 CNS-DLBCL and evaluated their prognostic significance. We found high MYC protein expression in 43% of cases, and this was associated with lower overall survival (OS). Cases with concurrent expression of MYC and BCL2 showed a lower OS, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Translocations involving the MYC or BCL2 genes were not detected. The BCL6 gene was frequently translocated, but was unrelated to survival.

Although myocardial signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 is potently cardioprotective during IRI, the inhibitory mechanism responsible for its activation is largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of the myocardial suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3, an intrinsic negative feedback regulator of the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling pathway, in the development of myocardial IRI. Myocardial IRI was induced in mice by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 1 h, followed by different reperfusion times. One hour after reperfusion, the rapid expression of JAK-STAT-activating cytokines was observed. We precisely evaluated the phosphorylation of cardioprotective signaling molecules and the expression of SOCS3 during IRI and then induced myocardial IRI in wild-type and cardiac-specific SOCS3 knockout mice (SOCS3-CKO). The activation of STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2 rapidly peaked and promptly decreased during IRI. This decrease correlated with the induction of SOCS3 expression up to 24 h after IRI in wild-type mice. The infarct size 24 h after reperfusion was significantly reduced in SOCS3-CKO compared with wild-type mice. In SOCS3-CKO mice, STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was sustained, myocardial apoptosis was prevented, and the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) was augmented. Cardiac-specific SOCS3 deletion led to the sustained activation of cardioprotective signaling molecules including and prevented myocardial apoptosis and injury during IRI. Our findings suggest that SOCS3 may represent a key factor that exacerbates the development of myocardial IRI.",,"['Nagata, Takanobu', 'Yasukawa, Hideo', 'Kyogoku, Sachiko', 'Oba, Toyoharu', 'Takahashi, Jinya', 'Nohara, Shoichiro', 'Minami, Tomoko', 'Mawatari, Kazutoshi', 'Sugi, Yusuke', 'Shimozono, Koutatsu', 'Pradervand, Sylvain', 'Hoshijima, Masahiko', 'Aoki, Hiroki', 'Fukumoto, Yoshihiro', 'Imaizumi, Tsutomu']","['Nagata T', 'Yasukawa H', 'Kyogoku S', 'Oba T', 'Takahashi J', 'Nohara S', 'Minami T', 'Mawatari K', 'Sugi Y', 'Shimozono K', 'Pradervand S', 'Hoshijima M', 'Aoki H', 'Fukumoto Y', 'Imaizumi T']","['Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan; Cardiovascular Research Institute, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Lausanne Genomic Technologies Facility (LGTF), University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Cardiovascular Research Institute, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan; Cardiovascular Research Institute, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Fukuoka Sanno Hospital and International University of Health and Welfare, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150526,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Deletion', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Myocardial Reperfusion Injury/genetics/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Myocardium/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2015/05/27 06:00,2016/04/22 06:00,['2015/05/27 06:00'],"['2015/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0127942 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-02343 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 26;10(5):e0127942. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0127942. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4444323,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, SCT remains the only curative option in this high-risk population. Because myeloablative conditioning regimen (MAC) is associated with less relapse, we hypothesized that more intensive conditioning regimen might be beneficial for MK AML patients. We reviewed 303 patients over age 45 diagnosed with either de novo or secondary MK AML. One hundred and five patients received a MAC and 198 a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). The median age at SCT was 57-year-old, significantly lower in the MAC (53-year-old) than in the RIC group (59-year-old). The median follow-up was 42 months (range, 3 - 156 months). The 3-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and relapse rate (RR) were not significantly different between both groups with overall values of 34%, 29%, and 51%, respectively. On the contrary, the 3-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was significantly higher in MAC recipients (28%) compared with RIC patients (16%, P = 0.004). The incidence of Grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was significantly higher after a MAC (30.5%) than after a RIC (19.3%, P = 0.02).

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 224 patients according to the central nervous system (CNS) involvement at diagnosis: CNS1, CNS2, or CNS3. Patients with CNS2/TLP+ received two additional ITM doses during induction. Patients were treated according to the Children's Cancer Group (CCG)-1991/1961 protocols between January 2001 and December 2007. RESULTS: The 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates for the ALL patients in the CNS1, CNS2, and CNS3 groups were 80.4 +/- 3.0, 100, and 73.5 +/- 11.3%, respectively; a non-significant difference was observed between the groups (P = 0.063). However, the patients with CNS2 had significantly better survival compared with the CNS3 patients (P = 0.03). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rates for the three groups were 17 (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.9-22.9), 0, and 18.8% (95% CI: 4.3-41.1), respectively; (P = 0.214) and those of isolated or combined CNS relapse were 9.6 (95% CI: 5.8-14.5), 0 and 6.3% (95% CI: 0.3-25.8), respectively (P = 0.424). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the intensification of ITM therapy during induction improves outcomes in patients with CNS2/TLP+ status and eliminates its prognostic significance. This suggests that early intensification using CNS-directed therapy is beneficial in controlling minimal CNS disease.",,"['Jastaniah, Wasil', 'Elimam, Naglla', 'Abdalla, Khalid', 'Khattab, Taha M', 'Felimban, Sami', 'Abrar, Mohammed B']","['Jastaniah W', 'Elimam N', 'Abdalla K', 'Khattab TM', 'Felimban S', 'Abrar MB']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150526,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/*secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'CNS', 'CNS2', 'Outcome', 'Traumatic lumbar puncture']",2015/05/27 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2015/05/27 06:00'],"['2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000020 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Dec;20(10):561-6. doi: 10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000020.

RUNX1 expression is essential for the initiation of definitive haematopoiesis, for steady-state thrombopoiesis, and for normal lymphocytes development. Recent studies revealed that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which accounts for the majority of the type I PRMT activity in cells, methylates two arginine residues in RUNX1 (R206 and R210), and these modifications inhibit corepressor-binding to RUNX1 thereby enhancing its transcriptional activity. In order to elucidate the biological significance of these methylations, we established novel knock-in mouse lines with non-methylable, double arginine-to-lysine (RTAMR-to-KTAMK) mutations in RUNX1. Homozygous Runx1(KTAMK) (/) (KTAMK) mice are born alive and appear normal during adulthood. However, Runx1(KTAMK) (/) (KTAMK) mice showed a reduction in CD3(+) T lymphoid cells and a decrease in CD4(+) T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs, in comparison to their wild-type littermates, leading to a reduction in the CD4(+) to CD8(+) T-cell ratio. These findings suggest that arginine-methylation of RUNX1 in the RTAMR-motif is dispensable for the development of definitive haematopoiesis and for steady-state platelet production, however this modification affects the role of RUNX1 in the maintenance of the peripheral CD4(+) T-cell population.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Mizutani, Shinsuke', 'Yoshida, Tatsushi', 'Zhao, Xinyang', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Okuda, Tsukasa']","['Mizutani S', 'Yoshida T', 'Zhao X', 'Nimer SD', 'Taniwaki M', 'Okuda T']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Haematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Haematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150526,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",['NOTNLM'],"['RUNX1', 'leukaemia', 'lymphocyte differentiation', 'methylation', 'transgenic mice models']",2015/05/27 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13499 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Sep;170(6):859-73. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13499.

To calculate the activity to administer, time-integrated activity coefficients are required. These are estimated prior to therapy using gamma camera and serum measurements after injection of 111In labeled anti-CD66 antibody. Equal pre-therapeutic and therapeutic biodistributions are usually assumed to calculate the coefficients. However, additional measurements during therapy had shown that this assumption had to be abandoned. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to allow the prediction of therapeutic time-integrated activity coefficients in eight patients. AIMS: The aims of the study were to demonstrate using a larger patient group 1) the need to perform patient-specific dosimetry in 90Y-labeled anti-CD66 RIT, 2) that pre-therapeutic and therapeutic biodistributions differ, and most importantly 3) that this difference in biodistributions can be accurately predicted using a refined model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two new PBPK models were developed considering fully, half and non-immunoreactive antibodies and constraints for estimating the RM antigen number. Both models were fitted to gamma camera and serum measurements of 27 patients. Akaike weights were used for model averaging. Time-integrated activity coefficients for total body, liver, spleen, RM and serum were calculated. Model-based predictions of the serum biokinetics during therapy were compared to actual measurements. RESULTS: Variability of the RM time-integrated activity coefficients ((37.3 +/- 7.5) h) indicates the need for patient-specific dosimetry. The relative differences between pre-therapeutic and therapeutic serum time-activity curves were (-25 +/- 16)%. The prediction accuracy of these differences using the refined PBPK models was (-3 +/- 20)%. CONCLUSION: Individual treatment is needed due to biological differences between patients in RIT with 90Y-labeled anti-CD66 antibody. Differences in pre-therapeutic and therapeutic biokinetics are predominantly caused by different degrees of saturation due to different amounts of administered antibody. These differences could be predicted using the PBPK models.",,"['Kletting, Peter', 'Maass, Christian', 'Reske, Sven', 'Beer, Ambros J', 'Glatting, Gerhard']","['Kletting P', 'Maass C', 'Reske S', 'Beer AJ', 'Glatting G']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ulm University, 89070, Ulm, Germany.', 'Medical Radiation Physics/Radiation Protection, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ulm University, 89070, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ulm University, 89070, Ulm, Germany.', 'Medical Radiation Physics/Radiation Protection, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150526,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD66 antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Isotope Labeling', 'Leukemia/*radiotherapy', '*Models, Biological', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",,,2015/05/27 06:00,2016/04/19 06:00,['2015/05/27 06:00'],"['2014/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0127934 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-53448 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 26;10(5):e0127934. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0127934. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4444288,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic stem cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are enriched in Lineage-/CD38-/CD34+ compartment of CD34-positive AML. Many markers important for stem cell biology have been reported for their association with leukemic stem cell population, but what remains clinically most important is a rapid identification of prognostic information. In this study, we evaluated four signal transduction pathways and thirteen markers on Lin-/CD38-/CD34+ population in AML. Expressions were compared in different AML subtypes, survival, and treatment outcome groups. We observed that markers important in homing, cell quiescence, and signal propagation such as CD44, CD96, CD90, WT-1, CD123 and CD25 were most significantly differentially expressed on Lin-/CD38-/CD34+ population in AML from their normal counterparts (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney). Constitutive activation of phospho ERK, AKT, and STAT5 in these cells was associated with poor outcome. Also, an increased frequency of putative leukemic stem cell population shows negative impact on treatment outcome and overall survival, suggesting that initial evaluation of AML samples for pLSC frequency and constitutively activated signaling pathway can provide prognostic and therapeutic information at the time of diagnosis.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We examined the outcomes of patients with high-risk AML who received allogeneic HPC transplant in CR1. Forty five consecutive high-risk AML patients in CR1 were included. All 45 patients had adverse cytogenetics, FLT 3 mutations, or secondary AML. Group A patients (n = 33) received one or two cycles, and Group B (n = 12) three or more cycles of induction chemotherapy. The patients were comparable in age, sex, white cell count at presentation, and time from diagnosis and from last chemotherapy to transplant. The 100-day mortality rate was higher in Group B patients (50% vs. 9%, P = 0.006). They had a higher non-relapse mortality (33% vs. 6%, P = 0.035) and a longer length of hospital stay from the day of stem cell infusion (median 21 vs. 20, P = 0.02; third quartile 22 vs. 28, P = 0.02). There was also a trend toward inferior event-free survival and overall survival. High-risk AML patients undergoing allogeneic transplant in CR1 after three or more cycles of induction chemotherapy have an inferior outcome and higher mortality when compared to those who only needed one or two cycles of induction chemotherapy. Novel strategies are needed to reduce the transplant-related mortality in high-risk AML patients needing more than two cycles of induction chemotherapy prior to allogeneic transplant in CR1.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Lim, Sara J', 'Lim, Matthew J', 'Raptis, Anastasios', 'Hou, Jing-Zhou', 'Farah, Rafic', 'Marks, Stanley M', 'Im, Annie', 'Dorritie, Kathleen', 'Sehgal, Alison', 'Agha, Mounzer', 'Felgar, Raymond', 'Lim, Seah H']","['Lim SJ', 'Lim MJ', 'Raptis A', 'Hou JZ', 'Farah R', 'Marks SM', 'Im A', 'Dorritie K', 'Sehgal A', 'Agha M', 'Felgar R', 'Lim SH']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2015/05/27 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2015/05/27 06:00'],"['2015/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24062 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Aug;90(8):715-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24062.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complications after HSCT include relapse, graft-versus-host disease, graft rejection and infection. High-resolution HLA matching has improved survival in HSCT over recent years; however, GVHD still remains a serious complication. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) within genes that are involved with an individual's capability to mount an immune response to infectious pathogens, residual leukaemia, alloantigens or genes involved in drug metabolism have been studied for their association with HSCT outcome. Indeed, over the last 15 years, several groups, including ourselves, have demonstrated that non-HLA gene polymorphisms can be predictive of HSCT outcome. Can genetic characteristics of the patient and donor be used in the future to tailor HSCT protocols and determine GVHD prophylaxis? This review summarizes some of the recent SNP association studies in HSCT and highlights some of the disparities therein, discussing the integral problems of performing genetic association studies on diseases with complex outcomes using heterogeneous cohorts. The review will comment on recent genomewide association studies (GWAS) and discuss their relevance in this field, and it will also comment on recent meta-analysis combining GWAS studies with other studies such as gene expression micro array data in the field of autoimmune disease and solid organ transplantation. It will mention possible novel candidate gene polymorphisms, for example SNPS in microRNAs. In addition, it will discuss some of the inherent problems associated with gene association studies including the GRIPs (genetic risk prediction studies) recommendations. In summary, this review will assess the usefulness of non-HLA genomic studies in HSCT with regard to predicting outcome and modifying therapy.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Dickinson, A M', 'Norden, J']","['Dickinson AM', 'Norden J']","['Haematological Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Haematological Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150523,England,Int J Immunogenet,International journal of immunogenetics,101232337,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genomics', 'Graft Rejection/genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics']",,,2015/05/27 06:00,2016/04/30 06:00,['2015/05/27 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/iji.12202 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Immunogenet. 2015 Aug;42(4):229-38. doi: 10.1111/iji.12202.

Despite intensive investigation, oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) represent a clinical challenge resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Resistance to cell death is common in OSCC and is often mediated by the Bcl-2 family proteins. Among all anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Mcl-1 functions as a major survival factor, particularly in solid cancers. Despite the confirmed importance of Mcl-1 in several neoplasms, the role of Mcl-1 in OSCC survival has yet to be explored. In this study, we found that knocking down Mcl-1 sensitized OSCC cells to ABT-737, which binds to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1. We report for the first time that a BH3 mimetic, Sabutoclax, which functions as an inhibitor of all anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, induced cancer-specific cell death in an Mcl-1-dependent manner through both apoptosis and toxic mitophagy.

Despite the fact that AzaC is not substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the adaptation procedure resulted in an induction in P-gp expression/efflux activity that confers crossresistance to P-gp substrates in both resistant cell variants. While the resistance to P-gp substrates in SKM-1/AzaC and MOLM-13/AzaC cells could be reversed by the P-gp inhibitors, resistance to AzaC was insensitive to these inhibitors in both resistant cell variants. In addition, NF-kappaB and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 were downregulated and the proapoptotic proteins Bax and p53 were upregulated in both resistant cell variants when compared with their sensitive counterparts. Moreover, at least five times the elevation in overall glutathione S-transferase activity was measured with 1-chloro-2, 5-dinitrobenzene as a substrate in the resistant variant of both cell lines.

Recently, we showed that a peptide derived from Cyclic-AMP Responsive Element Binding Protein (CREB) was highly phosphorylated in pediatric leukemias. In this study, we determined CREB phosphorylation and mRNA levels showing that CREB expression was significantly higher in ALL compared to normal bone marrow (phosphorylation: P < 0.0001, mRNA: P = 0.004). High CREB and phospho-CREB expression was correlated with a lower median overall survival in a cohort of 140 adult ALL patients. ShRNA mediated knockdown of CREB in ALL cell lines blocked leukemic cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Gene expression array analysis showed downregulation of CREB target genes regulating cell proliferation and glucose metabolism and upregulation of apoptosis inducing genes. Similar to CREB knockdown, the CREB inhibitor KG-501 decreased leukemic cell viability and induced apoptosis in ALL cell lines, as well as primary T-ALL samples, with cases showing high phospho-CREB levels being more sensitive than those with lower phospho-CREB levels.

We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all CL, CL at age <5 years and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) for three measures of population mixing (population growth, in-migration and diversity of origin), stratified by degree of urbanisation. Measures of population mixing were calculated for all municipalities for the 5-year period preceding the 1990 and 2000 censuses. Analyses were based on 2,128,012 children of whom 536 developed CL.

Approval of decitabine (DAC) in the European Union (EU) in 2012 for the treatment of patients with AML >/=65 years marks the potential for hypomethylating agents in elderly AML. Nevertheless the situation is dissatisfactory and the quest for novel treatment approaches, including combination epigenetic therapy is actively ongoing. The given randomized trial should be helpful in investigating the question whether combinations of DAC with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) and/or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which in vitro show a very promising synergism, are superior to the DAC monotherapy. The accompanying translational research project will contribute to find surrogate molecular end points for drug efficacy and better tailor epigenetic therapy. An additional aim of the study is to investigate the prognostic value of geriatric assessments for elderly AML patients treated non-intensively. METHODS/DESIGN: DECIDER is a prospective, randomized, observer blind, parallel group, multicenter, Phase II study with a 2x2 factorial design. The primary endpoint is objective best overall response (complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR)). The target population is AML patients aged 60 years or older and unfit for standard induction chemotherapy. Patients are randomized to one of the four treatment groups: DAC alone or in combination with VPA or ATRA or with both add-on drugs. One interim safety analysis was planned and carried out with the objective to stop early one or more of the treatment arms in case of an unacceptable death rate. This analysis showed that in all treatment arms the critical stopping rule was not reached. No important safety issues were observed. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended continuing the study as planned. The first patient was included in December 2011. A total of 189 out of 200 planned patients were randomized since then (status 31.12.2014).

Multiple epidemiologic studies show that diabetic patients have an increased risk of developing cancer of different types. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are among the most common hematologic malignancies and include a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic neoplasms characterized by dysplastic changes, low blood counts, and an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Potential epigenetic and metabolic interferences between DM and MDS have been reported but are poorly understood. DM and MDS share some predisposing risk factors such as obesity. Patients with MDS and DM can experience worsening of diabetic control due to multiple factors that exacerbate hyperglycemia and insulin resistance such as stress, infections, adjunct drugs (e.g. steroids to control nausea), and others. In addition, accurate assessment of glucose control in diabetic patients who have MDS can be complicated. Alternatively, DM when associated with end-organ damage can complicate management of MDS, increase risks of complications, and limit the applicability of intensive therapeutic interventions. Here we review the current knowledge of the interactions between DM and MDS at the pathogenetic, clinical and epidemiologic levels, discuss how this knowledge could be used therapeutically to improve the outcome of patients affected by both conditions, and delineate important unmet needs that should be addressed in future research.",,"['Hamoudeh, Eyad', 'Zeidan, Amer M', 'Barbarotta, Lisa', 'Rosano, Nina']","['Hamoudeh E', 'Zeidan AM', 'Barbarotta L', 'Rosano N']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University, 333 Cedar Street, PO Box 208028, New Haven, CT 06520-8028. amer.zeidan@yale.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Diabetes Rev,Current diabetes reviews,101253260,,IM,"['Diabetes Complications/epidemiology/etiology', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Evidence-Based Medicine/trends', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/complications/epidemiology/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology/therapy']",,,2015/05/27 06:00,2017/03/04 06:00,['2015/05/27 06:00'],"['2015/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['CDR-EPUB-67653 [pii]', '10.2174/1573399811666150526151241 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Diabetes Rev. 2016;12(3):231-9. doi: 10.2174/1573399811666150526151241.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both idh2 and idh1 monoallelic mutations are harbored in grade 2/3 gliomas, secondary glioblastomas and acute myeloid leukemia. Mutant IDH1/IDH2 enzymes were reported to form an oncometabolite r-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), further strengthening malignancy. We quantified CO2-dependent reductive carboxylation glutaminolysis (RCG) and CO2-independent 2HG production in HTB-126 and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells by measuring (13)C incorporation from 1-(13)C-glutamine into citrate, malate, and 2HG. For HTB-126 cells, (13)C-citrate, (13)C-malate, and (13)C-2-hydroxyglutarate were enriched by 2-, 5-, and 15-fold at 5mM glucose (2-, 2.5-, and 13-fold at 25 mM glucose), respectively, after 6 h. Such enrichment decreased by 6% with IDH1 silencing, but by 30-50% upon IDH2 silencing while cell respiration and ATP levels rose up to 150%. Unlike 2HG production RCG declined at decreasing CO2. At hypoxia (5% O2), IDH2-related and unrelated (13)C-accumulation into citrate and malate increased 1.5-2.5-fold with unchanged IDH2 expression; whereas hypoxic 2HG formation did not. (13)C-2HG originated by approximately 50% from other than IDH2 or IDH1 reactions, substantiating remaining activity in IDH1&2-silenced cells. Relatively high basal (12)C-2HG levels existed (5-fold higher vs. non-tumor HTB-125 cells) and (13)C-2HG was formed despite the absence of any idh2 and idh1 mutations in HTB-126 cells. Since RCG is enhanced at hypoxia (frequent in solid tumors) and 2HG can be formed without idh1/2 mutations, we suggest 2HG as an analytic marker (in serum, urine, or biopsies) predicting malignancy of breast cancer in all patients.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It exhibited the most potent activity against leukemia Molt 4 cells. Accumulating evidence showed that HQ may act as a potent protein kinase inhibitor in cancer therapy. To fully understand the mechanism of HQ, we further explored the precise molecular targets in leukemia Molt 4 cells. We found that the use of HQ increased apoptosis by 26.23%-70.27% and caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by 17.15%-53.25% in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by Annexin-V/PI and JC-1 staining assays, respectively. Moreover, our findings indicated that the pretreatment of Molt 4 cells with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, diminished MMP disruption and apoptosis induced by HQ, suggesting that ROS overproduction plays a crucial rule in the cytotoxic activity of HQ. The results of a cell-free system assay indicated that HQ could act as an HDAC and topoisomerase catalytic inhibitor through the inhibition of pan-HDAC and topoisomerase IIalpha expression, respectively. On the protein level, the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins p-Akt, NFkappaB, HDAC and Bcl-2, as well as hexokinase II was inhibited by the use of HQ. On the other hand, the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, PARP cleavage, caspase activation and cytochrome c release were increased after HQ treatment. Taken together, our results suggested that the antileukemic effect of HQ is ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis combined with the inhibitory effect on HDAC and topoisomerase activities.",,"['Shih,

This study was a postapproval commitment to investigate bendamustine's effect on cardiac repolarization in treatment-naive adults with advanced indolent NHL/mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, patients received 6-8 28-day cycles of bendamustine (90 mg/m(2), days 1 and 2) and rituximab (375 mg/m(2), day 1). Exclusions included a history of cardiac conditions with potential for QT prolongation. The primary endpoint was change in Fridericia-corrected QT (QTcF; 3 electrocardiograms per time point) on day 2 of cycle 1, from just before infusion to end of infusion (immediately postinfusion, coinciding with maximum plasma concentration of bendamustine). Change 1 h postinfusion was also measured. Exploratory assessments included specific QTcF outlier analyses (new QTcF >500 ms, change >60 ms) and morphological changes. RESULTS: Of the 54 enrolled patients (mean age, 62.9 years), 53 received >/=1 dose; 49 completed >/=6 cycles. Mean QTcF change from baseline was 6.7 ms at end of infusion; no mean changes >20 ms were detected </=1 h postinfusion. No patients met specific outlier criteria at end of infusion or 1 h postinfusion. No morphological changes were detected. CONCLUSIONS: In this small treatment-naive population with advanced NHL/MCL, bendamustine did not produce a clinically relevant increase in mean QTcF on the second infusion day. The potential for delayed effects on QT interval after 1 h was not evaluated.",,"['Burke, John M', 'van der Jagt, Richard H C', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Craig, Michael D', 'Chen, Ling', 'Morganroth, Joel', 'Munteanu, Mihaela C', 'MacDonald, David A']","['Burke JM', 'van der Jagt RH', 'Flinn IW', 'Craig MD', 'Chen L', 'Morganroth J', 'Munteanu MC', 'MacDonald DA']","['Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers, 1700 S.

It includes 5788 childhood leukemia cases and 5788 matched primary controls born between 1986 and 2007. We describe the methodology for estimating magnetic fields at study residences as well as for characterizing sources of uncertainty in these estimates. Birth residences of study subjects were geocoded and their distances to transmission lines were ascertained. 302 residences were deemed sufficiently close to transmission lines to have non-zero magnetic fields attributable to the lines. These residences were visited and detailed data, describing the physical configuration and dimensions of the lines contributing to the magnetic field at the residence, were collected. Phasing, loading, and directional load flow data for years of birth and diagnosis for each subject as well as for the day of site visit were obtained from utilities when available; when yearly average load for a particular year was not available, extrapolated values based on expert knowledge and prediction models were obtained. These data were used to estimate the magnetic fields at the center, closest and farthest point of each residence. We found good correlation between calculated fields and spot measurements of fields taken on site during visits. Our modeling strategies yielded similar calculated field estimates, and they were in high agreement with utility extrapolations. Phasing was known for over 90% of the lines. Important sources of uncertainty included a lack of information on the precise location of residences located within apartment buildings or other complexes. Our findings suggest that we were able to achieve high specificity in exposure assessment, which is essential for examining the association between distance to or magnetic fields from power lines and childhood leukemia risk.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The mechanisms responsible for this preferential homing are incompletely understood. Here we studied multiple myeloma (MM) as a model of a terminally differentiated B cell malignancy that selectively colonizes the bone marrow. We found that extracellular CyPA (eCyPA), secreted by bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs), promoted the colonization and proliferation of MM cells in an in vivo scaffold system via binding to its receptor, CD147, on MM cells. The expression and secretion of eCyPA by BMECs was enhanced by BCL9, a Wnt-beta-catenin transcriptional coactivator that is selectively expressed by these cells. eCyPA levels were higher in bone marrow serum than in peripheral blood in individuals with MM, and eCyPA-CD147 blockade suppressed MM colonization and tumor growth in the in vivo scaffold system. eCyPA also promoted the migration of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma cells, two other B cell malignancies that colonize the bone marrow and express CD147.

We found that reduced expression of PICALM in AD and murine brain endothelium correlated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology and cognitive impairment. Moreover, Picalm deficiency diminished Abeta clearance across the murine blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accelerated Abeta pathology in a manner that was reversible by endothelial PICALM re-expression. Using human brain endothelial monolayers, we found that PICALM regulated PICALM/clathrin-dependent internalization of Abeta bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1, a key Abeta clearance receptor, and guided Abeta trafficking to Rab5 and Rab11, leading to Abeta endothelial transcytosis and clearance.

Here we report the 2-(oxazol-2-yl)phenol moiety as a novel ZBG that can be used to produce compounds that are potent HDAC inhibitors. A series of analogues with this novel ZBG have been synthesized, and these analogues exhibit selective inhibition against HDAC1 as well as the class IIb HDACs (HDAC6 and HDAC10). Compound 10 possesses an IC50 value of 7.5 muM in the MV-4-11 leukemia cell line, and induces a comparable amount of acetylated histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and p21Waf1/CIP1 as 0.5 muM of SAHA.

Since neutrophils are short living cells, inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis appears to play a major role in the productive infection of neutrophils by C. pneumoniae. In the present study, we have investigated which survival pathways and which events of the apoptotic process are modulated in C. pneumoniae-infected neutrophils. All infection experiments were carried out using primary human neutrophils in vitro. We show that infection with C. pneumoniae activates PI3K/Akt as well as the ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases and present evidence that activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways are essential to initiate the apoptosis delay in C. pneumoniae-infected neutrophils. Both the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways are involved in the maintained expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. In addition, we also showed that the PI3K/Akt pathway leads to the activation of NF-kappaB-dependent release of IL-8 by infected neutrophils. Infection with C. pneumoniae activates the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 MAPK survival pathways in neutrophils, induces the NF-kappaB dependent release of IL-8 and leads to the maintenance of Mcl-1 expression in neutrophils.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

This study sought to characterize the chemical attributes and in vivo activity of Tet-OAHCs. Four Tet-OAHCs were assessed for their partition coefficient and alkylating activity to determine cellular environments where adduct formation would be favorable. In vitro, IC50 values of all four Tet-OAHCs were determined against Ehrlich ascites murine carcinoma, as well as two leukemias (U937 human monocytic leukemia and L1210 murine lymphoid leukemia) to assess their cytotoxicity in multiple neoplastic cell lines. In vivo, B6D2F1 and CD2F1 mice were challenged i.p. with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma prior to, or after being treated with a single dose of one of the analogs. Finally, a quantitative comparison of host leukocyte influx between Tet-OAHCs and other alkylating agents was performed to confirm previous in vivo observations that the tetra-O-acetate carbohydrate moiety is important for inducing a host leukocyte response in murine models. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) Tet-OAHCs appear to demonstrate high alkylating activity in amphiphilic environments. 2) All four congeners have comparable in vitro cytotoxicities against the neoplastic cell lines examined. 3) The analogs demonstrate marked in vivo activity in both B6D2F1 and CD2F1 mice challenged with a lethal dose of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, and frequently produce long term survival at 60 days, which is not observed in simple halo derivatives or two currently approved antineoplastic agents (daunorubicin and mechlorethamine).

However, when samples from shared milk meters are used, carryover of antibodies or other diagnostic targets can complicate the interpretation of the diagnostic test results for diseases, including bovine leukosis. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the potential for carryover of antibodies against bovine leukemia virus (BLV) in milk samples obtained from shared meters, and (2) to determine if adjustment of the diagnostic test cut-off value would improve the test characteristics for meter-collected milk ELISA results. Eight dairy farms were randomly selected from herds with a wide range of BLV prevalence levels in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Within each chosen farm, 2 to 4milk meters were randomly selected. During the routine procedures of DHI sampling, 2 simultaneous milk samples, 1 hand-collected at the beginning of milking (after udder preparation) and the other from the corresponding milk meter, were taken from all lactating cows (n=236) that were milked at the selected meters (n=26). The sequence of cows using each meter was recorded. All samples were tested for BLV antibodies using a commercial indirect ELISA. Antibody carryover potential was assessed in meter-collected samples which were preceded by other cows using the same meters. Applying the hand-collected sample results as our reference standard, a new cut-off was defined for meter-collected samples to optimize the test characteristics. At the standard cut-off value of the diagnostic test, 110 (46.6%) of the hand-collected and 136 (57.6%) of the meter-collected samples were positive. For low-titer cows (e.g., true negatives), the likelihood of antibody carryover significantly increased as the titer of preceding cows increased, whereas this change was not substantial for high-titer cows. The odds of obtaining false diagnoses in meter-positive samples became larger with increase in the titer of preceding cows. A suspicious category for meter ELISA results was defined, and a retest was recommended for the cows falling into this category. This strategy effectively assisted in reducing the number of consequent false-positive results. When DHI-collected samples are used, carryover can affect the interpretation of dichotomous test results and may require adjustment of assay cut-off values.","['Copyright (c) 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Here, we report that the specific AMPK agonist GSK621 selectively kills acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells but spares normal hematopoietic progenitors. This differential sensitivity results from a unique synthetic lethal interaction involving concurrent activation of AMPK and mTORC1. Strikingly, the lethality of GSK621 in primary AML cells and AML cell lines is abrogated by chemical or genetic ablation of mTORC1 signaling. The same synthetic lethality between AMPK and mTORC1 activation is established in CD34-positive hematopoietic progenitors by constitutive activation of AKT or enhanced in AML cells by deletion of TSC2. Finally, cytotoxicity in AML cells from GSK621 involves the eIF2alpha/ATF4 signaling pathway that specifically results from mTORC1 activation.

However, it remains to be elucidated whether doxycycline exerts this effect on leukemia cell migration. The present study aimed to examine the role of doxycycline in leukemia cell migration. The invasion capacities of the human leukemia cell lines KG1a (acute myelogenous leukemia) and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) were evaluated using Matrigel(R) matrixcoated Transwell(R) chamber assays; leukemic cell lines treated with doxycycline (1 microg/ml) or antibeta1integrin antibodies were added to the upper chamber, while untreated cells were included as controls. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed in order to further understand the influence of doxycycline treatment on the expression of FAK and gelatinases in the KG1a and K562 leukemic cell lines. In addition, FAK protein expression and phosphorylation were determined using western blot analysis in order to investigate the mechanism by which doxycycline inhibited leukemic cell migration. The results revealed that doxycycline treatment significantly attenuated the migration of KG1a and K562 cells, which was demonstrated to be associated with inhibition of the expression and phosphorylation of FAK. In addition, doxycycline treatment inhibited matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9 expression. Furthermore, incubation with blocking antibeta1integrin antibodies had an analogous inhibitory effect on leukemic cell migration to that of doxycycline. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that doxycycline attenuated leukemic cell migration through inhibiting the FAK signaling pathway. Therefore, doxycycline may have potential for use as a novel strategy for the treatment of leukemia.",,"['Wang, Chunhuai', 'Xiang, Ru', 'Zhang, Xiangzhong', 'Chen, Yunxian']","['Wang C', 'Xiang R', 'Zhang X', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun YatSen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, P.R.

Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-5 plays a critical role in the induction of interferon genes in viral infected cells. We examined the specific mechanisms underlying the expression and regulation of IRF-5 in HTLV-1-infected T cells. IRF-5 was constitutively transcribed into three distinct alternatively spliced isoforms (V1, V3 and V4) in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines but not in uninfected T-cell lines. IRF-5 was also upregulated in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines at protein level. Nuclear IRF-5 expression was noted in ATL cells present in lymph nodes and skin lesions. IRF-5 mRNA expression was induced following infection of T cells with HTLV-1, and specifically by viral oncoprotein Tax. Tax also activated V3 promoter. Microarray analysis of IRF-5-expressing uninfected T cells demonstrated that IRF-5 induced the expression of tumor necrosis factor family cytokines.

We have demonstrated that neutrophils produce a mimic ligand of G protein-coupled C5a receptor (C5aR), ribosomal protein S19 (RP S19) polymer. In contrast to an original ligand C5a, RP S19 polymer induces not only inhibition of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity but also initiation of the regulator of G protein signaling 3 (RGS3) promoter in a RP S19 C-terminus dependent manner. To examine an antagonistic effect of the RP S19 C-terminus on G proteins, His-S-tagged C5a or C5a/RP S19, in which an RP S19 C-terminus is bound to the C5a C-terminus, was incubated with neutrophils, and a transcription factor delta lactoferrin (deltaLf) was identified as a specific binding protein via pull-down experiments. The S-tagged C5a-induced agonistic effects on chemotaxis, cytoplasmic Ca(2+) influx and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation were not changed by Lf knockdown and deltaLf overexpression in neutrophil-like or macrophage-like cells, which were differentiated into mature cells from human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells by dimethyl sulfoxide and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, respectively. While, the S-tagged C5a/RP S19-induced antagonistic or agonistic effects on mature HL-60 neutrophil-like or macrophage-like cells were reversed by Lf knockdown and deltaLf overexpression, respectively. Moreover, RGS3 expression was increased in another HL-60 neutrophil-like cells under spontaneous apoptosis induced by an apoptotic inducer MnCl2. The RGS3 expression in apoptotic neutrophil-like cells was delayed not only by Lf knockdown but also by neutralization of the RP S19 polymer or C5aR. The inhibitory extension from G protein of C5aR to Galpha subsets of constitutively active GPCRs along with the RP S19 polymer-induced translocation of deltaLf from the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane to the nucleus seems to shorten the neutrophil cell lifespan.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Recent advances in the field of hematopoietic cell allografting have resulted in a practice shift, favoring less intense preparative regimens. We present results of a retrospective comparative analysis of two preparative regimens, namely FB2 (IV fludarabine plus IV busulfan 6.4mg/kg+/-10%) and FB4 (IV fludarabine plus IV busulfan 12.8mg/kg +/-10%), in patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing hematopoietic cell allografting in second complete remission at EBMT participating centers. Between 2003 and 2010, 128 AML patients in second complete remission were allografted following a preparative regimen of FB2 (n=88) or FB4 (n=40). The median time-to-neutrophil engraftment was similar whether patients received FB2 (16 (5-38) days) or FB4 (16 (9-29) days), p=0.45. A multivariate analysis showed that use of FB4 resulted in improved 2-year leukemia-free (HR=0.44 (95%CI=0.21, 0.94), p=0.03) and overall survival (HR=0.38 (95%CI=0.16, 0.86), p=0.02). Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (2-year) for all patients was 21% (95%CI=14-28%).

Previous studies in cell cultures and animal models suggest altered activation states and cellular senescence in the aged brain. Instead, we analyzed 3 transcriptome data sets from the postmortem frontal cortex of 381 control individuals to show that microglia gene markers assemble into a transcriptional module in a gene coexpression network. These markers predominantly represented M1 and M1/M2b activation phenotypes. Expression of genes in this module generally declines over the adult life span. This decrease was more pronounced in microglia surface receptors for microglia and/or neuron crosstalk than in markers for activation state phenotypes. In addition to these receptors for exogenous signals, microglia are controlled by brain-expressed regulatory factors. We identified a subnetwork of transcription factors, including RUNX1, IRF8, PU.1, and TAL1, which are master regulators (MRs) for the age-dependent microglia module. The causal contributions of these MRs on the microglia module were verified using publicly available ChIP-Seq data. Interactions of these key MRs were preserved in a protein-protein interaction network. Importantly, these MRs appear to be essential for regulating microglia homeostasis in the adult human frontal cortex in addition to their crucial roles in hematopoiesis and myeloid cell-fate decisions during embryogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

METHODS: This study evaluates the impacts of the MFIR on AML outcomes and its interaction with detection of the FLT3 ITD. RESULTS: Among 200 newly diagnosed AML patients, an MFIR of >/= 1.9 (MFIR+) was detected in 60 (30%) leukemic blast samples. In multivariate analysis, MFIR was an independent prognostic factor for response to induction chemotherapy (OR=7.2, P<0.00001), DFS (HR=2.3, P=0.004) and OS (HR=2.2, P=0.0005) with the main effect being in the 141 patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics. Among intermediate risk cytogenetics patients: MFIR+ outcomes were similar to unfavorable cytogenetic risk (CR, 53% vs. 52%, P=1.0; OS, 11 vs. 9 months, P=0.79). MFIR status can further stratify the prognostic risk for patients with or without FLT3 ITD mutation.

Leukemic B cells accumulate in the peripheral blood and the lymphoid organs where contact with stromal cells and T cells provide critical survival signals. Clinical severity of CLL is associated with several prognostic markers including expression of the kinase ZAP-70. ZAP-70 expression enhances signaling via the B cell antigen receptor and is associated with increased cell adhesion and migration capacity. Here we report that ZAP-70-positive CLL patients display significantly higher expression of the TNF superfamily receptor and memory marker CD27 than do ZAP-70 negative patients. CD27 expression by CLL was acutely elevated upon BCR cross-linking, or upon ectopic expression of ZAP-70. CD27 expression correlated with functional capacity to adhere to stromal cells and antibody blockade of CD27 impaired CLL binding to stroma. These results provide the first evidence for differential expression of CD27 among CLL prognostic groups, suggest a role for ZAP-70 dependent signaling in CD27 induction and implicate CD27 in cell-cell interactions with the lymphoid tissue microenvironment.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the response and molecular mechanism of breast cancer cells exposed to Talpha1 remain unclear. PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene, is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the biological roles of PTEN in the growth inhibition of human breast cancer cells exposed to Talpha1. Using wild-type and mutant PTEN-expressing cells, we found a strong correlation between PTEN status and Talpha1-mediated growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. The growth inhibition effect was more pronounced in breast cancer cells in which Talpha1 enhanced PTEN expression, whereas endogenous PTEN knockdown reversed the growth inhibition effect of Talpha1 in breast cancer cells. Further investigation revealed that PTEN up-regulation, which was induced by Talpha1, can inhibit the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, leading to the growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. The addition of the synergy between Talpha1 and the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation could strongly block cell viability in PTEN down-regulated breast cancer cells. PTEN-overexpressing cells not only up-regulated Bax and cleaved caspase-3/9 and PARP expression but also down-regulated Bcl-2 compared to the treatment with Talpha1 alone. Together these findings suggest that PTEN mediates Talpha1-induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial death cascade and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.",,"['Guo, Yan', 'Chang, Hui', 'Li, Jing', 'Xu, Xin-yuan', 'Shen, Lan', 'Yu, Zhi-bin', 'Liu, Wen-chao']","['Guo Y', 'Chang H', 'Li J', 'Xu XY', 'Shen L', 'Yu ZB', 'Liu WC']","[""Department of Oncology, State Key Discipline of Cell Biology, Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710032, China, 543703387@qq.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'W0B22ISQ1C (Thymalfasin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Thymalfasin', 'Thymosin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2015/05/24 06:00,2016/01/05 06:00,['2015/05/24 06:00'],"['2015/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-015-1138-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2015 Aug;20(8):1109-21. doi: 10.1007/s10495-015-1138-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the hazards associated with poor adherence, we implemented failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). METHODS: We surveyed 54 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated at Saga University Hospital from October 2012 to May 2014. The survey consisted of items regarding the type of ABL TKI used, adherence to ABL TKIs, the appearance of adverse effects, utilisation of the high cost medical care benefit system, and factors affecting adherence. Four factors that likely affected adherence were identified, including the level of understanding of ABL TKIs treatment outcomes, adverse effects, the high cost of medications, and careless slips in the taking of medicine. Results of the survey were analysed by FMEA. RESULTS: The risk priority number was highest for careless slips in the taking of medicine at 7.0 +/- 1.0 (mean +/- SEM), followed in descending order by the inadequate understanding of treatment outcomes (4.9 +/- 0.6), adverse effects (3.8 +/- 0.8), and high medication cost (2.2 +/- 0.5). Thus, the prevention of careless slips was the most important factor affecting adherence to ABL TKIs. Contrary to our preoccupation, FMEA revealed that high medication cost was the lowest risk factor for poor adherence. This finding may be attributed to the high utilisation (96.3 %) of the high cost medical care benefit system.

Though less common than acute lymphoblastic leukemia or brain tumors, these aggressive cancers account for a disproportionate amount of the cancer morbidity and mortality in children, and have seen few advances in survival in the past decade, despite many large, complicated, and expensive trials of various chemotherapy combinations. To improve the outcomes of children with bone sarcomas, a better understanding of the biology of these cancers is needed, together with informed use of targeted therapies that exploit the unique biology of each disease. Here we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the contribution of receptor tyrosine kinases, intracellular signaling pathways, bone biology and physiology, the immune system, and the tumor microenvironment in promoting and maintaining the malignant phenotype. These observations are coupled with a review of the therapies that target each of these mechanisms, focusing on recent or ongoing clinical trials if such information is available.

However, the expression of the membrane-bound drug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been shown to be critical for resistance against the cytotoxicity of a humanized anti-CD33 antibody conjugated to maytansine-derivative DM4. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the expression of P-gp in AML cell lines is associated with changes in CD33 expression. For this purpose, we established drug resistant variants of SKM-1 and MOLM-13 AML cell lines via the selection of parental cells for resistance to vincristine, mitoxantrone and lenalidomide. All three substances induced a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in SKM-1 cells associated with strong upregulation of P-gp and downregulation of CD33. However, in MOLM-13 cells, the upregulation of P-gp and downregulation of CD33 were present only in cells selected for resistance to vincristine and mitoxantrone but not lenalidomide. Inverse expression of P-gp and CD33 were observed in all resistant variants of SKM-1 and MOLM-13 cells. The MDR phenotype of resistant variants of SKM-1 and MOLM-13 cells was associated with alterations in apoptotic regulatory proteins and downregulation of the multidrug resistance associated protein 1 and breast cancer resistance protein.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Given considerable differences between primary and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment regimens, flow cytometric assessment of minimal residual disease in relapsed leukemia requires an independent comprehensive investigation. In the present study we addressed evaluation of minimal residual disease by flow cytometry in the clinical trial for childhood relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia using eight-color flow cytometry. The major challenge of the study was to reliably identify low amounts of residual leukemic cells against the complex background of regeneration, characteristic of follow-up samples during relapse treatment. In a prospective study of 263 follow-up bone marrow samples from 122 patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we tested various B-cell markers, adapted the antibody panel to the treatment protocol, and evaluated its performance by a blinded parallel comparison with the polymerase chain reaction data. The resulting eight-color single-tube panel showed a consistently high overall concordance (P<0.001) and, under optimal conditions, sensitivity similar to that of the reference polymerase chain reaction method. Overall, evaluation of minimal residual disease by flow cytometry can be successfully integrated into the clinical management of relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia either as complementary to the polymerase chain reaction or as an independent risk stratification tool.

In our cohort of 1444 cases analyzed by next generation sequencing, somatic mutations in the gene BRCA1-BRCA2-containing complex 3 (BRCC3) were identified in 28 cases (1.9%). BRCC3 is a member of the JAMM/MPN+ family of zinc metalloproteases capable of cleaving Lys-63 linked polyubiquitin chains, and is implicated in DNA repair. The mutations were located throughout its coding region. The average variant allelic frequency of BRCC3 mutations was 30.1%, and by a serial sample analysis at two different time points a BRCC3 mutation was already identified in the initial stage of a myelodysplastic syndrome. BRCC3 mutations commonly occurred in nonsense (n=12), frameshift (n=4), and splice site (n=5) configurations. Due to the marginal male dominance (odds ratio; 2.00, 0.84-4.73) of BRCC3 mutations, the majority of mutations (n=23; 82%) were hemizygous. Phenotypically, BRCC3 mutations were frequently observed in myelodysplastic syndromes and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms and associated with -Y abnormality (odds ratio; 3.70, 1.25-11.0). Clinically, BRCC3 mutations were also related to higher age (P=0.01), although prognosis was not affected. Knockdown of Brcc3 gene expression in murine bone marrow lineage negative, Sca1 positive, c-kit positive cells resulted in 2-fold more colony formation and modest differentiation defect. Thus, BRCC3 likely plays a role as tumor-associated gene in myelodysplastic syndromes and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Huang, Dayong',

Within a prospective phase II protocol, we investigated whether a dose reduction of alemtuzumab (from 75 mg to 50 mg MabCampath) would improve leukemia-free survival by reducing the incidence of relapse. Fifty-eight patients (median age, 67 years; range, 54 to 76) received radioimmunotherapy followed by fludarabine 150 mg/m(2) and busulfan 8 mg/kg combined with either 75 mg (n = 26) or 50 mg (n = 32) alemtuzumab. Although we observed a trend towards a shorter duration of neutropenia in the 50 mg group (median, 19 versus 21 days; P = .07), the time from transplantation to neutrophil and platelet engraftment as well as the overall incidence of engraftment did not differ. The incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease tended to be higher after the lower alemtuzumab dose (17% versus 4%; P = .15). No significant differences in the cumulative incidences of relapse (38% versus 35%; P = .81) or nonrelapse mortality (46% versus 27%; P = .31) were observed.

Six genes whose expression in leukemic blasts was associated with prognosis were identified:three genes predicting poor prognosis (AK022211, FASTKD1 and STARD4) and three genes associated with a favorable outcome (CAMSAP1, PCGF6 and SH3RF3). Combining the expression of these 6 genes could successfully predict prognosis not only in the two discovery pediatric ALL studies, but also in two independent validation cohorts of adult patients, one from a publicly available study and one consisting of 62 newly recruited Chinese patients.

This is due to the persistence of chemotherapy-resistant minimal residual disease in the patients' bone marrow (BM) after an effective induction therapy. Immunotherapies targeting surface molecules expressed on the bulk of tumor cells and the chemotherapy-resistant, myeloma-propagating cells could play a central role in this clinical setting. We recently described surface molecule CD229 as a potential therapeutic target for MM. In our current study we assessed the expression of CD229 on different PC subtypes and on cells with a myeloma-propagating phenotype in a total of 77 patients with PC dyscrasias independently at 2 different cancer centers. We found that CD229 was strongly and homogeneously overexpressed on the PC of patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering myeloma, MM, and PC leukemia. CD229 was particularly overexpressed on those PC showing an abnormal phenotype such as expression of CD56. Most importantly, CD229 was also highly expressed on those cells in the patients' BM displaying the phenotype of chemotherapy-resistant and myeloma-propagating cells. In conclusion, our combined findings suggest that immunotherapies targeting CD229 will not only be effective for the bulk of tumor cells but will also help to eradicate chemotherapy-resistant cells remaining in the patients' BM after induction treatment. Hopefully, the design of CD229-specific monoclonal antibodies or chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells will help to achieve prolonged remissions or even cures in MM patients.",,"['Yousef, Sara', 'Kovacsovics-Bankowski, Magdalena', 'Salama, Mohamed E', 'Bhardwaj, Neelam', 'Steinbach, Mary', 'Langemo, Amanda', 'Kovacsovics, Tibor', 'Marvin, James', 'Binder, Mascha', 'Panse, Jens', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Luetkens, Tim', 'Atanackovic, Djordje']","['Yousef S', 'Kovacsovics-Bankowski M', 'Salama ME', 'Bhardwaj N', 'Steinbach M', 'Langemo A', 'Kovacsovics T', 'Marvin J', 'Binder M', 'Panse J', 'Kroger N', 'Luetkens T', 'Atanackovic D']","['a Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies; University of Utah; Huntsman Cancer Institute ; Salt Lake City , UT , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,101572652,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (LY9 protein, human)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*immunology', 'CD56 Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology', 'Paraproteinemias/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD229', 'SLAM family of receptors', 'immunotherapy', 'multiple myeloma', 'plasma cell dyscrasias', 'tumor immunology']",2015/05/23 06:00,2016/05/10 06:00,['2015/05/23 06:00'],"['2015/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/21645515.2015.1046658 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2015;11(7):1606-11. doi: 10.1080/21645515.2015.1046658.,,PMC4514151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our current understanding of the patholobiology of these fundamental disorders suggests that inflammatory processes may differentially affect them; thus, atherosclerosis can be largely driven by inflammation, where as cancer often flourishes as inflammatory responses are modulated. A corollary of this hypothesis is that cancer (or its treatment may significantly attenuate atherosclerotic disease by diminishing host inflammatory response, suggesting potential therapeutic approaches. To evaluate the relationship between cancer and cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease, we assessed 1,024 autopsy reports from Brigham and Women's Hospital and performed correlative analyses on atherosclerotic severity and cancer prevalence. In gender- and age-matched populations, there is a statistically significant inverse correlation between history of malignancy and autopsy-proven atherosclerotic disease. In a second analysis, we evaluated 147,779 patients through analysis of the Harvard Catalyst SHRINE database and demonstrated a reduced non-coronary atherosclerotic disease rate: control (27.40%), leukemia/lymphoma (12.57%), lung (17.63%), colorectal (18.17%), breast (9.79%), uterus/cervix (11.47%), and prostate (18.40%). We herein report that, based on two separate medical records analysis, an inverse correlation between cancer and atherosclerosis.

ANIMALS AND SAMPLES: 10 Beagles and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. PROCEDURES: Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were used to verify antigen cross-reactivity between human and canine anti-TRX-antibodies. Dogs were assigned to receive 21% or 100% O2 (5 dogs/group) via an artificial respirator during a 3-hour period of isoflurane anesthesia (starting at 0 hours). Blood and urine samples were collected before (baseline) and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after commencement of inhalation anesthesia. Concentrations of TRX-1 and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in plasma and urine samples were analyzed; urine concentrations were reported as ratios against urine creatinine concentration. RESULTS: Canine TRX-1 was recognized by monoclonal human anti-TRX-1 antibodies (clones of adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor [ADF]-11 and ADF21) by western blot analysis. Results of an ELISA indicated that plasma TRX-1 concentration and urine TRX-1-to-creatinine concentration ratio increased rapidly after the 3-hour period of hyperoxia with maximal peaks at 12 and 6 hours, respectively. Urine 8-OHdG-to-creatinine concentration ratio also increased significantly after hyperoxia induction. However, unlike the rapid increase in urine TRX-1-to-creatinine concentration ratio, maximal urine 8-OHdG-to-creatinine concentration ratio was attained at 48 hours after hyperoxia induction. These variables remained unchanged from baseline in the control group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that human anti-TRX monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with canine TRX, and plasma TRX-1 concentrations were rapidly increased in dogs following an oxidative stress challenge. Thus, TRX may be a valuable clinical biomarker for detecting oxidative stress more rapidly than 8-OHdG in dogs.",,"['Munakata, Shuntaro', 'Tanaka, Yoshikazu', 'Nezu, Yoshinori', 'Harada, Yasuji', 'Yogo, Takuya', 'Hara, Yasushi', 'Tian, Hai', 'Matsuo, Yoshiyuki', 'Tagawa, Masahiro', 'Yodoi, Junji']","['Munakata S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Nezu Y', 'Harada Y', 'Yogo T', 'Hara Y', 'Tian H', 'Matsuo Y', 'Tagawa M', 'Yodoi J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'CYS9AKD70P (Isoflurane)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Anesthesia, General/*veterinary', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/*blood/urine', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/urine', 'Dogs/*physiology', 'Female', 'Isoflurane/administration & dosage', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen/administration & dosage', 'Thioredoxins/*blood/urine']",,,2015/05/23 06:00,2015/11/18 06:00,['2015/05/23 06:00'],"['2015/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2460/ajvr.76.6.554 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2015 Jun;76(6):554-60. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.76.6.554.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib, a new oral targeted therapy drug, is the first agent that binds to the Bruton's tyrosine kinases and inhibits overgrowth of B cells. In blocking this overgrowth, ibrutinib has been shown to achieve lengthy remissions for patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Remissions are highly valued in these cancers; cure is rare in MCL, and CLL is incurable. OBJECTIVES: This article reviews ibrutinib, its risks and benefits, and the role that oncology nurses play in educating patients and promoting drug adherence. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted using key words such as ibrutinib, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and oral chemotherapy. FINDINGS: Ibrutinib has been shown to be well tolerated, with manageable, low-grade toxicities compared to traditional cytotoxic agents. For all patients with a hematologic cancer, but particularly for the large proportion of older adults affected by hematologic malignancies, ibrutinib provides a new treatment option with a low toxicity profile.",,"['Smithson, Caroline R', 'Schneider, Susan M']","['Smithson CR', 'Schneider SM']","['Duke University Hospital.', 'School of Nursing, Duke University, Durham, NC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin J Oncol Nurs,Clinical journal of oncology nursing,9705336,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Interactions', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Piperidines', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"[""Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia"", 'chronic lymphocytic lymphoma', 'mantle cell lymphoma', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2015/05/23 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/23 06:00'],"['2015/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1188/15.CJON.E47-E51 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin J Oncol Nurs. 2015 Jun;19(3):E47-51. doi: 10.1188/15.CJON.E47-E51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With such data one might track heterogeneous cell sub-populations, and infer regulatory relationships between genes and pathways. Recently, RNA sequencing has achieved single-cell resolution. What is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. The reproducibility of these high-throughput single-cell data allowed us to deconstruct cell populations and infer gene expression relationships. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To monitor mast cell activation and to improve the sensitivity of detection, aequorin was stably expressed in the cells and used as an indicator of calcium flux and the stable cell line was created. The procedures for preparing cells were optimized to improve the quantum yield and sensitivity of detection. The cells sensitized with anti-DNP (dinitrophenyl) IgE were capable of detecting as little as 0.1 ng/mL DNP-BSA in less than 2 min. To demonstrate the utility of this mast cell sensor in detecting protein toxins, an IgE chimeric protein (p21-Fcepsilon) was created. This was achieved by fusing the Fc region of IgE antibody to a 21-amino acid peptide (p21) derived from residues 40-60 of synaptotagmin II (Syt II), the protein receptor of botulinum neurotoxin type B (BoNT/B). In addition, magnetic beads linked with anti-BoNT/B polyclonal antibody were prepared to capture BoNT/B molecules in solution to make targets multivalent and concentrated. The p21-Fcepsilon binds to FcsRI receptors on RBL (Rat basophilic leukemia) cells and can be cross-linked by BoNT/B captured by the magnetic beads. This led to cell activation and Ca2+ flux indicated by an increase of quantum yield. This assay can detect as little as 100 pM (15 ng/mL) BoNT/B in less than 1 hr, which included the initial sample preparation time.

The clinical manifestations of central nervous system listerial infections are variable and represent a diagnostic challenge. CASE REPORT: The authors report the case of a 59-year-old woman who was admitted for confusion, agitation, and right-lower extremity weakness. The patient was treated for 3 months with fludarabine and 2 months with corticosteroids for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hemolytic anemia, respectively. At the time of admission, the neurological examination revealed grade 4 right-lower extremity weakness with reflex asymmetry and right-sided Babinski sign; no signs of meningeal irritation were detectable. Physical examination was notable for grade 1 obesity and subfebrility. The cerebral computed tomography scan demonstrated a hypodense lesion in the left frontal lobe. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hyperintense lesion in the left frontal lobe with extension toward the basal ganglia (T2 and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery [FLAIR] sequences), and small nodular enhancing lesions after gadolinium infusion in the affected territory. Blood analyses revealed pancytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. During the second day after admission, the patient developed fever and neurological examination revealed signs of meningeal irritation. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses revealed: red blood cells 24 cells/mm(3); white blood cells 829 cells/mm(3) (76% lymphocytes, 22% neutrophils, 2% monocytes); protein level 111.2 mg/dL; glucose level 10.2 mg/dL. Empiric anti-infection treatment was started with intravenous ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacine, aciclovir, and fluconasole. Both blood cultures and CSF cultures were positive for L. monocytogenes. The antimicrobial regimen was changed to ampicillin. The clinical and imaging outcome was excellent. CONCLUSION: The supratentorial focal lesions secondary to Listeria meningoencephalitis are rare.

As proteins that interact with STAT3 may be key in addressing how STAT3 contributes to cancer pathogenesis, we took a proteomics approach to identify novel STAT3-interacting proteins. We performed mass spectrometry-based profiling of STAT3-containing complexes from breast cancer cells that have constitutively active STAT3 and are dependent on STAT3 function for survival. We identified granulin (GRN) as a novel STAT3-interacting protein that was necessary for both constitutive and maximal leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)induced STAT3 transcriptional activity. GRN enhanced STAT3 DNA binding and also increased the time-integrated amount of LIF-induced STAT3 activation in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, silencing GRN neutralized STAT3-mediated tumorigenic phenotypes including viability, clonogenesis, and migratory capacity. In primary breast cancer samples, GRN mRNA levels were positively correlated with STAT3 gene expression signatures and with reduced patient survival. These studies identify GRN as a functionally important STAT3-interacting protein that may serve as an important prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.",,"['Yeh, Jennifer E', 'Kreimer, Simion', 'Walker, Sarah R', 'Emori, Megan M', 'Krystal, Hannah', 'Richardson, Andrea', 'Ivanov, Alexander R', 'Frank, David A']","['Yeh JE', 'Kreimer S', 'Walker SR', 'Emori MM', 'Krystal H', 'Richardson A', 'Ivanov AR', 'Frank DA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Barnett Institute of Chemical and Biological Analysis, Northeastern University, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA ; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Barnett Institute of Chemical and Biological Analysis, Northeastern University, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA ; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['STAT3', 'breast cancer', 'interacting protein']",2015/05/23 06:00,2015/05/23 06:01,['2015/05/23 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:01 [medline]']","['58 [pii]', '10.18632/genesandcancer.58 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2015 Mar;6(3-4):153-68. doi: 10.18632/genesandcancer.58.,"['F30 CA180340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA160979/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007226/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4426952,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most effective and consolidated cell therapy approach is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only cure for several patients with high-risk hematological malignancies. The potential of allogeneic HSCT is strictly dependent on the donor immune system, particularly on alloreactive T lymphocytes, that promote the beneficial graft-versus-tumor effect (GvT), but may also trigger the detrimental graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). Gene transfer technologies allow to manipulate donor T-cells to enforce GvT and foster immune reconstitution, while avoiding or controlling GvHD. The suicide gene approach is based on the transfer of a suicide gene into donor lymphocytes, for a safe infusion of a wide T-cell repertoire, that might be selectively controlled in vivo in case of GvHD. The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) is the suicide gene most extensively tested in humans.

Thus, a meta-analysis was carried out to accurately evaluate the effect of this polymorphism on leukemia susceptibility. METHODS: A computerized literature search was conducted of PubMed, Elsevier database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, and Wanfang Database, to find published case-control studies exploring the relationship between ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism and leukemia risk. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to assess the strength of association. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies of 2,431 cases and 3,028 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The results of overall comparisons suggest that there is a significant association between ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism and leukemia risk under two genetic models (TT vs CC: OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.04-1.84, P=0.02; CT+TT vs CC: OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.06-1.36, P=0.004). In the subgroup analyses by ethnicity, age, and leukemia subtype, a significant association was found in Caucasian (CT vs CC: OR=1.22, 95% CI=1.03-1.45, P=0.02; TT vs CC: OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.10-1.64, P=0.004; CT+TT vs CC: OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.08-1.49, P=0.004), adult leukemia (CT vs CC: OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.17-1.83, P=0.001; CT+TT vs CC: OR=1.43, 95% CI=1.01-2.03, P=0.04), and lymphocytic leukemia (TT vs CC: OR=1.73, 95% CI=1.19-2.51, P=0.004; TT vs CC+CT: OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.10-2.38, P=0.01; CT+TT vs CC: OR=1.28, 95% CI=1.10-1.48, P=0.001).

Adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) has emerged as a powerful targeted immunotherapy, showing striking responses in highly refractory populations. Complete remission (CR) rates as high as 90% have been reported in children and adults with relapsed and refractory ALL treated with CAR-modified T cells targeting the B-cell-specific antigen CD19. Distinct CAR designs across several studies have produced similar promising CR rates, an encouraging finding. Even more encouraging are durable remissions observed in some patients without additional therapy. Duration of remission and CAR-modified T-cell persistence require further study and more mature follow-up, but emerging data suggest these factors may distinguish CAR designs. Supraphysiologic T-cell proliferation, a hallmark of this therapy, contributes to both efficacy and the most notable toxicity, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), posing a unique challenge for toxicity management.

In particular, unbiased genome-wide association studies have identified germline variants strongly associated with the predisposition to ALL in children, providing novel insight into the mechanisms of leukemogenesis and evidence for complex interactions between inherited and acquired genetic variations in ALL. Similar genome-wide approaches have also discovered novel germline genetic risk factors that independently influence ALL prognosis and those that strongly modify host susceptibility to adverse effects of antileukemic agents (eg, vincristine, asparaginase, glucocorticoids).

In the last decade, microarray and sequencing analysis of large ALL cohorts has revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of this disease. These studies have identified new ALL subtypes, each characterized by constellations of structural and sequence alterations that perturb key cellular pathways, including lymphoid development, cell-cycle regulation, and tumor suppression; cytokine receptor, kinase, and Ras signaling; and chromatin modifications. Several of these pathways, particularly kinase-activating lesions and epigenetic alterations, are logical targets for new precision medicine therapies. Genomic profiling has also identified important interactions between inherited genetic variants that influence the risk of leukemia development and the somatic genetic alterations that are required to establish the leukemic clone. Moreover, sequential sequencing studies at diagnosis, remission, and relapse have provided important insights into the relationship among genetic variants, clonal heterogeneity, and the risk of relapse.

MRD diagnostics has proven to be the strongest prognostic factor, allowing for risk group assignment into different treatment arms, ranging from significant treatment reduction to mild or strong intensification. Also in relapsed ALL patients and patients undergoing stem cell transplantation, MRD diagnostics is guiding treatment decisions. This is also why the efficacy of innovative drugs, such as antibodies and small molecules, are currently being evaluated with MRD diagnostics within clinical trials. In fact, MRD measurements might well be used as a surrogate end point, thereby significantly shortening the follow-up. The MRD techniques need to be sensitive (</=10(-4)), broadly applicable, accurate, reliable, fast, and affordable. Thus far, flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of rearranged immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes (allele-specific oligonucleotide [ASO]-PCR) are claimed to meet these criteria, but classical flow cytometry does not reach a solid 10(-4), whereas classical ASO-PCR is time-consuming and labor intensive.

The mitochondria are important and central mediators of both apoptosis and regulated necrosis. In apoptosis, the B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family members Bcl-2-associated protein x (Bax) and Bcl-2 homologues antagonist/killer (Bak) undergo oligomerization in the outer mitochondrial membrane resulting in the release of apoptosis inducing substrates and the activation of caspases and nucleases. In contrast, during necrosis the mitochondria become dysfunctional and maladaptive in conjunction with reactive oxygen species production and the loss of ATP production, in part through opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Although regulated necrosis is caspase-independent, recent evidence has shown that it still requires the apoptotic regulators Bax/Bak, which can regulate the permeability characteristics of the outer mitochondrial membrane in their nonoligomerized state. Here, we review the nonapoptotic side of Bcl-2 family, specifically the role of Bax/Bak in regulated necrotic cell death. We will also discuss how these Bcl-2 family member effectors could be part of a larger integrated network that ultimately decides the fate of a given cell somewhere within a molecular continuum between apoptosis and regulated necrosis.","['(c) 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.']","['Karch, Jason', 'Molkentin, Jeffery D']","['Karch J', 'Molkentin JD']","[""From the Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH (J.K., J.D.M.); and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Cincinnati, OH (J.D.M.)."", ""From the Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH (J.K., J.D.M.); and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Cincinnati, OH (J.D.M.). jeff.molkentin@cchmc.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', '*Necrosis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'calcium', 'mitochondria', 'necrosis']",2015/05/23 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2015/05/23 06:00'],"['2015/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['CIRCRESAHA.116.305421 [pii]', '10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305421 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2015 May 22;116(11):1800-9. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305421.,"['R01 HL105924/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL108806/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HL052318/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL062927/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 HL060562/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HL077101/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4443748,['NIHMS683297'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resultant compound, dBET1, induced highly selective cereblon-dependent BET protein degradation in vitro and in vivo and delayed leukemia progression in mice. A second series of probes resulted in selective degradation of the cytosolic protein FKBP12. This chemical strategy for controlling target protein stability may have implications for therapeutically targeting previously intractable proteins.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Winter, Georg E', 'Buckley, Dennis L', 'Paulk, Joshiawa', 'Roberts, Justin M', 'Souza, Amanda', 'Dhe-Paganon, Sirano', 'Bradner, James E']","['Winter GE', 'Buckley DL', 'Paulk J', 'Roberts JM', 'Souza A', 'Dhe-Paganon S', 'Bradner JE']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Several expression profile studies have been pursued to better understand CLL pathogenesis. However, these large-scale studies only provide information at the transcriptional level. To better comprehend the differential protein changes that take place in CLL, we performed a reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analysis using 167 different antibodies on B-cell lysates from 18 CLL patients and 6 normal donors. From our analysis, we discovered an enrichment of protein alterations involved with mRNA translation, specifically upregulation of the translation initiator eIF4G and phosphorylation of the cap-dependent translation inhibitor 4E-BP1 at serine 65. Interestingly, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation occurred independently of AKT phosphorylation, suggesting a disconnect between PI3K/AKT pathway activation and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Based on these results, we treated primary CLL samples with NVP-BEZ235, a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor, and compared its apoptotic-inducing potential against the BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib and the PI3Kdelta inhibitor Idelalisib. We demonstrated that treatment with NVP-BEZ235 caused greater apoptosis, greater apoptotic cleavage of eIF4G, and greater dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in primary CLL cells. Taken together, these results highlight the potential dependence of eIF4G overexpression and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in CLL survival.",,"['Shull, Austin Y', 'Noonepalle, Satish K', 'Awan, Farrukh T', 'Liu, Jimei', 'Pei, Lirong', 'Bollag, Roni J', 'Salman, Huda', 'Ding, Zhiyong', 'Shi, Huidong']","['Shull AY', 'Noonepalle SK', 'Awan FT', 'Liu J', 'Pei L', 'Bollag RJ', 'Salman H', 'Ding Z', 'Shi H']","['Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'GRU Cancer Center, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'GRU Cancer Center, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'The Ohio State Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'GRU Cancer Center, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'GRU Cancer Center, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'GRU Cancer Center, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'GRU Cancer Center, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'Deparment of Medicine, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'GRU Cancer Center, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Array Analysis/*methods', 'Serine/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['4E-BP1', 'CLL', 'EIF4G', 'NVP-BEZ235', 'RPPA']",2015/05/23 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/05/23 06:00'],"['2015/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['4104 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4104 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Jun 10;6(16):14632-45. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.4104.,"['R21 CA185833/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA185833/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4546493,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cancers relapsing within a previously irradiated area have an increased probability to metastasize. The mechanisms responsible for this aggressiveness remain unclear. Here, we used the clinically relevant 4T1 breast cancer model mimicking aggressive local relapse after radiotherapy to identify differences between tumors grown in untreated versus preirradiated mammary glands. Tumors grown within preirradiated beds were highly enriched in transcripts encoding collagens and other proteins building or modifying the extracellular matrix, such as laminin-332, tenascins, lysyl oxidases and matrix metalloproteinases. Type I collagen, known to directly contribute to tissue stiffening, and the pro-metastatic megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (Mkl1) target gene tenascin-C were further investigated. Mammary tissue preirradiation induced Mkl1 nuclear translocation in the tumor cells in vivo, indicating activation of Mkl1 signaling. Transcript profiling of cultured 4T1 cells revealed that the majority of the Mkl1 target genes, including tenascin-C, required serum response factor (SRF) for their expression. However, application of dynamic strain or matrix stiffness to 4T1 cells converted the predominant SRF/Mkl1 action into SAP domain-dependent Mkl1 signaling independent of SRF, accompanied by a switch to SAP-dependent tumor cell migration. 4T1 tumors overexpressing intact Mkl1 became more metastatic within preirradiated beds, while tumors expressing Mkl1 lacking the SAP domain exhibited impaired growth and metastatic spread, and decreased Mkl1 target gene expression. Thus, we identified SAP-dependent Mkl1 signaling as a previously unrecognized mediator of aggressive progression of mammary tumors locally relapsing after radiotherapy, and provide a novel signaling pathway for therapeutic intervention.",['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to analyze temporal and spatial patterns in this condemnation data to gain insight into the ecology and epidemiology of the causative virus. We extracted visual patterns in the data using seasonal trend decomposition, and we tested for statistical significance using extended linear modeling techniques. The analysis confirmed previous findings that there are differences in leukosis condemnation rates between states, across years, and within years. The analysis also revealed several patterns not previously highlighted, including spatial and temporal autocorrelations in leukosis condemnation, changes to the amplitude of seasonality over time, and increasing within-year variation in condemnation rate over time. These patterns suggest that locally shared farm practices, virus transmission between farms, or viral persistence may be important to understanding the dynamics of the disease.

We examined the expression of the known plasma membrane carnitine transporters, OCTN1, OCTN2, and CT2 in AML cell lines and primary AML samples and compared expression to normal hematopoietic cells. Of the three carnitine transporters, CT2 demonstrated the greatest differential expression between AML and normal cells. Using shRNA, we knocked down CT2 and demonstrated that target knockdown impaired the function of the transporter. In addition, knockdown of CT2 reduced the growth and viability of AML cells with high expression of CT2 (OCI-AML2 and HL60), but not low expression. CT2 knockdown reduced basal oxygen consumption without a concomitant increase in glycolysis. Thus, CT2 may be a novel target for a subset of AML.",,"['Wu, Yan', 'Hurren, Rose', 'MacLean, Neil', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Jitkova, Yulia', 'Sukhai, Mahadeo A', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Wu Y', 'Hurren R', 'MacLean N', 'Gronda M', 'Jitkova Y', 'Sukhai MA', 'Minden MD', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Ave, Toronto, ON, M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SLC22A16 protein, human)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology']",,,2015/05/23 06:00,2016/01/05 06:00,['2015/05/23 06:00'],"['2015/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-015-1137-x [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2015 Aug;20(8):1099-108. doi: 10.1007/s10495-015-1137-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, using pro-erythroblast-like murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, a model system of erythroid maturation, we aimed to investigate whether genetic manipulation of RPS5 expression affects the capacity of cells to grow and differentiate in culture. Parental MEL cells stably transfected with full length RPS5 cDNA in sense (MEL-C14 culture) or antisense (MEL-antisenseRPS5 culture) orientation, as well as MEL cells transiently transfected with siRNAs specific for RPS5 gene silencing (MEL-RPS5siRNA culture) were assessed for their ability to fully execute their erythroid maturation program in culture. The data obtained thus far indicate that: a) MEL-antisenseRPS5 exhibit a pronounced delay in the initiation of differentiation, as well as an impairment of commitment, since the continuous presence of the inducer in culture is required for the cells to fully execute their erythroid maturation program. b) RNAi-mediating silencing of RPS5 gene expression resulted in the inability of MEL cells to differentiate; however, when these cells were allowed to recapitulate normal RPS5 gene expression levels they regained their differentiation capacity by accumulating high proportion of erythroid mature cells. c) Interestingly the latter, is accompanied by morphological changes of cells and an impairment of their proliferation and apoptosis potential.

However, its atheroprotective activity in human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells remains unclear. We investigated the activity and molecular mechanism of action of curcumin in polarized macrophages. METHODS: Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-treated THP-1 cells were differentiated to macrophages, which were further polarized to M1 cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 microg/ml) and interferon (IFN)-gamma (20 ng/ml) and treated with varying curcumin concentrations. [3H]thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation assays were utilized to measure curcumin-induced growth inhibition. The expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL-6), and IL-12B (p40) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Macrophage polarization and its mechanism were evaluated by flow cytometry and western blot. Additionally, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) small interfering RNA and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors were used to further confirm the molecular mechanism of curcumin on macrophage polarization. RESULTS: Curcumin dose-dependently inhibited M1 macrophage polarization and the production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-12B (p40). It also decreased TLR4 expression, which regulates M1 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, curcumin significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, p38, and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. In contrast, SiTLR4 in combination with p-JNK, p-ERK, and p-p38 inhibition reduced the effect of curcumin on polarization. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin can modulate macrophage polarization through TLR4-mediated signaling pathway inhibition, indicating that its effect on macrophage polarization is related to its anti-inflammatory and atheroprotective effects. Our data suggest that curcumin could be used as a therapeutic agent in atherosclerosis.","['(c) 2015 S.

The aim of this study was to investigate BP effects on cell growth, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in three human leukemia cell lines HL-60, U-937 and K-562. BP was able to induce both the reduction of cell proliferation, associated with an arrest in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle and the increase of apoptosis in leukemic cell lines, thus exerting both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects. The growth inhibitory effect was likely mediated by the decrease of cyclins D, E, A, B1 levels and CDK4 expression; meanwhile, the apoptotic effect, not mediated by ROS production, was presumably due to the combined action of the survival and pro-apoptotic AKT and MAPK signal transduction pathways.

More importantly, miR-193b significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in HepG2 cells by targeting Mcl-1. Knockdown of the Mcl-1 gene by specific siRNA exhibited a function similar to miR-193b on sensitizing HepG2 cells to cisplatin-inducing cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the miR-193b-induced sensitization of HepG2 cells to cisplatin cytotoxicity was abolished by the transfection of Mcl-1 expression plasmid that lacked the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). In addition, activation of caspase-3 was needed for sensitization by miR-193b to cisplatin-mediated cell death.

IGHV3-21 was found in 29 patients (7%) and IGHV1-69 in 51 patients (12.4%). The median overall survival (OS) rates were 97 months and 85 months in the IGHV3-21 and IGHV1-69 groups, respectively. In this small group of patients, the study failed to show a difference in OS of IGHV3-21 patients with mutated and unmutated IGHV status (p<0.597). There was also no difference in OS between IGHV3-21 patients with mutated IGHV status and all patients in the group having unmutated IGHV status (p<0.245). On the other hand, patients with IGHV3-21 and the presence of some other adverse prognostic factors (age >/= 65 years, lymphocyte count >/= 50x109/L, serum thymidine kinase >/= 9U/L, deletion of 17p) had statistically significantly worse OS than IGHV3-21 patients without the presence of these prognostic factors. The multivariate analysis of an entire group of Binet clinical stage A patients proved that the presence of IGHV3-21 is as an independent adverse prognostic factor even though there was no statistical difference in OS between patients with IGHV3-21 and those without IGHV3-21 in the entire group (p<0.769). Patients with IGHV1-69 had the same probablility of OS irrespective of the presence of other adverse prognostic factors; their OS was significantly shorter as compared with the other patients from the entire group (p<0.03).The study mapped the occurrence of recurrent cytogenetic changes detected by FISH in IGHV3-21 (subset #2 and non-subset #2) and IGHV1-69 and compared it with the occurrence of recurrent changes in the entire group of patients. In IGHV1-69 and in subset #2 IGHV3-21, higher proportions of deletion of 11q were found (30% and 31%, respectively), with the deletion being present in 19.2% of the entire group of patients. None of the 3 patients with IGHV3-21 and deletion of 17p had subset #2. Patients with subset #2 IGHV3-21 had higher proportions of deletion of 13 (69%) as compared with non-subset #2 IGHV3-21 patients (27%).",,"['Urbanova, R', 'Humplikova, L', 'Drimalova, H', 'Prochazka, V', 'Turcsanyi, P', 'Pikalova, Z', 'Holzerova, M', 'Kruzova, L', 'Jarosova, M', 'Urban, J', 'Vrbkova, J', 'Indrak, K', 'Papajik, T']","['Urbanova R', 'Humplikova L', 'Drimalova H', 'Prochazka V', 'Turcsanyi P', 'Pikalova Z', 'Holzerova M', 'Kruzova L', 'Jarosova M', 'Urban J', 'Vrbkova J', 'Indrak K', 'Papajik T']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['IGHV mutation status', 'IGHV1-69', 'IGHV3-21', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'stereotyped B-cell receptor', 'subset #2.']",2015/05/23 06:00,2015/05/23 06:01,['2015/05/23 06:00'],"['2015/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2015_074 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2015;62(4):618-26. doi: 10.4149/neo_2015_074.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve this goal we used erythroleukemia cell lines expressing COX2 (HEL cell line) or not (K562 cell line). Moreover, we made use of COX2 cDNA to overexpress COX2 in K562 cells. In light of the reported chemopreventive and chemosensitive effects of natural products on various tumor cells and animal models, we postulated that our Bl extract may mediate their effects through apoptosis induction with suppression of cell survival pathways. Our study is the first report on the specific examination of intrinsic apoptosis and Akt/NF-kappaB/COX2 pathways in human erythroleukemia cells upon Bl extract exposure. Even if Bl extract induced apoptosis of three human erythroleukemia cell lines, a dominant effect of Bl extract treatment on K562 cells was observed resulting in activation of the late markers of apoptosis with caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. Whereas, we showed that Bl extract reduced significantly expression of COX2 by a dose-dependent manner in HEL and K562 (COX2+) cells. Furthermore, in regard to our results, it is clear that the simultaneous inhibition of Akt and NF-kappaB signalling can significantly contribute to the anticancer effects of Bl extract in human erythroleukemia cells. We observed that the Bl extract is clearly more active than the berberine alone on the induction of DNA fragmentation in human erythro-leukemia cells.",,"['Diab, Saada', 'Fidanzi, Chloe', 'Leger, David Y', 'Ghezali, Lamia', 'Millot, Marion', 'Martin, Frederique', 'Azar, Rania', 'Esseily, Fadi', 'Saab, Antoine', 'Sol, Vincent', 'Diab-Assaf, Mona', 'Liagre, Bertrand']","['Diab S', 'Fidanzi C', 'Leger DY', 'Ghezali L', 'Millot M', 'Martin F', 'Azar R', 'Esseily F', 'Saab A', 'Sol V', 'Diab-Assaf M', 'Liagre B']","['Laboratory of Chemistry of Natural Substances, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, FR 3503 GEIST, EA1069, Limoges, France.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry of Natural Substances, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, FR 3503 GEIST, EA1069, Limoges, France.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry of Natural Substances, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, FR 3503 GEIST, EA1069, Limoges, France.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry of Natural Substances, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, FR 3503 GEIST, EA1069, Limoges, France.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry of Natural Substances, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, FR 3503 GEIST, EA1069, Limoges, France.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry of Natural Substances, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, FR 3503 GEIST, EA1069, Limoges, France.', 'Molecular Tumorigenesis and Anticancer Pharmacology, EDST, Lebanese University, Hadath, Lebanon.', 'Laboratory Science Department, Faculty of Public Health, Lebanese University, Jdeidet El Metn, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Sciences II, Chemistry Department, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry of Natural Substances, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, FR 3503 GEIST, EA1069, Limoges, France.', 'Molecular Tumorigenesis and Anticancer Pharmacology, EDST, Lebanese University, Hadath, Lebanon.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry of Natural Substances, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, FR 3503 GEIST, EA1069, Limoges, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150518,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Berberis/*chemistry', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,,2015/05/23 06:00,2016/03/22 06:00,['2015/05/23 06:00'],"['2015/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2015.3012 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2015 Jul;47(1):220-30. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2015.3012.

Recently, it is well-known that ceramide acts as an inducer of cell death, that sphingomyelin works as a regulator for microdomain function of the cell membrane, and that sphingosine-1-phosphate plays a role in cell survival/proliferation. The lipids are metabolized by the specific enzymes, and each metabolite could be again returned to the original form by the reverse action of the different enzyme or after a long journey of many metabolizing/synthesizing pathways. In addition, the metabolites may serve as reciprocal bio-modulators like the rheostat between ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate. Therefore, the change of lipid amount in the cells, the subcellular localization and the downstream signal in a specific subcellular organelle should be clarified to understand the pathobiological significance of sphingolipids when extracellular stimulation induces a diverse of cell functions such as cell death, proliferation and migration. In this review, we focus on how sphingolipids and their metabolizing enzymes cooperatively exert their function in proliferation, migration, autophagy and death of hematopoetic cells, and discuss the way developing a novel therapeutic device through the regulation of sphingolipids for effectively inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell death in hematological malignancies such as leukemia, malignant lymphoma and multiple myeloma.",,"['Kitatani, Kazuyuki', 'Taniguchi, Makoto', 'Okazaki, Toshiro']","['Kitatani K', 'Taniguchi M', 'Okazaki T']","['Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Medical Research Institute, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.', 'Medical Research Institute, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Immunology, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150522,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,['0 (Sphingolipids)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Sphingolipids/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['ceramide', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'sphingolipid', 'sphingomyelin']",2015/05/23 06:00,2016/04/15 06:00,['2015/05/23 06:00'],"['2015/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.14348/molcells.2015.0118 [doi]', 'molcells.2015.0118 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2015 Jun;38(6):482-95. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2015.0118.

A growing body of evidence suggests that the epigenetic abnormalities are involved in tyrosine kinase resistance in CML, leading to leukaemic clone escape and disease propagation. Here we show that, by applying cellular reprogramming to primary CML cells, aberrant DNA methylation contributes to the disease evolution.

We have evaluated the assays systematically with regard to specificity, linearity, lower limit of detection (LLOD), lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), and precision. Both assays are specific for X-MuLV detection, with a linear detection range of 0.6-5.6 log(10) TCID(50)/mL for the infectivity assay, and 1.4-6.5 log(10) particles/mL for the qRT-PCR assay. The LLOD and LLOQ of the infectivity and the qRT-PCR assays are determined as 0.5 and 1.0 log(10)/mL, and 1.4 and 2.2 log(10)/mL. The inter-assay repeatability of qRT-PCR assay (4.2% coefficient of variation [CV]) is higher than the infectivity assay (7.9% CV). We have shown that both assays are closely correlated (r = 0.85, P < 0.05, n = 22). The particle/infectivity ratio is determined as 66. Both assays were applied to evaluate virus removal using virus clearance samples of chromatographic and filtration processes. Here, we have demonstrated that the qRT-PCR assay is much faster in testing and is approximately 8-fold more sensitive than the infectivity assay. Therefore, the qRT-PCR assay can replace the infectivity assay in many cases, but both assays are complementary in elucidating the mechanism of virus inactivation and removal in virus clearance validation.","['Copyright (c) 2015 The International Alliance for Biological Standardization.', 'Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We previously showed that, other than its known function as a cytoplasmic signal transducer, Lck also acts as a nuclear transcription factor in mouse leukemic cells. In the present study, we demonstrated the presence of nuclear Lck in human leukemic T cells and in primary cells. We further established a positive correlation between Lck nuclear localization and its kinase activity. Proteomic analysis identified CR6-interacting factor 1 (CRIF1) as one of the Lck-interacting proteins. CRIF1 and Lck association in the nucleus was confirmed both by immunofluorescence microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation in human leukemic T cells. Close-range interaction between Lck and CRIF1 was validated by in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA). Consistent with the role of nuclear CRIF1 as a tumor suppressor, CRIF1 silencing promotes leukemic T cell survival in the absence of growth factors. This protective effect can be recapitulated by endogenous Lck or reconstituted Lck in leukemic T cells. All together, our results support a novel function of nuclear Lck in promoting human leukemic T cell survival through interaction with a tumor suppressor.

METHODS: Seventy-one patients were treated according to the GMALL 07/2003 protocol and evaluated for MRD in bone marrow by specific clonal rearrangements of Ig/TCR in BCR-ABL negative ALL or fusion gene transcript in BCR-ABL positive ALL. RESULTS: Three-year overall survival (OS) was 94% in patients with BCR-ABL negative ALL reaching complete molecular response (CMR) after the first course of chemotherapy (vs. 32% if MRD >10(-4) ; P = 0.001). Patients with CMR prior to the start of consolidation chemotherapy at week 11 had 3-yr OS 82% (vs. 18% if MRD >10(-4) ; P = 0.001). Patients with BCR-ABL positive ALL showed slower MRD dynamics. There was a trend to better OS in patients with >/= 4 log reduction of BCR-ABL transcript prior to HSCT (92% vs. 50%; P = 0.065). None of the patients with detectable MRD (both BCR-ABL positive and negative) after HSCT survived 3 yr. CONCLUSION: Early MRD kinetics is an important tool for new prognostication models with direct clinical impact irrespective of standard prognostic factors in patients with BCR-ABL negative ALL.,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

RITs armed with Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) are undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. The current design of PE-based RITs joins an antibody fragment to the catalytic domain of PE using a polypeptide linker that is cleaved by the protease furin. Intracellular cleavage of native PE by furin is required for cytotoxicity, yet the PE cleavage site has been shown to be a poor furin substrate. Here we describe the rational design of more efficiently cleaved furin linkers in PE-based RITs, and experiments evaluating their effects on cleavage and cytotoxicity. We found that changes to the furin site could greatly influence both cleavage and cytotoxicity, but the two parameters were not directly correlated. Furthermore, the effects of alterations to the furin linker were not universal. Identical mutations in the anti-CD22 RIT HA22-LR often displayed different cytotoxicity from mutations in the anti-mesothelin RIT SS1-LR/GGS, underscoring the prominent role of the target site in their intoxication pathways. Combining several beneficial mutations in HA22-LR resulted in a variant (HA22-LR/FUR) with a remarkably enhanced cleavage rate and improved cytotoxicity against five B cell lines and similar or enhanced cytotoxicity in five out of six hairy cell leukemia patient samples. This result informs the design of protease-sensitive linkers and suggests that HA22-LR/FUR may be a candidate for further preclinical development.",,"['Weldon, John E', 'Skarzynski, Martin', 'Therres, Jamy A', 'Ostovitz, Joshua R', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Kreitman, Robert J', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Weldon JE', 'Skarzynski M', 'Therres JA', 'Ostovitz JR', 'Zhou H', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I']","['daggerDepartment of Biological Sciences, Jess and Mildred Fisher College of Science and Mathematics, Towson University, Towson, Maryland 21252, United States.', 'double daggerLaboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States.', 'double daggerLaboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Biological Sciences, Jess and Mildred Fisher College of Science and Mathematics, Towson University, Towson, Maryland 21252, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Biological Sciences, Jess and Mildred Fisher College of Science and Mathematics, Towson University, Towson, Maryland 21252, United States.', 'double daggerLaboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States.', 'double daggerLaboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States.', 'double daggerLaboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150603,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)', 'EC 3.4.21.75 (Furin)']",IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Bacterial Toxins/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Exotoxins/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Furin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Virulence Factors/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology']",,,2015/05/23 06:00,2016/03/15 06:00,['2015/05/22 06:00'],"['2015/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5b00190 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2015 Jun 17;26(6):1120-8. doi: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5b00190.

CONCLUSIONS: Although most toxic neuropathies are symmetrical axonal neuropathies, bortezomib is part of a small list of agents that may cause a demyelinating polyneuropathy and axonal degeneration.

Here, we identified Mtss1 expression to be increased in AML subsets with favorable outcome, while suppressed in high risk AML patients. High expression of MTSS1 predicted better clinical outcome of patients with normal-karyotype AML. Mechanistically, MTSS1 expression was negatively regulated by FLT3-ITD signaling but enhanced by the AML1-ETO fusion protein. DNMT3B, a negative regulator of MTSS1, showed strong binding to the MTSS1 promoter in PML-RARA positive but not AML1-ETO positive cells, suggesting that AML1-ETO leads to derepression of MTSS1. Pharmacological treatment of AML cell lines carrying the FLT3-ITD mutation with the specific FLT3 inhibitor PKC-412 caused upregulation of MTSS1. Moreover, treatment of acute promyelocytic cells (APL) with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) increased MTSS1 mRNA levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that MTSS1 might have a context-dependent function and could act as a tumor suppressor, which is pharmacologically targetable in AML patients.",,"['Schemionek, Mirle', 'Kharabi Masouleh, Behzad', 'Klaile, Yvonne', 'Krug, Utz', 'Hebestreit, Katja', 'Schubert, Claudia', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Wormann, Bernhard', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Koschmieder, Steffen']","['Schemionek M', 'Kharabi Masouleh B', 'Klaile Y', 'Krug U', 'Hebestreit K', 'Schubert C', 'Dugas M', 'Buchner T', 'Wormann B', 'Hiddemann W', 'Berdel WE', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Koschmieder S']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Urology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology, Pneumology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology, Pneumology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Membership of the German Society of Hematology and Oncology (DGHO), Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Clinical Cooperation Group Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Helmholtz Zentrum Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology, Pneumology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology, Pneumology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150521,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MTSS1 protein, human)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Microfilament Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2015/05/23 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/05/22 06:00'],"['2014/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0125783 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-49425 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 21;10(5):e0125783. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0125783. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4440712,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, less is known about whether specific methylation profiles characterize specific subcategories of AML. We examined this issue by using comprehensive high-throughput array-based relative methylation analysis (CHARM) to compare methylation profiles among patients in different AML cytogenetic risk groups. We found distinct profiles in each group, with the high-risk group showing overall increased methylation compared with low- and mid-risk groups. The differentially methylated regions (DMRs) distinguishing cytogenetic risk groups of AML were enriched in the CpG island shores. Specific risk-group associated DMRs were located near genes previously known to play a role in AML or other malignancies, such as MN1, UHRF1, HOXB3, and HOXB4, as well as TRIM71, the function of which in cancer is not well characterized. These findings were verified by quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing and by comparison with results available at the TCGA cancer genome browser. To explore the potential biological significance of the observed methylation changes, we correlated our findings with gene expression data available through the TCGA database. The results showed that decreased methylation at HOXB3 and HOXB4 was associated with increased gene expression of both HOXB genes specific to the mid-risk AML, while increased DNA methylation at DCC distinctive to the high-risk AML was associated with increased gene expression. Our results suggest that the differential impact of cytogenetic changes on AML prognosis may, in part, be mediated by changes in methylation.",,"['Qu, Xiaoyu', 'Davison, Jerry', 'Du, Liping', 'Storer, Barry', 'Stirewalt, Derek L', 'Heimfeld, Shelly', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Fang, Min']","['Qu X', 'Davison J', 'Du L', 'Storer B', 'Stirewalt DL', 'Heimfeld S', 'Estey E', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Fang M']","['a Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ; Seattle , WA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (HoxB3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'CHARM', 'CHARM, comprehensive high-throughput array-based relative methylation analysis', 'DMR', 'DMR, differentially methylated region', 'TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network', 'expression', 'methylation']",2015/05/23 06:00,2016/03/10 06:00,['2015/05/22 06:00'],"['2015/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15592294.2015.1048060 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2015;10(6):526-35. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2015.1048060.,"['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK056465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 DK106829/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4623036,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of the NRG1 (neuregulin1)-ERBB4 (v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4) signaling pathway has been shown to stimulate mature cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry and cell division. In this connection, we aimed to determine whether overexpression of ERBB4 in MSCs can enhance their cardio-protective effects following myocardial infarction. NRG1, MSCs or MSC-ERBB4 (MSC with ERBB4 overexpression), were transplanted into mice following myocardial infarction. Superior to that of MSCs and solely NRG1, MSC-ERBB4 transplantation significantly preserved heart functions accompanied with reduced infarct size, enhanced cardiomyocyte division and less apoptosis during early phase of infarction. The transduction of ERBB4 into MSCs indeed increased cell mobility and apoptotic resistance under hypoxic and glucose-deprived conditions via a PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the presence of NRG1. Unexpectedly, introduction of ERBB4 into MSC in turn potentiates NRG1 synthesis and secretion, thus forming a novel NRG1-ERBB4-NRG1 autocrine loop. Conditioned medium of MSC-ERBB4 containing elevated NRG1, promoted cardiomyocyte growth and division, whereas neutralization of NRG1 blunted this proliferation. These findings collectively suggest that ERBB4 overexpression potentiates MSC survival in the infarcted heart, enhances NRG1 generation to restore declining NRG1 in the infarcted region and stimulates cardiomyocyte division. ERBB4 has an important role in MSC-mediated myocardial repairs.",,"['Liang, X', 'Ding, Y', 'Zhang, Y', 'Chai, Y-H', 'He, J', 'Chiu, S-M', 'Gao, F', 'Tse, H-F', 'Lian, Q']","['Liang X', 'Ding Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Chai YH', 'He J', 'Chiu SM', 'Gao F', 'Tse HF', 'Lian Q']","['Department of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', '1] Department of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China [2] Organ Transplantation Institute, Xiamen University, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', '1] Department of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China [2] Organ Transplantation Institute, Xiamen University, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', '1] Department of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China [2] Research Centre of Heart, Brain, Hormone, and Healthy Aging, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China [3] Shenzhen Institutes of Research and Innovation, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China [4] Hong Kong-Guangdong Joint Laboratory on Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Hong Kong, China.', '1] Department of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China [2] Research Centre of Heart, Brain, Hormone, and Healthy Aging, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China [3] Shenzhen Institutes of Research and Innovation, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China [4] Hong Kong-Guangdong Joint Laboratory on Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Hong Kong, China [5] Department of Ophthalmology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150521,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Neuregulin-1)', '0 (Nrg1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Erbb4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-4)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myocardial Infarction/*pathology/therapy', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/metabolism', 'Neuregulin-1/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptor, ErbB-4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Wound Healing/physiology']",,,2015/05/23 06:00,2016/02/19 06:00,['2015/05/22 06:00'],"['2014/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201591 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.91 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 May 21;6:e1765. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2015.91.,,PMC4669719,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, CML patients develop IM-resistance, which has emerged as a significant clinical problem. Somatic mutations, especially T315I mutation, in BCR-ABL kinase domain represent the most common mechanism underlying drug resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), including imatinib. Thus, it is urgent to develop novel therapeutic strategies to overcome TKI-resistance. The anti-rheumatic gold (I) compound Auranofin (AF), was recently approved by US Food and Drug Administration for Phase II clinical trials to treat leukemia. In a recent study, we discovered that AF can selectively inhibit 19S proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (UCHL5 and USP14), which mediates its anticancer effects. More recently studies we have shown that AF inhibits the growth of both Bcr-Abl wild-type cells and IM-resistant Bcr-Abl-T315I mutation cells in vitro and in vivo. AF-induced Bcr-Abl down regulation is associated with diminished mRNA expression and caspase-dependent Bcr-Abl cleavage. More importantly, we unraveled that AF cytotoxicity is mediated by proteasome inhibition rather than previously suspected reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These findings support that AF overcomes IM-resistance through Bcr/Abl-dependent and -independent mechanisms, identifying a potentially new strategy for cancer treatment.",,"['Chen, Xin', 'Shi, Xianping', 'Wang, Xuejun', 'Liu, Jinbao']","['Chen X', 'Shi X', 'Wang X', 'Liu J']","['State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong 510182, China.', 'State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong 510182, China.', 'State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong 510182, China ; Division of Basic Biomedical Sciences, Sanford School of Medicine of the University of South Dakota, Vermillion, South Dakota 57069, USA.', 'State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Lab, Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong 510182, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Cell Microenviron,Cancer cell & microenvironment,101647794,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'CML', 'auranofin', 'imatinib resistance', 'proteasomal deubiquitinases', 'reactive oxygen species']",2015/05/23 06:00,2015/05/23 06:01,['2015/05/22 06:00'],"['2015/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.14800/ccm.415 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Cell Microenviron. 2014 Nov 1;1(6). doi: 10.14800/ccm.415.,"['R01 HL072166/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL085629/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4434598,['NIHMS689366'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent discovery that the first platelet-forming cells of the conceptus are not megakaryocytes (MKs) but diploid platelet-forming cells (DPFCs) revealed a previously unappreciated complexity in thrombopoiesis. This raises important questions, including the following. When do conventional MKs appear? Do pathogenic genetic lesions of adult MKs affect DPFCs? What role does myeloproliferative leukemia virus (MPL), a key regulator of adult megakaryopoiesis, play in prenatal platelet-forming lineages? We performed a comprehensive study to determine the spatial and temporal appearance of prenatal platelet-forming lineages. We demonstrate that DPFCs originate in the yolk sac and then rapidly migrate to other extra- and intraembryonic tissues. Using gene disruption models of Gata1 and Nfe2, we demonstrate that perturbing essential adult MK genes causes an analogous phenotype in the early embryo before the onset of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell-driven (definitive) hematopoiesis.

Still, the majority of patients who achieve a morphological CR will eventually relapse.

Over the last years, several methodologies, particularly multiparameter flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction, have emerged that can detect, quantify, and monitor submicroscopic amounts of leukemia cells (""minimal residual disease"", MRD). Newer techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, have not only changed our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and clonal heterogeneity of AML but may also be used for MRD detection. Increasing evidence indicates that MRD could play an important role in dynamically refining disease risk and, perhaps, serve to fine-tune post-remission therapy in a risk-adapted manner, although the latter concept awaits validation through well-controlled trials.

Treatment has been unified in the middle of 1980 in the Czech Republic. In 2002-2007 children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated in an international randomized trial ALL-IC BFM 2002 in the Czech Republic. 291 patients aged 1-18 years were enrolled; infants below 1 year entered a separate trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were stratified into three risk groups according to their age, initial leukocyte count, prednisone response, presence of fusion genes BCR/ABL or MLL/AF4, bone marrow D+15 and remission status D+33. The whole therapy took 24 months. Randomized late intensification compared standard BFM therapy with extended, usually more intensive experimental treatment. The median follow-up was 8.7 years.

These patients have an up to 10-fold increased risk of developing sepsis, which often leads to these patients being transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). The survival of neutropenic patients with sepsis in particular has improved in recent years, due to advanced therapy in intensive care (surviving sepsis campaign); however few large international studies of neutropenic cancer patients in the ICU are available. METHODS: In a retrospective study, 59 episodes of neutropenic cancer patients in the internal medicine ICU at the University Hospital of Cologne over a period of 2 years were analyzed. RESULTS: Pneumonia with or without sepsis are the main admission diagnoses of neutropenic cancer patients in the ICU. The mortality rate of these patients is very high (50.8 %). Pneumonia and sepsis, stem cell transplantation, mechanical ventilation, and acute renal failure with or without dialysis are correlated with mortality.

In order to establish immunophenotypic features that predict prognosis, the expression of single AML blast cell antigens has been evaluated with partly conflicting results; however, the influence of immunophenotypic blast maturity is largely unknown. In our study, 300 AML patients diagnosed at our institution between January 2003 and April 2012 were analyzed. A flow cytometric maturity score was developed in order to distinguish ""mature"" AML (AML-ma) from ""immature"" AML (AML-im) by quantitative expression levels of early progenitor cell antigens (CD34, CD117, and TdT). AML-ma showed significantly longer relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than AML-im (p < 0.001). Interestingly, statistically significant differences in RFS and OS were maintained within the ""intermediate-risk"" group according to ELN (RFS, 7.0 years (AML-ma) vs. 3.3 years (AML-im); p = 0.002; OS, 5.1 years (AML-ma) vs. 3.0 years (AML-im); p = 0.022). Our novel flow cytometric score easily determines AML blast maturity and can predict clinical outcome.

Although various recurrent somatic mutations of DNMT3A have been described, the most common mutation is located at R882 in the methyltransferase domain of the gene. Because of their prognostic significance and high stability during disease evolution, DNMT3A mutations might represent highly informative biomarkers for prognosis and outcome of disease. METHODS: We describe an allele-specific PCR with a Blocking reagent for the quantitative detection of DNMT3A R882H mutation providing the possibility to analyze the quantitative amount of mutation during the course of disease. Next, we analyzed 62 follow-up samples from 6 AML patients after therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). RESULTS: We developed an ASB-PCR assay for quantitative analysis of R882H DNMT3A mutation. After optimization of blocker concentration, a R882H-positive plasmid was constructed to enhance the accuracy of the sensitivity of quantitative detection. The assay displayed a high efficiency and sensitivity up to 10(-3). The reproducibility of assay analyzed using follow-up samples showed the standard deviation less than 3.1 %. This assay displayed a complete concordance with sequencing and endonuclease restriction analysis. We have found persistence of DNMT3A R882H mutations in complete remission (CR) after standard cytoreduction therapy that could be indicating presence of DNMT3A mutation in early pre-leukemic stem cells that resist chemotherapy. The loss of correlation between NPM1 and DNMT3A in CR could be associated with evolution of pre-leukemic and leukemic clones. In patients with CR with complete donor chimerism after alloSCT, we have found no DNMT3A R882H. In relapsed patients, all samples showed an increasing of both NPM1 and DNMT3A mutated alleles. This suggests at least in part the presence of NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations in the same cell clone. CONCLUSION: We developed a rapid and reliable method for quantitative detection of DNMT3A R882H mutations in AML patients. Quantitative detection of DNMT3A R882H mutations at different time points of AML disease enables screening of follow-up samples. This could provide additional information about the role of DNMT3A mutations in development and progression of AML.",,"['Berenstein, Rimma', 'Blau, Igor Wolfgang', 'Suckert, Nikola', 'Baldus, Claudia', 'Pezzutto, Antonio', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Blau, Olga']","['Berenstein R', 'Blau IW', 'Suckert N', 'Baldus C', 'Pezzutto A', 'Dorken B', 'Blau O']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University School of Medicine, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200, Berlin, Germany. rimma.berenstein@charite.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University School of Medicine, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200, Berlin, Germany. igor.blau@charite.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University School of Medicine, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200, Berlin, Germany. n.suckert@t-online.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University School of Medicine, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200, Berlin, Germany. claudia.baldus@charite.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University School of Medicine, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200, Berlin, Germany. antonio.pezzutto@charite.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University School of Medicine, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200, Berlin, Germany. bernd.doerken@charite.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University School of Medicine, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200, Berlin, Germany. olga.blau@charite.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150522,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods/standards', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin']",,,2015/05/23 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/05/22 06:00'],"['2015/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-015-0173-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-015-0173-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2015 May 22;34:55. doi: 10.1186/s13046-015-0173-2.,,PMC4443651,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also well established that signaling by TLRs results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). However, how these pro-inflammatory cytokines influence the virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell response during the TLR agonist stimulation remained largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of TLR-induced IL-6 in shaping virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in the Friend retrovirus (FV) mouse model. We show that the TLR agonist induced IL-6 counter-regulates effector CD8(+) T-cell responses. IL-6 potently inhibited activation and cytokine production of CD8(+) T cells in vitro. This effect was mediated by a direct stimulation of CD8(+) T cells by IL-6, which induced upregulation of STAT3 phosphorylation and SOCS3 and downregulated STAT4 phosphorylation and T-bet. Moreover, combining TLR stimulation and IL-6 blockade during an acute FV infection resulted in enhanced virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell immunity and better control of viral replication. These results have implications for our understanding of the role of TLR induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in regulating effector T cell responses and for the development of therapeutic strategies to overcome T cell dysfunction in chronic viral infections.",,"['Wu, Weimin', 'Dietze, Kirsten K', 'Gibbert, Kathrin', 'Lang, Karl S', 'Trilling, Mirko', 'Yan, Huimin', 'Wu, Jun', 'Yang, Dongliang', 'Lu, Mengji', 'Roggendorf, Michael', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Liu, Jia']","['Wu W', 'Dietze KK', 'Gibbert K', 'Lang KS', 'Trilling M', 'Yan H', 'Wu J', 'Yang D', 'Lu M', 'Roggendorf M', 'Dittmer U', 'Liu J']","['Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', '1] Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany [2] Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150521,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*agonists/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Virus Replication']",,,2015/05/23 06:00,2016/03/29 06:00,['2015/05/22 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['srep10501 [pii]', '10.1038/srep10501 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 May 21;5:10501. doi: 10.1038/srep10501.,,PMC4440206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, it has been reported that some of the signaling pathways in which environmental contaminants act in vivo are associated with innate immunity. Innate immunity recognizes ligands and induces inflammation. Those ligands are pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs: e.g., lipopolysaccharide) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs: e.g., cholesterol crystallization or uric acid crystal). Activation of innate immunity stimulates the acquired immunity system. Therefore, innate immunity regulates the strength of the general immune system. Furthermore, crystal silica, which is an environmental pollutant, activates innate immunity as a ligand. Innate immunity involves the membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLR) and cytoplasm-localized nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLR). We reported the innate immunity-system-related diseases such as Crohn's disease, Blau syndrome, myelogenous leukemia, and sarcoidosis. An inflammasome complex containing NLR has attracted attention owing to its correlation with the onset of several diseases. It is reported that the inflammasome activation is related to the development of lifestyle-related diseases such as myocardial infarction and fatty liver.

Inhibition of miR-195 prevents apoptosis in cardiomyocytes stimulated with palmitate and transgenic overexpression of miR-195 induces cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. We investigated whether silencing of miR-195 reduces diabetic cardiomyopathy in a mouse model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Type 1 diabetes was induced in C57BL/6 mice (male, 2 months old) by injections of STZ. RESULTS: MiR-195 expression was increased and levels of its target proteins (B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 and sirtuin 1) were decreased in STZ-induced type 1 and db/db type 2 diabetic mouse hearts. Systemically delivering an anti-miR-195 construct knocked down miR-195 expression in the heart, reduced caspase-3 activity, decreased oxidative stress, attenuated myocardial hypertrophy and improved myocardial function in STZ-induced mice with a concurrent upregulation of B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 and sirtuin 1. Diabetes reduced myocardial capillary density and decreased maximal coronary blood flow in mice. Knockdown of miR-195 increased myocardial capillary density and improved maximal coronary blood flow in diabetic mice. Upregulation of miR-195 sufficiently induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and attenuated the angiogenesis of cardiac endothelial cells in vitro.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total 60 patients were examined with GERD time-divided into 2 equal groups on the receiving PCT Leukemia over standard dose for at least one year. The first group consisted of 30 subjects with non-erosive GERD (NEGERD) endoscopically positive form receiving PCT. The second group consisted of 30 subjects with erosive form of GERD (EFGERD) receiving PCT. Patients underwent endoscopy, morphological and immunohistochemical examination of the esophageal mucosa to the definition expression of molecules PCNA, Bcl-2, neurokinin A, substance P and factor Nf-Kb. In patients with refractory form of GERD to proton pump inhibitors therapy (PPIs), additionally imposed ursodeoxycholic acid. THE RESULTS: Patients with NEGERD receiving PCT in 33.3% of cases formed refractory to PPIs form of the disease, when EFGERD refractoriness occurs in 46.7% of patients, which is associated with slowing the proliferation of epithelial cells of the esophagus due to decreased expression of PCNA. Reduced expression of neurokinin A in patients receiving PCT is associated with less activity and intensity of inflammation of esophageal mucosa. Against the background of a high degree of PCT expression of Bcl-2 and factor Nf-Kb, which may explain the frequent detection of atrophic and meta- plastic changes in the esophageal mucosa. Appointment of ursodeoxycholic acid in the complex therapy of GERD can overcome resistance to PPIs and improve the performance of cell renewal.

METHOD: Acute myelogenous leukemia stem cells were isolated by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS). The ability of LSC proliferation treated by various concentration of ASP(20-80 mg . L(-1)) in vitro for 48 hours were tested using cell counting Kit-8 ( CCK8) , colony forming were evaluated by methylcellulose CFU assay. The ultra structure changes of AML CD34+ CD38- cells were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The aging cells were detected with senescence-beta-galactosidase Kit staining. Expression of aging-related p53, p21, p16, Rb mRNA and P16, Rb, CDK4 and Cyclin E protein were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction( qRT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. RESULT: The purity of the CD34 + CD38 - cells is (91.15 +/- 2.41)% after sorted and showed good morphology. The proliferation of LSC was exhibited significantly concentration-dependent inhibited after exposure to various concentration of ASP. Treated by 40 mg . L(-1) ASP for 48 hours, the percentage of positive cells stained by SA-beta-Gal was dramatically increased (P < 0.01) and the colony-formed ability has been weakened (P < 0.01). The observation of ultrastructure showed that cell heterochromatin condensation and fragmentation, mitochondrial swelling, lysosomes increased in number. Aging-related p53, p21, p16, Rb and P16, Rb were up-regulated, protein regulatory cell-cycle CDK4 and Cyclin E were down-regulated.

The reported incidence of CLL involving the thyroid is extremely low, representing about 3-4% of all thyroid lymphoproliferative neoplasm. We report a rare case of CLL presenting initially in the thyroid gland. Systemic disease was detected as a result of thyroid investigation. An 85 years old woman, with multinodular goiter without adenophaties, was referred to our department, carrying a fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) report of a private institution referring ""lymphoid monomorphic proliferation"" and suggesting a ""Core-needle biopsy"" for further investigation. She was euthyroid (TSH-0.5 uU/mL (0.4-4.0), thyroid antibodies negative, including TRab). The patient denied systemic symptoms and at physical examination there were no adenophaties or organomegalies. FNAB analysis was repeated. Although the patient denied constitutional symptoms and there were no relevant findings in physical examination, technetium 99m thyroid gamagraphy (GG) and blood count were additionally asked. FNAB analysis concluded lymphocytic tiroiditis, but thyroid GG revelled global hypocaptation and blood count showed 173.4 x 109 leukocyte/L with 94% lymphocyte. An ecoguided FNAB with flow cytometry identified thyroid infiltration by monotonous population of blasts with phenotype consistent with CLL/malignancy of mature B-cells. CLL/malignancy of mature B-cells was also detected in peripheral blood analysis, suggesting systemic disease with secondary thyroid involvement. The patient started chemotherapy with rituximab and chlorambucil with good response. Pos-treatment GG revelled ""Increased levels of uptake in the middle third of the right lower lobe, with low uptake of the remaining parenchyma"". In conclusion, good communication with the pathologist can improve diagnostic accuracy and dictate appropriate therapy. The use of techniques such as flow cytometry, immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, and immunohistochemistry has improved diagnostic accuracy and obviated more invasive procedures, such as core needle or open surgery biopsy. Apart from chemotherapy, immunochemotherapy with anti-CD20 and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies can be used in the treatment of CLL.",,"['Goncalves, Ana', 'Vale, Sara', 'Nobre, Ema', 'Barbosa, Ana Paula', 'Piloto, Ema', 'Wessling, Ana', 'Mascarenhas, Mario']","['Goncalves A', 'Vale S', 'Nobre E', 'Barbosa AP', 'Piloto E', 'Wessling A', 'Mascarenhas M']","['Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, Hospital de Santa Maria, Brasil.', 'Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, Hospital de Santa Maria, Brasil.', 'Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, Hospital de Santa Maria, Brasil.', 'Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, Hospital de Santa Maria, Brasil.', 'Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, Hospital de Santa Maria, Brasil.', 'Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, Hospital de Santa Maria, Brasil.', 'Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, Hospital de Santa Maria, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20150401,Brazil,Arch Endocrinol Metab,Archives of endocrinology and metabolism,101652058,,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Rare Diseases', 'Thyroid Gland/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Thyroid Nodule/*etiology']",,,2015/05/23 06:00,2016/04/22 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S2359-39972015000200190 [pii]', '10.1590/2359-3997000000034 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Endocrinol Metab. 2015 Apr;59(2):190-4. doi: 10.1590/2359-3997000000034.

Thus, there is currently no convincing evidence that doxycycline reduces AAA expansion. Here, we critically review the available experimental and clinical information about the effects of doxycycline when used as a pharmacological treatment for AAA. The view that AAA can be considered an autoimmune disease and the observation that AAA tissue shows clonal expansion of T cells is placed in the light of the well-known inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by doxycycline. In T cell leukaemia animal models, this inhibitory effect of the antibiotic has been shown to impede T cell proliferation, resulting in complete tumour eradication. We suggest that the available evidence of doxycycline action on AAA is erroneously ascribed to its inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by competitive binding of the zinc ion co-factor. Although competitive binding may explain the inhibition of proteolytic activity, it does not explain the observed decreases of MMP mRNA levels. We propose that the observed effects of doxycycline are secondary to inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Provided that serum doxycycline levels are kept at adequate levels, the inhibition will result in a proliferation arrest, especially of clonally expanding T cells. This, in turn, leads to the decrease of proinflammatory cytokines that are normally generated by these cells. The drastic change in cell type composition may explain the changes in MMP mRNA and protein levels in the tissue samples.",,"['Kroon, Albert M', 'Taanman, Jan-Willem']","['Kroon AM', 'Taanman JW']","['Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Institute of Neurology, University College London, London NW3 2PF, UK. amk@keab.nl.', 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Institute of Neurology, University College London, London NW3 2PF, UK. j.taanman@ucl.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150518,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/chemistry/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['T cells', 'abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)', 'clonal expansion', 'doxycycline', 'drug target', 'matrix metalloproteinases', 'mitochondrial protein synthesis']",2015/05/21 06:00,2016/02/19 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms160511178 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms160511178 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2015 May 18;16(5):11178-95. doi: 10.3390/ijms160511178.,,PMC4463695,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only one new drug (ruxolitinib) has been approved during the past 40 years, and, although promising new therapies are evaluated, the armamentarium to treat MPN still relies on conventional drugs, like cytotoxic agents and anagrelide. The exact role of interferon (IFN) alfa still needs to be clarified in randomized studies, although it has been shown to be effective in MPNs for more than 25 years. The current therapeutic strategy for MPNs is based on the risk of vascular complication, which is the main cause of mortality and mortality in the medium term. However, the long-term outcome may be different, with an increasing risk of transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia during follow-up times.

Morphologically, transformation from CP-CML to AP/BP-CML is characterized by a progressive or sudden loss of differentiation. Multiple different somatic mutations have been implicated in transformation from CP-CML to AP/BC-CML, but no characteristic mutation or combination of mutations have emerged. Gene expression profiles of AP-CML and BP-CML are similar, consistent with biphasic evolution at the molecular level. Gene expression of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant CP-CML and second CP-CML resemble AP/BP-CML, suggesting that morphology alone is a poor predictor of biologic behavior. At the clinical level, progression to AP/BP-CML or resistance to first-line TKI therapy distinguishes a good risk condition with survival close to the general population from a disease likely to reduce survival. Progression while receiving TKI therapy is frequently caused by mutations in the target kinase BCR-ABL1, but progression may occur in the absence of explanatory BCR-ABL1 mutations, suggesting involvement of alternative pathways. Identifying patients in whom milestones of TKI response fail to occur or whose disease progress while receiving therapy requires appropriate molecular monitoring. Selection of salvage TKI depends on prior TKI history, comorbidities, and BCR-ABL1 mutation status. Despite the introduction of novel TKIs, therapy of AP/BP-CML remains challenging and requires accepting modalities with substantial toxicity, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).",,"['Deininger, Michael W']",['Deininger MW'],"['From the Huntsman Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

The standard management approach is careful observation, irrespective of risk factors unless patients meet the International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) criteria for ""active disease,"" which requires treatment. The initial standard therapy for most patients combines an anti-CD20 antibody (such as rituximab, ofatumumab, or obinutuzumab) with chemotherapy (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide [FC], bendamustine, or chlorambucil) depending on multiple factors including the physical fitness of the patient. However, patients with very high-risk CLL because of a 17p13 deletion (17p-) with or without mutation of TP53 (17p-/TP53mut) have poor responses to chemoimmunotherapy and require alternative treatment regimens containing B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway inhibitors. The BCR signaling pathway inhibitors (ibrutinib targeting Bruton's tyrosine kinase [BTK] and idelalisib targeting phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase delta [PI3K-delta], respectively) are currently approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL and all patients with 17p- (ibrutinib), and in combination with rituximab for relapsed/refractory patients (idelalisib). These agents offer great efficacy, even in chemotherapy refractory CLL, with increased tolerability, safety, and survival. Ongoing studies aim to determine the best therapy combinations with the goal of achieving long-term disease control and the possibility of developing a curative regimen for some patients. CLL is associated with a wide range of infectious, autoimmune, and malignant complications. These complications result in considerable morbidity and mortality that can be minimized by early detection and aggressive management.

When activated by high concentrations of ATP (i.e., at inflammation sites), this receptor is capable of forming a pore that allows molecules of up to 900 Da to pass through. This receptor is upregulated in several diseases, particularly leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. A selective antagonist of this receptor could be useful in the treatment of P2X7R activation-related diseases. In the present study, we have evaluated several parameters using in vitro protocols to validate a high-throughput screening (HTS) method to identify P2X7R antagonists. We generated dose-response curves to determine the EC50 value of the known agonist ATP and the ICs50 values for the known antagonists Brilliant Blue G (BBG) and oxidized ATP (OATP).

Previous trials have shown conflicting results concerning the efficacy of high or low doses of daunorubicin to induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to resolve this controversial issue. We compared the efficacy and safety of high doses of daunorubicin (HD-DNR) and traditional low doses of daunorubicin (LD-DNR) or idarubicin (IDA) during induction therapy of newly diagnosed AML. Data of 3,824 patients from 1,796 articles in the literature were retrieved and six randomized controlled trials were analyzed. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and event-free survival (EFS). The secondary outcomes included complete remission (CR), relapse, and toxicity.

Leukemia has the highest incidence, followed by tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and lymphomas (Hodgkin lymphoma, HL, and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, NHL). Spatial distribution of childhood cancer cases has been under concern with the aim of identifying potential risk factors. OBJECTIVE: The two objectives are to study overall spatial clustering and cluster detection of cases of the three main childhood cancer causes, looking to increase etiological knowledge. METHODS: We ran a case-control study. The cases were children aged 0 to 14 diagnosed with leukemia, lymphomas (HL and NHL) or CNS neoplasm in five Spanish regions for the period 1996-2011. As a control group, we used a sample from the Birth Registry matching every case by year of birth, autonomous region of residence and sex with six controls. We geocoded and validated the address of the cases and controls. For our two objectives we used two different methodologies. For the first, for overall spatial clustering detection, we used the differences of K functions from the spatial point patterns perspective proposed by Diggle and Chetwynd and the second, for cluster detection, we used the spatial scan statistic proposed by Kulldorff with a level for statistical significance of 0.05. RESULTS: We had 1062 cases of leukemia, 714 cases of CNS, 92 of HL and 246 of NHL. Accordingly we had 6 times the number of controls, 6372 controls for leukemia, 4284 controls for CNS, 552 controls for HL and 1476 controls for NHL. We found variations in the estimated empirical D(s) for the different regions and cancers, including some overall spatial clustering for specific regions and distances. We did not find statistically significant clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The variations in the estimated empirical D(s) for the different regions and cancers could be partially explained by the differences in the spatial distribution of the population; however, according to the literature, we cannot discard environmental hazards or infections agents in the etiology of these cancers.",,"['Ramis, Rebeca', 'Gomez-Barroso, Diana', 'Tamayo, Ibon', 'Garcia-Perez, Javier', 'Morales, Antonio', 'Pardo Romaguera, Elena', 'Lopez-Abente, Gonzalo']","['Ramis R', 'Gomez-Barroso D', 'Tamayo I', 'Garcia-Perez J', 'Morales A', 'Pardo Romaguera E', 'Lopez-Abente G']","['Environmental Epidemiology and Cancer Unit, National Centre for Epidemiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III - ISCIII, Madrid, Spain; Consortium for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology & Public Health (CIBER en Epidemiologia y Salud Publica-CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Consortium for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology & Public Health (CIBER en Epidemiologia y Salud Publica-CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Consortium for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology & Public Health (CIBER en Epidemiologia y Salud Publica-CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain; Public Health Division of Gipuzkoa, BIODonostia Research Institute, Department of Health of the regional Government of the Basque Country, Donostia, Spain.', 'Environmental Epidemiology and Cancer Unit, National Centre for Epidemiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III - ISCIII, Madrid, Spain; Consortium for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology & Public Health (CIBER en Epidemiologia y Salud Publica-CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Rare Disease Research Institute (Instituto de Investigacion de Enfermedades Raras-IIER), Instituto de Salud Carlos III - ISCIII, Madrid, Spain; Consortium for Biomedical Research in Rare Diseases (Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras-CIBERER), Madrid, Spain.', 'Registro Espanol de Tumores Infantiles (RETI-SEHOP), Universidad de Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Environmental Epidemiology and Cancer Unit, National Centre for Epidemiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III - ISCIII, Madrid, Spain; Consortium for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology & Public Health (CIBER en Epidemiologia y Salud Publica-CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150520,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Spain/epidemiology', '*Spatial Analysis']",,,2015/05/21 06:00,2016/04/19 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0127273 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-01646 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 20;10(5):e0127273. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0127273. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4439051,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-2 is of considerable therapeutic interest, but harnessing its actions in a controllable manner remains a challenge. Previously, we have engineered an IL-2 ""superkine"" with enhanced affinity for IL-2Rbeta. Here, we describe next-generation IL-2 variants that function as ""receptor signaling clamps."" They retained high affinity for IL-2Rbeta, inhibiting binding of endogenous IL-2, but their interaction with gammac was weakened, attenuating IL-2Rbeta-gammac heterodimerization. These IL-2 analogs acted as partial agonists and differentially affected lymphocytes poised at distinct activation thresholds. Moreover, one variant, H9-RETR, antagonized IL-2 and IL-15 better than blocking antibodies against IL-2Ralpha or IL-2Rbeta.

We studied the association between genetic polymorphisms of estrogen metabolism and EAL. Using data from the Brazilian Collaborative Study Group of Infant Acute Leukemia (2000-2012), 350 cases and 404 age-matched controls and 134 mothers of cases and controls were genotyped to explore polymorphisms in genes of the estrogen metabolism pathway: CYP1B1 (c.1294C>G, rs1056836), CYP3A4 (c.-392A>G, rs2740574), CYP3A5 (c.219-237G>A, rs776746), GSTM1/GSTT1 deletions, and SULT1A1 (c.638G>A, rs9282861; and c.667A>G, rs1801030). Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) by ethnicity. Because of multiple testing, p values < 0.01 were significant after Bonferroni correction. SULT1A1 (c.638G>A) was associated to infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) risk in males (additive model: aOR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.29-0.95, p = 0.03; dominant model: aOR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.17-4.05, p = 0.01, respectively). CYP1B1 polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk of AML either for non-white or female children (additive model: OR = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.08-0.76, p < 0.01; additive model: aOR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08-0.89, p = 0.03, respectively). Since polymorphisms of Cytochrome P450 genes presented gender-specific risk associations, we also investigated their expression. CYP1B1 was not expressed in 57.1% of EAL cases, and its expression varied by genotype, gender, and leukemia subtype. Maternal-fetal GSTT1 null genotype was associated with risk of EAL. This study shows that polymorphisms in genes of estrogen metabolism confer genetic susceptibility to EAL, mainly in males, and maternal susceptibility genes modify the risk for developing EAL in newborns.",,"['Lopes, Bruno Almeida', 'Emerenciano, Mariana', 'Goncalves, Bruno Alves Aguiar', 'Vieira, Tallita Meciany', 'Rossini, Ana', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['Lopes BA', 'Emerenciano M', 'Goncalves BA', 'Vieira TM', 'Rossini A', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150518,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1B1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.8.2.1 (Arylsulfotransferase)', 'EC 2.8.2.1 (SULT1A1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Arylsulfotransferase/*genetics', 'Brazil/ethnology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1/*genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/ethnology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/*genetics', 'Sex Factors']",,,2015/05/21 06:00,2016/04/15 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0127308 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-04522 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 18;10(5):e0127308. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0127308. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4436276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that if an efficient immune response against mutated nucleophosmin can be induced in vivo, the individuals expressing HLA alleles suitable for presenting NPM-derived peptides should be less prone to developing AML associated with NPM1 mutation. We thus compared HLA class I frequencies in a cohort of patients with mutated NPM1 (63 patients, NPMc+), a cohort of patients with wild-type NPM1 (94 patients, NPMwt) and in normal individuals (large datasets available from Allele Frequency Net Database). Several HLA allelic groups were found to be depleted in NPMc+ patients, but not in NPMwt compared to the normal distribution. The decrease was statistically significant for HLA B(*)07, B(*)18, and B(*)40. Furthermore, statistically significant advantage in the overall survival was found for patients with mutated NPM1 expressing at least one of the depleted allelic groups. The majority of the depleted alleles were predicted to bind potent NPM-derived immunopeptides and, importantly, these peptides were often located in the unmutated part of the protein.

AIMS: To investigate the phenotype in ALL in our demographic population and to prognosticate various upfront current protocols employed in our hospital. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study spanned over a period of 4 years with retrospective and prospective data of January 2008 through December 2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 159 patients of all age groups were enrolled for the study, of which flow cytometry was done in 144 patients. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Analysis was done using the variables on SPSS (statistical package for social sciences) software on computer. Survival curves were estimated by method of Kaplan-Meir. RESULTS: Majority of the patients were of B-cell (68.1%) and 30.6% patients were of T-cell lineage. Of these, 80.6% patients were having cALLa positivity. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 59.1%, 16.4% relapsed, and 20.1% patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotyping has become an important and integral part of diagnosis, classification, management and prognosticating in ALL.

Thymidine kinase-1 (TK-1) is expressed in proliferating cells so elevated TK-1 indicates active tumor growth. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical significance of TK-1 in children with ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out on 40 children with newly diagnosed ALL who were admitted to Oncology Unit, Pediatric department, Tanta University (26 males and 14 females) with their ages ranged from 4 to 10 years and 30 healthy children of matched age and sex as a control group. For all patients the following were done: Complete blood picture, bone marrow examination, immunophenotyping and TK-1 serum levels. RESULTS: Mean TK-1 level was significantly higher in patients at diagnosis than controls and significantly higher in patients with unfavorable outcome than patients with favorable outcome. Mean TK-1 level was significantly higher in patients in relapse than patients in remission and controls. No significant differences in mean TK-1 level between patients in remission and controls. There were statistically significant differences in disease free survival and overall survival between patients with favorable and unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION: From this study we concluded that TK is a helpful marker in diagnosis and follow-up of patients with ALL. RECOMMENDATIONS: Thymidine kinase-1 should be routinely assessed at diagnosis and during follow-up in ALL patients for better diagnostic and prognostic assessment and should be taken in consideration in designing future therapeutic strategies based on patients-specific risk factors.",,"['Hagag, Adel A', 'Saad, Mohamed A', 'Mohamed, Sohair A']","['Hagag AA', 'Saad MA', 'Mohamed SA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,South Asian J Cancer,South Asian journal of cancer,101618774,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia-childhood malignancies', 'Risk stratification of ALL', 'thymidine kinase 1']",2015/05/21 06:00,2015/05/21 06:01,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2278-330X.155675 [doi]', 'SAJC-4-72 [pii]']",ppublish,South Asian J Cancer. 2015 Apr-Jun;4(2):72-4. doi: 10.4103/2278-330X.155675.,,PMC4418086,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An obstacle in the diagnosis and outcome of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,68-71,10.4103/2278-330X.155648 [doi],"CONTEXT: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) ranks first among pediatric malignancies. 8-12% of ALL present with pancytopenia and 2% with hypocellular marrow a. Diagnosis of ALL in the background of pancytopenia and aplastic bone marrow is difficult. AIMS: This study was aimed to compare the clinicopathologic, genetic, and outcome of paediatric ALL patients with and without pancytopenia. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included all ALL patients presenting with pancytopenia. The control group included equal number of randomly selected patients with ALL without pancytopenia treated during the same period. Ethics committee approved this study. The demographic, laboratory, and treatment-related details were retrieved from the records and entered in an Excel sheet. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data was analyzed with Chi-square test with IBM SPSS statistics 16 software. RESULTS: Diagnosis by peripheral smear is significantly lower (P = 0.015) in comparison with the control group. There is no significant difference in diagnosis between the groups by bone marrow aspirate (P = 0.731) and biopsy (P = 0.849). The diagnosis of leukemia is misdiagnosed as hypo cellular/aplastic marrow in 10% of the pancytopenic patients. Flow cytometry yielded the diagnosis in all the pancytopenic patients. Though cytogenetic abnormalities are more common in pancytopenic group, it is not statistically significant (P = 0.106). There is no significant difference in treatment outcome between the groups (P = 0.0827%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical expertise is highly essential to evaluate a case of pancytopenia to diagnose leukemia. Pancytopenia is an obstacle in the diagnosis of ALL without immunophenotyping. There is no significant difference in the outcome between the two groups.",,"['Raja, Shruti', 'Suman, Febe Renjitha', 'Scott, Julius Xavier', 'Latha, M S', 'Rajenderan, Aruna', 'Ethican, Abhirami']","['Raja S', 'Suman FR', 'Scott JX', 'Latha MS', 'Rajenderan A', 'Ethican A']","['Department of Pathology and Paediatric Haematology Oncology, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pathology and Paediatric Haematology Oncology, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pathology and Paediatric Haematology Oncology, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pathology and Paediatric Haematology Oncology, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pathology and Paediatric Haematology Oncology, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pathology and Paediatric Haematology Oncology, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,South Asian J Cancer,South Asian journal of cancer,101618774,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'pancytopenia', 'pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2015/05/21 06:00,2015/05/21 06:01,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2278-330X.155648 [doi]', 'SAJC-4-68 [pii]']",ppublish,South Asian J Cancer. 2015 Apr-Jun;4(2):68-71. doi: 10.4103/2278-330X.155648.,,PMC4418085,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The FLT3 gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a key role in controlling survival, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Mutations in this gene are critical in causing a deregulation of the delicate balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. In this review, we provide an update on the structure, synthesis and activation of the FLT3 receptor and the subsequent activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways.

To examine whether occurrences of MLL1 morphemes in genomic DNA may influence codon utilization, we analyzed the frequency of various 9-mers in human cDNAs and in total human genomic DNA. We uncovered preferential utilization of GGC for Gly, GCG for Ala, CCG for Pro, and TCG for Ser, in coding sequences (CDSs) that included MLL1 morphemes. We also examined weighted occurrences of CDS 9-mers in a 30-base window that moved along each human chromosome. In plots, we observed peaks with fluctuating intensities. High intensity peaks appeared within promoter and exons localized in CpG islands, encompassing sequences that included MLL1 morphemes. High intensity peaks included CCG/GGC repeats, whose expansion may cause neurological disorders and congenital malformations. Such repeats are generated from overlap of a morpheme (CGCCG/CGGCG), which depending on reading frame and orientation would produce runs of Ala, Gly, or Pro in proteins. Overall, our results point to a role for morpheme occurrences on synonymous codon utilization in human genomic DNA and indicate that regulatory instructions are dispersed not only in promoters but also in exons of human genes.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Bina, Minou', 'Wyss, Phillip']","['Bina M', 'Wyss P']","['Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907.', 'Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biopolymers,Biopolymers,0372525,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Codon/*genetics', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['CCG/GGC repeats', 'MLL', 'alanine tracts', 'codes in human DNA, codon bias', 'gene regulation', 'genomic DNA', 'glycine tracts', 'polyalanine expansion', 'proline tracts']",2015/05/21 06:00,2016/05/24 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bip.22681 [doi]'],ppublish,Biopolymers. 2015 Sep;103(9):480-90. doi: 10.1002/bip.22681.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these B cells, an archetypical clonotypic set that recognizes phosphorylcholine (PC) antigens and produces anti-PC IgM, first implicated for roles in microbial protection, was later found to become expanded in hyperlipidemic mice and in response to an increased in vivo burden of apoptotic cells. These IgM natural antibodies can enhance clearance of damaged cells and induce intracellular blockade of inflammatory signaling cascades. In clinical populations, raised levels of anti-PC IgM correlate with protection from atherosclerosis and may also downmodulate the severity of autoimmune disease. Human anti-PC-producing clones without hypermutation have been isolated that can similarly discriminate apoptotic from healthy cells. An independent report on unrelated adults has described anti-PC-producing B cells with IgM genes that have conserved CDR3 motifs, similar to stereotypic clonal sets of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Taken together, emerging evidence suggests that, despite the capacity to form an effectively limitless range of Ig receptors, the human immune system may often recurrently generate lymphocytes expressing structurally convergent B cell receptors with protective and homeostatic roles.",['(c) 2015 New York Academy of Sciences.'],"['Silverman, Gregg J']",['Silverman GJ'],"['Departments of Medicine and Pathology, NYU School of Medicine, Alexandria Center for Life Science, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150518,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,['0 (Autoantibodies)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Autoantibodies/chemistry/*genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Secondary']",['NOTNLM'],"['B cell', 'apoptotic cell', 'apoptotic clearance', 'immunoregulation', 'natural antibody']",2015/05/21 06:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/nyas.12788 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2015 Dec;1362:164-75. doi: 10.1111/nyas.12788.

However, the primary endpoints in several clinical trials of enzastaurin were not met, and thrombosis was reported as an adverse effect in some trials. While investigating the role of PKC in regulating growth factor release from platelets, we found that, unlike other PKC inhibitors, enzastaurin may potentiate platelet aggregation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of enzastaurin on platelet aggregation, growth factor secretion from alpha-granules and cancer cell apoptosis in the presence of platelets. METHODS: Prostacyclin-washed platelets and platelet-rich plasma were isolated from the blood of healthy human volunteers. Platelet light-aggregometry was performed in the presence and absence of enzastaurin and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). P-selectin was measured by flow cytometry, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release was measured by ELISA. A549 lung carcinoma cells were treated with releasates from enzastaurin-titrated platelets. A cell death ELISA was performed to measure A549 apoptosis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Enzastaurin (10(-8) -10(-6) m) potentiated aggregation of prostacyclin-washed platelets and caused an increase in VEGF release from alpha-granules that, in turn, promoted cancer cell survival. In platelet-rich plasma, 10(-6) m enzastaurin inhibited platelet aggregation, but not 10(-7) m enzastaurin, which also failed to suppress VEGF secretion. ASA abrogated enzastaurin-potentiated washed-platelet aggregation and VEGF release. These findings indicate that, at high plasma protein-free drug concentrations, enzastaurin potentiates platelet aggregation and growth factor secretion, an effect that may counteract its anticancer activity. ASA nullifies this effect.",['(c) 2015 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.'],"['Lesyk, G', 'Fong, T', 'Ruvolo, P P', 'Jurasz, P']","['Lesyk G', 'Fong T', 'Ruvolo PP', 'Jurasz P']","['Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Cardiovascular Research Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Leukemia Research, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Cardiovascular Research Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150617,England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'UC96G28EQF (enzastaurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*toxicity', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Platelet Aggregation/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C beta/antagonists & inhibitors/blood', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Secretory Vesicles/drug effects/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['drug therapy', 'neoplasms', 'pharmacology', 'platelet aggregation', 'vascular endothelial growth factor A']",2015/05/21 06:00,2016/06/10 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jth.13010 [doi]'],ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2015 Aug;13(8):1514-20. doi: 10.1111/jth.13010.

Thus, it is hardly surprising that miRNAs are globally repressed in AML, a disease mainly characterized by a block in cellular myeloid differentiation. Studies investigating the mechanisms for low miRNA expression in AML has mostly focused on altered transcriptional regulation or deletions, whereas defective miRNA processing has received less attention. In this study, we report that the expression of the key miRNA processing enzyme DICER1 is down-regulated in primary AML patient samples and healthy CD34(+) progenitor cells as compared with granulocytes. In line with these findings, Dicer1 expression was induced significantly in AML cell lines upon neutrophil differentiation. The knocking down of DICER1 in AML cells significantly attenuated neutrophil differentiation, which was paralleled by decreased expression of miRNAs involved in this process. Moreover, we found that inhibiting DICER1 attenuated the activation of autophagy, a cellular recycling process that is needed for proper neutrophil differentiation of AML cells. Our results clearly indicate that DICER1 plays a novel role in neutrophil differentiation as well as in myeloid autophagy of AML cells.",['(c) Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Wampfler, Julian', 'Federzoni, Elena A', 'Torbett, Bruce E', 'Fey, Martin F', 'Tschan, Mario P']","['Wampfler J', 'Federzoni EA', 'Torbett BE', 'Fey MF', 'Tschan MP']","['*Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, and Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, Switzerland; Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA; and Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', '*Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, and Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, Switzerland; Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA; and Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', '*Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, and Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, Switzerland; Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA; and Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', '*Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, and Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, Switzerland; Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA; and Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', '*Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, and Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, Switzerland; Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA; and Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland mario.tschan@pathology.unibe.ch.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150519,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (DICER1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (Ribonuclease III)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['*Autophagy/drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease III/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'RNAi', 'processing machinery']",2015/05/21 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.1AB0514-258R [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1AB0514-258R [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2015 Sep;98(3):357-63. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1AB0514-258R.

Garenoxacin, a fluoroquinolone developed in Japan, shows a stronger in vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria than levofloxacin. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed high-risk patients with acute myeloid leukemia who were administered garenoxacin (n = 36) or levofloxacin (n = 120) during chemotherapy. We compared the profiles of infections between these fluoroquinolones. RESULTS: Febrile events occurred in 31 (86%) and 93 (78%) cases in the garenoxacin and levofloxacin group, respectively (P = 0.35). Bloodstream infections by Gram-positive bacteria were recorded in one (3%) case in the garenoxacin group and 25 (21%) cases in the levofloxacin group (P < 0.01). In contrast, bloodstream infections by Gram-negative microorganisms were identified in five (4%) cases in the levofloxacin group and eight (22%) cases in the garenoxacin group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that there may be substantial differences in the antimicrobial spectrum between different fluoroquinolones. Although there are several biases due to rather small sample size and the retrospective nature, we should take the differences into consideration when we administer a prophylactic fluoroquinolone to a patient with hematological disease.","['(c) The Author 2015.

The purpose of this study is to quantify the radiation dose to the patient and interventional radiologist during percutaneous cryoablation of renal masses using CT fluoroscopic guidance. METHODS: Over a 1-year period, the CT fluoroscopy time during percutaneous cryoablation of renal masses was recorded in 41 patients. The level of complexity of each procedure was designated as simple, intermediate, or complex. Patient organ radiation doses were estimated using an anthropomorphic model. Dose to the interventional radiologist was estimated using ion chamber survey meters. RESULTS: The average CT fluoroscopy time for technically simple cases was 47 s, 126 s for intermediate cases, and 264 s for complex cases. The relative risk of hematologic stomach and liver malignancy in patients undergoing this procedure was 1.003-1.074. The lifetime attributable risk of cancer ranged from 2 to 58, with the highest risk in younger patients for developing leukemia. The estimated radiation dose to the interventionalist without lead shielding was 390 mR (3.9 mGy) per year of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The radiation risk to the patient during CT fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous renal mass cryoablation is, as expected, related to procedure complexity. Quantification of patient organ radiation dose was estimated using an anthropomorphic model. This information, along with the associated relative risk of malignancy, may assist in evaluating risks of the procedure, particularly in younger patients. The radiation dose to the interventionist is low regardless of procedure complexity, but highlights the importance of lead shielding.",,"['Stewart, Jessica K', 'Looney, Christopher B', 'Anderson-Evans, Colin D', 'Toncheva, Greta I', 'Sopko, David R', 'Kim, Charles Y', 'Yoshizumi, Terry T', 'Nelson, Rendon C']","['Stewart JK', 'Looney CB', 'Anderson-Evans CD', 'Toncheva GI', 'Sopko DR', 'Kim CY', 'Yoshizumi TT', 'Nelson RC']","['Department of Radiology, Duke University Hospital, Box 3808, DUMC, Durham, NC, 27710, USA. jessica.stewart@dm.duke.edu.', 'Department of Radiology, Duke University Hospital, Box 3808, DUMC, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Duke University Hospital, Box 3808, DUMC, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Duke University Hospital, Box 3808, DUMC, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Duke University Hospital, Box 3808, DUMC, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Duke University Hospital, Box 3808, DUMC, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Duke University Hospital, Box 3808, DUMC, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Duke University Hospital, Box 3808, DUMC, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Abdom Imaging,Abdominal imaging,9303672,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cryosurgery', 'Female', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Humans', 'Kidney/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Radiation Dosage', '*Radiography, Interventional', 'Risk', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['CT fluoroscopy', 'Cryoablation', 'Radiation dose']",2015/05/21 06:00,2016/07/12 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00261-015-0456-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00261-015-0456-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Abdom Imaging. 2015 Oct;40(7):2606-12. doi: 10.1007/s00261-015-0456-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: RT-PCR, Q-PCR, western blotting and whole-cell patch-clamp recording were employed to assess the expression of T-type Ca(2+) channels in leukemia cell lines. The function of T-type Ca(2+) channels in leukemia cell growth and the possible mechanism of the effect of T-type Ca(2+) channel antagonists on cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined in T-lymphoma cell lines. RESULTS: We show that leukemia cell lines exhibited reduced cell growth when treated with T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitors, mibefradil and NNC-55-0396 in a concentration-dependent manner. Mechanistically, these inhibitors played a dual role on cell viability: (i) blunting proliferation, through a halt in the progression to the G1-S phase; and (ii) promoting cell apoptosis, partially dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release. In addition, we observed a reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MOLT-4 cells in response to mibefradil and NNC-55-0396 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that mibefradil and NNC-55-0396 regulate proliferation and apoptosis in T-type Ca(2+) channel expressing leukemia cell lines and suggest a potential therapeutic target for leukemia.",,"['Huang, Weifeng', 'Lu, Chunjing', 'Wu, Yong', 'Ouyang, Shou', 'Chen, Yuanzhong']","['Huang W', 'Lu C', 'Wu Y', 'Ouyang S', 'Chen Y']","[""Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, 350004, People's Republic of China. hwf0625@163.com."", ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Xiamen, Xiamen, 361003, People's Republic of China. 272828086@qq.com."", ""Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, 350004, People's Republic of China. wuyong9195@126.com."", ""Xiamen Medical Research Institute, Xiamen, 361008, People's Republic of China. xmmri@xmu.edu.cn."", ""Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, 350004, People's Republic of China. chenyz@mail.fjmu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150521,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Calcium Channels, T-Type)', '0 (Cyclopropanes)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0A7CE46ERM (NNC 55-0396)', '27B90X776A (Mibefradil)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels, T-Type/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclopropanes/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mibefradil/*pharmacology', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology']",,,2015/05/21 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-015-0171-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-015-0171-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2015 May 21;34:54. doi: 10.1186/s13046-015-0171-4.,,PMC4443536,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study characterised body composition using different methodologies and explored associations with reduced insulin sensitivities in a group of ALL survivors treated with/without HSCT/TBI. PROCEDURE: Survivors of childhood ALL treated with HSCT/TBI (n = 20,10 M) were compared with Chemotherapy-only (n = 31), and an obese non-leukaemic controls (n = 30). All subjects (aged 16-26 years) were investigated with: auxology (BMI, waist and hip circumferences), DEXA (total and regional fat, fat-free mass), abdominal MRI (subcutaneous, visceral, intramuscular fat), oral glucose tolerance tests (impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, insulin sensitivity) and serum adiponectin. RESULTS: HSCT/TBI Group displayed a higher prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (45%); lower insulin sensitivity; lower lean mass with higher prevalence of reduced fat-free mass index (from DEXA); higher visceral and intramuscular, and lower subcutaneous fat on MRI, compared with the Chemotherapy-only and Obese controls. BMI was lowest in HSCT/TBI Group. Waist-to-hip and android-to-gynoid ratios were similar between HSCT/TBI and Obese Groups. Insulin sensitivity adjusted for visceral fat mass was lower in the HSCT/TBI than the Chemotherapy-only and Obese groups. Adiponectin in the HSCT/TBI Group was lower than the Chemotherapy-only group, and correlated negatively with time post HSCT/TBI. CONCLUSIONS: HSCT/TBI survivors have an increased risk of abnormal glucose tolerance and reduced insulin sensitivity with reduced subcutaneous and increased visceral fat distribution, increased total fat mass and reduced lean mass.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Wei, Christina', 'Thyagiarajan, Manigandan S', 'Hunt, Linda P', 'Shield, Julian P H', 'Stevens, Michael C G', 'Crowne, Elizabeth C']","['Wei C', 'Thyagiarajan MS', 'Hunt LP', 'Shield JP', 'Stevens MC', 'Crowne EC']","['Department of Paediatric Endocrinology & Diabetes, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, UK.', 'St. Georges Hospital, St. Georges Health Care NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', ""Department of Paediatric Radiology, Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK."", 'School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Endocrinology & Diabetes, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, UK.', 'Bristol Biomedical Research Unit in Nutrition, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Endocrinology & Diabetes, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20150519,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['*Adiposity', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Insulin Resistance', '*Lipodystrophy/mortality/pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Risk Factors', '*Sarcopenia/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', '*Survivors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",['NOTNLM'],"['haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'impaired glucose tolerance', 'insulin sensitivity', 'lipodystrophy', 'sarcopenia', 'total body irradiation']",2015/05/21 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/05/21 06:00'],"['2015/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25601 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Nov;62(11):1992-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25601.

We aimed to investigate this association, exploring the potential modifying roles of age at diagnosis and maternal anthropometrics, using prospectively collected data from the International Childhood Cancer Cohort Consortium. METHODS: We pooled data on infant and parental characteristics and cancer incidence from six geographically and temporally diverse member cohorts [the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (UK), the Collaborative Perinatal Project (USA), the Danish National Birth Cohort (Denmark), the Jerusalem Perinatal Study (Israel), the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (Norway), and the Tasmanian Infant Health Survey (Australia)]. Birthweight metrics included a continuous measure, deciles, and categories (>/= 4.0 vs. < 4.0 kilogram). Childhood cancer (377 cases diagnosed prior to age 15 years) risk was analysed by type (all sites, leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and non-leukaemia) and age at diagnosis. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from Cox proportional hazards models stratified by cohort. RESULTS: A linear relationship was noted for each kilogram increment in birthweight adjusted for gender and gestational age for all cancers [HR = 1.26; 95% CI 1.02, 1.54]. Similar trends were observed for leukaemia. There were no significant interactions with maternal pre-pregnancy overweight or pregnancy weight gain. Birthweight >/= 4.0 kg was associated with non-leukaemia cancer among children diagnosed at age >/= 3 years [HR = 1.62; 95% CI 1.06, 2.46], but not at younger ages [HR = 0.7; 95% CI 0.45, 1.24, P for difference = 0.02]. CONCLUSION: Childhood cancer incidence rises with increasing birthweight. In older children, cancers other than leukaemia are particularly related to high birthweight. Maternal adiposity, currently widespread, was not demonstrated to substantially modify these associations. Common factors underlying foetal growth and carcinogenesis need to be further explored.","['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Experience in 41 patients.,20140861,10.1259/bjr.20140861 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is a difference in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in adults after solid organ transplantation (SOT) and haematologic stem cell transplantation (HST). METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study, we reviewed clinical data and imaging at the time of diagnosis in 41 patients (26 SOT and 15 HST) (31 males and 10 females; mean age 51 years) with histopathology-confirmed PTLD seen at our institution from 2004 through 2013. Statistical analysis was performed to assess difference in distribution and survival between SOT and HST cohorts. RESULTS: SOT: 17 lung/cardiac, 8 renal and 1 liver transplant recipients. HST: 13 leukaemia/lymphoma and 2 patients with aplastic anaemia. Median time to diagnosis: SOT 3.0 years; HST 6 months (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.0011). There was no statistically significant difference in distribution of PTLD after SOT and HST with nodes (15/26; 8/15), lung (10/26; 5/15) and bowel (6/26; 4/15) being the most common sites. Hepatic (3/26) and neurologic (2/26) involvement occurred in only SOT cohort while splenic PTLD (5/15) occurred more often in HST cohort. Death occurred earlier in HST (9/15; 2 weeks) than SOT cohort (12/26; 11 months) (Wilcoxon test; p = 0.0188). CONCLUSION: PTLD did not differ significantly in distribution between SOT and HST cohorts. PTLD after HST occurred early and had shorter survival. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The most common sites of PTLD were the nodes, lung and bowel. Distribution of PTLD does not differ significantly between patients with SOT and HST.

Phellinus linteus polysaccharide extracts (PLPEs) is an immunomudulatory agent with a molecular weight of 153 kd. Here, we analyzed the effects of PLPEs on cholesterol efflux in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-loaded THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) macrophages. Various concentrations of PLPEs (5, 10, 20, and 100 mug/mL) were used to treat cells. Cholesterol efflux analysis was performed to analyze the cholesterol efflux ratio in PLPE-treated cells. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were conducted to assess the expression of target genes. Low dose of PLPEs (5-20 mug/mL) dose dependently enhanced cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), evidenced by promoting the expression of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette A1, ATP-binding cassette G1, and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor gamma, key regulators for cholesterol efflux. Moreover, GW9662, a potent antagonist of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor gamma, inhibited PLPE (20 mug/mL)-promoted cholesterol efflux to ApoA-I in a dose-dependent fashion. However, high dose of PLPEs (100 mug/mL) inhibited cholesterol efflux to ApoA-I from ox-LDL-loaded THP-1 macrophages, enhanced the production of superoxide anion, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels, and raised nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase subunits. Thus, these results indicate that low and high doses of PLPEs exhibit opposite effects on cholesterol efflux from ox-LDL-loaded THP-1 cells.",,"['Li, Xiao-hui', 'Li, Yan', 'Cheng, Zhao-yun', 'Cai, Xi-guo', 'Wang, Hong-min']","['Li XH', 'Li Y', 'Cheng ZY', 'Cai XG', 'Wang HM']","[""From the *Department of Cardiovascular Surgery ICU, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou; daggerDepartment of Radiology, Puyang City Oil-Field General Hospital, Puyang; and double daggerDepartment of Rehabilitation Medicine, Henan Provincial People's Hospital; and section signDepartment of Respiratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Province, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,"['0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Phellinus linteus extract)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phellinus', 'Plant Extracts', 'Polysaccharides/*pharmacology']",,,2015/05/20 06:00,2016/04/02 06:00,['2015/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JIM.0000000000000201 [doi]', '00042871-201506000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,J Investig Med. 2015 Jun;63(5):752-7. doi: 10.1097/JIM.0000000000000201.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aerobic microorganism most frequently isolated from PCs is coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis, a normal inhabitant of the human skin, which has been involved in fatal transfusion reactions worldwide. CASE REPORT: In September 2014, a splenectomized elderly male patient, suffering from leukemia, was transfused with two 5-day-old buffy coat platelet (PLT) pools. The patient returned to emergency on the same day with a low-grade fever. He was bacteremic and died on the next day. Microbiology and molecular testing of a blood sample from the patient and one of the PCs yielded the same S. epidermidis strain. Further analysis demonstrated that this S. epidermidis isolate displays a biofilm-positive phenotype in PCs. DISCUSSION: At Canadian Blood Services, PCs are screened for bacterial contamination with the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux) at approximately 24 hours postcollection. The implicated PC had been tested and yielded a false-negative culture result. A titration experiment indicated that, at the time of screening, the contaminated PC had a titer of less than 0.74 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL (<227 CFUs/unit) of S. epidermidis. Mathematical models have predicted that up to 70% of PCs contaminated with coagulase-negative staphylococci at concentrations of 0.02 CFU/mL can be missed by BacT/ALERT screening. CONCLUSION: Despite several mitigation strategies, false-negative cultures with current PLT screening practices still occur. This report creates awareness of the pathogenicity of opportunistic S. epidermidis, a low-virulence organism, in susceptible patients who may not develop a typical transfusion reaction.",['(c) 2015 AABB.'],"['Kou, Yuntong', 'Pagotto, Franco', 'Hannach, Barbara', 'Ramirez-Arcos, Sandra']","['Kou Y', 'Pagotto F', 'Hannach B', 'Ramirez-Arcos S']","['Canadian Blood Services.', 'Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Canadian Blood Services.', 'Canadian Blood Services.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150518,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', '*Biofilms', '*Blood Buffy Coat', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Staphylococcal Infections/*transmission', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis/*physiology']",,,2015/05/20 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/05/20 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/trf.13154 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2015 Oct;55(10):2384-9. doi: 10.1111/trf.13154.

We analyzed by microFTIR human polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMNs) leukocytes, mouse-derived parental Ba/F3 cells (Ba/F3#PAR), Ba/F3 cells transfected with p210(BCR/ABL) (Ba/F3#WT) and expressing high levels of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), and human-derived BCR/ABL positive K562 leukemic cell sub-clones engineered to differently express receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase gamma (PTPRG). Synchrotron radiation (SR) and conventional (globar) IR sources were used to perform microFTIR respectively, on single cells and over several cells within the same sample. Ex vivo time-course experiments were run, inducing maximal protein phosphorylation in PMNs by 100 nM N-formylated tripeptide fMLP. Within the specific IR fingerprint 1800-850 cm(-1) frequency domain, PCA identified two regions with maximal signal variance. These were used to model and test the robustness of PCA in representing the dynamics of protein phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation processes. An IR signal ratio marker reflecting the homeostatic control by protein kinases and phosphatases was identified in normal leukocytes. The models identified by microFTIR and PCA in normal leukocytes also distinguished BCR/ABL positive Ba/F3#WT from BCR/ABL negative Ba/F3#PAR cells as well as K562 cells exposed to functionally active protein tyrosine phosphatase recombinant protein ICD-Tat transduced in cells by HIV-1 Tat technology or cells treated with the PTK inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IMA) from cells exposed to phosphatase inactive (D1028A)ICD-Tat recombinant protein and untreated control cells, respectively. The IR signal marker correctly reflected the degrees of protein phosphorylation associated with abnormal PTK activity in BCR/ABL positive leukemic cells and in general was inversely related to the expression/activity of PTPRG in leukemic sub-clones.

METHODS: We constructed a vector pcDNA3.1 (-)/myc-His A-HBVDNAPTP1 and used it to transfect acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. HBVDNAPTP1 expression was detected by western blot analysis in the cells. A cDNA library of genes transactivated by HBVDNAPTP1 in THP-1 cells was made in pGEM-T Easy using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). The cDNAs were sequenced and analyzed with BLAST search against the sequences in GenBank. RESULTS: Some sequences, such as CIP4, might be involved in apoptosis development. mRNA and protein expression of CIP4 was identified by Real time RT-PCR and western blot in THP-1 cells. HBVDNAPTP1 could down-regulate the expression of CIP4 at both transcription and translation levels.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different doses of low-level laser on proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line (KG-1a) in vitro. METHODS: A plastic flask containing 5,000,000 KG-1a cultured cells was provided by Iran Pasteur Institute. KG-1a cell line has been produced from the bone marrow aspirate of a 59-year-old white male with acute myelogenous leukemia. Upon completion of the proliferation steps of KG-1a cell line, 7x10(4) cells were placed in 96-well tissue culture plates. All the surrounding wells were filled with Wright-Giemsa stain in order to prevent laser from scattering to the neighboring wells. In total, 28 plates were prepared using this method. After a forty-eight hours incubation period, irradiation was performed in continuous mode with an infrared laser of 810nm wavelength. After 24 hours, cells cultures were exposed to one, two, or three applications of laser irradiation. Irradiation exposures were performed at energy densities of 5, 10, and 20 J/cm(2) . Each experiment included 18 replicates for each application of laser and 6 replicates of negative/untreated controls. For experiments with two and three repeated exposures, the irradiation applications were separated by 48 hours. All the culture plates were incubated for seven days. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay after seven days. Spectroscopy (620nm) was used to determine the optical density (OD) of both irradiated and control samples. RESULTS: Significant increase in cell proliferation was seen only after two exposures at energy density of 20J/cm2 (P=0.021). CONCLUSION: Although LLLT is commonly used to treat radiotherapy- or chemotherapy- induced mucositis, as long as further studies demonstrate that different wavelengths and doses of laser phototherapy are safe and effective in treatment of mucositis, clinicians should remain cautious regarding the use of this treatment modality to treat patients with malignancies.",,"['Dastanpour, Somayeh', 'Momen Beitollahi, Jalil', 'Saber, Kazem']","['Dastanpour S', 'Momen Beitollahi J', 'Saber K']","['Department of Oral Medicine, Dental Faculty, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dental Research Centre, Dental Faculty, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Laser Research Centre in Dentistry, Dental Faculty, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,J Lasers Med Sci,Journal of lasers in medical sciences,101580415,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cell culture', 'leukemia', 'low-level laser therapy']",2015/05/20 06:00,2015/05/20 06:01,['2015/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Lasers Med Sci. 2015 Spring;6(2):74-9.,,PMC4431967,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier in vitro experiments with inhibitors that block MEK 1 and 2 suggested that activation of ERK 1 and 2 MAP kinases is required for BAFF-R to promote B cell survival. However, these inhibitors are now known to also inhibit MEK5, which activates the related MAP kinase ERK5. In the present study, we demonstrated that BAFF-induced B cell survival was actually independent of ERK1/2 activation but required ERK5 activation. Consistent with this, we showed that conditional deletion of ERK5 in B cells led to a pronounced global reduction in mature B2 B cell numbers, which correlated with impaired survival of ERK5-deficient B cells after BAFF stimulation. ERK5 was required for optimal BAFF up-regulation of Mcl1 and Bcl2a1, which are prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family. However, ERK5 deficiency did not alter BAFF activation of the PI3-kinase-Akt or NF-kappaB signaling pathways, which are also important for BAFF to promote mature B cell survival.

Thus, we performed targeted deep sequencing of 18 core complex genes within the NF-kappaB pathway in a discovery and validation CLL cohort totaling 315 cases. The most frequently mutated gene was NFKBIE (21/315 cases; 7%), which encodes IkappaBepsilon, a negative regulator of NF-kappaB in normal B cells. Strikingly, 13 of these cases carried an identical 4-bp frameshift deletion, resulting in a truncated protein. Screening of an additional 377 CLL cases revealed that NFKBIE aberrations predominated in poor-prognostic patients and were associated with inferior outcome. Minor subclones and/or clonal evolution were also observed, thus potentially linking this recurrent event to disease progression. Compared with wild-type patients, NFKBIE-deleted cases showed reduced IkappaBepsilon protein levels and decreased p65 inhibition, along with increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65. Considering the central role of B cell receptor (BcR) signaling in CLL pathobiology, it is notable that IkappaBepsilon loss was enriched in aggressive cases with distinctive stereotyped BcR, likely contributing to their poor prognosis, and leading to an altered response to BcR inhibitors. Because NFKBIE deletions were observed in several other B cell lymphomas, our findings suggest a novel common mechanism of NF-kappaB deregulation during lymphomagenesis.",['(c) 2015 Mansouri et

This study was conducted to test whether interpatient variability in neurocognitive outcomes can be explained by polymorphisms in candidate genes conferring susceptibility to neurocognitive decline. METHODS: Neurocognitive testing was conducted in 350 pediatric leukemia survivors, treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocols 95-01 or 00-01. Genomic DNA was isolated from bone marrow collected at remission. Candidate polymorphisms were selected on the basis of prior literature, targeting genes related to drug metabolism, oxidative damage, altered neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and folate physiology. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected using either a customized multiplexed Sequenom MassARRAY assay or polymerase chain reaction-based allelic discrimination assays. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the effects of genotype on neurocognitive outcomes, adjusted for the effects of demographic and treatment variables. False-discovery rate correction was made for multiple hypothesis testing, indicated as a Q value. RESULTS: Inferior cognitive or behavioral outcomes were associated with polymorphisms in three genes related to oxidative stress and/or neuroinflammation: NOS3 (IQ, Q = 0.008; Vocabulary Q = 0.011; Matrix Reasoning Q = 0.008), SLCO2A1 (IQ Q = 0.043; Digit Span Q = 0.006; Block Design Q = 0.076), and COMT (Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2 Attention Q = 0.080; and Hyperactivity Q = 0.084). Survivors homozygous for NOS3 894T, with at least one SLCO2A1 variant G allele or with at least one GSTP1 variant allele, had lower mean estimated IQ scores than those without these genotypes. CONCLUSION: These data are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative damage contributes to chemotherapy-associated neurocognitive decline among children with leukemia.",['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Cole, Peter D', 'Finkelstein, Yaron', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Blonquist, Traci M', 'Vijayanathan, Veena', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Waber, Deborah P']","['Cole PD', 'Finkelstein Y', 'Stevenson KE', 'Blonquist TM', 'Vijayanathan V', 'Silverman LB', 'Neuberg DS', 'Sallan SE', 'Robaey P', 'Waber DP']","[""Peter D.

SUMMARY: Obinutuzumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 receptor on mature B cells, was recently approved for use in combination with chlorambucil in patients with previously untreated CLL. In a Phase III clinical trial including 671 patients with CLL and significant comorbidities, patients who received obinutuzumab-chlorambucil combination therapy had longer median progression-free survival than those who received rituximab plus chlorambucil (26.7 months versus 15.2 months, p < 0.001) or chlorambucil alone (11.1 months, p < 0.001). Overall survival was also improved with the use of obinutuzumab-chlorambucil versus chlorambucil alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.41, p = 0.002) and similar to survival with the use of rituximab plus chlorambucil. The main type of adverse effect reported in association with obinutuzumab use is infusion-related reactions (IRRs), which occurred in 66% of patients in the Phase III trial, with 20% of reactions categorized as grade 3 or 4; IRR risk can be reduced with appropriate dosing, premedication, patient monitoring, and immediate treatment of IRRs. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the effects of obinutuzumab in patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed or treatment-refractory CLL. CONCLUSION: In patients who are elderly or who have multiple comorbidities, the use of obinutuzumab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody, in combination with chlorambucil is an efficacious regimen for treatment-naive patients with symptomatic CLL.","['Copyright (c) 2015 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

Before randomization, a CCR (standard induction chemotherapy, low-dose ara-c, or supportive care only) was preselected for each patient. Patients then were assigned 1:1 to azacitidine (n = 241) or CCR (n = 247). Patients assigned to CCR received their preselected treatment. Median overall survival (OS) was increased with azacitidine vs CCR: 10.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0-12.7 months) vs 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.0-8.6 months), respectively (hazard ratio [HR] was 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69-1.03; stratified log-rank P = .1009). One-year survival rates with azacitidine and CCR were 46.5% and 34.2%, respectively (difference, 12.3%; 95% CI, 3.5%-21.0%). A prespecified analysis censoring patients who received AML treatment after discontinuing study drug showed median OS with azacitidine vs CCR was 12.1 months (95% CI, 9.2-14.2 months) vs 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.1-9.6 months; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.96; stratified log-rank P = .0190). Univariate analysis showed favorable trends for azacitidine compared with CCR across all subgroups defined by baseline demographic and disease features. Adverse events were consistent with the well-established safety profile of azacitidine. Azacitidine may be an important treatment option for this difficult-to-treat AML population.

It is well established that mitochondrial membranes are the main locus of action of all BCL2 family proteins, but it is difficult to obtain a precise view of how BCL2 family members operate at the native mitochondrial membrane environment during apoptosis. Here, we used minimalist model systems and multiple fluorescence-based techniques to examine selected membrane activities of MCL1 and BAK under apoptotic-like conditions. We show that three distinct apoptosis-related factors (i.e. the BCL2 homology 3 ligand cBID, the mitochondrion-specific lipid cardiolipin, and membrane geometrical curvature) all promote membrane association of BCL2-like structural folds belonging to both MCL1 and BAK. However, at the same time, the two proteins exhibited distinguishing features in their membrane association modes under apoptotic-like conditions. In addition, scanning fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy and FRET measurements revealed that the BCL2-like structural fold of MCL1, but not that of BAK, forms stable heterodimeric complexes with cBID in a manner adjustable by membrane cardiolipin content and curvature degree. Our results add significantly to a growing body of evidence indicating that the mitochondrial membrane environment plays a complex and active role in the mode of action of BCL2 family proteins.","['(c) 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Landeta, Olatz', 'Landajuela, Ane', 'Garcia-Saez, Ana', 'Basanez, Gorka']","['Landeta O', 'Landajuela A', 'Garcia-Saez A', 'Basanez G']","['From the Unidad de Biofisica, Centro Mixto Centro Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-EuskalHerriko Unibertsitatea/Universidad del Pais Vasco (EHU/UPV), Barrio Sarriena s/n, Leioa 48940, Spain, olatz.landeta@ehu.eus.', 'From the Unidad de Biofisica, Centro Mixto Centro Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-EuskalHerriko Unibertsitatea/Universidad del Pais Vasco (EHU/UPV), Barrio Sarriena s/n, Leioa 48940, Spain.', 'the Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, University of Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Strasse 4, 72076 Tubingen, Germany, and the Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Heisenbergstrasse 3, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany, and the German Cancer Research Center, BioQuant, ImNeuenheimer Feld 267, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'From the Unidad de Biofisica, Centro Mixto Centro Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-EuskalHerriko Unibertsitatea/Universidad del Pais Vasco (EHU/UPV), Barrio Sarriena s/n, Leioa 48940, Spain, gorka_basanez@ehu.eus.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150518,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bak1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family', 'cardiolipin', 'fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)', 'fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)', 'liposome', 'membrane curvature', 'mitochondrial apoptosis']",2015/05/20 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2015/05/20 06:00'],"['2014/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)40253-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.602193 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Jul 3;290(27):17004-19. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.602193.

Perturbed ribosome biogenesis in DBA has been shown to induce a p53-mediated ribosomal stress response. However, the mechanisms of p53 activation and its relevance for the erythroid defect remain elusive. Previous studies have indicated that activation of p53 is caused by the inhibition of mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2), the main negative regulator of p53, by the 5S ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP). Meanwhile, it is not clear whether this mechanism solely mediates the p53-dependent component found in DBA. To approach this question, we crossed our mouse model for RPS19-deficient DBA with Mdm2(C305F) knock-in mice that have a disrupted 5S RNP-Mdm2 interaction. Upon induction of the Rps19 deficiency, Mdm2(C305F) reversed the p53 response and improved expansion of hematopoietic progenitors in vitro, and ameliorated the anemia in vivo. Unexpectedly, disruption of the 5S RNP-Mdm2 interaction also led to selective defect in erythropoiesis. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of erythroid progenitor cells to aberrations in p53 homeostasis mediated by the 5S RNP-Mdm2 interaction. Finally, we provide evidence indicating that physiological activation of the 5S RNP-Mdm2-p53 pathway may contribute to functional decline of the hematopoietic system in a cell-autonomous manner over time.",,"['Jaako, P', 'Debnath, S', 'Olsson, K', 'Zhang, Y', 'Flygare, J', 'Lindstrom, M S', 'Bryder, D', 'Karlsson, S']","['Jaako P', 'Debnath S', 'Olsson K', 'Zhang Y', 'Flygare J', 'Lindstrom MS', 'Bryder D', 'Karlsson S']","['Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150519,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 5S)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Rps19 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan/*etiology', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*physiology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*physiology', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 5S/physiology', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*physiology', 'Ribosomal Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology']",,,2015/05/20 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015128 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.128 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Nov;29(11):2221-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.128.

ALK+ ALCL is also characterized by strong activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity and overexpression of two AP-1 transcription factors, CJUN and JUNB. Here, we hypothesized that a biologic link between AP-1 and AKT kinase may exist, thus contributing to ALCL oncogenesis. We show that JUNB and CJUN bind directly to the AKT1 promoter, inducing AKT1 transcription in ALK+ ALCL. Knockdown of JUNB and CJUN in ALK+ ALCL cell lines downregulated AKT1 mRNA and promoter activity and was associated with lower AKT1 protein expression and activation. We provide evidence that this is a transcriptional control mechanism shared by other cell types even though it may operate in a way that is cell context-specific. In addition, STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)-induced control of AKT1 transcription was functional in ALK+ ALCL and blocking of STAT3 and AP-1 signaling synergistically affected cell proliferation and colony formation.

We here report that expression of IRF4 mRNA inversely correlates with microRNA (miR)-125b in MM patients. Moreover, we provide evidence that miR-125b is downregulated in TC2/3 molecular MM subgroups and in established cell lines. Importantly, constitutive expression of miR-125b-5p by lentiviral vectors or transfection with synthetic mimics impaired growth and survival of MM cells and overcame the protective role of bone marrow stromal cells in vitro. Apoptotic and autophagy-associated cell death were triggered in MM cells on miR-125b-5p ectopic expression. Importantly, we found that the anti-MM activity of miR-125b-5p was mediated via direct downregulation of IRF4 and its downstream effector BLIMP-1. Moreover, inhibition of IRF4 translated into downregulation of c-Myc, caspase-10 and cFlip, relevant IRF4-downstream effectors. Finally, in vivo intra-tumor or systemic delivery of formulated miR-125b-5p mimics against human MM xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient/non-obese diabetic mice induced significant anti-tumor activity and prolonged survival.

Inhibition of DOT1L activity by shRNA or small-molecule inhibitors has been established to prevent proliferation of various MLL-rearranged leukemia cells in vitro, establishing DOT1L an attractive therapeutic target for mixed lineage leukemia (MLL). Most of the drugs currently in use for the MLL treatment are reported to have low efficacy, hence this study focused on various natural compounds which exhibit minimal toxic effects and high efficacy for the target receptor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Structures of human protein methyl-transferase DOT1L and natural compound databases were downloaded from various sources. Virtual screening, molecular docking, dynamics simulation and drug likeness studies were performed for those natural compounds to evaluate and analyze their anti-cancer activity. RESULTS: The top five screened compounds possessing good binding affinity were identified as potential high affinity inhibitors against DOT1L's active site. The top ranking molecule amongst the screened ligands had a Glide g-score of -10.940 kcal/mol and Glide e-model score of -86.011 with 5 hydrogen bonds and 12 hydrophobic contacts. This ligand's behaviour also showed consistency during the simulation of protein-ligand complex for 20000 ps, which is indicative of its stability in the receptor pocket.

Traditional modalities with most used radiation and chemotherapy are nonspecific and toxic which cause adverse effects on normal cells. Differentiation inducing therapy forcing malignant cells to undergo terminal differentiation has been proven to be a promising strategy. However, there is still scarce of potent differentiation inducing agents. We show here that Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), a major active component in Dong quai (Chinese Angelica sinensis), has potential differentiation inducing activity in human chronic erythro- megakaryoblastic leukemia K562 cells. MTT assays and flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that ASP inhibited K562 cell proliferation and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. ASP also triggered K562 cells to undergo erythroid differentiaton as revealed by morphological changes, intensive benzidine staining and hemoglobin colorimetric reaction, as well as increased expression of glycophorin A (GPA) protein. ASP induced redistribution of STAT5 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Western blotting analysis further identified that ASP markedly sensitized K562 cells to exogenous erythropoietin (EPO) by activating EPO-induced JAK2/ STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, thus augmenting the EPO-mediated JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway.

The promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf) protein plays an essential role in spermatogonia maintenance by preventing their differentiation. To evaluate whether there is an age-related change in Plzf expression, we found that aged mouse testes exhibited a robust ""Plzf overexpression"" phenotype, in that they showed not only a higher frequency of Plzf-expressing cells but also an increased level of Plzf expression in these cells. Moreover, some Plzf-expressing cells in aged testes even aberrantly appeared in the differentiating spermatogonia compartment, which is usually low or negative for Plzf expression. Importantly, ectopic Plzf expression in F9 cells suppressed retinoic acid (RA)-induced Stra8 activation, a gene required for meiosis initiation. These data, together with our observation of a lack of meiosis-initiating spermatocytes associated with high Plzf-expressing spermatogonia in the aged testes, particularly in the degenerative seminiferous tubules, suggest that age-related increase in Plzf expression represents a novel molecular signature of spermatogonia aging by functionally arresting their differentiation.",,"['Ferder, Ianina C', 'Wang, Ning']","['Ferder IC', 'Wang N']","['Vincent Center for Reproductive Biology, MGH Vincent Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Vincent Center for Reproductive Biology, MGH Vincent Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Gene Expression', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Spermatogonia/metabolism/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Gerotarget', 'Plzf', 'aging', 'differentiation', 'mTORC1', 'spermatogonial stem cell']",2015/05/20 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['4045 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4045 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Jun 30;6(18):15891-901. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.4045.,"['K99 AG039512/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 AG039512/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'K99/R00-AG039512/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4599245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the potential neuroprotective effects of OSM against mitochondrial dysfunction have never been reported. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that OSM may confer neuronal resistance against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), a plant toxin that irreversibly inhibits the complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and characterized the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that OSM preconditioning dose- and time-dependently protected cortical neurons against 3-NP toxicity. OSM stimulated expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member expressed in differentiating myeloid cells, that required prior phosphorylation of Janus kinase-1 (JAK1), JAK2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), STAT1, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Pharmacological inhibitors of JAK1, JAK2, ERK1/2, STAT3, STAT1, and CREB as well as the siRNA targeting at STAT3 and Mcl-1 all abolished OSM-dependent 3-NP resistance. Finally, OSM-dependent Mcl-1 induction contributed to the enhancements of mitochondrial bioenergetics including increases in spare respiratory capacity and ATP production. In conclusion, our findings indicated that OSM induces Mcl-1 expression via activation of ERK1/2, JAK1/2, STAT1/3, and CREB; furthermore, OSM-mediated Mcl-1 induction contributes to bioenergetic improvements and neuroprotective effects against 3-NP toxicity in cortical neurons. OSM may thus serve as a novel neuroprotective agent against mitochondrial dysfunction commonly associated with pathogenic mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Among these cancers the most frequent are malignant hemopathies, and in particular, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which represents 80% of infant leukemias, with a peak of incidence around the age of 3-4. The overall prognosis for infant malignant hemopathies has improved significantly thanks to progress made in chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, these anti-cancer treatments, particularly radiotherapy, when performed early, generally before 5 years of age, can have harmful effects that interfere with overall growth and particularly cranio-facial growth, and also with the child's oro-dental development. Some effects such as mandibular retrognathia, macrodontia, microdontia, agenesis and delayed eruption could increase the need for orthodontic treatment, while other complications, particularly the reduced height of the alveolar processes, short thin roots and modification of the superficial and profound periodontium, are likely to make such treatment more difficult. The aim of this review of the literature is to identify the essential factors that must be analyzed before orthodontic treatment is proposed for subjects who have undergone radiotherapy at an early age, and the precautions to be taken before and during orthodontic treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2015 CEO.

Experience from recent years unveiled that these methods are more effective and less prone to artifacts compared to biochemical high-throughput screening (HTS) of large collection of compounds in designing protein inhibitors. Hence these strategies are increasingly becoming the most utilized in the modern pharmaceutical industry. Nonetheless, there is still an impending need to develop innovative and effective strategies to tackle other more challenging targets such as those involving protein-protein interactions (PPIs). While HTS strategies notoriously fail to identify viable hits against such targets, few successful examples of PPIs antagonists derived by FBDD strategies exist. Recently, we reported on a new strategy that combines some of the basic principles of fragment-based screening with combinatorial chemistry and NMR-based screening. The approach, termed HTS by NMR, combines the advantages of combinatorial chemistry and NMR-based screening to rapidly and unambiguously identify bona fide inhibitors of PPIs.

Moreover, it is generally accepted that these plant secondary metabolites can also sensitize malignant cells to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and could thus be considered as potential adjunctive agents in cancer treatment. In this review article we show that besides potentiating the anticancer activity of standard chemotherapeutics by modifying the molecular events that are involved in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, flavonoids might also act as inhibitory modulators in human leukemia cells. The specific behavior of a certain flavonoid in such combination treatments is multifactorial being dependent on various aspects, including cellular context, molecular mechanisms of clinical drugs, temporal regimen of administration, as well as doses of agents. Based on the highly complex nature of leukemogenesis it is feasible that a multifaceted therapeutic approach is also required to cure this disease and therefore, combined chemotherapeutic schemes incorporating natural plant metabolites as chemosensitizing agents can represent a new attractive strategy for more successful treatment of leukemia patients in the future. However, as highlighted in this review, caution should be taken when affecting malignant cells concurrently with chemotherapeutic drugs and flavonoids as unwisely chosen combinations can lead to inadvisable results and sometimes even deteriorate the clinical outcomes.",,"['Sak, Katrin', 'Everaus, Hele']","['Sak K', 'Everaus H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tartu, L.

Pharmacologically overcoming the differentiation block in this condition is an attractive therapeutic avenue, which has achieved success only in a subtype of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Attempts to emulate this success in other AML subtypes have thus far been unsuccessful. Autophagy is a conserved protein degradation pathway with important roles in mammalian cell differentiation, particularly within the hematopoietic system. In the study described here, we investigated the functional importance of autophagy in APL cell differentiation. We found that autophagy is increased during all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of the APL cell line NB4 and that this is associated with increased expression of LC3II and GATE-16 proteins involved in autophagosome formation. Autophagy inhibition, using either drugs (chloroquine/3-methyladenine) or short-hairpin RNA targeting the essential autophagy gene ATG7, attenuates myeloid differentiation. Importantly, we found that enhancing autophagy promotes ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation of an ATRA-resistant derivative of the non-APL AML HL60 cell line (HL60-Diff-R). These data support the development of strategies to stimulate autophagy as a novel approach to promote differentiation in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Among ATLL cases, 70% of patients present with leukemia and the remaining patients present with lymphoma. Hand osteolysis in the patients with ATLL is considered as paraneoplastic syndrome and caused by parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) released from tumor cells. Radiographic features are similar to hyperparathyroidism, but the distribution of osteolysis in hands appears to be slightly different with the authors' experiences. The objective of this study was to identify radiographic characteristics of hand osteolysis associated with ATLL. We included six ATLL patients (5 men and 1 woman; age range, 45-71 years). All the patients presented with acute leukemia, and three were associated with hypercalcemia and pain in various locations including hands. Patterns of osteolysis on hand radiographs were evaluated and recorded independently by three musculoskeletal radiologists. We analyzed the distribution of the bone resorption in the ray distribution of the hand, finger predilection, and the difference between the ulnar and radial sides. The bone resorption was characterized by frequent involvement of the distal and proximal phalanges, predilection of ring fingers and prominent involvement on the ulnar side, compared with frequent involvement of proximal and middle phalanges, index and middle fingers, and on the radial side in the bone resorption of typical hyperparathyroidism. Such distribution may be a characteristic feature of hand osteolysis in patients with ATLL. The present findings are helpful for physicians to differentiate PTHrP-mediated osteolysis in ATLL from parathyroid hormone-mediated hyperparathyroidism.",,"['Ehara, Shigeru', 'Takahashi, Kei', 'Nishida, Jun', 'Uetani, Masataka', 'Ohashi, Kenjirou', 'Aoki, Takatoshi']","['Ehara S', 'Takahashi K', 'Nishida J', 'Uetani M', 'Ohashi K', 'Aoki T']","['Department of Radiology, Iwate Medical University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Resorption/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Female', 'Fingers/diagnostic imaging', 'Hand/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Osteolysis/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Radiography', 'Radius/diagnostic imaging', 'Ulna/diagnostic imaging']",,,2015/05/20 06:00,2016/01/08 06:00,['2015/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1620/tjem.236.63 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2015 May;236(1):63-9. doi: 10.1620/tjem.236.63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous options for relapsed or refractory disease were restricted to cytotoxic chemotherapy with limited efficacy and significant toxicity. Through an innovative mechanism of action, blinatumomab stimulates a polyclonal antitumor T-cell response, yielding unprecedented single agent efficacy in the relapsed/refractory setting. Success comes at the cost of immunological toxicities rarely encountered with previous therapies and challenging administration logistics requiring clinical expertise. AREAS COVERED: All published clinical and preclinical studies using blinatumomab were reviewed in addition to all registered ongoing clinical trials and data published in abstract form. The search was limited to the English language. The pharmacology, clinical efficacy, toxicity profile, and logistical considerations for drug administration are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Blinatumomab is an exciting addition to the treatment armamentarium for relapsed/refractory ALL, yet several questions remain regarding optimal implementation into the current treatment paradigm. A unique toxicity profile should be weighed against promising benefits in a poor prognosis population. Other emerging therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cells and inotuzumab ozogamicin, with different side effect profiles and administration schedules, may prove to be more beneficial for specific patient populations.",,"['Rogala, Britny', 'Freyer, Craig W', 'Ontiveros, Evelena P', 'Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Wetzler, Meir']","['Rogala B', 'Freyer CW', 'Ontiveros EP', 'Griffiths EA', 'Wang ES', 'Wetzler M']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Department of Pharmacy, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods/trends', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['AMG 103', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bi-specific T-cell engager', 'blinatumomab', ""non-Hodgkin's lymphoma""]",2015/05/20 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2015.1041912 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2015 Jun;15(6):895-908. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2015.1041912.,"['P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4994468,['NIHMS723730'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is impressively demonstrated by redirecting T cells with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) towards CD19, inducing complete and lasting remission of leukemia in more than two-thirds of patients in early phase trials. AREAS COVERED: We outline how the CAR strategy is highly specific in redirecting T cells towards pre-defined target cells, however, reaches its limits when targeting solid tumors with a tremendous phenotypic heterogeneity. After initial tumor reduction by CAR T cells, antigen-negative cancer cells not recognized by CAR may give rise to tumor relapse. The situation may be overcome by CAR-mediated activation of T cells in the tumor, releasing inducible IL-12 which augments T-cell activation and attracts and activates innate immune cells to eliminate antigen-negative cancer cells in the targeted lesion. EXPERT OPINION: CAR T cells with a transgenic 'payload', so-called TRUCK T cells or the 'fourth-generation' CAR T cells, are worthwhile to explore to shape the tumor environment by the inducible release of transgenic immune modifiers. Such TRUCK T cells are moreover envisioned to be applied in fields beyond cancer therapy including the therapy of virus infections, auto-immune diseases or metabolic disorders.",,"['Chmielewski, Markus', 'Abken, Hinrich']","['Chmielewski M', 'Abken H']","['University Hospital Cologne, Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), Clinic I for Internal Medicine , Robert-Koch-Street 21, D-50931 Cologne , Germany hinrich.abken@uk-koeln.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150518,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Interleukin-12/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['IL-12', 'T cell', 'adoptive cell therapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'inducible cytokine', 'innate immunity']",2015/05/20 06:00,2016/02/11 06:00,['2015/05/20 06:00'],"['2015/05/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2015.1046430 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2015;15(8):1145-54. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2015.1046430.

In a former study we detected that the valosin-containing protein (VCP, cdc48), a member of the ubiquitin proteasome degradation system (UPS), is altered in gc-resistant leukemic cells suggesting that the associated pathways might be involved in chemotherapy resistance in childhood ALL. METHODS: Human B-cell precursor leukemia cell lines, gc-resistant MHH-cALL-2 and gc-sensitive MHH-cALL-3, were treated with prednisolone and various concentrations of bortezomib. Viability and apoptosis rates were determined. RESULTS: Both cell lines showed a dose-dependent increase in caspase activity after bortezomib single treatment. The gc-sensitive cells showed an additive effect after combined treatment with prednisolone and bortezomib. In contrast, both cell lines showed a reduced viability and enhanced propidium iodide positivity after combined treatment as determined by flow cytometry. Western blot analyses of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) suggested that combined treatment promote necrotic cleavage of PARP-1 in gc-resistant cells. Furthermore, after prednisolone treatment the UPS associated proteins VCP and NFkappaB-inhibitor IkappaBalpha were differentially modulated in gc-resistant cells.

Therefore, in study AML-BFM 2004 we aimed to improve outcome of HR-patients by adding moderately dosed 2-Chloro-2-Deoxyadenosine (2-CDA) to the respective consolidation treatment backbone without increasing toxicity. The aim was to improve prognosis especially in FAB M4/M5/MLL patients, who represent the largest subgroup of HR patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 343 children and adolescents with HR-AML were randomized to receive or not 2-CDA (6 mg/m(2)/d, days 1, 3) in combination with cytarabine/idarubicine (AI=500 mg/m(2) cytarabine 5 days continuous infusion plus 7 mg/m(2)/d idarubicin, days 3 and 5). RESULTS: RESULTS for patients of the AI/2-CDA arm (n=168) vs. the AI-arm (n=175) were similar: 5-year overall survival 68+/-4 vs. 72+/-4%, plogrank=0.38, event-free survival 53+/-4 vs. 49+/-4%, plogrank=0.77; cumulative incidence of relapse at 5 years: 35+/-4 vs. 37+/-4%, p(Gray)=0.89. RESULTS in patients with MLL rearrangement or FAB M4/M5 were also similar in the treatment groups. In addition, toxicities did not differ between the two arms. CONCLUSION: We conclude that additional, moderate dose 2-CDA does not improve prognosis in HR-patients when given during consolidation treatment. Its effect might be too low in this multidrug regimen, where the strongest effects are achieved during induction, or the chosen dose of 2-CDA might have been too low.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Here we identified small pre-BII cells as a natural subset with increased genetic vulnerability owing to concurrent activation of these enzymes. Consistent with epidemiological findings on childhood ALL etiology, susceptibility to genetic lesions during B lymphopoiesis at the transition from the large pre-BII cell stage to the small pre-BII cell stage was exacerbated by abnormal cytokine signaling and repetitive inflammatory stimuli.

Two groups of detection probes were designed, and each group was composed of a biotinylated capture probe and an assisted probe. They were separately complementary with two strands of target dsDNA in order to prevent the reannealing of the two separate strands from target dsDNA. First, thiol functionalized capture probes (C1 and C2) were severally assembled onto two different gold electrodes, followed by hybridizing with target dsDNA (S1a-S1b) and assistant probes to form two Y-junction-structure ternary complexes. Subsequently, restriction sites on the ternary complexes were digested by Rsa I, which can release S1a, S1b and biotins from the electrode surfaces. Meanwhile, the released S1a and S1b can further hybridize with the unhybridized corresponding detection probes and then initiate another new hybridization-cleavage-separation cycle. Finally, the current signals were produced by the enzyme-catalyzed reaction of streptavidin-horse reddish peroxidase (streptavidin-HRP). The distinct difference in current signals between different sequences allowed detection of target dsDNA down to a low detection limit of 47 fM and presented excellent specificity with discriminating only a single-base mismatched dsDNA sequence.

Although HCT with MAC is preferred to reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) for most patients 60 years with AML/myelodysplastic syndrome and ALL, RIC and nonmyeloablative (NMA) regimens allow HCT for many otherwise ineligible patients. Reduced intensity preparative regimens have produced high rates of PFS for diagnoses, which are highly sensitive to GVM.

Here we are the first to report that the extracellular acid sensing G-protein coupled receptor, GPR65, is expressed in primary CLL cells where its level correlate strongly with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member levels. GPR65 expression is found normally within the lymphoid lineage and has not been previously reported in CLL. We demonstrate a wide range of GPR65 mRNA expression among CLL 87 patient samples. The correlation between GPR65 mRNA levels and Bcl-2 mRNA levels is particularly strong (r=0.8063, p= <0.001). The correlation extends to other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Mcl-1 (r=0.4847, p=0.0010) and Bcl-xl (r=0.3411, p=0.0252), although at lower levels of significance. No correlation is detected between GPR65 and levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM, PUMA or NOXA. GPR65 expression also correlates with the favorable prognostic marker of 13q deletion. The present findings suggest the acid sensing receptor GPR65 may be of significance to allow CLL tolerance of extracellular acidosis. The correlation of GPR65 with Bcl-2 suggests a novel cytoprotective mechanism that enables CLL cell adaptation to acidic extracellular conditions.

Similarly, BK nephropathy is a recognized cause of graft failure in renal transplant recipients but rarely causes significant disease in native kidneys. In the few reports where leukaemic infiltration of the kidney has led to significant renal impairment, the pathological process causing renal dysfunction is not identified on biopsy. In these cases, it is unclear whether BK polyomavirus (BKV) nephropathy has been excluded. We describe a case of dual pathologies in a patient with Binet stage C CLL and deteriorating renal function where renal biopsy reveals leukaemic infiltration of the kidney occurring alongside BKV nephropathy. The relative importance of each pathology in relation to the rapid decline to end-stage renal failure remains unclear, but the presence of both pathologies appears to impart a poor prognosis. Additionally, we describe the novel histological finding of loss of tubular integrity resulting in tubular infiltration and occlusion by leukaemic cells. It is possible that the patient with advanced CLL is at particular risk of BK activation, and the presence of BK nephropathy may compromise tubular integrity allowing leukaemic cell infiltration and obstruction of tubules. This case bares remarkable resemblance to the first and only other report of its kind in the literature. It is not clear how available immunocytochemistry for polyoma infection is outside transplant centres, and it is possible that BK nephropathy is being under-diagnosed in patients with CLL in the context of declining renal function. At present, the combination of BKV nephropathy and leukaemic infiltration represents a management conundrum and the prognosis is poor.

BKV is associated with tubulointerstitial nephritis and ureteric stenosis in renal transplant recipients.

In most solid tumors, ATO disturbs the cell cycle instead of inducing apoptosis. We aimed to determine the exact mechanism underlying the different response of APL to ATO compared with the response of solid tumors. METHODS: A proteomics-based screening was used to identify the ATO-associated proteins in the human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line, Eca109. The expression levels of Annexin A1 (ANXA1) in 4 different types of cancer cells were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line Eca109 and pancreatic carcinoma cell line BxPC3 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting ANXA1 and scrambled control siRNA. Cell proliferation was evaluated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. RESULTS: After verification of the mRNA and protein levels in 4 cancer cell lines, ANXA1 and lamin A/B were validated to have increased expression levels after low-concentration ATO treatment. Lower concentrations of ATO, which has no effect on proliferation of cancer cells, induced apoptosis after ANXA1 silencing. Furthermore, overexpression of ANXA1 induced by ATO resulted in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), rendering cancer cells resistant to the agent. In addition, PD98059, a specific ERK inhibitor, increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to a lower concentration of ATO treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that overexpression of ANXA1 induced by low-concentration ATO makes cancer cells more resistant to the agent via activated ERK MAPKs. Specific silencing of ANXA1 increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to ATO treatment.",,"['Zhang, Xueyan', 'Li, Xiaodong', 'Li, Xiaolin', 'Zheng, Lei', 'Lei, Lei']","['Zhang X', 'Li X', 'Li X', 'Zheng L', 'Lei L']","['Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Hospital Affiliated to Harbin Medical University, Harbin - China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150513,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Annexin A1/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2015/05/20 06:00,2015/10/20 06:00,['2015/05/19 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['27E00C15-4A48-42A6-9F9F-CF32A152E825 [pii]', '10.5301/tj.5000315 [doi]']",ppublish,Tumori. 2015 Jul-Aug;101(4):360-7. doi: 10.5301/tj.5000315.

In addition, we also investigated alternative splicing of the cell cycle genes affected by imatinib, since an important relationship has been shown to exist between RNA splicing and cell cycle progression. Exon array analysis was performed using total RNA purified from normal and imatinib-treated K562 cells. We identified 185 differentially expressed genes and 277 alternative splicing events between the two cell groups. A detailed analysis by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of key genes confirmed the experimental results of the exon array.

While deregulated glutamate pathways impact oncogenicity in some cancers, the role of glutamate and NMDARs in megakaryocytic malignancies remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine if NMDARs participate in Ca(2+) responses in leukemic megakaryoblasts and if so, whether modulating NMDAR activity could influence cell growth. Three human cell lines, Meg-01, Set-2 and K-562 were used as models of leukemic megakaryoblasts. NMDAR components were examined in leukemic cells and human bone marrow, including in megakaryocytic disease. Well-established NMDAR modulators (agonists and antagonists) were employed to determine NMDAR effects on Ca(2+) flux, cell viability, proliferation and differentiation. Leukemic megakaryoblasts contained combinations of NMDAR subunits that differed from normal bone marrow and the brain. NMDAR agonists facilitated Ca(2+) entry into Meg-01 cells, amplified Ca(2+) responses to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and promoted growth of Meg-01, Set-2 and K-562 cells. Low concentrations of NMDAR inhibitors (riluzole, memantine, MK-801 and AP5; 5-100muM) were weakly cytotoxic but mainly reduced cell numbers by suppressing proliferation. The use-dependent NMDAR inhibitor, memantine (100muM), reduced numbers and proliferation of Meg-01 cells to less than 20% of controls (IC50 20muM and 36muM, respectively). In the presence of NMDAR inhibitors cells acquired morphologic and immunophenotypic features of megakaryocytic differentiation.

The aim of the study is the evaluation of BCL2 and BAX expression for the prognosis of ch-ALL patients treated with Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) backbone protocol. METHODS: Bone marrow specimens were obtained at the time of diagnosis and on day 33 following BFM treatment induction from 82 ch-ALL patients, as well as from 63 healthy children. Following extraction, total RNA was reverse transcribed and BCL2 and BAX expression levels were determined by qPCR. RESULTS: BCL2 expression and BCL2/BAX ratio were strongly upregulated in ch-ALL compared to healthy children and were correlated with favorable prognostic disease features. Increased levels of BCL2 and BAX expression were associated with disease remission, as ch-ALL patients with lower expression ran a significantly higher risk of M2-M3 response, positive MRD and poor survival outcome. Moreover, the upregulation of BCL2 and BAX following BFM treatment induction was shown to represent an independent predictor of patients' short-term relapse, which was further confirmed in ch-ALL patients with favorable prognostic markers. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, BCL2 and BAX could be effectively used for an enhanced prediction of BFM-treated patients' outcome.",,"['Stamati, Lamprini', 'Avgeris, Margaritis', 'Kosmidis, Helen', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Anastasiou, Theodora', 'Piatopoulou, Despina', 'Scorilas, Andreas', 'Gourgiotis, Dimitrios']","['Stamati L', 'Avgeris M', 'Kosmidis H', 'Baka M', 'Anastasiou T', 'Piatopoulou D', 'Scorilas A', 'Gourgiotis D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Biochemistry - Molecular Diagnostics, Second Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens Medical School, ""P&A Kyriakou"" Children\'s Hospital, Levadias 13 Str., 115 27, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis, 157 01, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, ""P&A Kyriakou"" Children\'s Hospital, Thivon & Levadias Str., 115 27, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, ""P&A Kyriakou"" Children\'s Hospital, Thivon & Levadias Str., 115 27, Athens, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, ""P&A Kyriakou"" Children\'s Hospital, Thivon & Levadias Str., 115 27, Athens, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Biochemistry - Molecular Diagnostics, Second Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens Medical School, ""P&A Kyriakou"" Children\'s Hospital, Levadias 13 Str., 115 27, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis, 157 01, Athens, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Biochemistry - Molecular Diagnostics, Second Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens Medical School, ""P&A Kyriakou"" Children\'s Hospital, Levadias 13 Str., 115 27, Athens, Greece. dgourg@med.uoa.gr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150516,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster treatment protocol', 'Chemotherapy resistance', 'Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ch-ALL)', 'Molecular tumor markers']",2015/05/20 06:00,2016/05/03 06:00,['2015/05/19 06:00'],"['2015/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00432-015-1982-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-015-1982-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2015 Nov;141(11):2023-36. doi: 10.1007/s00432-015-1982-6.

We previously showed that ultra-small polymer nanoparticles efficiently drain to the lymphatics after intradermal injection and target antigen-presenting cells, including Ly6c(hi) Ly6g(-) monocytic MDSCs (Mo-MDSCs), in skin-draining lymph nodes (LNs) and spleen. Here, we developed ultra-small polymer micelles loaded with 6-thioguanine (MC-TG), a cytotoxic drug used in the treatment of myelogenous leukemia, with the aim of killing Mo-MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice and thus enhancing T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. We found that 2 days post-injection in tumor-bearing mice (B16-F10 melanoma or E.G7-OVA thymoma), MC-TG depleted Mo-MDSCs in the spleen, Ly6c(lo) Ly6g(+) granulocytic MDSCs (G-MDSCs) in the draining LNs, and Gr1(int) Mo-MDSCs in the tumor. In both tumor models, MC-TG decreased the numbers of circulating Mo- and G-MDSCs, as well as of Ly6c(hi) macrophages, for up to 7 days following a single administration. MDSC depletion was dose dependent and more effective with MC-TG than with equal doses of free TG. Finally, we tested whether this MDSC-depleting strategy might enhance cancer immunotherapies in the B16-F10 melanoma model. We found that MC-TG significantly improved the efficacy of adoptively transferred, OVA-specific CD8(+) T cells in melanoma cells expressing OVA. These findings highlight the capacity of MC-TG in depleting MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment and show promise in promoting anti-tumor immunity when used in combination with T cell immunotherapies.",,"['Jeanbart, Laura', 'Kourtis, Iraklis C', 'van der Vlies, Andre J', 'Swartz, Melody A', 'Hubbell, Jeffrey A']","['Jeanbart L', 'Kourtis IC', 'van der Vlies AJ', 'Swartz MA', 'Hubbell JA']","['Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences and School of Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150516,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Micelles)', '0 (Polymers)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Melanoma, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Micelles', 'Myeloid Cells/*physiology', 'Polymers', 'Thioguanine/*administration & dosage', 'Thymoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",,,2015/05/20 06:00,2015/10/28 06:00,['2015/05/19 06:00'],"['2014/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-015-1702-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2015 Aug;64(8):1033-46. doi: 10.1007/s00262-015-1702-8.

Cellular oxidative state is a credible target to selectively eradicate AML cells, because it is a fundamental property of each cell that is sufficiently different between leukemic and normal cells, yet its aberrancy shared among different AML cells. To this end, we tested whether a short-time treatment of AML cells, including cells with FLT3-ITD mutation, with sub-lethal dose of dichloroacetate (DCA) (priming) followed by pharmacologic dose of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in presence of low-dose DCA could produce insurmountable level of oxidative damage that kill AML cells. Using cellular cytotoxicity, apoptotic and metabolic assays with both established AML cell lines and primary AML cells, we found that priming with DCA significantly potentiated the cytotoxicity of ATO in AML cells in a synergistic manner. The combination decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential as well as expression of Mcl-1 and GPx in primary AML cells more than either drug alone. One patient with AML whose disease was refractory to several lines of prior treatments was treated with this combination, and tolerated it well. These data suggest that targeting cellular redox balance in leukemia may provide a therapeutic option for AML patients with relapsed/refractory disease.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is unclear whether this applies to the leukemic stem cell as well and if differences in pO2 between the normal hematopoetic and the leukemic stem cell niche exits. Here, we demonstrate that while there is no detectable difference in the hypoxic level of bone marrow infiltrated by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and healthy bone marrow, physiological hypoxia of 1% O2 itself leads to cell cycle arrest of AML blasts (both cell lines and primary AML samples) in the G0/G1 phase with upregulation of p27 and consecutive decrease of cells in the S phase. Hence, susceptibility of AML blasts toward cytarabine as S phase dependent drug is significantly decreased as shown by decreased cytotoxicity in vitro. In addition, cells exposed to hypoxia activate PI3K/Akt and increase expression of anti-apoptotic XIAP. Inhibition of PI3K can restore cytarabine sensitivity of AML blasts at hypoxic conditions.

Some evidence suggests differences in clinical and cytogenetic characteristics of ALL based on geographic and ethnic variations. However, data on ALL characteristics and early outcome of therapy from low/middle-income countries such as Pakistan are scanty. PROCEDURE: A prospective, multi-institutional cohort study in Karachi enrolled 646 newly diagnosed children with ALL over 3 years. Standard forms were used to collect demographic, clinical, and laboratory data at presentation and at the end of induction. RESULTS: Of the total, 66.1% (n = 427) were males. Median age was 6 (mean +/- SE 6.87 +/- 0.16; range 0.16-18) years. The most common clinical presentation was fever (88.7%). BPC-ALL was diagnosed in 78.5%, while 17.5% had T-ALL; 28.8% had a WBC >50 x 10(9) /L. With 316 patients karyotyped, hypodiploidy and hyperdiploidy were seen in 5.1% and 10.7%, respectively. Of those tested, ETV6-RUNX1 translocation was detected in 13.2%, while BCR-ABL1 translocation and MLL gene rearrangements were seen in 7.3% and 4.6%, respectively. The cumulative loss to follow up before and during induction was 12.8% (n = 83) and 11.5% (n = 74) died before or during this phase. Induction was successfully completed by only 75.6% (n = 489) of the entire cohort and 69.6% (n = 450) achieved remission. CONCLUSION: These patients had ALL with higher risk features than that reported from developed countries. One quarter failed to complete induction chemotherapy. This suboptimal result requires further study and development of innovative interventions, particularly focusing on the causes and solutions for late referral, abandonment, and infections.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Fadoo, Zehra', 'Nisar, Imran', 'Yousuf, Fatimah', 'Lakhani, Laila Saleem', 'Ashraf, Shamvil', 'Imam, Uzma', 'Zaheer, Junaid', 'Naqvi, Ahmed', 'Belgaumi, Asim']","['Fadoo Z', 'Nisar I', 'Yousuf F', 'Lakhani LS', 'Ashraf S', 'Imam U', 'Zaheer J', 'Naqvi A', 'Belgaumi A']","['Department of Pediatrics and Child Health and Department of Oncology, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health and Department of Oncology, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Medical Student, Aga Khan University Medical College, Pakistan.', 'Medical Student, Aga Khan University Medical College, Pakistan.', ""Children's Cancer Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan."", 'Pediatric Oncology Department, National Institute of Child Health, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health and Department of Oncology, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, the Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health and Department of Oncology, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pediatric Medicine, Division of Hematology Oncology, Sidra Medical and Research Center, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150515,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Pakistan/ethnology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Social Class', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['childhood ALL', 'induction outcome', 'low/middle income country']",2015/05/20 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2015/05/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25583 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Oct;62(10):1700-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25583.

We provide evidence that these TFs, in conjunction with the lysine acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP, facilitate BRD4 recruitment to their occupied sites to promote transcriptional activation. Chemical inhibition of BET bromodomains was found to suppress the functional output of each hematopoietic TF, thereby interfering with essential lineage-specific transcriptional circuits in this disease.

METHODS: Data were drawn from a population-based case-control study carried out to assess the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia in an adult population exposed to environmental air pollution in Northern Italy. Each case was classified according to the WHO ICD-O-3 classification. Statistical analyses were performed by multivariable unconditional logistic regression in 573 interviewed subjects (199 lymphoid cases, 95 myeloid cases, and 279 healthy controls). RESULTS: Lymphoid malignancies were associated with a history of gastroduodenal ulcer (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.2-3.6), rheumatoid arthritis (OR 4.4, 95 % CI 1.3-19.0), anemia (OR 3.3, 95 % CI 1.2-9.3), cholecystectomy (OR 2.9, 95 % CI 1.0-8.0), heavy diagnostic X-ray exposure (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.3-3.7), and a familial risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR 10.1, 95 % CI 1.3-458). Myeloid malignancies were associated with non-neoplastic thyroid diseases (OR 6.2, 95 % CI 1.7-35.6) and anemia (OR 6.8, 95 % CI 2.0-23.1). Subgroup analysis highlighted an excess risk of MALT in patients with gastroduodenal ulcer (OR 5.3, 95 % CI 1.04-23.7) and of AML in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (OR 6.9, 95 % CI 1.2-38.1), and of MDS in subjects exposed to heavy diagnostic X-ray (OR 3.4, 95 % CI 1.03-11.2) when the analysis was restricted to irradiation of pelvis, abdomen, or thorax.

Screening of several natural products in the search for novel anticancer agents against human leukemia HL-60 cells led us to identify potent apoptosis-inducing activity in the essential oil fraction from Artemisia capillaris Thunb. flower. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of extracts were assessed on human leukemia HL-60 cells by XTT assay. Induction of apoptosis was assessed by analysis of DNA fragmentation and nuclear morphological change. The plant name was checked with the plant list website (http://www.theplantlist.org). RESULTS: A purified compound from the essential oil fraction from Artemisia capillaris Thunb. flower that potently inhibited cell growth in human leukemia HL-60 cells was identified as capillin. The cytotoxic effect of capillin in cells was associated with apoptosis. When HL-60 cells were treated with 10(-6) M capillin for 6 h, characteristic features of apoptosis such as DNA fragmentation and nuclear fragmentation were observed. Moreover, activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was detected after treatment with capillin preceding the appearance of characteristic properties of apoptosis. Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was also observed in HL-60 cells that had been treated with capillin. CONCLUSION: Capillin induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which might be controlled through JNK signaling.

Leukemic cells, similar to other tumor cells, hijack these inhibitory pathways to evade immune recognition and destruction by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Thus, blockade of immune checkpoints has emerged as a highly promising approach to augment innate anti-tumor immunity in order to treat malignancies. Most evidence for the clinical efficacy of this immunotherapeutic strategy has been seen in patients with metastatic melanoma, where anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies have recently revolutionized treatment of this lethal disease with otherwise limited treatment options. To meet the high demand for new treatment strategies in acute leukemia, clinical testing of these promising therapies is commencing. Herein, we review the biology of multiple inhibitory checkpoints (including CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3, BTLA, and CD200R) and their contribution to immune evasion by acute leukemias. In addition, we discuss the current state of preclinical and clinical studies of immune checkpoint inhibition in acute leukemia, which seek to harness the body's own immune system to fight leukemic cells.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Knaus, Hanna A', 'Kanakry, Christopher G', 'Luznik, Leo', 'Gojo, Ivana']","['Knaus HA', 'Kanakry CG', 'Luznik L', 'Gojo I']","['Cancer Research Building I, Room 346, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD 21287, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Tumor Escape/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*T cells.', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*co-inhibitory receptor', '*immune evasion', '*immune checkpoint pathway', '*immunotherapy', '*monoclonal antibody']",2015/05/20 06:00,2017/09/14 06:00,['2015/05/19 06:00'],"['2015/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2015/05/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.2174/1389450116666150518095346 [doi]', 'CDT-EPUB-67384 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2017;18(3):315-331. doi: 10.2174/1389450116666150518095346.,"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 CA186691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4729661,['NIHMS751252'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gonadal dysfunction is not described, since it is detailed in another chapter. During childhood, prompt diagnosis and management of endocrine complications allow improvement of final height outcome and body composition (lean body mass and bone mass), reducing morbidity and impaired quality of life later in adulthood.

METHODS: Adult patients with newly diagnosed AML who were initially treated with conventional 3 + 7 induction chemotherapy within 5 days of their diagnosis were included. Patients with previous cytotoxic chemotherapy <3 years, acute promyelocytic leukemia diagnosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or significant systemic infection at the time of diagnosis were excluded. Patients were treated with an institutional policy of substantial identity with negligible differences regarding supportive care. RESULTS: Among 110 patients (median age 54.5 years), 39 infectious events in 38 patients were reported, along with 21 episodes of infectious treatment-related mortality (TRM; 19.1%). Elevated pre-treatment CRP (p = 0.032) and ferritin (p = 0.002) were related to the incidence of systemic infection. The degree of increase of blood CRP and ferritin level was correlated with the extent of leukocytosis. However, patients with elevated inflammatory markers above normal range had increased risk of infection irrespective of whether they had leukocytosis or not, suggesting that expansion of leukemic blast is another factor affecting the elevation of the markers independent to infection propensity and therefore the magnitude of the elevation does not quantitatively predict the risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Modest elevation of baseline blood inflammatory markers above the normal range could be an indicator for predicting the incidence of systemic infection in patients with AML.",,"['Hong, Junshik', 'Woo, Hyun Seon', 'Ahn, Hee Kyung', 'Sym, Sun Jin', 'Park, Jinny', 'Cho, Eun Kyung', 'Shin, Dong Bok', 'Lee, Jae Hoon']","['Hong J', 'Woo HS', 'Ahn HK', 'Sym SJ', 'Park J', 'Cho EK', 'Shin DB', 'Lee JH']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon Regional Cancer Center, Gachon University School of Medicine, 21 Namdongdae-ro 774-gil, Namdong-gu, Incheon, 405-760, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon Regional Cancer Center, Gachon University School of Medicine, 21 Namdongdae-ro 774-gil, Namdong-gu, Incheon, 405-760, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon Regional Cancer Center, Gachon University School of Medicine, 21 Namdongdae-ro 774-gil, Namdong-gu, Incheon, 405-760, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon Regional Cancer Center, Gachon University School of Medicine, 21 Namdongdae-ro 774-gil, Namdong-gu, Incheon, 405-760, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon Regional Cancer Center, Gachon University School of Medicine, 21 Namdongdae-ro 774-gil, Namdong-gu, Incheon, 405-760, Republic of Korea. jhagnes@gilhospital.com.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon Regional Cancer Center, Gachon University School of Medicine, 21 Namdongdae-ro 774-gil, Namdong-gu, Incheon, 405-760, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon Regional Cancer Center, Gachon University School of Medicine, 21 Namdongdae-ro 774-gil, Namdong-gu, Incheon, 405-760, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon Regional Cancer Center, Gachon University School of Medicine, 21 Namdongdae-ro 774-gil, Namdong-gu, Incheon, 405-760, Republic of Korea. jhlee@gilhospital.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150519,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Sepsis/*etiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'C-reactive protein', 'Ferritin', 'Induction chemotherapy', 'Infection']",2015/05/20 06:00,2016/08/05 06:00,['2015/05/19 06:00'],"['2014/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00520-015-2762-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-015-2762-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2016 Jan;24(1):187-194. doi: 10.1007/s00520-015-2762-1.

It is known that melanogenesis influences diverse cellular responses, including cell survival and apoptosis, via complex mechanisms of feedback and crosstalk. Therefore, an attempt to suppress melanin production by modulating the melanogenesis pathway may induce perturbations in the apoptotic balance of the cells in response to UVB irradiation, which results in various skin diseases such as melasma, vitiligo, and skin cancer. To identify such appropriate target strategies for the reduction of UVB-induced melanin synthesis, we reconstructed the melanogenesis signaling network and developed a Boolean network model. Mathematical simulations of the melanogenesis network model revealed that the inhibition of beta-catenin in the melanocytes effectively reduce melanin production while having minimal influence on the apoptotic balance of the cells. Exposing cells to a beta-catenin inhibitor decreased pigmentation but did not significantly change the B-cell Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 expression, a potent regulator of apoptotic balance. Thus, our systems analysis suggests that the inhibition of beta-catenin may be the most appropriate target strategy for the reduction of UVB-induced skin pigmentation.",,"['Lee, Ho-Sung', 'Goh, Myeong-Jin', 'Kim, Junil', 'Choi, Tae-Jun', 'Kwang Lee, Hae', 'Joo Na, Yong', 'Cho, Kwang-Hyun']","['Lee HS', 'Goh MJ', 'Kim J', 'Choi TJ', 'Kwang Lee H', 'Joo Na Y', 'Cho KH']","['1] Laboratory for Systems Biology and Bio-Inspired Engineering, Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305-701, Republic of Korea [2] Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Skin Research Institute, Amorepacific R&D center, Gyeonggi-do, 446-729, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory for Systems Biology and Bio-Inspired Engineering, Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory for Systems Biology and Bio-Inspired Engineering, Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Skin Research Institute, Amorepacific R&D center, Gyeonggi-do, 446-729, Republic of Korea.', 'Skin Research Institute, Amorepacific R&D center, Gyeonggi-do, 446-729, Republic of Korea.', '1] Laboratory for Systems Biology and Bio-Inspired Engineering, Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305-701, Republic of Korea [2] Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150518,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['0 (Melanins)'],IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Epididymis/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanins/*biosynthesis', 'Melanocytes/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Pigmentation/*physiology/*radiation effects', 'Systems Biology/methods', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",,,2015/05/20 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/05/19 06:00'],"['2014/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['srep10305 [pii]', '10.1038/srep10305 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 May 18;5:10305. doi: 10.1038/srep10305.,,PMC4434836,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the transcriptome profiles and miRNA expression profiles of ALV-J-infected and uninfected chicken spleens to identify the genes and miRNAs related to ALV-J invasion. In total, 252 genes and 167 miRNAs were differentially expressed in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to control uninfected spleens. miR-23b expression was up-regulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared with the control spleens, and transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) was down-regulated in ALV-J-infected spleens compared to uninfected spleens. A dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that IRF1 was a direct target of miR-23b. miR-23b overexpression significantly (P = 0.0022) decreased IRF1 mRNA levels and repressed IRF1-3'-UTR reporter activity. In vitro experiments revealed that miR-23b overexpression strengthened ALV-J replication, whereas miR-23b loss of function inhibited ALV-J replication. IRF1 overexpression inhibited ALV-J replication, and IRF1 knockdown enhanced ALV-J replication. Moreover, IRF1 overexpression significantly (P = 0.0014) increased IFN-beta expression.

It is known, that many chemotherapy drugs have toxic effects on the central nervous system and is a factor, that leads to significant cognitive impairment. Purpose: Search of neurophysiological, neurochemical, and psychological correlates of neurotoxicity in children with LT when programmed therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 39 children (4-16 years) with LT, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) - 25, with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) - 14 who were treated according to the scheme m-BFM-90: for patients with ALL (mALL-BFM -90) and the NHL (mNHL - BFM-90). Investigated the EEG, REG, ECHO EG. In 12 children with LT in blood serum levels of middle molecules (MM) - indicator of general toxicity, N-acetylneuraminic acid (N-ANA) - indicator of neurotoxicity, malondialdehyde (MDA) - lipid peroxidation, tocopherol, retinol - indicators of antioxidant protection, level of catalase - as free radical oxida- lion; vanilmindalic acid levels (VMA) - as indicator of the state catecholaminergic system. Studies were performed before treatment, after induction of remission, after M-protocol, after the end of chemotherapy. In 23 children (11-16 years) with LT during chemotherapy, performed a comparison of EEG and the level of anxiety (Ch.D.Spilberger), <<strategy selection behavior>> (Thomas-Kilman). Control group - healthy children of the same age. RESULTS: The main results obtained in the present study were that 1) Prior to initiation of treatment of children with LT had a EEG changes, indicating certain dysfunction of diencephalic structures of the brain, and probably due to metabolic disorders that affect the neurotransmitter metabolism. 2) Toxic effects of chemotherapy on the CNS program was shown on a range of indicators: according to EEC-increasing values of relative power in the band delta- and Theta-frequency range, lower alpha-activity, increase of relative power in the band betal,2; according to REG-hemodynamic compromise; increasing levels of neurochemical indicators N-ANA and the VMA.

Since year 2000, we developed the following non-invasive diagnostic methods that can be quickly identified by the patented simple non-invasive method without using expensive or bulky instrument at any office or field where there is no electricity or instrument available. The following are examples of non-invasive quick method of diagnosis and treatment of cancers using different approaches: 1) Soft red laser beam scanning of different parts of body; 2) By speaking voice; 3) Visible and invisible characteristic abnormalities on different organ representation areas of the different parts of the body, and 4) Mouth, Hand, and Foot Writings of both right and left side of the body. As a consequence of our latest research, we were able to develop a simple method of detecting cancer from existing recorded electrocardiograms. In this article, we are going to describe the method and result of clinical applications on many different cancers of different organs including lung, esophagus, breast, stomach, colon, uterus, ovary, prostate gland, as well as common bone marrow related malignancies such as Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Multiple Myeloma as well as Leukemia.",,"['Omura, Yoshiaki', 'Lu, Dominic', ""O'Young, Brian"", 'Jones, Marilyn', 'Nihrane, Abdallah', 'Duvvi, Harsha', 'Shimotsuura, Yasuhiro', 'Ohki, Motomu']","['Omura Y', 'Lu D', ""O'Young B"", 'Jones M', 'Nihrane A', 'Duvvi H', 'Shimotsuura Y', 'Ohki M']",,['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Acupunct Electrother Res,Acupuncture & electro-therapeutics research,7610364,,IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, X/chemistry', 'Chromosomes, Human, Y/chemistry', 'Early Detection of Cancer/economics/instrumentation/*methods', 'Electrocardiography/economics/instrumentation/*methods', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/chemistry/*diagnosis']",,,2015/05/20 06:00,2015/06/19 06:00,['2015/05/19 06:00'],"['2015/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3727/036012915x14279074629589 [doi]'],ppublish,Acupunct Electrother Res. 2015;40(1):1-15. doi: 10.3727/036012915x14279074629589.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although protumorigenic and tumor-suppressive miRNAs are implicated in disease onset in murine models of Notch-driven T-cell leukemia, whether Dicer1-processed miRNAs are essential for Notch-driven T-ALL is currently unknown. Here we used conditional and inducible genetic loss-of-function approaches to test whether the development and maintenance of Notch-driven T-ALL was dependent on Dicer1 function. Mice with specific inactivation of both Dicer1 alleles in the T-cell lineage did not develop Notch-driven T-ALL. In contrast, loss of 1 functional Dicer1 allele did not significantly perturb T-ALL onset and tumor progression. Inducible inactivation of Dicer1 in early stage polyclonal T-ALL cells was sufficient to abrogate T-ALL progression in leukemic mice, whereas late-stage monoclonal T-ALL cells were counterselected against loss of Dicer1. Lineage-tracing experiments revealed that Dicer1 deficiency led to the induction of apoptosis in T-ALL cells, whereas cell cycle progression remained unaltered. Through microarray-based miRNA profiling, we identified miR-21 as a previously unrecognized miRNA deregulated in both mouse and human T-ALL. Herein, we demonstrate that miR-21 regulates T-ALL cell survival via repression of the tumor suppressor Pdcd4.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Junker, Fabian', 'Chabloz, Antoine', 'Koch, Ute', 'Radtke, Freddy']","['Junker F', 'Chabloz A', 'Koch U', 'Radtke F']","['Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, School of Life Sciences, Swiss Experimental Cancer Research Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, School of Life Sciences, Swiss Experimental Cancer Research Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, School of Life Sciences, Swiss Experimental Cancer Research Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, School of Life Sciences, Swiss Experimental Cancer Research Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150515,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN21 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (PDCD4 protein, human)', '0 (Pdcd4 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (Ribonuclease III)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease III/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,,2015/05/17 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2015/05/17 06:00'],"['2014/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31334-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-12-618892 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Aug 20;126(8):993-1004. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-12-618892.

The current study uses the Emu-TCL1 mouse model, which replicates human T-cell defects, as a preclinical platform to longitudinally examine patterns of T-cell dysfunction alongside developing CLL and in different microenvironments, with a focus on PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. The development of CLL was significantly associated with changes in T-cell phenotype across all organs and function. Although partly mirrored in aging wild-type mice, CLL-specific T-cell changes were identified. Murine CLL cells highly expressed PD-L1 and PD-L2 in all organs, with high PD-L1 expression in the spleen. CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells from leukemic and aging healthy mice highly expressed PD-1, identifying aging as a confounder, but adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated CLL-specific PD-1 induction. Direct comparisons of PD-1 expression and function between aging CLL mice and controls identified PD-1(+) T cells in CLL as a heterogeneous population with variable effector function. This is highly relevant for therapeutic targeting of CD8(+) T cells, showing the potential of reprogramming and selective subset expansion to restore antitumor immunity.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['McClanahan, Fabienne', 'Riches, John C', 'Miller, Shaun', 'Day, William P', 'Kotsiou, Eleni', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Capasso, Melania', 'Gribben, John G']","['McClanahan F', 'Riches JC', 'Miller S', 'Day WP', 'Kotsiou E', 'Neuberg D', 'Croce CM', 'Capasso M', 'Gribben JG']","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Centre for Cancer and Inflammation, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150515,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Cd274 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Pdcd1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Aging/genetics/*immunology', 'Animals', 'B7-H1 Antigen/*physiology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",,,2015/05/17 06:00,2015/10/07 06:00,['2015/05/17 06:00'],"['2015/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31459-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-02-626754 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jul 9;126(2):212-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-02-626754.

Although imatinib is the standard treatment for Ph+ leukemia, response rate of Ph+ ALL to imatinib is low, relapse is frequent and quick. Studies have documented the potential anti-tumor activities of curcumin. However, whether curcumin can be used in the therapy for Ph+ ALL remains obscure. Here, we reported that curcumin induced apoptosis by inhibition of AKT/mTOR and ABL/STAT5 signaling, down-regulation of BCR/ABL expression, and induction of the BCL2/BAX imbalance. Curcumin exerted synergetic anti-leukemia effects with imatinib by inhibition of the imatinib-mediated overactivation of AKT/mTOR signaling and down-regulation of BCR/ABL gene expression. In primary samples from Ph+ ALL patients, curcumin inhibited cellular proliferation and down-regulated constitutive activation of growth-signaling pathways not only in newly diagnosed patients but also in imatinib-resistant patients. In Ph+ ALL mouse models, curcumin exhibited synergetic anti-leukemia effects with imatinib.

Its numerous side effects include: hyperlipidemia, arthralgias, noncardiac peripheral edema, thrombotic microangiopathy and interstitial pneumonitis. SR-associated pneumonitis is a rare but potentially serious complication due to its increasing utilization in transplant patients. PATIENT AND METHOD: We report the case of a patient undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with severe respiratory distress and SR therapy. RESULTS: Microbiological tests were all negative and other complications related to transplantation were discarded. The chest computed tomography of high-resolution showed pneumonitis. The SR therapy was interrupted and treatment was started with steroids with resolution of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: SR associated pneumonitis is a potentially fatal side effect. In patients treated with SR and respiratory failure, we must suspect this complication because early recognition along with drug discontinuation and steroid treatment is essential to reverse this complication.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Characterization of these MPs is often performed by flow cytometry but there is no consensus on the appropriate negative control to use that can lead to false positive results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed MPs from platelets, B-cells, T-cells, NK-cells, monocytes, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cells. Cells were purified by positive magnetic-separation and cultured for 48h. Cells and MPs were characterized using the following monoclonal antibodies (CD19,20 for B-cells, CD3,8,5,27 for T-cells, CD16,56 for NK-cells, CD14,11c for monocytes, CD41,61 for platelets). Isolated MPs were stained with annexin-V-FITC and gated between 300nm and 900nm. The latex bead technique was then performed for easy detection of MPs. Samples were analyzed by Transmission (TEM) and Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Annexin-V positive events within a gate of 300-900nm were detected and defined as MPs. Our results confirmed that the characteristic antigens CD41/CD61 were found on platelet-derived-MPs validating our technique. However, for MPs derived from other cell types, we were unable to detect any antigen, although they were clearly expressed on the MP-producing cells in the contrary of several data published in the literature. Using the latex bead technique, we confirmed detection of CD41,61. However, the apparent expression of other antigens (already deemed positive in several studies) was determined to be false positive, indicated by negative controls (same labeling was used on MPs from different origins). CONCLUSION: We observed that mother cell antigens were not always detected on corresponding MPs by direct flow cytometry or latex bead cytometry. Our data highlighted that false positive results could be generated due to antibody aspecificity and that phenotypic characterization of MPs is a difficult field requiring the use of several negative controls.",,"['Crompot, Emerence', 'Van Damme, Michael', 'Duvillier, Hugues', 'Pieters, Karlien', 'Vermeesch, Marjorie', 'Perez-Morga, David', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Mineur, Philippe', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Lagneaux, Laurence', 'Stamatopoulos, Basile']","['Crompot E', 'Van Damme M', 'Duvillier H', 'Pieters K', 'Vermeesch M', 'Perez-Morga D', 'Meuleman N', 'Mineur P', 'Bron D', 'Lagneaux L', 'Stamatopoulos B']","['Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Hematology Department, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Parasitology, IBMM, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Parasitology, IBMM, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Gosselies, Belgium.', 'Hematology Department, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Grand Hopital de Charleroi, Gilly, Belgium.', 'Hematology Department, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150515,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*immunology', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Tests/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Microspheres', 'Monocytes/immunology']",,,2015/05/16 06:00,2016/04/20 06:00,['2015/05/16 06:00'],"['2014/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0127209 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-39420 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 15;10(5):e0127209. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0127209. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4433223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 by the methyltransferase G9a and SUV39H1 is associated with inhibition of tumor suppressor genes. We studied the effect of G9a and SUV39H1 inhibitors on viability and differentiation of AML cells and tested the cytotoxicity induced by combination of G9a and SUV39H1 inhibitors and various epigenetic drugs. The SUV39H1 inhibitor (chaetocin) and the G9a inhibitor (UNC0638) caused cell death in AML cells at high concentrations. However, only chaetocin-induced CD11b expression and differentiation of AML cells at non-cytotoxic concentration. HL-60 and KG-1a cells were more sensitive to chaetocin than U937 cells. Long-term incubation of chaetocin led to downregulation of SUV39H1 and reduction of H3K9 tri-methylation in HL-60 and KG-1a cells. Combination of chaetocin with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor) or JQ (a BET (bromodomain extra terminal) bromodomain inhibitor) showed synergistic cytotoxicity. Conversely, no synergism was found by combining chaetocin and UNC0638. More importantly, chaetocin-induced differentiation and combined cytotoxicity were also found in the primary cells of AML patients.

The aim of this study was to quantify the relationships of diagnostic interval with these variables in 15 cancers diagnosed between 2007 and 2010 using routinely collected data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in the UK. METHODS: Symptom lists for each cancer were prepared from the literature and by consensus amongst the clinician researchers, which were then categorised into either NICE qualifying (NICE) or not (non-NICE) based on NICE Urgent Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer criteria. Multivariable linear regression models were fitted to examine the relationship between diagnostic interval (outcome) and the predictors: age, gender and symptom type. RESULTS: 18,618 newly diagnosed cancer patients aged >/=40 who had a recorded symptom in the preceding year were included in the analysis. Mean diagnostic interval was greater for older patients in four disease sites (difference in days per 10 year increase in age; 95% CI): bladder (10.3; 5.5 to 15.1; P<0.001), kidney (11.0; 3.4 to 18.6; P=0.004), leukaemia (18.5; 8.8 to 28.1; P<0.001) and lung (10.1; 6.7 to 13.4; P<0.001). There was also evidence of longer diagnostic interval in older patients with colorectal cancer (P<0.001). However, we found that mean diagnostic interval was shorter with increasing age in two cancers: gastric (-5.9; -11.7 to -0.2; P=0.04) and pancreatic (-6.0; -11.2 to -0.7; P=0.03). Diagnostic interval was longer for females in six of the gender non-specific cancers (mean difference in days; 95% CI): bladder (12.2; 0.8 to 23.6; P=0.04), colorectal (10.4; 4.3 to 16.5; P=0.001), gastric (14.3; 1.1 to 27.6; P=0.03), head and neck (31.3; 6.2 to 56.5; P=0.02), lung (8.0; 1.2 to 14.9; P=0.02), and lymphoma (19.2; 3.8 to 34.7; P=0.01). Evidence of longer diagnostic interval was found for patients presenting with non-NICE symptoms in 10 of 15 cancers (mean difference in days; 95% CI): bladder (62.9; 48.7 to 77.2; P<0.001), breast (115.1; 105.9 to 124.3; P<0.001), cervical (60.3; 31.6 to 89.0; P<0.001), colorectal (25.8; 19.6 to 31.9; P<0.001), gastric (24.1; 3.4 to 44.8; P=0.02), kidney (22.1; 4.5 to 39.7; P=0.01), oesophageal (67.0; 42.1 to 92.0; P<0.001), pancreatic (48.6; 28.1 to 69.1; P<0.001), testicular (36.7; 17.0 to 56.4; P< 0.001), and endometrial (73.8; 60.3 to 87.3; P<0.001). Pooled analysis across all cancers demonstrated highly significant evidence of differences overall showing longer diagnostic intervals with increasing age (7.8 days; 6.4 to 9.1; P<0.001); for females (8.9 days; 5.5 to 12.2; P<0.001); and in non-NICE symptoms (27.7 days; 23.9 to 31.5; P<0.001).

Aberrant expression of SALL4 is frequently associated with a more aggressive cancer phenotype, which includes high-risk MDS and its progression to AML. SALL4 contributes to leukemogenesis through multiple pathways including the repression of PTEN and the activation of HOXA9 expression.

However, there is no means to promote a licensing effect of allogeneic NK cells other than cytomegalovirus reactivation-induced licensing in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in human. In mice, a licensing process is mediated by Ly49 receptors which recognize self-major histocompatibility complex class I. The distribution of four Ly49 receptors showed similar pattern in congenic mice, B10, B10.BR, and B10.D2, which have B10 background. Forty Gy-irradiated 2 x 10(6) B10.D2 cells including splenocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells in untreated mice, or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treated mice were injected intraperitoneally into B10 mice. We found that murine NK cells were effectively licensed by intraperitoneal injection of donor neutrophils with its corresponding NK receptor ligand in B10 mice as a recipient and B10.D2 as a donor. Mechanistic studies revealed that NK cells showed the upregulation of intracellular interferon-gamma and CD107a expression as markers of NK cell activation. Moreover, enriched neutrophils enhanced licensing effect of NK cells; meanwhile, licensing effect was diminished by depletion of neutrophils.

To gain insight into the role of isolated fragments in NPM1 activities, we dissected the C-terminal domain (CTD) into its helical fragments. In this study, we observed the unexpected structural behavior of the peptide fragment corresponding to helix (H)2 (residues 264-277). This peptide has a strong tendency to form amyloidlike assemblies endowed with fibrillar morphology and beta-sheet structure, under physiologic conditions, as shown by circular dichroism, thioflavin T, and Congo red binding assays; dynamic light scattering; and atomic force microscopy. The aggregates are also toxic to neuroblastoma cells, as determined using 3-(4;5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction and Ca(2+) influx assays. We also found that the extension of the H2 sequence beyond its N terminus, comprising the connecting loop with H1, delayed aggregation and its associated cytotoxicity, suggesting that contiguous regions of H2 have a protective role in preventing aggregation. Our findings and those in the literature suggest that the helical structures present in the CTD are important in preventing harmful aggregation. These findings could elucidate the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) caused by NPM1 mutants. Because the CTD is not properly folded in these mutants, we hypothesize that the aggregation propensity of this NPM1 region is involved in the pathogenesis of AML. Preliminary assays on NPM1-Cter-MutA, the most frequent AML-CTD mutation, revealed its significant propensity for aggregation. Thus, the aggregation phenomena should be seriously considered in studies aimed at unveiling the molecular mechanisms of this pathology.",['(c) FASEB.'],"['Di Natale, Concetta', 'Scognamiglio, Pasqualina Liana', 'Cascella, Roberta', 'Cecchi, Cristina', 'Russo, Anna', 'Leone, Marilisa', 'Penco, Amanda', 'Relini, Annalisa', 'Federici, Luca', 'Di Matteo, Adele', 'Chiti, Fabrizio', 'Vitagliano, Luigi', 'Marasco, Daniela']","['Di Natale C', 'Scognamiglio PL', 'Cascella R', 'Cecchi C', 'Russo A', 'Leone M', 'Penco A', 'Relini A', 'Federici L', 'Di Matteo A', 'Chiti F', 'Vitagliano L', 'Marasco D']","['*Department of Pharmacy, Diagnostica e Farmaceutica Molecolari-Societa Cooperativa a Responsabilita Limitata, Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sui Peptidi Bioattivi, University of Naples ""Federico II,"" Naples, Italy;

The roles of balanced chromosomal rearrangements (BCR) specifically balanced translocations and inversions in MDS are less established. We hypothesized that BCR are commonly found in MDS and might confer important prognostic and therapeutic effect. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic, hematologic, clinical, and survival data from a total of 302 MDS patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic between the years 2002 and 2011 were collected. Direct sequencing for genes relevant in MDS pathophysiology was performed on patients with BCR. Categorical data were analyzed using the chi2 test and survival outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (8%) carried non-t(6;9) and non-inv(3) BCR. These patients had short overall survival (OS) similar to patients with poor risk cytogenetics, defined according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, which was not altered by new single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays or acquired somatic uniparental disomy lesions. Among the detected somatic mutations, only patients harboring mutations in the RNA splicing gene serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) conferred worse outcomes in this group of patients. Therapeutically, patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantations had better OS compared with patients treated with pharmacologic therapies or best supportive care only. CONCLUSION: BCR are not common in MDS and are associated with poor survival, which might be influenced by the presence of SRSF2 mutation.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Core therapy for AML has remained unchanged for nearly 30 years, and survival rates remain unsatisfactory. However, advances in the immunotherapy of AML have created opportunities for improved outcomes. Enforcing a tumor-specific immune response through the re-direction of the adaptive immune system, which links remarkable specificity with potent cytotoxic effector functions, has proven particularly compelling. This may be coupled with immune checkpoint blockade and conventional therapies for optimal effect. Engineered antibodies are currently in use in AML and the repertoire of available therapeutics will expand. NK cells have shown effectiveness in this disease. New methods to optimize their activation and the targeting of AML show potential.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-platform meta-analysis of three publically available microarray datasets related to cancer with AGR. For the top 100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we clustered functional modules of hub genes in a gene co-expression network and a protein-protein interaction network. We conducted a weighted correlation network analysis of total DEGs in microarray dataset GSE 34228. The identified DEGs were functionally enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) function and KEGG pathway. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1,033 DEGs (510 up-regulated, 523 down-regulated, and 109 novel genes). Among the top 100 up- or down-regulated DEGs, many genes were found in different types of cancers and tumors. Through integrative analysis of two systemic networks, we selected six hub DEGs (Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox1, Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 1, AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, S100 calcium binding protein A9, S100 calcium binding protein A8, and Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2) associated with calcium homeostasis and signaling, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, or chemoresistance. We confirmed a correlation of expression of these genes in the microarray dataset. CONCLUSION: Our study may lead to comprehensive insights into the complex mechanism of AGR and to novel gene expression signatures useful for further clinical studies.","['Copyright(c) 2015, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Lee, Young Seok', 'Hwang, Sun Goo', 'Kim, Jin Ki', 'Park, Tae Hwan', 'Kim, Young Rae', 'Myeong, Ho Sung', 'Kwon, Kang', 'Jang, Cheol Seong', 'Noh, Yun Hee', 'Kim, Sung Young']","['Lee YS', 'Hwang SG', 'Kim JK', 'Park TH', 'Kim YR', 'Myeong HS', 'Kwon K', 'Jang CS', 'Noh YH', 'Kim SY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Plant Genomics Laboratory, Department of Applied Plant Science, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Korean Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Plant Genomics Laboratory, Department of Applied Plant Science, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gefitinib', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['DEGs', 'Meta-analysis', 'acquired drug resistance', 'differentially expressed genes', 'gefitinib', 'microarray']",2015/05/16 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/05/16 06:00'],"['2015/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']",['12/3/153 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2015 May-Jun;12(3):153-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes harboring phenotype-associated polymorphisms for neoplasm traits can be identified using diverse bioinformatics tools. The recent availability of various protein expression datasets from normal human tissues, including the body fluids, enables for baseline expression profiling of the cancer secretome. Chemoinformatics approaches can help identify drug-like compounds from the protein 3D structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Phenome Genome Integrator (PheGenI) tool was enriched for neoplasm-associated traits. The neoplasm genes were characterized using diverse bioinformatics tools for pathways, gene ontology, genome-wide association, protein expression and functional class. Chemogenomics analysis was performed using the canSAR protein annotation tool. RESULTS: The neoplasm-associated traits segregated into 1,305 genes harboring 2,837 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Also identified were 65 open reading frames (ORFs) encompassing 137 SNPs. The neoplasm genes and the associated SNPs were classified into distinct tumor types. Protein expression in the secretome was seen for 913 of the neoplasm-associated genes, including 17 novel uncharacterized ORFs. Druggable proteins, including enzymes, transporters, channel proteins and receptors, were detected. Thirty-four novel druggable lead genes emerged from these studies, including seven cancer lead targets. Chemogenomics analysis using the canSAR protein annotation tool identified 168 active compounds (<1 muM) for the neoplasm genes in the body fluids. Among these, 7 most active lead compounds with drug-like properties (1-600 nM) were identified for the cancer lead targets, encompassing enzymes and receptors. CONCLUSION: Over seventy percent of the neoplasm trait-associated genes were detected in the body fluids, such as ascites, blood, tear, milk, semen, urine, etc. Ligand-based druggabililty analysis helped establish lead prioritization. The association of these proteins with diverse cancer types and other diseases provides a framework to develop novel diagnosis and therapy targets.","['Copyright(c) 2015, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Narayanan, Ramaswamy']",['Narayanan R'],"['Department of Biological Sciences, Charles E.

FLT3 inhibitors such as sorafenib may improve outcome, but only few patients display long-term responses, prompting the search for underlying resistance mechanisms and therapeutic strategies to overcome them. Here we identified that the nuclear factor of activated T cells, NFATc1, is frequently overexpressed in FLT3-ITD-positive (FLT3-ITD+) AML. NFATc1 knockdown using inducible short hairpin RNA or pharmacological NFAT inhibition with cyclosporine A (CsA) or VIVIT significantly augmented sorafenib-induced apoptosis of FLT3-ITD+ cells. CsA also potently overcame sorafenib resistance in FLT3-ITD+ cell lines and primary AML. Vice versa, de novo expression of a constitutively nuclear NFATc1-mutant mediated instant and robust sorafenib resistance in vitro. Intriguingly, FLT3-ITD+ AML patients (n=26) who received CsA as part of their rescue chemotherapy displayed a superior outcome when compared with wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) AML patients.

Here, we describe two 10-color panels of surface markers (screening and comprehensive panel) applied at the Flow Cytometry Laboratory, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada. A 10-color flow cytometry is applied using the stain-lyse-wash sample preparation method. In patients with <10% blasts and no clear involvement by hematological malignancy based on cytomorphological evaluation of bone marrow (BM) smear, the recently published one-tube 10-color 14-antibody screening panel is applied. This panel allows detection of major B- and T-cell abnormalities, enumeration of cells in blast region (CD45 dim), and gives insight into myeloid BM compartment, including calculation of four-parameter score for MDS-related abnormalities.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare native and chemically modified crude peanut extract (CPE) and major peanut allergens Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 in a mediator-release assay based on the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell line transfected with human Fcepsilon receptor. METHODS: Native Ara h 2/6 was reduced and alkylated (RA), with or without additional glutaraldehyde treatment (RAGA). CPE was reduced and alkylated. Sera of subjects with peanut allergy (16 males; median age 7 years) were used for overnight RBL-passive sensitization. Cells were stimulated with 0.1 pg/mL to 10 mug/mL of peanut. beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase release (NHR) was used as a marker of RBL degranulation, expressed as a percentage of total degranulation caused by Triton X. RESULTS: Median peanut-specific immunoglobulin E was 233 kUA/L. Nineteen subjects were responders, NHR >/= 10% in the mediator release assay. Responders had reduced NHR by RA and RAGA compared with the native Ara h 2/6. Modification resulted in a later onset of activation by 10- to 100-fold in concentration and a lowering of the maximum release. Modified RA-Ara h 2/6 and RAGA-Ara h 2/6 caused significantly lower maximum mediator release than native Ara h 2/6, at protein concentrations 0.1, 1, and 10 ng/mL (p < 0.001, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively, for RA; and < 0.001, 0.026, and 0.041, respectively, for RAGA). RA-CPE caused significantly lower maximum NHR than native CPE, at protein concentration 1 ng/mL (p < 0.001) and 10 ng/mL (p < 0.002). Responders had high rAra h 2 immunoglobulin E (mean, 61.1 kUA/L; p < 0.001) and higher NHR in mediator release assay to native Ara h 2/6 than CPE, which indicates that Ara h 2/6 were the most relevant peanut allergens in these responders. CONCLUSIONS: Chemical modification of purified native Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 reduced mediator release in an in vitro assay approximately 100-fold, which indicates decreased allergenicity for further development of the alternative candidate for safe peanut immunotherapy.",,"['Bencharitiwong, Ramon', 'van der Kleij, Hanneke P M', 'Koppelman, Stef J', 'Nowak-Wegrzyn, Anna']","['Bencharitiwong R', 'van der Kleij HP', 'Koppelman SJ', 'Nowak-Wegrzyn A']","['Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Allergy Asthma Proc,Allergy and asthma proceedings,9603640,"['0 (2S Albumins, Plant)', '0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Ara h 2 allergen, Arachis hypogaea)', '0 (Ara h 6 allergen, Arachis hypogaea)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['2S Albumins, Plant/immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Allergens/chemistry/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Plant/immunology', 'Arachis/*adverse effects/chemistry', 'Basophils/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood/immunology', 'Male', 'Peanut Hypersensitivity/blood/*immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",,,2015/05/16 06:00,2016/02/04 06:00,['2015/05/16 06:00'],"['2015/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2500/aap.2015.36.3840 [doi]'],ppublish,Allergy Asthma Proc. 2015 May-Jun;36(3):185-91. doi: 10.2500/aap.2015.36.3840.,,PMC4405596,,['Allergy Asthma Proc. 2015 May-Jun;36(3):236.

Therefore, a tendency to inflammatory states developing within oral mucosa is often observed. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of disturbed immunity on the gum condition in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) during anti-tumour treatment and to compare saliva interleukin-2 (IL-2) concentration in relation to the condition of gums oral mucositis-must be removed in children with ALL. METHODS: The study included 78 children with ALL in followed three examinations and a control group included 78 healthy children. Dental examination of the children with ALL and the control group included the evaluation of gingival condition by gingival index (GI). Children's unstimulated saliva samples were taken, and IL-2 concentration was determined by Human IL-2 EIA. RESULTS: Mean GI higher than 1 was observed in 3.17 % children with ALL. The results found higher frequency of gingival inflammations in children with ALL on chemotherapy compared with the healthy controls. A comparison of results for a given patient during anti-tumour therapy with regard to salivary IL-2 showed significant differences between examination 2 and examination 3. The results indicated that IL-2 level in saliva was twice higher in a patient during chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in salivary level of the proinflammatory IL-2 cytokine in ALL children during chemotherapy may cause pathological changes in the condition of the gums. An increase in salivary IL-2 level most probably results from a micro-injury of oral mucosa following administration of cytostatics, which in turn may cause oral mucositis in children with ALL.",,"['Pels, Elzbieta']",['Pels E'],"['Chair and Department of Paedodontics, Medical University, Lublin, Karmelicka 7 St., 20-081, Lublin, Poland, elzbieta.pels@umlub.pl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150516,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism', 'Saliva/immunology/*metabolism', 'Stomatitis/immunology/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2015/05/16 06:00,2015/10/09 06:00,['2015/05/16 06:00'],"['2015/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-015-2750-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2015 Jul;76(1):205-10. doi: 10.1007/s00280-015-2750-7.

In this setting, a comparison of idarubicin and daunorubicin has never been carried out. Two similar clinical trials using ATRA and chemotherapy for newly diagnosed APL were compared using matched-pair analysis. One was conducted by the PETHEMA/HOVON group with idarubicin and the other by the International Consortium on APL (IC-APL) using daunorubicin. Three hundred and fifty patients from the PETHEMA/HOVON cohort were matched with 175 patients in the IC-APL cohort, adjusting for the significantly unbalanced presenting features of the two entire cohorts. Complete remission (CR) rate was significantly higher in the PETHEMA/HOVON (94 %) than in the IC-APL cohort (85 %) (P = 0.002). The distribution of causes of induction failure and the time to achieve CR were similar in both cohorts. Patients who achieved CR had comparable cumulative incidence of relapse and disease-free survival rates, but lower overall and event-free survivals were observed in the IC-APL cohort, which was mainly due to a higher death rate during induction therapy. A higher death rate during consolidation therapy was also observed in the IC-APL. These results show that daunorubicin and idarubicin have similar antileukaemic efficacy in terms of primary resistance, molecular persistence, as well as molecular and haematological relapse rates when combined with ATRA in treatment of APL. However, a higher toxic death rate during induction and consolidation therapy was observed in the IC-APL cohort.

Using the 2008 WHO criteria, there were 89 acute myeloid leukemia-not otherwise specified (56%) and 43 acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (27%), while 27 cases were ambiguous as to myelodysplasia-related changes status due to limited maturing cells (acute myeloid leukemia-not evaluable, 17%).

PTCL-NOS in this patient progressed to leukemic phase, whereas Hodgkin's lymphoma disappeared with standard chemotherapies within 4 years of the initial diagnosis. Leukemic-phase PTCL-NOS was refractory to several chemotherapies. However, auto-PBSCT following high-dose chemotherapy combined with pre- and post-transplant mogamulizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody to CCR4, provided persistent complete remission of PTCL-NOS, despite residual gammadeltaTCR+ in the transplanted stem cell product, suggesting a purging effect of mogamulizumab. At 15 months after transplantation, we also found markedly fewer effector regulatory T cells, which may have contributed to prolonged remission.

Owing to a marked heterogeneity of response to daratumumab therapy in MM, we investigated determinants of the sensitivity of MM cells toward daratumumab-mediated ADCC and CDC. In bone marrow samples from 144 MM patients, we observed no difference in daratumumab-mediated lysis between newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory patients. However, we discovered, next to an expected effect of effector (natural killer cells/monocytes) to target (MM cells) ratio on ADCC, a significant association between CD38 expression and daratumumab-mediated ADCC (127 patients), as well as CDC (56 patients). Similarly, experiments with isogenic MM cell lines expressing different levels of CD38 revealed that the level of CD38 expression is an important determinant of daratumumab-mediated ADCC and CDC.

However, the detection of MRD by flow cytometric immunophenotyping is technically challenging, and an automated method to detect MRD is therefore desirable. viSNE, a recently developed computational tool based on the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm, has been shown to be capable of detecting synthetic ""MRD-like"" populations of leukemic cells created in vitro, but whether viSNE can facilitate the immunophenotypic detection of MRD in clinical samples has not been evaluated. METHODS: We applied viSNE retrospectively to 8-color flow cytometric immunophenotyping data from normal bone marrow samples, and samples from B lymphoblastic leukemia patients with or without suspected MRD on the basis of conventional manual gating. RESULTS: In each of 14 bone marrow specimens containing MRD or suspected MRD, viSNE identified a putative MRD population; an abnormal composite immunophenotype was confirmed for the putative MRD in each case. MRD populations were not identified by viSNE in control bone marrow samples from patients with increased normal B-cell precursors, or in post-treatment samples from B lymphoblastic leukemia patients who did not have detectable MRD by manual gating. CONCLUSION: viSNE shows promise as an automated method to facilitate immunophenotypic MRD detection in patients treated for B lymphoblastic leukemia.",['(c) 2015 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['DiGiuseppe, Joseph A', 'Tadmor, Michelle D', ""Pe'er, Dana""]","['DiGiuseppe JA', 'Tadmor MD', ""Pe'er D""]","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150602,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Here, the development of a prodrug of the canonical broad-spectrum HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is described. Although hydroxamic acids are utilized universally in the development of metalloenzyme inhibitors, they are considered to be poor pharmacophores with reduced activity in vivo. We developed a prodrug of SAHA by appending a promoiety, sensitive to thiols, to the hydroxamic acid warhead (termed SAHA-TAP). After incubation of SAHA-TAP with an HDAC, the thiol of a conserved HDAC cysteine residue becomes covalently tagged with the promoiety, initiating a cascade reaction that leads to the release of SAHA. Mass spectrometry and enzyme kinetics experiments validate that the cysteine residue is covalently appended with the TAP promoiety. SAHA-TAP demonstrates cytotoxicity activity against various cancer cell lines.

The bone marrow stromal environment protects leukaemia cells from chemotherapy (i.e., stroma-induced chemoresistance), eventually leading to recurrence. Our goal is to delineate the mechanisms underlying stroma-mediated chemoresistance in AML. We used two human bone marrow stromal cell lines, HS-5 and HS-27A, which are equally effective in protecting AML cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in AML-stromal co-cultures. We found that CYR61 was highly expressed by stromal cells, and was upregulated in AML cells by both stromal cell lines. CYR61 is a secreted matricellular protein and is associated with cell-intrinsic chemoresistance in other malignancies. Here, we show that blocking stromal CYR61 activity, by neutralization or RNAi, increased mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis in AML cells in AML-stromal co-cultures, providing functional evidence for its role in stroma-mediated chemoresistance. Further, we found that spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) mediates CYR61 signalling. Exposure to stroma increased SYK expression and activation in AML cells, and this increase required CYR61. SYK inhibition reduced stroma-dependent mitoxantrone resistance in the presence of CYR61, but not in its absence. Therefore, SYK is downstream of CYR61 and contributes to CYR61-mediated mitoxantrone resistance. The CYR61-SYK pathway represents a potential target for reducing stroma-induced chemoresistance.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Long, Xin', 'Yu, Yang', 'Perlaky, Laszlo', 'Man, Tsz-Kwong', 'Redell, Michele S']","['Long X', 'Yu Y', 'Perlaky L', 'Man TK', 'Redell MS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150514,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCN1 protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine-Rich Protein 61)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cysteine-Rich Protein 61/*biosynthesis', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['adhesion', 'drug resistance', 'marrow stroma', 'myeloid leukaemia', 'signalling']",2015/05/15 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13492 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Sep;170(5):704-18. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13492.

Pre-leukemic myeloproliferative changes in DS foetal livers precede the acquisition of GATA1 mutations, transient myeloproliferative disorder (DS-TMD) and acute megakaryocytic leukemia (DS-AMKL). Trisomy of the Erg gene is required for myeloproliferation in the Ts(1716)65Dn DS mouse model. We demonstrate here that genetic changes specifically attributable to trisomy of Erg lead to lineage priming of primitive and early multipotential progenitor cells in Ts(1716)65Dn mice, excess megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors, and malignant myeloproliferation. Gene expression changes dependent on trisomy of Erg in Ts(1716)65Dn multilineage progenitor cells were correlated with those associated with trisomy of HSA21 in human DS hematopoietic stem and primitive progenitor cells. These data suggest a role for ERG as a regulator of hematopoietic lineage potential, and that trisomy of ERG in the context of DS foetal liver hemopoiesis drives the pre-leukemic changes that predispose to subsequent DS-TMD and DS-AMKL.",,"['Ng, Ashley P', 'Hu, Yifang', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Hyland, Craig D', 'Ierino, Helen', 'Phipson, Belinda', 'Wu, Di', 'Baldwin, Tracey M', 'Kauppi, Maria', 'Kiu, Hiu', 'Di Rago, Ladina', 'Hilton, Douglas J', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Alexander, Warren S']","['Ng AP', 'Hu Y', 'Metcalf D', 'Hyland CD', 'Ierino H', 'Phipson B', 'Wu D', 'Baldwin TM', 'Kauppi M', 'Kiu H', 'Di Rago L', 'Hilton DJ', 'Smyth GK', 'Alexander WS']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Research, Monash Institute of Medical Research, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia; Department of Statistics, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150514,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (ERG protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics', 'Erythroid Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Transcriptome', '*Trisomy']",,,2015/05/15 06:00,2016/04/28 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1005211 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-14-02382 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2015 May 14;11(5):e1005211. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005211. eCollection 2015 May.,,PMC4431731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the incidence and risk factors of HBV reactivation in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are rarely investigated. METHODS: AML patients followed-up at the National Taiwan University Hospital between 2006 and 2012 were analyzed. The clinical characteristics and laboratory data were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety patients comprising 265 men and 225 women were studied. The median age was 52 years (range, 18 - 94). Chronic HBV carriage was documented at the time of leukemia diagnosis in 57 (11.6%) patients. Forty-six (80.7%) of the 57 HBV carriers received prophylaxis with anti-HBV agents. Sixteen HBV carriers (28.1%) developed hepatitis B reactivation during or after chemotherapy, including 7 patients who had discontinued antiviral therapy. The incidence of hepatitis B reactivation among AML patients with HBV carriage was 9.5 per 100 person-years. Prophylaxis with anti-HBV agents significantly decreased the risk of hepatitis B reactivation among HBV carriers (13% vs. 61%, p<0.001). Four (2.8%) of 142 patients with initial positive anti-HBsAb and anti-HBcAb experienced hepatitis B reactivation and lost their protective anti-HBsAb. Multivariate analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus (p=0.008, odds ratio (OR) = 2.841, 95% confident interval (CI): 0.985-8.193) and carriage of HBsAg (p<0.001, OR=36.878, 95% CI: 11.770-115.547) were independent risk factors for hepatitis B reactivation in AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis B reactivation is not uncommon in the HBsAg positive AML patients.

METHODS: Relevant electronic databases were searched for studies characterizing the associated risk of overall malignancy in patients with AASV. Standardized incidence rates (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of association. We tested for publication bias and heterogeneity and stratified for site-specific cancers. RESULTS: Six studies (n = 2,578) were eventually identified, of which six provided the SIR for overall malignancy, five reported the SIR for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), four for leukemia, five for bladder cancer, three for lymphoma, three for liver cancer, four for lung cancer, three for kidney cancer, four for prostate cancer, four for colon cancer and four for breast cancer. Overall, the pooled SIR of cancer in AASV patients was 1.74 (95%CI = 1.37-2.21), with moderate heterogeneity among these studies (I(2) = 65.8%, P = 0.012). In sub-analyses for site-specific cancers, NMSC, leukemia and bladder cancer were more frequently observed in patients with AASV with SIR of 5.18 (95%CI = 3.47-7.73), 4.89 (95%CI = 2.93-8.16) and 3.84 (95%CI = 2.72-5.42) respectively. There was no significant increase in the risk of kidney cancer (SIR = 2.12, 95%CI = 0.66-6.85), prostate cancer (SIR = 1.45, 95%CI = 0.87-2.42), colon cancer (SIR = 1.26, 95%CI = 0.70-2.27), and breast cancer (SIR = 0.95, 95%CI = 0.50-1.79). Among these site-specific cancers, only NMSC showed moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 55.8%, P = 0.06). No publication bias was found by using the Begg's test and Egger's test. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that AASV patients treatment with cyclophosphamide (CYC) are at increased risk of late-occurring malignancies, particularly of the NMSC, leukemia and bladder cancer. However, there is no significant association between AASV and kidney cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer and breast cancer. These findings emphasize monitoring and preventative management in AASV patients after cessation of CYC therapy is momentous.",,"['Shang, Weifeng', 'Ning, Yong', 'Xu, Xiu', 'Li, Menglan', 'Guo, Shuiming', 'Han, Min', 'Zeng, Rui', 'Ge, Shuwang', 'Xu, Gang']","['Shang W', 'Ning Y', 'Xu X', 'Li M', 'Guo S', 'Han M', 'Zeng R', 'Ge S', 'Xu G']","['Department of Nephrology, Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150514,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis/*complications/drug therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced/etiology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/chemically induced/etiology']",,,2015/05/15 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0126016 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-54683 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 14;10(5):e0126016. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0126016. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4431871,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Childhood leukemia occurs in nearly a third of all patients newly diagnosed with pediatric cancer. only a small percentage of these new cases of childhood leukemia are associated with high penetrant hereditary cancer syndromes. Childhood leukemia, especially acute lymphoblastic leukemia, has been associated with a dysregulated immune system due to delayed infectious exposure at a young age. Identical twins with childhood leukemia suggest that acute lymphoblastic leukemia begins in utero and that the concordant presentation is due to a shared preleukemia subclone via placental transfer. Investigation of single nucleotide polymorphisms within candidate genes find that leukemia risk may be attributed to population-based polymorphisms affecting folate metabolism, xenobiotic metabolism, DNA repair, immunity, and B-cell development. More recently, genome-wide association studies for leukemia risk has led investigators to genes associated with B-cell development. When describing leukemia predisposition due to hereditary cancer syndromes, the following 6 categories become apparent on the basis of biology and clinical presentation: (1) genetic instability/DNA repair syndromes, (2) cell cycle/differentiation syndromes, (3) bone marrow failure syndromes, (4) telomere maintenance syndromes, (5) immunodeficiency syndromes, and (6) transcription factor syndromes and pure familial leukemia. understanding the molecular epidemiology of childhood leukemia can affect the treatment and tumor surveillance strategies for these high risk patients and their family members.",['Copyright (c) 2016 American Federation for Medical Research.'],"['Schiffman, Joshua D']",['Schiffman JD'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160111,England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,,IM,"['Child', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Inheritance Patterns/genetics', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*genetics', '*Molecular Epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA repair', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cancer predisposition', 'childhood leukemia', 'familial leukemia', 'genetic instability', 'genome wide association study', 'inherited cancer syndrome', 'inherited leukemia', 'molecular epidemiology']",2015/05/15 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2015/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JIM.0000000000000204 [pii]', '10.1097/JIM.0000000000000204 [doi]']",ppublish,J Investig Med. 2016 Feb;64(2):355-60. doi: 10.1097/JIM.0000000000000204.

It binds specifically to the CD20 antigen expressed on pre-B and consequently on mature B-lymphocytes of both normal and malignant cells, inhibiting their proliferation through apoptosis, CDC, and ADCC mechanisms. The immunomodulatory activity of rituximab is closely related to critical quality attributes that characterize its chemical composition and spatial configuration, which determine the recognition of CD20 and the binding to receptors or factors involved in its effector functions, while regulating the potential immunogenic response. Herein, we present a physicochemical and biological characterization followed by a pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity study to demonstrate comparability between two products containing rituximab. The physicochemical and biological characterization revealed that both products fit within the same response intervals exhibiting the same degree of variability. With regard to clinical response, both products depleted CD20+ B-cells until posttreatment recovery and no meaningful differences were found in their pharmacodynamic profiles.

Among them, more than 100 oncogenes, 20-30 tumor-suppressor genes, and hundreds of genes participating in DNA repair and replication have been found to play a role in the origins of cancer over the last 25 years. The phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues is a critical step in cellular growth and development and is achieved through the tight regulation of protein kinases. Phosphorylation plays a major role in eukaryotic signaling as kinase domains are found in 2% of our genes. The deregulation of kinase control mechanisms has disastrous consequences, often leading to gains of function, cell transformation, and cancer. The c-Abl kinase protein is one of the most studied targets in the fight against cancer and is a hotspot for drug development because it participates in several solid tumors and is the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Tumor suppressors have the opposite effects. Their fundamental role in the maintenance of genomic integrity has awarded them a role as the guardians of DNA. Among the tumor suppressors, p53 is the most studied. The p53 protein has been shown to be a transcription factor that recognizes and binds to specific DNA response elements and activates gene transcription. Stress triggered by ionizing radiation or other mutagenic events leads to p53 phosphorylation and cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or programed cell death. The p53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer. Mutations in the DNA-binding domain are classified as class I or class II depending on whether substitutions occur in the DNA contact sites or in the protein core, respectively. Tumor-associated p53 mutations often lead to the loss of protein function, but recent investigations have also indicated gain-of-function mutations. The prion-like aggregation of mutant p53 is associated with loss-of-function, dominant-negative, and gain-of-function effects. In the current review, we focused on the most recent insights into the protein structure and function of the c-Abl and p53 proteins that will provide us guidance to understand the loss and gain of function of these misfolded tumor-associated proteins.",,"['de Oliveira, Guilherme A P', 'Rangel, Luciana P', 'Costa, Danielly C', 'Silva, Jerson L']","['de Oliveira GA', 'Rangel LP', 'Costa DC', 'Silva JL']","['Programa de Biologia Estrutural, Instituto de Bioquimica Medica Leopoldo de Meis, Instituto Nacional de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem, Centro Nacional de Ressonancia Magnetica Nuclear Jiri Jonas, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil.', 'Programa de Biologia Estrutural, Instituto de Bioquimica Medica Leopoldo de Meis, Instituto Nacional de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem, Centro Nacional de Ressonancia Magnetica Nuclear Jiri Jonas, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil ; Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil.', 'Programa de Biologia Estrutural, Instituto de Bioquimica Medica Leopoldo de Meis, Instituto Nacional de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem, Centro Nacional de Ressonancia Magnetica Nuclear Jiri Jonas, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil.', 'Programa de Biologia Estrutural, Instituto de Bioquimica Medica Leopoldo de Meis, Instituto Nacional de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem, Centro Nacional de Ressonancia Magnetica Nuclear Jiri Jonas, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150429,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'kinases', 'misfolding', 'signaling', 'tumor suppressor']",2015/05/15 06:00,2015/05/15 06:01,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2015/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2015.00097 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2015 Apr 29;5:97. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2015.00097. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4413674,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we identified that oligomerization activity allows CARD16 to function as a CASP1 activator. We investigated the molecular characteristics of CARD16 and CARD17 in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Although both CARD16 and CARD17 interacted with CASP1CARD, only CARD16 formed a homo-oligomer. Oligomerized CARD16 formed a filament-like structure with CASP1CARD and a speck with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD. A filament-like structure formed by CARD16 promoted CASP1 filament assembly and IL-1beta release. In contrast, CARD17 did not form a homo-oligomer or filaments and inhibited CASP1-dependent IL-1beta release. Mutated CARD16D27G, mimicking the CARD17 amino acid sequence, formed a homo-oligomer but failed to form a filament-like structure.

Here reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were proven essential for the differentiation of APL cells. A down-regulation of ROS by ROS quencher (NAC) blocked the differentiation of APL cell line NB4 while an over-expression of ROS by superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) RNA interference (RNAi) increased cell differentiation. HMGB1 was vital for the differentiation of ROS-mediated NB4 cells and its up-regulation promoted ATRA-induced autophagy and the degradation of PML-RARalpha. Furthermore, ATRA treatment elevated the levels of ROS, enhanced autophagic flux and thereby promoted cytosolic translocation of HMGB1. HMGB1 regulated the interactions between ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein p62/SQSTM and PML-RARalpha so as to affect the degradation of PML-RARalpha during ATRA-induced autophagy. Also a depletion of p62/SQSTM1 expression inhibited HMGB1-mediated PML-RARalpha degradation and cell differentiation.

This study shows a new evidence of NO as a mediator of acute leukemia cell death induced by fisetin, a promising chemotherapeutic agent. Fisetin was able to kill THP-1 cells in vivo resulting in tumor shrinkage in the mouse xenograft model. Death induction in vitro was mediated by an increase in NO resulting in double strand DNA breaks and the activation of both the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Double strand DNA breaks could be reduced if NO inhibitor was present during fisetin treatment. Fisetin also inhibited the downstream components of the mTORC1 pathway through downregulation of levels of p70 S6 kinase and inducing hypo-phosphorylation of S6 Ri P kinase, eIF4B and eEF2K. NO inhibition restored phosphorylation of downstream effectors of mTORC1 and rescued cells from death. Fisetin induced Ca(2+) entry through L-type Ca(2+) channels and abrogation of Ca(2+) influx reduced caspase activation and cell death. NO increase and increased Ca(2+) were independent phenomenon. It was inferred that apoptotic death of acute monocytic leukemia cells was induced by fisetin through increased generation of NO and elevated Ca(2+) entry activating the caspase dependent apoptotic pathways.

Our results suggest that CD317 expression might be of prognostic significance for B-CLL, and CD317 could be used as a new marker for minimal residual disease detection in B-ALL.",,"['Gong, Shunyou', 'Osei, Ebenezer S', 'Kaplan, David', 'Chen, Youhai H', 'Meyerson, Howard']","['Gong S', 'Osei ES', 'Kaplan D', 'Chen YH', 'Meyerson H']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University Cleveland 44106, Ohio, USA ; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia 19104, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University Cleveland 44106, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University Cleveland 44106, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia 19104, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University Cleveland 44106, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150201,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (BST2 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['B lymphocytes', 'CD317', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",2015/05/15 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2015 Feb 1;8(2):1613-21. eCollection 2015.,"['R01 AI050059/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI050059/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-050059/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4396245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that EBV serological patterns can be useful to identify different stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. METHODS: Information on 150 cases with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 157 frequency-matched (by age, sex and region) population-based controls from a Spanish multicentre case-control study was obtained. EBV immunoglobulin G serostatus was evaluated through a peptide-based ELISA and further by immunoblot analysis to EBV early antigens (EA), nuclear antigen (EBNA1), VCA-p18, VCA-p40 and Zebra. Two independent individuals categorized the serological patterns of the western blot analysis. Patients with very high response and diversity in EBV-specific polypeptides, in particular with clear responses to EA-associated proteins, were categorized as having an abnormal reactive pattern (ab_EBV). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Almost all subjects were EBV-IgG positive (>95% of cases and controls) whereas ab_EBV patterns were detected in 23% of cases (N = 34) and 11% of controls (N = 17; OR: 2.44, 95% CI, 1.29 to 4.62; P = 0.006), particularly in intermediate/high risk patients. Although based on small numbers, the association was modified by smoking with a gradual reduction of ab_EBV-related OR for all Rai stages from never smokers to current smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Highly distinct EBV antibody diversity patterns revealed by immunoblot analysis were detected in cases compared to controls, detectable at very early stages of the disease and particularly among non smokers. This study provides further evidence of an abnormal immunological response against EBV in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",,"['Casabonne, Delphine', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'Robles, Claudia', 'Costas, Laura', 'Alonso, Esther', 'Gonzalez-Barca, Eva', 'Tardon, Adonina', 'Dierssen-Sotos, Trinidad', 'Vazquez, Eva Gimeno', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Campo, Elias', 'Castano-Vinyals, Gemma', 'Aragones, Nuria', 'Pollan, Marina', 'Kogevinas, Manolis', 'Juwana, Hedy', 'Middeldorp, Jaap', 'de Sanjose, Silvia']","['Casabonne D', 'Benavente Y', 'Robles C', 'Costas L', 'Alonso E', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Tardon A', 'Dierssen-Sotos T', 'Vazquez EG', 'Aymerich M', 'Campo E', 'Castano-Vinyals G', 'Aragones N', 'Pollan M', 'Kogevinas M', 'Juwana H', 'Middeldorp J', 'de Sanjose S']","[""Unit of Infections and Cancer (UNIC), IDIBELL, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Av.

The aim of this study was to use microarray-based expression profiling to evaluate the quality and consistency of PG2 from three different product batches and to study biological mechanisms of PG2. An integrative molecular analysis approach has been designed to examine significant PG2-induced signatures in HL-60 leukemia cells. A quantitative analysis of gene expression signatures was conducted for PG2 by hierarchical clustering of correlation coefficients. The results showed that PG2 product batches were consistent and of high quality. These batches were also functionally equivalent to each other with regard to how they modulated the immune and hematopoietic systems. Within the PG2 signature, there were five genes associated with doxorubicin: IL-8, MDM4, BCL2, PRODH2, and BIRC5. Moreover, the combination of PG2 and doxorubicin had a synergistic effect on induced cell death in HL-60 cells.

An expression of the altered metabolic pathway utilization is the selection of metabolites consumed and released by cells. However, methods for the inference of intracellular metabolic states from extracellular measurements in the context of metabolic models remain underdeveloped compared to methods for other omics data. Herein, we describe a workflow for such an integrative analysis emphasizing on extracellular metabolomics data. We demonstrate, using the lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines Molt-4 and CCRF-CEM, how our methods can reveal differences in cell metabolism. Our models explain metabolite uptake and secretion by predicting a more glycolytic phenotype for the CCRF-CEM model and a more oxidative phenotype for the Molt-4 model, which was supported by our experimental data. Gene expression analysis revealed altered expression of gene products at key regulatory steps in those central metabolic pathways, and literature query emphasized the role of these genes in cancer metabolism. Moreover, in silico gene knock-outs identified unique control points for each cell line model, e.g., phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase for the Molt-4 model. Thus, our workflow is well-suited to the characterization of cellular metabolic traits based on extracellular metabolomic data, and it allows the integration of multiple omics data sets into a cohesive picture based on a defined model context.",,"['Aurich, Maike K', 'Paglia, Giuseppe', 'Rolfsson, Ottar', 'Hrafnsdottir, Sigrun', 'Magnusdottir, Manuela', 'Stefaniak, Magdalena M', 'Palsson, Bernhard O', 'Fleming, Ronan M T', 'Thiele, Ines']","['Aurich MK', 'Paglia G', 'Rolfsson O', 'Hrafnsdottir S', 'Magnusdottir M', 'Stefaniak MM', 'Palsson BO', 'Fleming RM', 'Thiele I']","['Center for Systems Biology, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland ; Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Campus Belval, Esch-Sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.', 'Center for Systems Biology, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Center for Systems Biology, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Center for Systems Biology, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Center for Systems Biology, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'School of Health Science, Faculty of Food Science and Nutrition, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Center for Systems Biology, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland ; Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA USA.', 'Center for Systems Biology, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland ; Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Campus Belval, Esch-Sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.', 'Center for Systems Biology, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland ; Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Campus Belval, Esch-Sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140814,United States,Metabolomics,Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,101274889,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Constraint-based modeling', 'Metabolic network', 'Metabolomics', 'Multi-omics', 'Transcriptomics']",2015/05/15 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11306-014-0721-3 [doi]', '721 [pii]']",ppublish,Metabolomics. 2015;11(3):603-619. doi: 10.1007/s11306-014-0721-3.

METHODS: Coculture experiments were performed to assess exosomic transfer of miR-21 from NBL cells to human monocytes and miR-155 from human monocytes to NBL cells. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to assess miR-155 targeting of TERF1 in NBL cells. Tumor growth was measured in NBL xenografts treated with Cisplatin and peritumoral exosomic miR-155 (n = 6 mice per group) CD163, miR-155, and TERF1 levels were assessed in 20 NBL primary tissues by Human Exon Arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Student's t test was used to evaluate the differences between treatment groups. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: miR-21 mean fold change (f.c.) was 12.08+/-0.30 (P < .001) in human monocytes treated with NBL derived exosomes for 48 hours, and miR-155 mean f.c. was 4.51+/-0.25 (P < .001) in NBL cells cocultured with human monocytes for 48 hours. TERF1 mean luciferase activity in miR-155 transfected NBL cells normalized to scrambled was 0.36 +/- 0.05 (P <.001). Mean tumor volumes in Dotap-miR-155 compared with Dotap-scrambled were 322.80+/-120mm(3) and 76.00+/-39.3mm(3), P = .002 at day 24, respectively. Patients with high CD163 infiltrating NBLs had statistically significantly higher intratumoral levels of miR-155 (P = .04) and lower levels of TERF1 mRNA (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a unique role of exosomic miR-21 and miR-155 in the cross-talk between NBL cells and human monocytes in the resistance to chemotherapy, through a novel exosomic miR-21/TLR8-NF-small ka, CyrillicB/exosomic miR-155/TERF1 signaling pathway.","['(c) The Author 2015.

Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein(+) T cells and natural Th17 cells are known to be generated by sensing a high and persistent TCR strength, whereas this is not the case for Eomes(+) CD4 T cells. These cells go through low-level signal during the entire maturation pathway, which subsequently leads to induction of high susceptibility to cytokine IL-4. This event seems to be a major determinant for the generation of this type of cell. These T cells are functionally equivalent to Th1 cells that are present in the periphery, and this event takes place both in transgenic and in wild-type mice. There is additional evidence that this type of Eomes(+) innate CD4 T cell is also present in human cord blood.","['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Kang, Byung Hyun', 'Park, Hyo Jin', 'Yum, Hye In', 'Park, Seung Pyo', 'Park, Jin Kyun', 'Kang, Eun Ha', 'Lee, Jae-Il', 'Lee, Eun Bong', 'Park, Chung-Gyu', 'Jung, Kyeong Cheon', 'Park, Seong Hoe']","['Kang BH', 'Park HJ', 'Yum HI', 'Park SP', 'Park JK', 'Kang EH', 'Lee JI', 'Lee EB', 'Park CG', 'Jung KC', 'Park SH']","['Graduate School of Immunology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea;', 'Department of Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, SungNam 463-707, Korea;', 'Graduate School of Immunology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea;', 'Transplantation Research Institute, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 110-744, Korea;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, SungNam 463-707, Korea;', 'Graduate School of Immunology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; Transplantation Research Institute, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 110-744, Korea;', 'Transplantation Research Institute, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; Translational Xenotransplantation Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; and.', 'Graduate School of Immunology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; Department of Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; Transplantation Research Institute, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 110-744, Korea pshoe@snu.ac.kr jungkc66@snu.ac.kr.', 'Graduate School of Immunology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; Transplantation Research Institute, Medical Research Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 110-799, Korea; pshoe@snu.ac.kr jungkc66@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150513,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Eomes protein, mouse)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Clonal Selection, Antigen-Mediated', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Th1 Cells/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Thymocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology/*metabolism']",,,2015/05/15 06:00,2015/08/21 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1401628 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1401628 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Jun 15;194(12):5861-71. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1401628.

This study's purpose was to compare the efficacy of Nobivac feline 2-FeLV (an inactivated, adjuvanted whole-virus vaccine) and PureVax recombinant FeLV (a live, canarypox virus-vectored vaccine) following FeLV challenge. Cats were vaccinated at 9 and 12 weeks with Nobivac feline 2-FeLV (group A, n = 11) or PureVax recombinant FeLV (group B, n = 10). Group C (n = 11) comprised unvaccinated controls. At 3 months postvaccination, cats were immunosuppressed and challenged with FeLV-A/61E. The outcomes measured were persistent antigenemia at 12 weeks postchallenge (PC) and proviral DNA and viral RNA at 3 to 9 weeks PC. Persistent antigenemia was observed in 0 of 11 cats in group A, 5 of 10 cats in group B, and 10 of 11 cats in group C. Group A was significantly protected compared to those in groups B (P < 0.013) and C (P < 0.0001). No difference was found between groups B and C (P > 0.063). The preventable fraction was 100% for group A and 45% for group B. At 9 weeks PC, proviral DNA and viral RNA were detected 1 of 11 cats in group A, 6 of 10 cats in group B, and 9 of 11 cats in group C.

However, the exact mechanism and the extent to which TET2 mutations affect DNA methylation remain in question. Here, we report on DNA methylomes in TET2 wild-type (TET2-WT) and mutant (TET2-MT) cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). We analyzed 85,134 CpG sites [28,114 sites in CpG islands (CGI) and 57,020 in non-CpG islands (NCGI)]. TET2 mutations do not explain genome-wide differences in DNA methylation in CMML, and we found few and inconsistent differences at CGIs between TET2-WT and TET2-MT cases. In contrast, we identified 409 (0.71%) TET2-specific differentially methylated CpGs (tet2-DMCs) in NCGIs, 86% of which were hypermethylated in TET2-MT cases, suggesting a strikingly different biology of the effects of TET2 mutations at CGIs and NCGIs. DNA methylation of tet2-DMCs at promoters and nonpromoters repressed gene expression. Tet2-DMCs showed significant enrichment at hematopoietic-specific enhancers marked by H3K4me1 and at binding sites for the transcription factor p300. Tet2-DMCs showed significantly lower 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in TET2-MT cases.

Conventional karyotyping provides a comprehensive view of the genome, while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detects targeted abnormalities. The aim of this study was to compare the utility of karyotyping and FISH in adult AML. METHODS: We studied 250 adult AML cases with concurrent karyotyping and FISH testing. Karyotyping was considered adequate when 20 or more metaphases were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 220 cases had adequate karyotyping and were classified as normal karyotype/normal FISH (n = 92), normal karyotype/abnormal FISH (n = 4), abnormal karyotype/normal FISH (n = 8), and abnormal karyotype/abnormal FISH (n = 116). The overall karyotype/FISH concordance rate was 97.7% with five discordant cases identified, four from the normal karyotype/abnormal FISH group and one from the abnormal karyotype/abnormal FISH group. No karyotype/FISH discordance was seen in the abnormal karyotype/normal FISH group for the FISH probes evaluated. FISH lent prognostic information in one (0.5%) of 220 cases with normal karyotype/abnormal FISH: CBFB-MYH11 fusion, indicating favorable prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: In adult AML, FISH rarely provides additional information when karyotyping is adequate. We therefore propose an evidence-based, cost-effective algorithmic approach for routine conventional karyotype and FISH testing in adult AML workup.",['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],"['He, Rong', 'Wiktor, Anne E', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Kurtin, Paul J', 'Van Dyke, Daniel L', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Howard, Matthew T', 'Reichard, Kaaren K']","['He R', 'Wiktor AE', 'Hanson CA', 'Ketterling RP', 'Kurtin PJ', 'Van Dyke DL', 'Litzow MR', 'Howard MT', 'Reichard KK']","['From the Divisions of Hematopathology and He.Rong@mayo.edu.', 'Laboratory Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, and.', 'From the Divisions of Hematopathology and.', 'Laboratory Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, and.', 'From the Divisions of Hematopathology and.', 'Laboratory Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN.', 'From the Divisions of Hematopathology and.', 'From the Divisions of Hematopathology and.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male']",['NOTNLM'],"['Genetics', 'Hematology', 'Hematopathology', 'Molecular diagnostics']",2015/05/15 06:00,2015/07/29 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['143/6/873 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPP6LVMQG4LNCK [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2015 Jun;143(6):873-8. doi: 10.1309/AJCPP6LVMQG4LNCK.,,,,['Am J Clin Pathol. 2016 Mar;145(3):430-2.

Recent reports attribute ibrutinib resistance to acquired mutations in Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (BTK), the target of ibrutinib, as well as the immediate downstream effector phospholipase C, gamma2 (PLCG2). Although the C481S mutation found in BTK has been shown to disable ibrutinib's capacity to irreversibly bind this primary target, the detailed mechanisms of mutations in PLCG2 have yet to be established. Herein, we characterize the enhanced signaling competence, BTK independence, and surface immunoglobulin dependence of the PLCG2 mutation at R665W, which has been documented in ibrutinib-resistant CLL. Our data demonstrate that this missense alteration elicits BTK-independent activation after B-cell receptor engagement, implying the formation of a novel BTK-bypass pathway. Consistent with previous results, PLCG2(R665W) confers hypermorphic induction of downstream signaling events. Our studies reveal that proximal kinases SYK and LYN are critical for the activation of mutant PLCG2 and that therapeutics targeting SYK and LYN can combat molecular resistance in cell line models and primary CLL cells from ibrutinib-resistant patients. Altogether, our results engender a molecular understanding of the identified aberration at PLCG2 and explore its functional dependency on BTK, SYK, and LYN, suggesting alternative strategies to combat acquired ibrutinib resistance.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Liu, Ta-Ming', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Zhong, Yiming', 'Lozanski, Arletta', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Dong, Shuai', 'Strattan, Ethan', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Flynn, Joseph', 'Andritsos, Leslie A', 'Maddocks, Kami', 'Jaglowski, Samantha M', 'Blum, Kristie A', 'Byrd, John C', 'Dubovsky, Jason A', 'Johnson, Amy J']","['Liu TM', 'Woyach JA', 'Zhong Y', 'Lozanski A', 'Lozanski G', 'Dong S', 'Strattan E', 'Lehman A', 'Zhang X', 'Jones JA', 'Flynn J', 'Andritsos LA', 'Maddocks K', 'Jaglowski SM', 'Blum KA', 'Byrd JC', 'Dubovsky JA', 'Johnson AJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Pathology, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150513,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Phospholipase C gamma/*genetics', 'Piperidines', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Syk Kinase', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2015/05/15 06:00,2015/10/02 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2015/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31483-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-02-626846 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jul 2;126(1):61-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-02-626846.

Encouraging clinical data have been reported with molecules such as the anti-CD19/CD3 bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) blinatumomab. However, the clinical use of many reported T cell-recruiting bispecific modalities is limited by liabilities including unfavorable pharmacokinetics, potential immunogenicity, and manufacturing challenges. We describe a B cell-targeting anti-CD20/CD3 T cell-dependent bispecific antibody (CD20-TDB), which is a full-length, humanized immunoglobulin G1 molecule with near-native antibody architecture constructed using ""knobs-into-holes"" technology. CD20-TDB is highly active in killing CD20-expressing B cells, including primary patient leukemia and lymphoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. In cynomolgus monkeys, CD20-TDB potently depletes B cells in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues at a single dose of 1 mg/kg while demonstrating pharmacokinetic properties similar to those of conventional monoclonal antibodies. CD20-TDB also exhibits activity in vitro and in vivo in the presence of competing CD20-targeting antibodies. These data provide rationale for the clinical testing of CD20-TDB for the treatment of CD20-expressing B cell malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Sun, Liping L', 'Ellerman, Diego', 'Mathieu, Mary', 'Hristopoulos, Maria', 'Chen, Xiaocheng', 'Li, Yijin', 'Yan, Xiaojie', 'Clark, Robyn', 'Reyes, Arthur', 'Stefanich, Eric', 'Mai, Elaine', 'Young, Judy', 'Johnson, Clarissa', 'Huseni, Mahrukh', 'Wang, Xinhua', 'Chen, Yvonne', 'Wang, Peiyin', 'Wang, Hong', 'Dybdal, Noel', 'Chu, Yu-Waye', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Scheer, Justin M', 'Junttila, Teemu', 'Totpal, Klara', 'Dennis, Mark S', 'Ebens, Allen J']","['Sun LL', 'Ellerman D', 'Mathieu M', 'Hristopoulos M', 'Chen X', 'Li Y', 'Yan X', 'Clark R', 'Reyes A', 'Stefanich E', 'Mai E', 'Young J', 'Johnson C', 'Huseni M', 'Wang X', 'Chen Y', 'Wang P', 'Wang H', 'Dybdal N', 'Chu YW', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Scheer JM', 'Junttila T', 'Totpal K', 'Dennis MS', 'Ebens AJ']","['Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. sun.laura@gene.com.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/immunology/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,2015/05/15 06:00,2016/02/18 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['7/287/287ra70 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa4802 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2015 May 13;7(287):287ra70. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa4802.,['R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our empirical analysis of the accuracy and convergence rate of our algorithm, CAncer PRogression Inference (CAPRI), shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms addressing similar problems. MOTIVATION: Several cancer-related genomic data have become available (e.g. The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA) typically involving hundreds of patients. At present, most of these data are aggregated in a cross-sectional fashion providing all measurements at the time of diagnosis. Our goal is to infer cancer 'progression' models from such data. These models are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of collections of 'selectivity' relations, where a mutation in a gene A 'selects' for a later mutation in a gene B. Gaining insight into the structure of such progressions has the potential to improve both the stratification of patients and personalized therapy choices. RESULTS: The CAPRI algorithm relies on a scoring method based on a probabilistic theory developed by Suppes, coupled with bootstrap and maximum likelihood inference. The resulting algorithm is efficient, achieves high accuracy and has good complexity, also, in terms of convergence properties. CAPRI performs especially well in the presence of noise in the data, and with limited sample sizes. Moreover CAPRI, in contrast to other approaches, robustly reconstructs different types of confluent trajectories despite irregularities in the data. We also report on an ongoing investigation using CAPRI to study atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, in which we uncovered non trivial selectivity relations and exclusivity patterns among key genomic events.

Although additional options represent progress, the availability of 3 second-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) and 1 third-generation TKI (ponatinib) has added complexity to the treatment paradigm for CML, particularly CML in the chronic phase. Two second-generation agents (dasatinib and nilotinib) are approved for use as first-line and subsequent therapy. Thus, the appropriate sequencing of TKIs is a frequent quandary, and is incompletely addressed in clinical guidelines. Here, we review studies that might guide selection of a second- or third-generation TKI after failure of TKI therapy in patients with chronic-phase CML. These studies evaluate prognostic factors such as first-line cytogenetic response and BCR-ABL1 mutation status, which might help physicians identify patients who are likely to respond to second-generation TKIs, and those for whom ponatinib or an investigational agent might be more appropriate. We summarize evidence to date that suggests that use of a second-generation TKI as third-line therapy confers limited value in most CML patients, and we also explore the utility of current event-free survival versus traditional outcomes to predict long-term benefits of sequential TKI use. Finally, we present 3 case studies to illustrate how prognostic factors and other considerations (eg, tolerability) can be used to individualize subsequent therapy in cases of TKI resistance or intolerance.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: We included 5,409 adult AML cases diagnosed between 1961 and 2005 in Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden and 27,045 controls matched by age, sex, and country. Lifetime occupational ELF-MF exposure and risk of electrical shocks were assigned to jobs reported in the censuses using job-exposure matrices. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) using conditional logistic regression adjusted for concurrent occupational exposures relevant for AML risk (e.g., benzene, ionizing radiation). We conducted sensitivity analyses with different assumptions to assess the robustness of our results. RESULTS: Approximately 40 % of the subjects were ever occupationally exposed to low levels and 7 % to high levels of ELF-MF, whereas 18 % were ever at low risk and 15 % at high risk of electrical shocks. We did not observe an association between occupational exposure to neither ELF-MF nor electrical shocks and AML.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to analyze NHL patients diagnosed between January 1997 and December 2010 in Taiwan. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were applied to compare the risk of SPMs in NHL patients and the general population. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent predictors of SPM. RESULT: NHL patients have a significantly greater risk of developing SPM [SIR 1.43; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.32-1.55; p < 0.001). A significantly high SIR was noted for leukemia, myeloma, and neoplasms of the bone and soft tissue, thyroid, central nervous system, skin, stomach, head and neck, liver and biliary tract, and the lungs and mediastinum. Multivariate analysis revealed that age >/=60 years [hazard ratios (HR) 2.04], being male (HR 1.22), comorbidities of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.34), liver cirrhosis (HR 1.50), hepatitis C infection (HR 1.94) and therapy containing radiotherapy (HR 1.38) were the significant predictors for SPM occurrence. The median follow-up time and survival time were 3.37 and 9.45 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: This Taiwanese population-based study provides updated data about the risk of SPM in NHL patients, demonstrating an approximately 1.5 time greater risk of SPM compared to the general population. A high risk of SPM for myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma is unique to Asian patients.",,"['Chien, Sheng-Hsuan', 'Liu, Chia-Jen', 'Hong, Ying-Chung', 'Teng, Chung-Jen', 'Hu, Yu-Wen', 'Ku, Fan-Chen', 'Yeh, Chiu-Mei', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Gau, Jyh-Pyng', 'Tzeng, Cheng-Hwai']","['Chien SH', 'Liu CJ', 'Hong YC', 'Teng CJ', 'Hu YW', 'Ku FC', 'Yeh CM', 'Chiou TJ', 'Gau JP', 'Tzeng CH']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, No. 201 Shipai Road, Sec. 2, Taipei, 11217, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, No. 201 Shipai Road, Sec. 2, Taipei, 11217, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Public Health, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Medicine, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Cancer Center, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Public Health, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, No. 201 Shipai Road, Sec. 2, Taipei, 11217, Taiwan. jpgau@vghtpe.gov.tw.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan. jpgau@vghtpe.gov.tw.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, No. 201 Shipai Road, Sec. 2, Taipei, 11217, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150514,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer risk', 'Epidemiology', 'Non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'Population study', 'Second malignancy']",2015/05/15 06:00,2016/05/03 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2014/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00432-015-1979-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-015-1979-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2015 Nov;141(11):1995-2004. doi: 10.1007/s00432-015-1979-1.

Although YAP has been shown to be significantly upregulated in gastric cancer, whether the YAP/PML/p73 regulation loop also functions in gastric cancer is unknown. Here, we show significantly higher levels of YAP and significantly lower levels of PML in the gastric cancer specimen. Overexpression of YAP in gastric cancer cells significantly increased cell growth, but did not affect apoptosis. However, overexpression of PML in gastric cancer cells significantly increased cell apoptosis, resulting in decreases in cell growth, which seemed to require the presence of YAP. The effect of PML on apoptosis appeared to be conducted through p73-mediated modulation of apoptosis-associated genes, Bcl-2, Bak, and caspase9. Thus, our study suggests the presence of a YAP/PML/p73 regulatory loop in gastric cancer, and highlights PML as a promising tumor suppressor in gastric cancer through YAP-coordinated cancer cell apoptosis.",,"['Xu, Zhipeng', 'Chen, Jiamin', 'Shao, Liming', 'Ma, Wangqian', 'Xu, Dingting']","['Xu Z', 'Chen J', 'Shao L', 'Ma W', 'Xu D']","['Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, 310009, China. xuzhipeng_1978@163.com.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, 310009, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, 310009, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20150515,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-yes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (YES1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gastric Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-yes/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Gastric cancer', 'Promyelocytic leukemia (PML)', 'Yes-associated protein (YAP)']",2015/05/15 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2015/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-3539-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-3539-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 Sep;36(10):8047-54. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-3539-3.

However, the use of CAP is limited because of its harmful side effects, such as leukemia. The molecular mechanism through which CAP has been strongly correlated with leukemogenesis is still unclear. To elucidate the mechanism of genotoxicity, we examined DNA damage by CAP and its metabolites, nitroso-CAP (CAP-NO), N-hydroxy-CAP (CAP-NHOH), using isolated DNA. CAP-NHOH have the ability of DNA damage including 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine formation in the presence of Cu(II), which was greatly enhanced by the addition of an endogenous reductant NADH. CAP-NO caused DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II), only when reduced by NADH. NADH can non-enzymatically reduce the nitroso form to hydronitroxide radicals, resulting in enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species followed by DNA damage through the redox cycle. Furthermore, we also studied the site specificity of base lesions in DNA treated with piperidine or formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase, using (32)P-5'-end-labeled DNA fragments obtained from the human tumor suppressor gene. CAP metabolites preferentially caused double base lesion, the G and C of the ACG sequence complementary to codon 273 of the p53 gene, in the presence of NADH and Cu(II).

We exploited the impaired transcriptional activity of mutant p53 to map out p53 targets in CLL by small RNA sequencing. We describe the landscape of p53-dependent microRNA/non-coding RNA induced in response to DNA damage in CLL.

In AML, miR-155 is regulated by NF-kappaB, the activity of which is, in part, controlled by the NEDD8-dependent ubiquitin ligases. We demonstrate that MLN4924, an inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme presently being evaluated in clinical trials, decreases binding of NF-kappaB to the miR-155 promoter and downregulates miR-155 in AML cells. This results in the upregulation of the miR-155 targets SHIP1, an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and PU.1, a transcription factor important for myeloid differentiation, leading to monocytic differentiation and apoptosis. Consistent with these results, overexpression of miR-155 diminishes MLN4924-induced antileukemic effects. In vivo, MLN4924 reduces miR-155 expression and prolongs the survival of mice engrafted with leukemic cells. Our study demonstrates the potential of miR-155 as a novel therapeutic target in AML via pharmacologic interference with NF-kappaB-dependent regulatory mechanisms. We show the targeting of this oncogenic microRNA with MLN4924, a compound presently being evaluated in clinical trials in AML.

Since LICs are considered to be resistant to standard chemotherapy, the identification of common mechanisms involved in LIC maintenance and progression is crucial to establishing broadly effective therapeutic agents for AML. The NF-kappaB pathway is one of the most promising targets, considering that its constitutive activation has been reported in different types of AML. In myeloid leukemia mouse models, we found that NF-kappaB activity is maintained specifically in LICs through autocrine TNF-alpha secretion, forming an NF-kappaB/TNF-alpha positive feedback loop. LICs had increased levels of active proteasome machinery, which promoted the degradation of IkappaBalpha and further supported NF-kappaB activity. Genetic ablation of TNF-alpha or NF-kappaB markedly suppressed leukemia progression in vivo. These findings demonstrate that NF-kappaB/TNF-alpha signaling in LICs contributes to leukemia progression and provide a widely applicable approach for targeting LICs.",,"['Kagoya, Yuki']",['Kagoya Y'],"['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",,,2015/05/15 06:00,2015/10/17 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.56.384 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2015 Apr;56(4):384-91. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.56.384.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified G protein-coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) as a novel marker for EVI1high AML, which is an orphan adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPR56 was found to be associated with high cell adhesion and anti-apoptotic activities in EVI1high AML through activation of RhoA signaling. Moreover, in Gpr56-/- mice, the number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in bone marrow was significantly decreased with proportional increases in the spleen and peripheral blood, reflecting extramedullary hematopoiesis. The number of Gpr56-/- HSC progenitor cells in the G0 phase was significantly reduced with impaired adhesion and the loss of GPR56 function, which diminished the in vivo repopulating ability of HSCs. In conclusion, GPR56 may represent an important GPCR for the maintenance of quiescence and cellular adhesion of EVI1high AML and HSCs in the bone marrow niche. Moreover, given that GPR56 expression in leukemia stem cells is much higher than that in HSCs, GPR56 is a candidate therapeutic target for leukemia stem cells in EVI1high AML.",,"['Saito, Yusuke', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Saito Y', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2015/05/15 06:00,2015/10/17 06:00,['2015/05/15 06:00'],"['2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.56.375 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2015 Apr;56(4):375-83. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.56.375.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study characterizes the type of pediatric second primary malignancies after retinoblastoma treatment and investigates the impact of different treatment strategies and prognostic factors at presentation. PROCEDURE: All national patients treated for retinoblastoma at the German referral center with a current age of 6-27 years were invited to participate in a study to characterize late effects. RESULTS: Data on pediatric second primary malignancies were recorded from 488 patients. Ten developed a malignancy before the age of 18 years. For children with heterozygous oncogenic RB1 alteration (heritable retinoblastoma), the cumulative incidence to develop a second malignancy at the age of 10 years was 5.2% (95% CI 1.7; 8.7%). This results in an elevated risk for sarcoma (n = 4) (SIR 147.98; 95% CI 39.81; 378.87) and leukemia (n = 4) (SIR 41.38; 95% CI 11.13; 105.95). Neither the functional type of the RB1 alteration nor its origin showed a significant impact. Treatment modality influenced incidence, latency, and type of malignancy. Previous radiotherapy increased the risk for solid tumors and 3 of 91 children developed acute leukemia after chemotherapy. However, 2 of 10 malignancies were diagnosed in patients with heritable retinoblastoma but without previous chemotherapy or external beam radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for second primary malignancy is an important part of pediatric oncological follow-up in patients with heritable retinoblastoma. For patients with sporadic unilateral retinoblastoma, genetic information influences treatment decisions and allows tailoring of follow-up schedules.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Temming, Petra', 'Viehmann, Anja', 'Arendt, Marina', 'Eisele, Lewin', 'Spix, Claudia', 'Bornfeld, Norbert', 'Sauerwein, Wolfgang', 'Jockel, Karl-Heinz', 'Lohmann, Dietmar R']","['Temming P', 'Viehmann A', 'Arendt M', 'Eisele L', 'Spix C', 'Bornfeld N', 'Sauerwein W', 'Jockel KH', 'Lohmann DR']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Eye Oncogenetics Research Group, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'German Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Centre of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Eye Oncogenetics Research Group, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Radiotherapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Eye Oncogenetics Research Group, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150513,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Retinal Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Retinoblastoma/*therapy', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['RB1', 'chemotherapy', 'mosaic', 'radiotherapy', 'retinoblastoma gene 1', 'sarcoma']",2015/05/15 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2015/05/14 06:00'],"['2015/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25576 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Oct;62(10):1799-804. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25576.

There are several functional subsets, of which M1 and M2 macrophages are of particular interest because they are differentially involved in inflammation and its resolution. Here, we investigated the differences in regulatory mechanisms between M1- and M2-polarized macrophages by examining mRNA metabolic machineries such as stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (P-bodies). Human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells cultured under M1-polarizing conditions (M1-THPs) had less ability to assemble oxidative-stress-induced SGs than those cultured under M2-polarizing conditions (M2-THPs). In contrast, P-body assembly in response to oxidative stress or TLR4 stimulation was increased in M1-THPs as compared to M2-THPs. These results suggest that mRNA metabolism is controlled differently in M1-THPs and M2-THPs. Interestingly, knocking down EDC4 or Dcp1a, which are components of P-bodies, severely reduced the production of IL-6, but not TNF-alpha in M1-THPs without decreasing the amount of IL-6 mRNA. This is the first report to demonstrate that the assembly of EDC4 and Dcp1a into P-bodies is critical in the posttranscriptional regulation of IL-6. Thus, improving our understanding of the mechanisms governing mRNA metabolism by examining macrophage subtypes may lead to new therapeutic targets.",,"['Seto, Eri', 'Yoshida-Sugitani, Reiko', 'Kobayashi, Toshihiko', 'Toyama-Sorimachi, Noriko']","['Seto E', 'Yoshida-Sugitani R', 'Kobayashi T', 'Toyama-Sorimachi N']","['Department of Molecular Immunology and Inflammation, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Virology and Preventive Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Immunology and Inflammation, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Immunology and Inflammation, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Immunology and Inflammation, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150513,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (EDC4 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.27.- (DCP1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/chemistry/*immunology', 'Endoribonucleases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics/immunology', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/cytology/*immunology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/immunology']",,,2015/05/15 06:00,2016/04/15 06:00,['2015/05/14 06:00'],"['2014/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0123223 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-51259 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 13;10(5):e0123223. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0123223. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4430274,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-five consecutive patients who had relapsed acute leukemia after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and received modified DLI were retrospectively studied. Forty-one patients received CSA and 14 received low-dose MTX after DLI to prevent DLI-associated GVHD. The incidence of acute GVHD and grade 2-4 acute GVHD in MTX group showed a trend toward being higher than in CSA group (61.0% vs. 37.3%, p = 0.198 and 61.0% vs. 35.5%, p = 0.155). However, no significant difference in the incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD between two groups (p = 0.982) was observed. Moreover, compared with CSA, patients treated with MTX had lower re-relapse rate (38.1% vs. 80.8%, p = 0.029), better disease-free survival (DFS) (51.9% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.06), and higher absolute lymphocyte counts at 30, 45, 60, and 90 d after modified DLI (p < 0.05). This study suggested that after haploidentical modified DLI, low-dose MTX is at least as effective as CSA in the prevention of DLI-associated GVHD and probably allowed stronger GVL effect than CSA.

Exposures to xenobiotics endogenous or exogenous associated with a reduced individual ability in detoxifying activity, constitutes a risk of developing cancer. It is known that polymorphism of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genes affects the detoxification of xenobiotics. Thus, we conducted a case-control study in which 92 patients (Mean age +/- SD, 40.62 +/- 12.7 years) with CML and 93 healthy unrelated controls (Mean age +/- SD, 41.38 +/- 13.4 years) have participated. GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes were determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression was used to assess the possible link between GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes and CML as well as between combined genotypes and CML. GSTM1 null genotype frequency was slightly higher in patients than control (48.9% vs. 40.9%) but, it was not associated with CML (OR 95% CI, 1.4, 0.78-2.48; p = 0.271). Moreover, GSTT1 null genotype frequency showed a similar trend between patients and control (17.4% vs. 9.7%; OR 95% CI, 1.97, 0.82-4.71; p = 0.13). Surprisingly, GSTT1 null genotype was significantly associated with the risk of CML in males (OR 95% CI, 5, 1.25-20.1; p = 0.023).

Infrequently, it can occur in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative overlap syndrome conditions such as chronic monomyelocytic leucaemia (CMML), where it often heralds the transformation towards an AML. We discuss a rare presentation of myeloid sarcoma in the perianal region of a 51-year-old man, who was seen by various clinicians and treated for haemorrhoids and perianal abscess. There were no gross abnormalities in initial haematological investigations and the patient was systemically well. A histological biopsy demonstrated myeloid sarcoma and bone marrow aspirate, and trephine confirmed CMML transforming to AML. Treatment of myeloid sarcoma is dependent on whether there is associated AML in the bone marrow. Dual chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin remains the gold standard treatment in these patients.

We describe the solution nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the Moloney murine leukemia virus IN (M-MLV) C-terminal domain (CTD) and a structural homology model of the catalytic core domain (CCD). In solution, the isolated MLV IN CTD adopts an SH3 domain fold flanked by a C-terminal unstructured tail. We generated a concordant MLV IN CCD structural model using SWISS-MODEL, MMM-tree and I-TASSER. Using the X-ray crystal structure of the prototype foamy virus IN target capture complex together with our MLV domain structures, residues within the CCD alpha2 helical region and the CTD beta1-beta2 loop were predicted to bind target DNA. The role of these residues was analyzed in vivo through point mutants and motif interchanges. Viable viruses with substitutions at the IN CCD alpha2 helical region and the CTD beta1-beta2 loop were tested for effects on integration target site selection. Next-generation sequencing and analysis of integration target sequences indicate that the CCD alpha2 helical region, in particular P187, interacts with the sequences distal to the scissile bonds whereas the CTD beta1-beta2 loop binds to residues proximal to it. These findings validate our structural model and disclose IN-DNA interactions relevant to target site selection.","['(c) The Author(s) 2015.

It is currently unknown whether plasma IgE levels are associated with risk of cancer in individuals from the general population. We tested the hypothesis that high levels of plasma total IgE are associated with overall risk of cancer and with risk of specific cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma total IgE was measured in 37 747 individuals from the general population, and the participants were followed prospectively for up to 30 years. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 7 years, a first cancer was diagnosed in 3454 participants. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for a 10-fold higher level of IgE was 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.11; P = 0.04] for any cancer, 0.44 (0.30-0.64; P = 0.00002) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 0.53 (0.33-0.84; P = 0.007) for multiple myeloma, 1.54 (1.04-2.29; P = 0.03) for other non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 1.38 (1.04-1.84; P = 0.03) for cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, and 1.12 (1.00-1.25; P = 0.05) for lung cancer. The findings for CLL and multiple myeloma were generally robust; however, after correcting for 27 multiple comparisons only the finding for CLL remained significant. CONCLUSION: High levels of plasma total IgE were associated with low risk of CLL and possibly of multiple myeloma, without convincing evidence for high risk of any cancer type.","['(c) The Author 2015.

Its enforced expression induces T-cell leukemia and we have implicated it as an important oncogene in early T-cell precursor leukemias where it is immediately downstream of an LMO2-associated protein complex. Conventional Hhex knockouts cause embryonic lethality precluding analysis of adult hematopoiesis. Thus, we induced highly efficient conditional knockout (cKO) using vav-Cre transgenic mice. Hhex cKO mice were viable and born at normal litter sizes. At steady state, we observed a defect in B-cell development that we localized to the earliest B-cell precursor, the pro-B-cell stage. Most remarkably, bone marrow transplantation using Hhex cKO donor cells revealed a more profound defect in all hematopoietic lineages. In contrast, sublethal irradiation resulted in normal myeloid cell repopulation of the bone marrow but markedly impaired repopulation of T- and B-cell compartments. We noted that Hhex cKO stem and progenitor cell populations were skewed in their distribution and showed enhanced proliferation compared to WT cells.

However, the metabolic effects of another family member, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), are not well characterized. Effects of LIF on skeletal muscle glucose uptake and palmitate oxidation and signaling were investigated in ex vivo incubated mouse soleus and EDL muscles from muscle-specific AMPKalpha2 kinase-dead, muscle-specific SOCS3 knockout, and lean and high-fat-fed mice. Inhibitors were used to investigate involvement of specific signaling pathways. LIF increased muscle glucose uptake in dose (50-5,000 pM/l) and time-dependent manners with maximal effects at the 30-min time point. LIF increased Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation (P) in soleus and EDL, whereas AMPK Thr(172) P was unaffected. Incubation with parthenolide abolished LIF-induced glucose uptake and STAT3 Tyr(705) P, whereas incubation with LY-294002 and wortmannin suppressed both basal and LIF-induced glucose uptake and Akt Ser(473) P, indicating that JAK and PI 3-kinase signaling is required for LIF-stimulated glucose uptake. Incubation with rapamycin and AZD8055 indicated that mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)2, but not mTORC1, also is required for LIF-stimulated glucose uptake. In contrast to CNTF, LIF stimulation did not alter palmitate oxidation. LIF-stimulated glucose uptake was maintained in EDL from obese insulin-resistant mice, whereas soleus developed LIF resistance. Lack of SOCS3 and AMPKalpha2 did not affect LIF-stimulated glucose uptake. In conclusion, LIF acutely increased muscle glucose uptake by a mechanism potentially involving the PI 3-kinase/mTORC2/Akt pathway and is not impaired in EDL muscle from obese insulin-resistant mice.",['Copyright (c) 2015 the American Physiological Society.'],"['Brandt, Nina', ""O'Neill, Hayley M"", 'Kleinert, Maximilian', 'Schjerling, Peter', 'Vernet, Erik', 'Steinberg, Gregory R', 'Richter, Erik A', 'Jorgensen, Sebastian B']","['Brandt N', ""O'Neill HM"", 'Kleinert M', 'Schjerling P', 'Vernet E', 'Steinberg GR', 'Richter EA', 'Jorgensen SB']","['Molecular Physiology Group, Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;', 'Molecular Physiology Group, Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Institute of Sports Medicine, Department of Orthopedic Surgery M, Bispebjerg Hospital and Center for Healthy Aging, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; and.', 'Diabetes Research Unit, Novo Nordisk A/S, Malov, Denmark.', 'Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;', 'Molecular Physiology Group, Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Diabetes Research Unit, Novo Nordisk A/S, Malov, Denmark sbbj@novonordisk.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150512,United States,Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,American journal of physiology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This method is based on the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy spin-trapping technique. 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl 5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (BMPO) was used as the spin trap. Normal human lymphocytes and leukemia cells were exposed to UVB radiation (290-315 nm) at 47.7 and 159 mJ/cm(2) and to UVA radiation (315-400 nm) at 53.7 J/cm(2). RESULTS: No significant radical production at 47.7 mJ/cm(2) UVB dose in both cell lines was observed. In normal cells, free radical production was observed at 159 mJ/cm(2) UVB and 53.7 J/cm(2) UVA doses. However, both UV sources did not significantly produce free radicals in leukemia cells. A radical scavenging property of tea extracts (black, green, sage, rosehip) was observed in normal lymphocytes after both UVB and UVA exposure. In leukemia cells, the intensities of EPR signals produced in BMPO with tea extracts were found to be increased substantially after UVA exposure. CONCLUSION: These results showed that UV radiation induced free radical formation in normal human lymphocytes and indicated that tea extracts may be useful as photoprotective agents for them. On the other hand, tea extracts facilitated free radical production in leukemia cells.",,"['Tepe Cam, Semra', 'Polat, Mustafa', 'Esmekaya, Meric Arda', 'Canseven, Ayse G', 'Seyhan, Nesrin']","['Tepe Cam S', 'Polat M', 'Esmekaya MA', 'Canseven AG', 'Seyhan N']","['a Gazi University Faculty of Medicine Biophysics Department , Besevler, Ankara , Turkey.', 'b Physics Engineering Department, Hacettepe University , Beytepe, Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Gazi University Faculty of Medicine Biophysics Department , Besevler, Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Gazi University Faculty of Medicine Biophysics Department , Besevler, Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Gazi University Faculty of Medicine Biophysics Department , Besevler, Ankara , Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150603,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Spin Labels)', '0 (Tea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Plant Extracts/*administration & dosage', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Tolerance/drug effects', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/administration & dosage', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Spin Labels', 'Tea/*chemistry', '*Ultraviolet Rays', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['EPR spin trap', 'Lymphocyte', 'UV', 'antioxidants', 'leukemia', 'radicals', 'tea extract']",2015/05/15 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/14 06:00'],"['2015/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09553002.2015.1047989 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2015 Aug;91(8):673-80. doi: 10.3109/09553002.2015.1047989.

Objective of the present study is the investigation of mental health and psychosocial burden in children and young adolescents two or more years after the treatment of leukemia (ALL, AML) or lymphoma disease (NHL) compared to peers not suffering from cancer as well as available standard values. 42 former patients and 23 healthy peers were included in the comparative analysis. In addition to socio-demographic and medical information the following validated questionnaires were used: the General Depression Scale (ADS), the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for the detection of behavioral difficulties and strengths, the KINDL-R questionnaire for assessing quality of life in children and adolescents, the Herth Hope Index (HHI), the Social Questionnaire (SFS 4-6) for assessing the educational integration and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) to measure self-efficacy. Children and young adolescent survivors of leukemia or lymphoma report significantly less depressive symptoms and significantly higher quality of life compared to a healthy age-matched comparison sample and representative standard values.

It is unknown why LIF/STAT3 signalling alone fails to sustain pluripotency in human PSCs. Here we show that the forced expression of the hormone-dependent STAT3-ER (ER, ligand-binding domain of the human oestrogen receptor) in combination with 2i/LIF and tamoxifen allows human PSCs to escape from the primed state and enter a state characterized by the activation of STAT3 target genes and long-term self-renewal in FGF2- and feeder-free conditions. These cells acquire growth properties, a gene expression profile and an epigenetic landscape closer to those described in mouse naive PSCs.

Methotrexate is one of the most useful drugs in cancer chemotherapy. The aim of the study was to develop and validate the methodology of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet detection for methotrexate dosage and to determine its concentration in plasma samples from children with leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients from the outpatient care of pediatric oncology at the Faculty of Medicine of ABC carriers in treatment of leukemia. The study was conducted in chromatographic model Agilent 1100 with UV detector at 302 nm and by the method of ELISA microplate reader capable of reading absorbance at 450 nm.

Two hypotheses describing the origins of cancer cells have been developed: one stating that any normal cell can acquire the ability to replicate indefinitely and evade natural cell death signals by accumulating multiple mutations over time, and a second suggesting that adult stem cells, by virtue of their pre-existing capacity for differentiation, asymmetric division and self-renewal, are the more likely targets of carcinogenic mutation. The leukemic stem cell (LSC) was the first cancer stem cell described. Evolving from the aberrant regulation and mutation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), LSCs are suggested to encompass the subset of tumor cells sufficient for continued tumorigenesis. LSCs were also found to differentiate into a variety of cancer cell progenitors in a manner reminiscent of HSC differentiation, also explaining the observed heterogeneity of leukemic cells. How these cells form from HSCs remains to be fully comprehended. However, over recent years, marked progress has been made in contributing to our knowledge of cancer stem cells and what signaling cascades are involved in their development. Therapeutics targeting the pathways allowing for LSCs to sustain proliferation and self-renewal may prove to be more effective treatments for lymphoblastic leukemia.",,"['Zhang, P-Y', 'Yang, Y-J', 'Fu, C-M', 'Xiang, L-L', 'Wang, Q', 'Li, X-L']","['Zhang PY', 'Yang YJ', 'Fu CM', 'Xiang LL', 'Wang Q', 'Li XL']","['Department of Hematology Cancer Center, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China. zpying58@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Signal Transduction/physiology']",,,2015/05/15 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/14 06:00'],"['2015/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2015 Apr;19(8):1356-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the fact that Apo2L/TRAIL is capable of inducing cell death in tumor cells but not in normal cells makes this death ligand a promising anti-tumor agent. Previous data from our group demonstrated that Apo2L/TRAIL was physiologically released as transmembrane protein inserted in lipid vesicles, called exosomes. Recently, we demonstrated that artificial lipid nanoparticles coated with bioactive Apo2L/TRAIL (LUV-TRAIL) resembling the natural exosomes, greatly improved Apo2L/TRAIL activity and were able to induce apoptosis in hematological malignancies. In this study, we have deepened in the underlying mechanism of action of LUV-TRAIL in hematologic cells. METHODS/PATIENTS: Cytotoxic ability of LUV-TRAIL was assessed on Jurkat cells either over-expressing the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl1 or down-regulating the pro-apoptotic protein Bim previously generated in our laboratory. We also tested LUV-TRAIL cytotoxic ability against primary human leukemic cells from T-cell ALL patient. RESULTS: Silencing Bim but not Mcl-1 over-expression partially protects Jurkat cells from apoptosis induced by sTRAIL. LUV-TRAIL induced caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation and killed Jurkat-Mcl1 and Jurkat-shBim more efficiently than sTRAIL independently of the mitochondrial pathway. On the other hand, LUV-TRAIL were clearly more cytotoxic against primary leukemic cells from a T-cell ALL patient than sTRAIL. CONCLUSION: Tethering Apo2L/TRAIL to the surface of lipid nanoparticles greatly increases its bioactivity and could be of potential use in anti-tumor therapeutics.",,"['De Miguel, D', 'Gallego-Lleyda, A', 'Galan-Malo, P', 'Rodriguez-Vigil, C', 'Marzo, I', 'Anel, A', 'Martinez-Lostao, L']","['De Miguel D', 'Gallego-Lleyda A', 'Galan-Malo P', 'Rodriguez-Vigil C', 'Marzo I', 'Anel A', 'Martinez-Lostao L']","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Biologia Molecular y Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, C/Pedro Cerbuna 12, 50009, Zaragoza, Spain, diego_demiguel@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150513,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology/metabolism/*pathology/*therapy', '*Liposomes', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism']",,,2015/05/15 06:00,2016/04/27 06:00,['2015/05/14 06:00'],"['2015/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12094-015-1295-x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2015 Aug;17(8):657-67. doi: 10.1007/s12094-015-1295-x.

An Experimental Rat Study.,,,"OBJECTIVE: To assess leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression as markers of intrauterine device (IUD) efficacy in a rat model. METHODS: Twenty nulliparous female Wistar rats were divided into two groups with 10 animals per group: group I (IUD) and group II (control group, no IUD). In group I, a 2-cm 3-0 silk suture was placed into one horn of the rat bicornuate uterus. On day 20 (after IUD insertion) rats were sacrificed and their uteri removed. The number of vessels and the distribution of LIF and VEGF were compared among the uterine horns. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in LIF and VEGF expression in the groups and all horns (p > 0.05). The number of vessels was higher in the IUD+ horn than in the IUD- horn of group I and in the horn of group II (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the number of vessels between the IUD- horns of groups I and II (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: LIF and VEGF expression did not correlate with IUD efficacy in a rat model. An IUD may increase the number of vessels in the uterine horn independent of VEGF expression. (c) 2015 S.

Additionally, drug release from the nanopores is achieved by selective glutathione (GSH)-triggered dismantle of the AgNPs, and the concurrent fluorescence change allows real-time monitoring of drug release efficacy and facile visualization of in vivo delivery events. After being functionalized with sgc8 aptamer on the outer shell of the AgNPs, the targeted nanocontainers are delivered into acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells by aptamer-mediated recognition and endocytosis.

Consequently, using established criteria, we isolated glioma-associated-human MSCs (GA-hMSCs) from fresh human glioma surgical specimens for the first time. We show that these GA-hMSCs are nontumorigenic stromal cells that are phenotypically similar to prototypical bone marrow-MSCs. Low-passage genomic sequencing analyses comparing GA-hMSCs with matched tumor-initiating glioma stem cells (GSCs) suggest that most GA-hMSCs (60%) are normal cells recruited to the tumor (group 1 GA-hMSCs), although, rarely (10%), GA-hMSCs may differentiate directly from GSCs (group 2 GA-hMSCs) or display genetic patterns intermediate between these groups (group 3 GA-hMSCs). Importantly, GA-hMSCs increase proliferation and self-renewal of GSCs in vitro and enhance GSC tumorigenicity and mesenchymal features in vivo, confirming their functional significance within the GSC niche. These effects are mediated by GA-hMSC-secreted interleukin-6, which activates STAT3 in GSCs.

The inhibitory effect of mangiferin on HL-60 leukemia cell proliferation was determined by the MTT assay. The impact of mangiferin on the HL-60 cell cycle was evaluated by flow cytometry. After the cells were treated with different concentrations of mangiferin, the expression levels of Wee1, Chk1 and CDC25C mRNA were determined by RT-PCR, and Western blot was used to evaluate the expression levels of cdc25c, cyclin B1, and Akt proteins. The inhibition of HL-60 cell growth by mangiferin was dose- and time-dependent. After treatment for 24 h, cells in G2/M phase increased, and G2/M phase arrest appeared with increased mRNA expression of Wee1, Chk1 and CDC25C. Mangiferin inhibited Chk1 and cdc25c mRNA expression at high concentrations and induced Wee1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. It significantly inhibited ATR, Chk1, Wee1, Akt, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation but increased cdc2 and cyclin B1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, mangiferin reduced cdc25c, cyclin B1, and Akt protein levels while inducing Wee1 protein expression.

Here, we show that the E3-ubiquitin ligase CBL down-regulation occurring during prolonged drug treatment plays a critical role in this process. Depletion of CBL in K562 cells increases AXL and LYN protein levels, promoting cell resistance to nilotinib. Conversely, forced expression of CBL in nilotinib-resistant K562 cells (K562-rn) dramatically reduces AXL and LYN expression and resensitizes K562-rn cells to nilotinib. A similar mechanism was found to operate in primary CML CD34(+) cells. Mechanistically, the E3-ligase CBL counteracts AXL/SYK signalling, promoting LYN transcription by controlling AXL protein stability. Surprisingly, the role of AXL in resistance was independent of its ligand GAS6 binding and its TK activity, in accordance with a scaffold activity for this receptor being involved in this cellular process. Collectively, our results demonstrate a pivotal role for CBL in the control of a tyrosine kinase network mediating resistance to nilotinib treatment in CML cells.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Exposure to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) caused normal mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells to divide more readily, altered their differentiation, and reduced their reconstitution and self-renewal potential. Interestingly, the normal bystander cells acquired gene expression patterns resembling their malignant counterparts. Therefore, much of the leukemia signature is mediated by extrinsic factors. Indeed, IL-6 was responsible for most of these changes. Compatible results were obtained when human CML were cultured with normal human hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Here we report that mutations affecting the splicing factor SRSF2 directly impair hematopoietic differentiation in vivo, which is not due to SRSF2 loss of function. By contrast, SRSF2 mutations alter SRSF2's normal sequence-specific RNA binding activity, thereby altering the recognition of specific exonic splicing enhancer motifs to drive recurrent mis-splicing of key hematopoietic regulators.

The need for leukemia-specific delivery of siRNA is discussed by describing approaches that targeted agents to leukemic cells. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of RNAi agents are then presented, highlighting the critical issues pertinent to emerging siRNA therapy. Efforts to deliver specific RNAi therapies are then summarized in the context of expected clinical outcomes, focusing on limiting leukemic cell survival, sensitizing malignant cells to chemotherapy, mobilization of leukemic cells, and eradication of leukemic stem cells.

Serology for HBV, HCV, human T-cell leukemia virus I (HTLV-I), and HIV was negative. His symptoms disappeared following discontinuation of RA treatment including MTX. A drastic regression of the tumor masses was further obtained without cytotoxic chemotherapy.

The hepatitis C example.,22-8,,"BACKGROUND: Response-guided therapy (RGT) is a treatment model that bases adjustments to therapeutic regimens on individualized patient physiologic response. This approach is applied to patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are treated with a triple therapy regimen of boceprevir or telaprevir in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. As RGT expands in other pharmacologic regimens, including the treatment of breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, a measurement of how this approach is applied in clinical practice is important to determine whether the benefits of RGT are being optimized. OBJECTIVE: To measure adherence to the RGT guidelines and to the treatment futility rules based on the drug labeling information for boceprevir and for telaprevir in the treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted using the large Humana research database, which includes pharmacy, medical, and laboratory claims, as well as enrollment data for more than 1.5 million fully insured commercial members, 1.9 million Medicare Advantage members, and 2.4 million Medicare Part D members from all 50 states. The study population included patients aged >/=18 years to <90 years who were fully insured with commercial or Medicare Advantage coverage. A pharmacy claim for boceprevir or telaprevir was used to identify patients receiving triple therapy for HCV infection. Medical, pharmacy, and laboratory claims were reviewed from the date of the first boceprevir or telaprevir pharmacy claim between May 2011 and February 2012 through a 32-week follow-up period, during which patients were required to have continuous health plan enrollment eligibility. This time period allowed for the occurrences of required HCV RNA laboratory monitoring and the assessment of treatment patterns. The use of RGT for boceprevir and telaprevir includes the monitoring of HCV RNA levels at routine intervals to determine how to proceed with therapy. Adherence to HCV RNA monitoring was measured as the proportion of eligible patients who had an HCV RNA assay at each of the recommended time intervals. According to futility rules, patients with greater-than-expected HCV RNA levels are deemed to be nonresponders and should discontinue therapy. Adherence to futility rules was measured as the proportion of patients who stopped therapy among all patients who had an HCV RNA result, which indicated treatment futility at each monitoring interval. RESULTS: A total of 326 patients (65 in the boceprevir group; 261 in the telaprevir group) were eligible for the HCV RNA monitoring analysis, and 134 patients (20 receiving boceprevir and 114 receiving telaprevir) were eligible for the futility rules analysis. There were 1203 HCV RNA assays during the follow-up period. The percentage of patients who were adherent to HCV RNA monitoring during the entire treatment period was 29.2% in the boceprevir group and 32.2% in the telaprevir group. In both treatment groups, adherence to HCV RNA monitoring was highest at the first recommended time interval, followed by a downward trend in the second and third time intervals. Approximately 15% of 134 eligible patients met the futility rules for stopping therapy based on HCV RNA assay results, and 55% of those patients stopped the therapy in accordance with the treatment futility rules. CONCLUSION: The implementation of RGT was suboptimal in this population of patients with chronic HCV infection; adherence to HCV RNA monitoring guidelines was less than 33%, and adherence to treatment futility rules was less than 50%. Managed care pharmacists should identify strategies to increase the adoption of RGT, which may, in turn, improve patient care and reduce unnecessary expenditures.",,"['Harris, Jennifer B', 'Ward, Melea A', 'Schwab, Phil']","['Harris JB', 'Ward MA', 'Schwab P']","['Clinical Pharmacist, Humana Inc, Louisville, KY.', 'Clinical Pharmacist, Humana, Inc, Louisville, KY, at the time this work was completed.', 'Research Lead, Comprehensive Health Insights, Humana Inc, Louisville, KY.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am Health Drug Benefits,American health & drug benefits,101479877,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA assay', 'boceprevir', 'hepatitis C virus', 'pegylated interferon', 'response-guided therapy', 'telaprevir']",2015/05/13 06:00,2015/05/13 06:01,['2015/05/13 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am Health Drug Benefits. 2015 Feb;8(1):22-8.,,PMC4415173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with CLL and white blood count (WBC) >150x10(6)/l at the time of diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the database of the Israeli CLL Study Group, which includes 1,507 cases, we identified 41 patients diagnosed with WBC >150x10(6)/l and analyzed the survival in the group that was 62 months compared to 174 months in patients without hyperleukocytosis (p<0.001). However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that the WBC count had no predictive value in relation to survival time. While in the entire patient cohort advanced age and Binet stage, presence of thrombocytopenia and ZAP-70 expression were independently associated with poor prognosis, these parameters lost their prognostic value in patients with hyperleukocytosis. CONCLUSION: Although our results do not confirm that high initial levels of WBC are independently associated with shorter survival in CLL, the clinical course in these cases appears to be aggressive and conventional prognostic factors are not valid in this patient sub-group.","['Copyright(c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Shvidel, Lev', 'Bairey, Osnat', 'Tadmor, Tamar', 'Braester, Andrei', 'Ruchlemer, Rosa', 'Fineman, Riva', 'Joffe, Erel', 'Berrebi, Alain', 'Polliack, Aaron']","['Shvidel L', 'Bairey O', 'Tadmor T', 'Braester A', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Fineman R', 'Joffe E', 'Berrebi A', 'Polliack A']","['Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel levsh@clalit.org.il.', 'Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.', 'Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Western Galilee Hospital, Naharyia, Israel.', 'Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel.', 'Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/complications/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/*blood/complications/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'hyperleukocytosis', 'prognosis', 'survival']",2015/05/13 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2015/05/13 06:00'],"['2015/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['35/5/2861 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2015 May;35(5):2861-6.,,,,,,,,,,['Israeli CLL Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,

Two compounds (HP109/HP102) were selected for evaluation of their anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic potential in Jurkat T-cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Jurkat T-cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/phytohemagglutinin (PMA/PHA) in the absence and presence of different concentrations of curcumin or HP109/HP102. Interleukin 2 (IL2) production and IL2 promoter activity were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a luciferase reporter assay, respectively. Proliferation and cell viability were monitored by 2,3-Bis-(2-Methoxy-4-Nitro-5-Sulfophenyl)-2H-Tetrazolium-5-Carboxanilide assay, annexin -V/7-amino-actinomycin D staining and western blotting. RESULTS: HP102 was about 10-times more effective in blocking IL2 synthesis compared to curcumin. Enhanced effects of HP102 were also observed in reducing the proliferation rate and cell viability. In contrast to HP102, HP109 did not exhibit enhanced effects compared to curcumin.

There exist three main players in this pathway. The inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB), IkappaB kinase (IkappaK)- NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) complex and NF-kappaB. The IkK-NEMO complex activates NF-kappaB via phosphorylation of Ikappabeta and, eventually, leads to its proteasomal degradation. This leads to nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and activation of target genes, such as cyclooxygenases and interleukins. The identification of anti-inflammatory compounds might be an effective strategy to target inflammatory disorders and cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present investigation, kaempferol was investigated in terms of its effect on NF-kappaB activity with a SEAP-driven reporter cell line, NF-kappaB DNA binding with electromobility shift assay (EMSA) and translocation of NF-kappaB-p65 from cytosol to the nucleus with western blot in Jurkat cells. RESULTS: Kaempferol revealed anti-inflammatory activity, as shown in vitro and in silico. Molecular docking studies of kaempferol revealed comparable binding energies and similar docking poses on target proteins such as MG-132, a known NF-kappaB inhibitor. CONCLUSION: We conclude that kaempferol possesses anti-inflammatory activity.","['Copyright(c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Kadioglu, Onat', 'Nass, Janine', 'Saeed, Mohamed E M', 'Schuler, Barbara', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kadioglu O', 'Nass J', 'Saeed ME', 'Schuler B', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Biotechnology, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany efferth@uni-mainz.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Kaempferols)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '731P2LE49E (kaempferol)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinogenesis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/chemistry/genetics', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kaempferols/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'NF-kappa B/chemistry/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['NF-kappaB pathway', 'inflammation', 'leukemia', 'molecular docking']",2015/05/13 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2015/05/13 06:00'],"['2015/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['35/5/2645 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2015 May;35(5):2645-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A member of the ABC transporter family, Pgp, represents the most frequently described membrane efflux pump and its expression in neoplastic cells is responsible for multi-drug resistance. Several lines of evidence indicate that the expression and increased function of both Pgp and glucosylceramide synthase (GCS, an enzyme responsible for ceramide pathway de-activation in the regulation of apoptosis progression) enhance the resistance of Pgp-positive cells. Previously, we described a reduction in the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose contents of mouse leukemia cells (R) expressing Pgp due to vincristine selection compared to parental L1210 cells (S). The reduced availability of UDP-glucose as a glucose donor in R cell glycosylation reactions could limit GCS-catalyzed ceramide glycosylation. Consequently, the over-expression of Pgp in Pgp-positive L1210 cells may be associated with reduced ceramide glycosylation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To test this idea, we measured the expression and activities of Pgp and GCS, UDP-glucose levels, cellular uptake of C12-NBD-ceramide (a fluorescent analogue of ceramide) and ceramide-induced cell death in S and R cells. T-cells, another Pgp-positive variant of L1210 cells that express Pgp due to their transfection with a gene encoding human Pgp were also used in this study. RESULTS: We detected significantly reduced levels of C12-NBD-ceramide glycosylation and reduced UDP-glucose contents in Pgp-positive R and T-cells compared to S cells. C12-NBD-ceramide uptake assays revealed nearly identical dynamics of uptake time-dependency curves. The Pgp-positive L1210 variants (R and T) are more sensitive than Pgp-negative S cells to ceramide-induced cell damage, as measured by an fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide apoptosis necrosis kit. Short chain C2-ceramide was more effective at inducing cell damage than ceramide analogues with longer chains. CONCLUSION: These evidence indicates that the down-regulation of UDP-glucose contents in Pgp-positive L1210 cells is responsible for their collateral sensitivity to ceramide-induced apoptosis.","['Copyright(c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Turakova, Katarina', 'Pavlikova, Lucia', 'Messingerova, Lucia', 'Lakatos, Boris', 'Breier, Albert', 'Sulova, Zdena']","['Turakova K', 'Pavlikova L', 'Messingerova L', 'Lakatos B', 'Breier A', 'Sulova Z']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Nutrition and Health Protection, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Nutrition and Health Protection, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Bratislava, Slovak Republic Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Nutrition and Health Protection, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Nutrition and Health Protection, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Bratislava, Slovak Republic Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic albert.breier@stuba.sk zdena.sulova@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic albert.breier@stuba.sk zdena.sulova@savba.sk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (C12-NBD-ceramide)', '0 (Ceramides)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)', 'EQF2794IRE (4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan)', 'V50K1D7P4Y (Uridine Diphosphate Glucose)']",IM,"['4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan/administration & dosage', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Glucosyltransferases/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Uridine Diphosphate Glucose/biosynthesis']",['NOTNLM'],"['L1210 cells', 'P-glycoprotein', 'UDP-glucose', 'ceramide induced cell death', 'glucosylceramide synthase']",2015/05/13 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2015/05/13 06:00'],"['2015/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['35/5/2627 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2015 May;35(5):2627-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The success of current antileukemic treatments is reduced by the occurrence of multidrug resistance, which, in turn, is mediated by membrane transport proteins, such as P-glycoprotein-1 (Pgp). Here, we evaluated the antileukemic effects of APO866 in combination with Pgp inhibitors and studied the mechanisms underlying the interaction between these two types of agents. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects of APO866 with or without Pgp inhibitors were tested on the viability of leukemia cell lines, primary leukemia cells (AML, n = 6; B-CLL, n = 19), and healthy leukocytes. Intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) and ATP levels, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), markers of apoptosis and of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were evaluated. RESULTS: The combination of APO866 with Pgp inhibitors resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic effect in leukemia cells, while sparing normal CD34(+) progenitor cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Combining Pgp inhibitors with APO866 led to increased intracellular APO866 levels, compounded NAD(+) and ATP shortage, and induced DeltaPsi(m) dissipation. Notably, APO866, Pgp inhibitors and, to a much higher extent, their combination induced ER stress and ER stress inhibition strongly reduced the activity of these treatments. CONCLUSIONS: APO866 and Pgp inhibitors show a strong synergistic cooperation in leukemia cells, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) samples. Further evaluations of the combination of these agents in clinical setting should be considered.",['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Cagnetta, Antonia', 'Caffa, Irene', 'Acharya, Chirag', 'Soncini, Debora', 'Acharya, Prakrati', 'Adamia, Sophia', 'Pierri, Ivana', 'Bergamaschi, Micaela', 'Garuti, Anna', 'Fraternali, Giulio', 'Mastracci, Luca', 'Provenzani, Alessandro', 'Zucal, Chiara', 'Damonte, Gianluca', 'Salis, Annalisa', 'Montecucco, Fabrizio', 'Patrone, Franco', 'Ballestrero, Alberto', 'Bruzzone, Santina', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Nencioni, Alessio', 'Cea, Michele']","['Cagnetta A', 'Caffa I', 'Acharya C', 'Soncini D', 'Acharya P', 'Adamia S', 'Pierri I', 'Bergamaschi M', 'Garuti A', 'Fraternali G', 'Mastracci L', 'Provenzani A', 'Zucal C', 'Damonte G', 'Salis A', 'Montecucco F', 'Patrone F', 'Ballestrero A', 'Bruzzone S', 'Gobbi M', 'Nencioni A', 'Cea M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS AOU S.

A recent prospective study of 110,999 adult women showed an association between paternal-but not maternal-age at birth and sporadic hematological cancer risk. To further investigate this topic, we examined these associations in women and men in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort. Among 138,003 Cancer Prevention Study-II participants, 2,532 incident hematological cancers were identified between 1992 and 2009. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed by using Cox proportional hazards regression. There was no clear linear trend in the risk of hematological malignancies by either paternal or maternal age. However, there was a strong, positive association with paternal age among participants without siblings. In that group, the hazard ratio for fathers aged >/=35 years compared with <25 years at birth was 1.63 (95% confidence interval: 1.19, 2.23), and a linear dose-response association was suggested (Pspline = 0.002).There were no differences by subtype of hematological cancer. Results of this study support the need for further research to better understand the association between paternal age at birth and hematological malignancies.","['(c) The Author 2015.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnostic samples from 914 patients (97% < 60 years old) were screened for mutations in DNMT3A exons 13 to 23. Clinical outcome was evaluated according to presence or absence of a mutation and stratified according to type of mutation (R882, non-R882 missense, or truncation). RESULTS: DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3A(MUT)) were identified in 272 patients (30%) and associated with a poorer prognosis than wild-type DNMT3A, but the difference was only seen when the results were stratified according to NPM1 genotype. This example of Simpson's paradox results from the high coincidence of DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations (80% of patients with DNMT3A(MUT) had NPM1 mutations), where the two mutations have opposing prognostic impact. In the stratified analyses, relapse in patients with DNMT3A(MUT) was higher (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.72; P = .01), and overall survival was lower (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.87; P = .002). The impact of DNMT3A(MUT) did not differ according to NPM1 genotype (test for heterogeneity: relapse, P = .4; overall survival, P = .9). Further analysis according to the type of DNMT3A mutation indicated that outcome was comparable in patients with R882 and non-R882 missense mutants, whereas in those with truncation mutants, it was comparable to wild-type DNMT3A. CONCLUSION: These data confirm that presence of a DNMT3A mutation should be considered as a poor-risk prognostic factor, irrespective of the NPM1 genotype, and suggest that further consideration should be given to the type of DNMT3A mutation.",['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Gale, Rosemary E', 'Lamb, Katarina', 'Allen, Christopher', 'El-Sharkawi, Dima', 'Stowe, Cassandra', 'Jenkinson, Sarah', 'Tinsley, Steven', 'Dickson, Glenda', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Linch, David C']","['Gale RE', 'Lamb K', 'Allen C', 'El-Sharkawi D', 'Stowe C', 'Jenkinson S', 'Tinsley S', 'Dickson G', 'Burnett AK', 'Hills RK', 'Linch DC']","['Rosemary E.

The vascular niche, in particular, regulates AML cell survival and cell cycling by both paracrine secretion and adhesive contact with endothelial cells. Moreover, AML cells can functionally integrate within vascular endothelia, undergo quiescence, and resist cytotoxic chemotherapy. Together, these findings support the notion of blood vessels as sanctuary sites for AML. Therefore, vascular targeting agents may serve to remit AML. Several early phase clinical trials have tested anti-angiogenic agents, leukemia mobilizing agents, and vascular disrupting agents in AML patients. In general, these agents can be safely administered to AML patients and cardiovascular side effects were reported. Response rates to vascular targeting agents in AML have been modest; however, a majority of vascular targeting trials in AML are monotherapy in design and indiscriminate in patient recruitment. When considering the chemosensitizing effects of targeting the microenvironment, there is a strong rationale to build upon these early phase clinical trials and initiate phase IB/II trials of combination therapy where vascular targeting agents are positioned as priming agents for cytotoxic chemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The conditions of intra-oral cavities and effects of oral care in patients with hematological malignancies were retrospectively evaluated by dental hygienists from April 2008 to March 2011. RESULTS: Eleven of 28 patients(39.3%)who received routine professional oral care developed oral mucositis. In many such patients, intra-oral cavity deterioration, evidenced by a coated tongue and Candida infection, was observed. Although 25 of 28 patients with hematologic malignancies received specific oral mucositis care after chemotherapy initiation, those receiving continuous oral care subsequently made a full recovery.

The synthesized compounds were subjected to basic cytotoxic and antimicrobial tests. The synthetic protocol is described separately for each of the three series of the target amides, because each series of compounds required a different synthetic approach. The cytotoxicity was tested on cells derived from human T-lymphoblastic leukemia, breast adenocarcinoma and cervical cancer, and compared with the tests on normal human fibroblasts. Most of the target compounds (5a-5c, 11a-11c and 16a-16c) showed medium to high cytotoxicity (0.7-7.8 muM), however, in some cases the compounds showed high cytotoxicity even toward normal human fibroblasts (11a-11c). Two compounds of this series (11c and 16c) also displayed antimicrobial activity with high and selective microbe specificity. The compound 11c was potent against Escherichia coli (minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) 6.25 mug mL(-1), i.e. 9.75 nM mL(-1)) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 12.5 mug mL(-1), i.e. 19.5 nM mL(-1)), and showed medium activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The compound 16c was highly active against Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus (both, MIC 3.125 mug mL(-1), i.e. 4.22 nM mL(-1)), both Gram-positive bacteria, however showed only weak activity against E. coli and no activity against P. aeruginosa, both Gram-negative bacteria, which indicates possible microbe specificity of 16c. Comparing beta-sitosterol-based series (5a-5c) and betulinic acid series (11a-11c and 16a-16c) of the target compounds, the latter one gave more promising structures. The compounds 11c and 16c showed effects which may be described as multifarious activity (pleiotropic effects).",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Research concerning potential long-term consequences of the condition for the offspring, is limited, but lack of nutrition in-utero has been associated with chronic disease in adulthood, including some cancers. There is growing evidence that several forms of cancer may originate during fetal life. We conducted a large study linking the high-quality population-based medical birth- and cancer registries in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, to explore whether hyperemesis is associated with increased cancer risk in offspring. METHODS: A registry-based nested case-control study. Twelve types of childhood cancer were selected; leukemia, lymphoma, cancer of the central nervous system, testis, bone, ovary, breast, adrenal and thyroid gland, nephroblastoma, hepatoblastoma and retinoblastoma. Conditional logistic regression models were applied to study associations between hyperemesis and risk of childhood cancer, both all types combined and separately. Cancer types with five or more exposed cases were stratified by age at diagnosis. All analysis were adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity and smoking, in addition to the offspring's Apgar score, placental weight and birth weight. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: In total 14,805 cases and approximately ten controls matched on time, country of birth, sex and year of birth per case (147,709) were identified. None of the cancer types, analyzed combined or separately, revealed significant association with hyperemesis. When stratified according to age at diagnosis, we observed a RR 2.13 for lymphoma among adolescents aged 11-20 years ((95% CI 1.14-3.99), after adjustment for maternal ethnicity and maternal age, RR 2.08 (95% CI 1.11-3.90)). The finding was not apparent when a stricter level of statistical significance was applied. CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of this paper is that hyperemesis does not seem to increase cancer risk in offspring.

Although the majority of these mutations are relatively infrequent at diagnosis (at least at the population-level) they tend to accumulate as the disease progresses or at relapse. Besides TP53 aberrations, several of these newly mutated genes have consistently been linked to shorter time to progression/treatment and poor overall survival (e.g. NOTCH1, SF3B1, BIRC3). These findings coupled with the diverse (sub)clonal evolution trajectory followed by CLL cells, at least in treated patients, alludes to their role as major subclonal driver events for disease progression. Together with the dependence of CLL cells on B-cell receptor (BcR) signaling and antigen stimulation, this reveals a disease within which both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors conspire to fuel leukemogenesis, and we have only recently begun to understand their intricate interplay. This was further highlighted with the efficiency of new targeted therapy interfering with the microenvironment and in particular with BcR signaling.

Although Imatinib has been proven to be an effective drug against CML, its resistance has been observed with disease relapse due to T315I predominant point mutation. Liriodendron tulipifera L., one of the fastest growing hardwood tree species, exerts antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its anticancer effect has been minimally reported. In this study, we extracted CD-200 from Liriodendron tulipifera L. and investigated its effect on cell survival or apoptosis in CML cells with Bcr-Abl/T315I (BaF3/T315I) as well as wild-type Bcr-Abl (BaF3/WT). CD-200 inhibited cell proliferation in the BaF3/WT cells, and also in the BaF3/T315I cells with Imatinib resistance. Moreover, it strongly inhibited Bcr-Abl signaling pathways in a dose-dependent manner. Also, it significantly increased the sub-G1 phase and the expression of cleaved PARP and caspase-3, as well as the TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells. In addition, we observed that CD-200 induced apoptosis with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by decreasing the expression of Mcl-1 and survivin. Furthermore, CD-200 showed a significant inhibition in tumor growth, compared to Imatinib in BaF3/T315I mouse xenograft models. Taken together, our study demonstrates that CD-200 exhibits apoptosis induction and anti-proliferative effect by blocking the Bcr-Abl signaling pathways in the Bcr-Abl/T315I with resistance to Imatinib. We suggest that CD-200 may be a natural product to target Bcr-Abl and overcome Imatinib resistance in CML patients.",,"['Fang, Zhenghuan', 'Jung, Kyung Hee', 'Yan, Hong Hua', 'Kim, Soo Jung', 'Son, Mi Kwon', 'Rumman, Marufa', 'Lee, Hyunseung', 'Kim, Ki Woon', 'Yoo, Hye-Dong', 'Hong, Soon-Sun']","['Fang Z', 'Jung KH', 'Yan HH', 'Kim SJ', 'Son MK', 'Rumman M', 'Lee H', 'Kim KW', 'Yoo HD', 'Hong SS']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 400-712, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 400-712, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 400-712, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 400-712, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 400-712, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 400-712, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 400-712, Republic of Korea.', 'Chodang Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seoul 152-860, Republic of Korea.', 'Chodang Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seoul 152-860, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 400-712, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150511,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Lactones/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Liriodendron/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2015/05/13 06:00,2016/03/22 06:00,['2015/05/13 06:00'],"['2015/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2015.2994 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2015 Jul;47(1):253-61. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2015.2994.

PROCEDURE: We analyzed childhood leukemia incidence and survival trends in children aged 0-19 years from 1990 to 2011 in Songkhla, Thailand (n = 316) and compared these results to US data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry (n = 6,738). We computed relative survival using Ederer II and estimated survival functions using the Kaplan-Meier method. Changes in incidence and 5-year survival by year of diagnosis were evaluated using joinpoint regression and are reported as annual percent changes (APC). RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence of leukemia was 3.2 and 4.1 cases per 100,000 in Songkhla and SEER-9, respectively. In Songkhla, incidence from 1990 to 2011 significantly increased for leukemia (APC = 1.7%, P = 0.031) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (APC = 1.8%, P = 0.033). Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) incidence significantly increased (APC = 4.2%, P = 0.044) and was significantly different from the US (P = 0.026), where incidence was stable during the same period (APC = 0.3%, P = 0.541). The overall 5-year relative survival for leukemia was lower than that reported in the US (43 vs. 79%). Five-year survival significantly improved by at least 2% per year from 1990 to 2011 in Songkhla for leukemia, ALL, and AML (P < 0.050). CONCLUSIONS: While leukemia and ALL incidence increased in Songkhla, differences in leukemia trends, particularly AML incidence, may suggest etiologic or diagnostic differences between Songkhla and the US. This work highlights the importance of evaluating childhood cancer trends in low- and middle-income countries.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Demanelis, Kathryn', 'Sriplung, Hutcha', 'Meza, Rafael', 'Wiangnon, Surapon', 'Rozek, Laura S', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Lupo, Philip J']","['Demanelis K', 'Sriplung H', 'Meza R', 'Wiangnon S', 'Rozek LS', 'Scheurer ME', 'Lupo PJ']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Epidemiology Unit, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla, Thailand.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.', 'Department of Environmental Health Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150511,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Registries', 'SEER Program', 'Thailand/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Southeast Asia', 'Thailand', 'childhood leukemia', 'incidence', 'joinpoint regression', 'survival']",2015/05/13 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2015/05/13 06:00'],"['2015/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25571 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Oct;62(10):1790-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25571.

The relationship between obesity, cytokine polymorphisms, and selected mature B-cell neoplasms is reported. METHOD: Data on 4,979 cases and 4,752 controls from nine American/European studies from the InterLymph consortium (1988-2008) were pooled. For diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), joint associations of body mass index (from self-reported height and weight) and 12 polymorphisms in cytokines IL1A (rs1800587), IL1B (rs16944, rs1143627), IL1RN (rs454078), IL2 (rs2069762), IL6 (rs1800795, rs1800797), IL10 (rs1800890, rs1800896), TNF (rs1800629), LTA (rs909253), and CARD15 (rs2066847) were investigated using unconditional logistic regression. BMI-polymorphism interaction effects were estimated using the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). RESULTS: Obesity (BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2)) was associated with DLBCL risk [OR = 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.73], as was TNF-308GA+AA (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.44). Together, being obese and TNF-308GA+AA increased DLBCL risk almost 2-fold relative to those of normal weight and TNF-308GG (OR = 1.93; 95% CI, 1.27-2.94), with a RERI of 0.41 (95% CI, -0.05-0.84; Pinteraction = 0.13). For FL and CLL/SLL, no associations with obesity or TNF-308GA+AA, either singly or jointly, were observed. No evidence of interactions between obesity and the other polymorphisms were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cytokine polymorphisms do not generally interact with BMI to increase lymphoma risk but obesity and TNF-308GA+AA may interact to increase DLBCL risk.

These include cytopenias affecting the erythroid, megakaryoblastoid, myeloid and lymphoid lineages, as well as a variety of bicytopenias, pancytopenia, bone marrow necrosis / fat embolism syndrome, myelodysplastic syndrome, leucoerythroblastopenia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

It is characterized by persistent eosinophilia and organ damage after excluding other causes. Clonal eosinophilia is distinguished from idiopathic eosinophilia by the presence of histologic, cytogenetic, or molecular evidence of an underlying malignancy. There are two distinct subcategories of clonal eosinophilia: chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and mutations involving platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha/beta or fibroblast growth factor receptor 1. More than 50% of HES are without knowledge of underlying pathogenic molecular pathways. Here we examined a HES patient by oligo-based aCGH analysis and molecular cytogenetic methods. Examination for the common eosinophilia-related cytogenetic abnormalities involving the genes PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1 together with BCR-ABL fusion gene was negative. Cytogenetic analysis and multi-color FISH analysis revealed a novel cryptic three-way translocation t(2;11;5)(p21.3;q13.5;q23.2). By oaCGH analysis we could not find any copy number changes related to the cytogenetic breakpoints but instead detected a 0.9Mb submicroscopic deletion at 11p14.3. The deleted region involved the 5'-upstream sequences and exons 1-4 of the LUZP2 gene, which encodes a leucine zipper protein. Analysis of surrogate germ-line cells revealed a normal result showing that the detected chromosomal aberrations were acquired. This is the first report on a HES patient associated with a novel complex three-way translocation t(2;11;5)(p21.3;q13.5;q23.2) and a submicroscopic deletion in chromosome band 11p14.3. The study also demonstrates the benefits of oligo-based aCGH analysis in detecting hidden disease related chromosomal abnormalities. The present findings provide additional clues to unravel important molecular pathways in HES to obtain the full spectrum of acquired chromosomal and genomic aberrations in this heterogeneous disease entity.

However, its value in patients achieving <CR is not clear. We hypothesized that patients achieving a normalization of FLCr with initial therapy of MM will have an improved outcome, even in the absence of a CR. We retrospectively evaluated 449 patients with newly diagnosed MM with measurable disease at baseline, who did not achieve a CR with initial therapy. One hundred and fifty-three patients (34%) had a normal FLCr, whereas 296 (66%) had an abnormal ratio. Patients with a normal FLCr had a longer progression-free survival (29 vs 16 months, P<0.001) and OS (91 vs 58 months, P<0.001). Normalization of FLCr retained its prognostic value in a multivariable model.

It has been associated with malignant disease, especially acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), infections, autoimmune disorders and drugs, particularly granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). No cause is found in the rest, which are labelled idiopathic. We describe 15 patients with SS, which we believe represent 'immune dysregulation' secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We initially identified 31 patients with SS in a cohort of 744 patients with MDS and 215 with AML seen over a 6-year period (2004-10). The cause in 16 patients could be attributed either to administration of GCSF or chemotherapy. The eruption was brief and resolved spontaneously or following withdrawal of GCSF. Fifteen patients however, had a chronic debilitating illness dominated by the skin eruptions. Diagnosis of chronic relapsing SS was delayed because the pathology was not always typical of classical neutrophil-rich SS and included lymphocytic and histiocytoid infiltrates and bone marrow was not always performed because the relevance of the eruption to MDS was often not immediately appreciated. All these patients had 'low risk' MDS, diagnosed at a median of 17 months (range 0-157) following the diagnosis of SS.

Morphometric analyses were carried out in the bone marrow trephine samples of 44 children with ALL, using a NanoZoomer HT digital scanner. Diagnostic samples were compared to those of 32 control patients with solid tumors but without marrow involvement. Samples from patients with ALL had significantly increased fibrosis and the area occupied by bony trabeculae was lower than in controls. Cellularity was higher in ALL samples due to leukemic infiltration while the percentage of normal elements such as megakaryocytes, adipocytes, osteoblasts and osteoclasts were all significantly lower. During the course of Induction therapy, there was a decrease in the cellularity of ALL samples at day 15 of therapy with a further decrease at the end of Induction and an increase in the area occupied by adipocytes and the width of sinusoids.

The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) are discrete nuclear foci that contain several cellular proteins involved in intrinsic antiviral responses against a number of viruses. Accumulating reports have shown the importance of PML as a DNA virus restriction factor and how these pathogens evade this antiviral activity. However, very little information is available regarding the antiviral role of PML against RNA viruses. Dengue virus (DENV) is an RNA emerging mosquito-borne human pathogen affecting millions of individuals each year by causing severe and potentially fatal syndromes. Since no licensed antiviral drug against DENV infection is currently available, it is of great importance to understand the factors mediating intrinsic immunity that may lead to the development of new pharmacological agents that can boost their potency and thereby lead to treatments for this viral disease.

The molecular mechanisms that regulate CSC properties are poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a significant role in normal and cancer tissues. Here, we show that miRNA-125a indirectly regulates TAZ, an effector molecule in the Hippo pathway, through the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). The miR-125a-->LIFR axis affected the homeostasis of nonmalignant and malignant breast epithelial stem cells through the Hippo signaling pathway. Inhibition of miR-125a in breast cancer cells led to a significant reduction in the CSC pool. In contrast, enhanced expression of miR-125a in nonmalignant breast epithelial cells resulted in significant expansion of the stem cell pool. Gain of function and loss of function of LIFR directly correlated with the inhibition and overexpression of miR-125a, respectively. Modulation of miR-125a led to a change in the activity of TAZ and its subcellular localization. We further demonstrated that miR-125a influenced stem cells by regulating Hippo signaling through LIFR in human primary breast cancer cells confirming the data obtained from established cell lines.

However, precise regulatory mechanisms of WT1 overexpression remain undetermined. In the present study, microRNA-125a (miR-125a) was identified as a miRNA that suppressed WT1 expression via binding to the WT1-3'UTR. MiR-125a knockout mice overexpressed WT1, developed myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) characterized by expansion of myeloid cells in bone marrow (BM), spleen and peripheral blood, and displayed urogenital abnormalities. Silencing of WT1 expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells of miR-125a knockout MPD mice by short-hairpin RNA inhibited myeloid colony formation in vitro. Furthermore, the incidence and severity of MPD were lower in miR-125a (-/-) mice than in miR-125a (+/-) mice, indicating the operation of compensatory mechanisms for the complete loss of miR-125a. To elucidate the compensatory mechanisms, miRNA array was performed. MiR-486 was occasionally induced in compete loss of miR-125a and inhibited WT1 expression instead of miR-125a, resulting in the cancellation of MPD occurrence.

This study assessed CML reporting in eastern Pennsylvania where a cluster of another myeloproliferative neoplasm was previously identified. METHODS: Cases were identified from 2 sources: 1) PCR case reports for residents of Carbon, Luzerne, or Schuylkill County with International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) codes 9875 (CML, BCR-ABL+), 9863 (CML, NOS), and 9860 (myeloid leukemia) and date of diagnosis 2001-2009, and 2) review of billing records at hematology practices. Participants were interviewed and their medical records were reviewed by board-certified hematologists. RESULTS: PCR reports included 99 cases coded 9875 or 9863 and 9 cases coded 9860; 2 additional cases were identified by review of billing records. Of the 110 identified cases, 93 were mailed consent forms, 23 consented, and 12 medical records were reviewed. Hematologists confirmed 11 of 12 reviewed cases as CML cases; all 11 confirmed cases were BCR/ABL positive, but only 1 was coded as positive (code 9875). CONCLUSIONS: Very few unreported CML cases were identified, suggesting relatively complete reporting to the PCR. Cases reviewed were accurately diagnosed, but ICD-0-3 coding often did not reflect BCR-ABL-positive tests.

In this study we further define risk by assessing timing of relapse and the effects of leukemia risk category and post-HCT MRD. By multivariate analysis, pre-HCT MRD <0.1% and aGvHD by day +55 were associated with decreased relapse and improved event-free survival (EFS). Intermediate leukemia risk status predicted decreased relapse, and improved EFS and overall survival (OS). Patients with pre-HCT MRD 0.1% who did not develop aGvHD compared with those with MRD <0.1% who did develop aGvHD had much worse survival (2 years EFS 18% vs 71%; P=0.001, 2 years OS 46 vs 74%; P=0.04). Patients with pre-HCT MRD <0.1% who did not experience aGvHD had higher rates of relapse than those who did develop aGvHD (40% vs 13%; P= 0.008).

TM9SF4 homologs, previously identified in many different species, were mainly involved in cellular adhesion, innate immunity and phagocytosis. In human, the function and biological significance of TM9SF4 are currently under investigation. However, TM9SF4 was found overexpressed in human metastatic melanoma and in a small subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AMLs) and myelodysplastic syndromes, consistent with an oncogenic function of this gene. PURPOSE AND RESULTS: In this study, we first analyzed the expression and regulation of TM9SF4 in normal and leukemic cells and identified TM9SF4 as a gene highly expressed in human quiescent CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), regulated during monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of HPCs, both lineages giving rise to mature myeloid cells involved in adhesion, phagocytosis and immunity. Then, we found that TM9SF4 is markedly overexpressed in leukemic cells and in AMLs, particularly in M2, M3 and M4 AMLs (i.e., in AMLs characterized by the presence of a more or less differentiated granulocytic progeny), as compared to normal CD34+ HPCs. Proliferation and differentiation of HPCs occurs in hypoxia, a physiological condition in bone marrow, but also a crucial component of cancer microenvironment. Here, we investigated the impact of hypoxia on TM9SF4 expression in leukemic cells and identified TM9SF4 as a direct target of HIF-1alpha, downregulated in these cells by hypoxia. Then, we found that the hypoxia-mediated downregulation of TM9SF4 expression is associated with a decrease of cell adhesion of leukemic cells to fibronectin, thus demonstrating that human TM9SF4 is a new molecule involved in leukemic cell adhesion. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our study reports for the first time the expression of TM9SF4 at the level of normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells and its marked expression at the level of AMLs displaying granulocytic differentiation.",,"['Paolillo, Rosa', 'Spinello, Isabella', 'Quaranta, Maria Teresa', 'Pasquini, Luca', 'Pelosi, Elvira', 'Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Testa, Ugo', 'Labbaye, Catherine']","['Paolillo R', 'Spinello I', 'Quaranta MT', 'Pasquini L', 'Pelosi E', 'Lo Coco F', 'Testa U', 'Labbaye C']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine of Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine of Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine of Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine of Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine of Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy; Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine of Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine of Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150511,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TM9SF4 protein, human)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oxygen/*pharmacology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2015/05/12 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/05/12 06:00'],"['2015/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0126968 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-02628 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 11;10(5):e0126968. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0126968. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4427288,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current screening strategies target CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutations to the 5' exons of candidate genes, but this approach often produces in-frame variants that retain functionality, which can obscure even strong genetic dependencies. Here we overcome this limitation by targeting CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to exons encoding functional protein domains. This generates a higher proportion of null mutations and substantially increases the potency of negative selection. We also show that the magnitude of negative selection can be used to infer the functional importance of individual protein domains of interest. A screen of 192 chromatin regulatory domains in murine acute myeloid leukemia cells identifies six known drug targets and 19 additional dependencies. A broader application of this approach may allow comprehensive identification of protein domains that sustain cancer cells and are suitable for drug targeting.",,"['Shi, Junwei', 'Wang, Eric', 'Milazzo, Joseph P', 'Wang, Zihua', 'Kinney, Justin B', 'Vakoc, Christopher R']","['Shi J', 'Wang E', 'Milazzo JP', 'Wang Z', 'Kinney JB', 'Vakoc CR']","['1] Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, USA.

Indeed, it costimulates T and natural killer (NK) cell proliferation and function and regulates B cell survival and differentiation and the function of dendritic cells. In addition, IL-21 exerts divergent effects on different lymphoid cell leukemia and lymphomas, as it may support cell proliferation or on the contrary induce growth arrest or apoptosis of the neoplastic lymphoid cells. Several preclinical studies showed that IL-21 has antitumor activity in different tumor models, through mechanism involving the activation of NK and T or B cell responses. Moreover, IL-21's antitumor activity can be potentiated by its combination with other immune-enhancing molecules, monoclonal antibodies recognizing tumor antigens, chemotherapy, or molecular targeted agents. Clinical phase I-II studies of IL-21 in cancer patients showed immune stimulatory properties, acceptable toxicity profile, and antitumor effects in a fraction of patients. In view of its tolerability, IL-21 is also suitable for combinational therapeutic regimens with other agents.

The NPM1-associated gene set (GCM_NPM1), in total 116 genes including NPM1, was chosen as the candidate gene set for the coexpression analysis. We wonder if NPM1-associated genes can affect the ribosomal synthesis and translation process in CML. RESULTS: We presented a distribution-based approach for gene pair classification by identifying a disease-specific cutoff point that classified the coexpressed gene pairs into strong and weak coexpression structures. The differences in the coexpression patterns between the normal and the CML groups were reflected from the overall structure by performing two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Our developed method effectively identified the coexpression pattern differences from the overall structure: P value = 1.71 x 10(-22) < 0.05 for the maximum deviation D = 0.109. Moreover, we found that genes involved in the ribosomal synthesis and translation process tended to be coexpressed in the CML group. CONCLUSION: Our developed method can identify the coexpression difference between two different groups. Dysregulation of ribosomal synthesis and translation process may be related to the CML disease.

BAALC gene (Brain and Acute Leukemia Cytoplasmic gene) is a recently identified gene on chromosome 8q22.3 that has prognostic significance in AML. The aim of this work was to study the impact of BAALC gene expression on prognosis of AML in Egyptian children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 40 Egyptian children with newly diagnosed AML who were subjected to full history taking, clinical examination and laboratory investigations including: complete blood count, LDH, bone marrow aspiration, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping and assessment of BAALC Gene by real time PCR in bone marrow aspirate mononuclear cells before the start of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Positive BAALC gene expression was found in 24 cases (60%) and negative expression in 16 cases (40%). Positive BAALC gene expression group includes 14 males and 10 females with mean age at presentation of 8.35+/-2.63 while negative BAALC gene expression includes 10 males and 6 females with mean age at presentation of 7.74+/-3.23 with no statistically significant differences between patients with positive and negative BAALC gene expression regarding age, sex and clinical presentations at time of diagnosis including pallor, purpura, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy and laboratory investigations including WBCs and platelets counts, hemoglobin and LDH levels, and peripheral blood and bone marrow blast cell counts. There was significant association between positive BAALC gene expression and M1 and M2 compared with negative BAALC gene expression which is significantly associated with M4. There were statistically significant differences in disease outcome between positive and negative BAALC gene expression groups with higher rate of relapse and death and lower rate of complete remission and disease free survival in positive BAALC gene expression group compared with negative BAALC gene expression group.

Neutropenia and mucositis are the most common predisposing factors for infection with other pathogens in cancer patients. In this study, we investigated the clinical characteristics of NVS bacteremia in cancer patients and identified risk factors and outcomes associated with these infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all cases of NVS bacteremia occurring from June 1999 to April 2014 at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute. The computerized epidemiology report provided by the microbiology laboratory identified thirteen cancer patients with NVS bacteremia. We collected data regarding baseline demographics and clinical characteristics such as age, sex, underlying malignancy, neutropenic status, duration of neutropenia, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were identified with positive NVS blood stream infection. Ten patients (77%) had hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)(1), multiple myeloma (MM)(1), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)(4), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)(4). The non-hematologic malignancies included esophageal cancer(2) and bladder cancer (1).

We showed that the lower-expression group had a shorter overall survival time and shorter relapse-free survival time compared with those of the high-expression group (37.6+/-1.6 versus 54.0+/-1.3 months, 28.6+/-1.8 months versus 44.8+/-2.1 months, respectively, P<0.05), and Cox regression showed that HES1 was an independent prognostic factor.

To date, mutations in the IDH1 gene have been found in numerous cancers with the highest frequencies occurring in gliomas, chondrosarcomas/enchondromas and cholangiocarcinomas. SCOPE OF REVIEW: IDH1 was first described in the scientific literature as early as 1950. Early researchers proposed that the enzyme likely functions in cellular lipid metabolism based on the observation that the enzymatic reaction produces NADPH and partially localizes to peroxisomes. This article highlights the studies implicating IDH1 in cytoplasmic and peroxisomal lipid metabolism from the early researchers to the recent studies examining mutant IDH1(R132), the most common IDH1 mutation found in cancer. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: While a role for IDH1 in lipid biosynthesis in the liver and adipose tissue is now established, a role in lipid metabolism in the brain and tumors is beginning to be examined. The recent discoveries that IDH1(R132H) interferes with the metabolism of phospholipids in gliomas and that IDH1 activity could participate in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from glutamine in hypoxic tumors highlight roles for IDH1 in lipid metabolism in a broad spectrum of tissues. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Interferences in cytoplasmic and peroxisomal lipid metabolism by IDH1(R132) may contribute to the more favorable clinical outcome in patients whose tumors express mutations in the IDH1 gene.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Several models of natural killer cell reactivity have been associated with improved outcomes after myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), but this issue has not been rigorously addressed in reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) unrelated donor (URD) HCT. We studied 909 patients undergoing RIC-URD HCT. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 612) lacking >/= 1 KIR ligands experienced higher grade III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.28; P = .005) compared to those with all ligands present. Absence of HLA-C2 for donor KIR2DL1 was associated with higher grade II to IV (HR, 1.4; P = .002) and III to IV acute GVHD (HR, 1.5; P = .01) compared with HLA-C2(+) patients. AML patients with KIR2DS1(+), HLA-C2 homozygous donors had greater treatment-related mortality compared with others (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.2; P = .002) but did not experience lower relapse. There were no significant associations with outcomes for AML when assessing donor-activating KIRs or centromeric KIR content or for any donor-recipient KIR-HLA assessments in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 297).

Recent studies have identified BRAF(V600E) mutations in most HCL patients, highlighting this abnormality as a molecular hallmark for this disease. Cell lines originating from HCL patients lack BRAF mutations but retain the typical piliferous morphology and the distinctive HCL immunophenotype, thus, constituting suitable tools for identifying alternative tumor genes and leukemic mechanisms in this malignancy. To this end, we integrated genomic and transcriptional profiling of the HCL cell line MLMA. The expression levels of genomically targeted genes were compared to four HCL control cell lines, thus, identifying 91 chromosomally deregulated genes. Gene set enrichment analysis of these indicted apoptosis, proliferation, and DNA damage response as altered processes. Accordingly, prominent target genes overexpressed in this cell line include ATM, BRAF, CDK6, CUTL1/CUX1, H2AFX, and REL. Treatment of MLMA with selective pharmacological inhibitors and specific siRNA-mediated gene knockdowns highlighted a central role for NFkB in their deregulation in HCL. Moreover, relevant expression profiling data from HCL and ABC-DLBCL cell lines display elevated NFkB-pathway activity when compared to GC-DLBCL equivalents. Finally, analysis of HCL patient samples in silico collectively supported the clinical significance of NFkB activation in this disease. In conclusion, we identified deregulated genes and multiple mechanisms underlying aberrantly activated NFkB-pathway in HCL.

A total of 1912 MDS patients from the Duesseldorf registry with less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow were evaluable and had complete covariates. As endpoints, overall survival and progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were considered. Cox models were computed for both outcomes. A multivariate Cox model for survival confirmed higher age and male sex as risk factors. In addition, we found a survival advantage of 9.1 years for MDS del(5q) patients compared to refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia, while the survival advantage of MDS del(5q) over refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia was 18.6 years. Considering progression to AML, we did not find any significant differences between the World Health Organization classification subtypes. Our analyses show that the higher survival probabilities of MDS del(5q) patients are not only due to age and sex, although higher age and male sex were also important risk factors.

Cyclin E normally accumulates at the G1/S boundary, where it promotes S phase entry and progression by activating Cdk2. In normal cells, cyclin E/Cdk2 activity is associated with DNA replication-related functions. However, deregulation of cyclin E leads to inefficient assembly of pre-replication complexes, replication stress, and chromosome instability. In malignant cells, cyclin E is frequently overexpressed, correlating with decreased survival in breast cancer patients. Transgenic mice deregulated for cyclin E in the mammary epithelia develop carcinoma, confirming that cyclin E is an oncoprotein. However, it remains unknown how cyclin E-mediated replication stress promotes genomic instability during carcinogenesis. Here, we show that deregulation of cyclin E causes human mammary epithelial cells to enter into mitosis with short unreplicated genomic segments at a small number of specific loci, leading to anaphase anomalies and ultimately deletions. Incompletely replicated regions are preferentially located at late-replicating domains, fragile sites, and breakpoints, including the mixed-lineage leukemia breakpoint cluster region (MLL BCR). Furthermore, these regions are characterized by a paucity of replication origins or unusual DNA structures. Analysis of a large set of breast tumors shows a significant correlation between cyclin E amplification and deletions at a number of the genomic loci identified in our study. Our results demonstrate how oncogene-induced replication stress contributes to genomic instability in human cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated DNA copy number aberrations in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray. We found that a novel amplification at the chromosomal region 3q26 occurs in the HCC cell line JHH-1, and that MECOM (MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus), which lies within the 3q26 region, was amplified. Quantitative PCR analysis of the three transcripts transcribed from MECOM indicated that only EVI1, but not the fusion transcript MDS1-EVI1 or MDS1, was overexpressed in JHH-1 cells and was significantly upregulated in 22 (61%) of 36 primary HCC tumors when compared with their non-tumorous counterparts. A copy number gain of EVI1 was observed in 24 (36%) of 66 primary HCC tumors. High EVI1 expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size and higher level of des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin, a tumor marker for HCC. Knockdown of EVI1 resulted in increased induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15(INK) (4B) by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and decreased expression of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and phosphorylated Rb in TGF-beta-treated cells. Consequently, knockdown of EVI1 led to reduced DNA synthesis and cell viability. Collectively, our results suggest that EVI1 is a probable target gene that acts as a driving force for the amplification at 3q26 in HCC and that the oncoprotein EVI1 antagonizes TGF-beta-mediated growth inhibition of HCC cells.","['(c) 2015 The Authors.

The multifunctional DNA dendrimer is constructed from functional Y-shaped building blocks with predesigned base-pairing hybridization including fluorophores, targeting DNA aptamers and intercalated anticancer drugs. With controllable step-by-step self-assembly, the programmable DNA dendrimer has several appealing features, including facile modular design, excellent biostability and biocompatibility, high selectivity, strong binding affinity, good cell internalization efficiency, and high drug loading capacity. Due to the unique structural features of DNA dendrimers, multiple copies of aptamers can be incorporated into each dendrimer, generating a multivalent aptamer-tethered nanostructure with enhanced binding affinity. A model chemotherapeutic anticancer drug, doxorubicin, was delivered via these aptamer-based DNA dendrimers and exerted a potent toxicity for target cancer cells (human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line) with low side effects for the non-target cells (human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line).

However, they may lose statistical power or may not control type I error due to their model assumption and/or instable parameter estimation algorithm when the genetic variant is rare or sample size is limited. To solve this problem, we propose a set-valued (SV) system model to identify genetic variants associated with an ordinal categorical phenotype. We couple this model with a SV system identification algorithm to identify all the key system parameters. Simulations and two real data analyses show that SV and LG accurately controlled the Type I error rate even at a significance level of 10(-6) but not oLG and oPRB in some cases. LG had significantly less power than the other three methods due to disregarding of the ordinal nature of the phenotype, and SV had similar or greater power than oLG and oPRB.

The DNA polymerase active site resides in the palm subdomain, and the RNase H active site is located in the RNase H domain. The RNase H domain contains a positively charged alpha-helix called the C helix (H(594)GEIYRRR(601)), that is thought to be involved in substrate recognition. In this study, we expressed three versions of the RNase H domain in Escherichia coli, the wild-type domain (WT) (residues Ile498-Leu671) and two variants that lack the regions containing the C helix (Ile593-Leu603 and Gly595-Thr605, which we called DeltaC1 and DeltaC2, respectively) with a strep-tag at the N-terminus and a deca-histidine tag at the C-terminus. These peptides were purified from the cells by anion-exchange, Ni(2+) affinity, and Strep-Tactin affinity column chromatography, and then the tags were removed by proteolysis. In an RNase H assay using a 25-bp RNA-DNA heteroduplex, WT, DeltaC1, and DeltaC2 produced RNA fragments ranging from 7 to 16 nucleotides (nt) whereas the full-length MMLV RT (Thr24-Leu671) produced 14-20-nt RNA fragments, suggesting that elimination of the fingers, palm, thumb, and connection subdomains affects the binding of the RNase H domain to the RNA-DNA heteroduplex. The activity levels of WT, DeltaC1, and DeltaC2 were estimated to be 1%, 0.01%, and 0.01% of full-length MMLV RT activity, indicating that the C helix is important, but not critical, for the activity of the isolated RNase H domain.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, knowledge about these topics and their associations in adult survivors of childhood cancer is largely lacking. METHODS: Participants completed web-based questionnaires concerning body image, body dissociation, sexual satisfaction, and relationship status satisfaction (i.e., satisfaction with either being in a relationship or being single). Survivors (n = 87) and controls (n = 87) were matched on age and gender, with a mean age of 27 years (range: 20-40). Survivors were most often diagnosed with leukemia (46%), at an average of 16 years prior to study participation (range: 6-33 years). RESULTS: Similar numbers of survivors and controls were single (n = 24/31), in a committed relationship (n = 33/23), or married (n = 30/33). Survivors and controls reported comparable levels of body image, body dissociation, sexual experiences, and sexual and status satisfaction (d = 0.15-0.28). Higher status satisfaction was associated with being in a relationship (compared with being single, beta = 0.439), more positive body image (beta = 0.196), and higher sexual satisfaction (beta = 0.200). CONCLUSIONS: Adult survivors of childhood cancer were comparable to healthy peers regarding views of their bodies and psychosexual development, which was unexpected. Independent of whether people experienced cancer or not, their status satisfaction was associated with their relationship status, body image, and sexual satisfaction. Future research should explore why sexual and body problems are identified after adult onset cancer, whereas this seems to be less of a problem in childhood cancer survivors.","['Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Lehmann, Vicky', 'Hagedoorn, Mariet', 'Gerhardt, Cynthia A', 'Fults, Marci', 'Olshefski, Randal S', 'Sanderman, Robbert', 'Tuinman, Marrit A']","['Lehmann V', 'Hagedoorn M', 'Gerhardt CA', 'Fults M', 'Olshefski RS', 'Sanderman R', 'Tuinman MA']","[""The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."", 'Health Psychology Research Section, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Health Psychology Research Section, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), Groningen, The Netherlands.', ""The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."", 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', ""The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."", 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."", 'Health Psychology Research Section, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Health Psychology Research Section, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150508,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Image', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Peer Group', '*Personal Satisfaction', 'Risk Assessment/statistics & numerical data', 'Sexual Behavior/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological/*psychology', 'Sexuality/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/05/12 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/12 06:00'],"['2014/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3841 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2016 Feb;25(2):210-6. doi: 10.1002/pon.3841.

Both WT Sp6 and Sp6/B7 showed down-regulated expression of MHC H-2 L(d). Increase of H-2 L(d) expression by cDNA transfection (Sp6/B7/L(d)) raised tumour immune protection and shifted most CTL responses towards H-2 L(d)-restricted antigenic epitopes. The tumour-protective responses were not specific for the H-2 L(d)-restricted immunodominant AH1 epitope of the gp70 common mouse tumour antigen, although WT Sp6 and transfectants were able to present it to specific T cells in vitro. Gp70 transcripts, absent in secondary lymphoid organs of naive mice, were detected in immunized mice as well as in splenocytes from naive mice incubated in vitro with supernatants of CTL-lysed Sp6 cell cultures, containing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). It has been shown that Toll-like receptor triggering induces gp70 expression. Damage-associated molecular patterns are released by CTL-mediated killing of Sp6/B7-Sp6/B7/L(d) cells migrated to draining lymph nodes during immunization and may activate gp70 expression and presentation in most resident antigen-presenting cells. The same could also apply for Mus musculus endogenous ecotropic murine leukaemia virus 1 particles present in Sp6-cytosol, discharged by dying cells and superinfecting antigen-presenting cells.

The reaction intermediates, porphyrins and iron and the final product, heme can be highly cytotoxic if allowed to accumulate. The importance of maintaining the levels of metabolic intermediates and heme within a narrow range is apparent based on the complex homeostatic system(s) that have developed. Ultimately, determining the enzymatic activity of ALA synthase (ALAS) present in the mitochondria is highly beneficial to confirm the effects of the transcriptional, translational and post-translational events. The aim of this study was to develop a highly sensitive assay for ALAS that could be used on whole tissue or cellular homogenates. DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic approach was used to optimize steps in formation of ALA by ALAS. Reducing the signal to noise ratio for the assay was achieved by derivatizing the ALA formed into a fluorescent product that could be efficiently separated by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) from other derivatized primary amines. The stability of ALAS activity in whole tissue homogenate and cellular homogenate was determined after extended storage at -80 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: A method for assaying ALAS has been developed that can be used with tissue homogenates or cellular lysates. There is no need to purify mitochondria and radiolabeled substrates are not needed for this assay. General laboratory reagents can be used to prepare the samples. Standard UPLC chromatography will resolve the derivatized ALA peak. Samples of tissue homogenate can be stored for approximately one year without significant loss of enzymatic activity.","['Copyright (c) 2015 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

It has shown efficacy in a range of solid organ and haematopoietic tumours in vitro, and several clinical trials are underway or completed in the field of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). The treatment of relapsed and refractory AML is a clinical challenge, where long-term survival is rare without allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. AREAS COVERED: We review the data from the published clinical trials of vosaroxin, including the recently presented Phase III VALOR study. In combination with intermediate dose cytarabine, vosaroxin almost doubled complete response (CR) rates in relapsed and refractory AML compared with cytarabine alone, and prolonged median survival by 1.4 months. EXPERT OPINION: Vosaroxin is a promising new agent in the treatment of AML, with the potential to improve CR rates in a high-risk group of patients with relapsed and refractory AML. However, higher CR rates have been associated with higher rates of treatment-related morbidity and mortality, especially in elderly/unfit patients. Maximising the potential of vosaroxin will therefore require the identification of patients most likely to benefit from vosaroxin-containing combination regimens.",,"['Hotinski, Anya K', 'Lewis, Ian D', 'Ross, David M']","['Hotinski AK', 'Lewis ID', 'Ross DM']","['Royal Adelaide Hospital, Leukaemia Fellow, SA Pathology , Adelaide, SA 5000 , Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150510,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'K6A90IIZ19 (vosaroxin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Naphthyridines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Failure']",['NOTNLM'],"['SNS-595', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'elderly', 'refractory', 'relapsed', 'topoisomerase-II', 'voreloxin', 'vosaroxin']",2015/05/12 06:00,2015/10/13 06:00,['2015/05/12 06:00'],"['2015/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2015.1044437 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2015 Jun;16(9):1395-402. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2015.1044437.

CCR4 is expressed on some tumor cells such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), adult peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). CCR4 is also expressed on majority of Tregs, mainly effector Tregs. In this study we have successfully developed three versions of diphtheria-toxin based anti-human CCR4 immunotoxins (monovalent, bivalent and single-chain fold-back diabody). Binding analysis by flow cytometry showed that all three versions of the anti-human CCR4 immunotoxins bound to the human CCR4(+) tumor cell line as well as CCR4(+) human PBMC. The bivalent isoform bound stronger than its monovalent counterpart and the single-chain foldback diabody isoform was the strongest among the three versions. In vitro efficacy analysis demonstrated that the bivalent isoform was 20 fold more potent in inhibiting cellular proliferation and protein synthesis in human CCR4(+) tumor cells compared to the monovalent anti-human CCR4 immunotoxin. The single-chain fold-back diabody isoform was 10 fold more potent than its bivalent counterpart and 200 fold more potent than its monovalent counterpart. The in vivo efficacy was assessed using a human CCR4(+) tumor-bearing mouse model. The immunotoxin significantly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing NOD/SCID IL-2 receptor gamma(-/-) (NSG) mice injected with human CCR4(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells compared with the control group. This novel anti-human CCR4 immunotoxin is a promising drug candidate for targeting human CCR4(+) tumor cells and Tregs in vivo.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Human pulmonary fibroblasts showed the highest sensitivity to the AgNPs. A modified comet assay using endonuclease III and formamidopyrimidine- DNA glycosylase restriction enzymes showed that in tumoral and normal human dermal fibroblasts, pyrimidines and purines were oxidatively damaged by both AgNPs, but the damage was not size-dependent.

We analyzed outcomes of 68 patients with poor-risk CLL/SLL who underwent reduced-intensity (RIC) UCBT from 2004 to 2012. The median age was 57 years and median follow-up 36 months; 17 patients had del 17p/p53mutation, 19 patients had fludarabine-refractory disease, 11 relapsed after autologous stem cell transplantation, 8 had diagnosis of prolymphocytic leukemia, 4 had Richter syndrome, and 8 underwent transplantation with progressive or refractory disease. The most common RIC used was cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and total body irradiation (TBI) in 82%; 15 patients received antithymocyte globulin. Most of the cord blood grafts were HLA mismatched and 76% received a double UCBT. Median total nucleated cells collected was 4.7 x 10(7)/kg. The cumulative incidences (CI) of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 84% and 72% at 60 and 180 days respectively; day 100 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (grade II to IV) was 43% and 3-year chronic GVHD was 32%. The CI of relapse, nonrelapse mortality, overall survival, and progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years were 16%, 39%, 54%, and 45%, respectively.

The promoter polymorphisms in these genes were shown to alter the protein function or expression and exert an impact on apoptosis regulation. Deregulation in the expression of any of these genes leads to disruption of cellular homeostasis and malignant transformation. The present study was aimed to determine the association of BCL2-938C>A and BAX-248G>A promoter polymorphisms with origin and progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We also have performed combined genotype analysis to evaluate the cumulative effect of risk genotypes in the AML development. These polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 221 AML patients and 305 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Our study revealed that BCL2-938CA (p = 0.018) and BAX-248GG (0.043) genotypes were significantly associated with increased risk for AML occurrence. BAX-248A allele had shown decreased risk for AML. The combined analysis had shown that BCL2-938CA+AA-BAX-248GG group had a 1.63-fold (95 % CI: 1.08-2.45, p = 0.02) increased risk for AML. None of the clinical variables had shown any significant association with both polymorphisms. With respect to complete remission (CR) rate, BAX-248GG genotype (p = 0.002) and G allele (p = 0.009) had conferred significant risk for complete remission failure. Although the log rank test was not significant, survival analysis had shown a trend where BCL2-938CA genotype, and BAX-248GG had reduced median disease-free survival (DFS) of 9 and 10 months, respectively. In conclusion, BCL2-938C>A and BAX-248G>A gene polymorphisms might contribute to the origin of AML. Moreover, influence of BAX-248GG genotype on CR and DFS rate suggests that the BAX-248G>A polymorphism can serve as marker for poor prognosis in AML.",,"['Cingeetham, Anuradha', 'Vuree, Sugunakar', 'Dunna, Nageswara Rao', 'Gorre, Manjula', 'Nanchari, Santhoshi Rani', 'Edathara, Prajitha Mohandas', 'Meka, Phannibhushann', 'Annamaneni, Sandhya', 'Digumarthi, Raghunadharao', 'Sinha, Sudha', 'Satti, Vishnupriya']","['Cingeetham A', 'Vuree S', 'Dunna NR', 'Gorre M', 'Nanchari SR', 'Edathara PM', 'Meka P', 'Annamaneni S', 'Digumarthi R', 'Sinha S', 'Satti V']","['Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'School of Chemical and Biotechnology, SASTRA University, Thanjuvur, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India.', 'Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Visakhapatnam, 530053, India.', 'MNJ Institute of Oncology Regional Cancer Center, Hyderabad, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 500007, India. sattivishnupriya@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150510,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA/analysis/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BAX', 'BCL2', 'Complete remission', 'Disease-free survival', 'PCR-RFLP']",2015/05/11 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/05/11 06:00'],"['2014/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-3457-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-3457-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 Sep;36(10):7967-76. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-3457-4.

To optimize the chemotherapy strategies, more practical and sensitive markers are needed to monitor the early treatment response during induction. For instance, peripheral blood (PB) blast clearance rate may be considered as such a monitoring marker. METHODS: PB blasts were monitored through multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC). Absolute counts were determined before treatment (D0) and at specified time points of induction chemotherapy (D3, D5, D7, and D9). The cut-off value of D5 peripheral blast clearance rate (D5-PBCR) was defined through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Prognostic effects were compared among different patient groups according to D5-PBCR cut-off value. RESULTS: D5-PBCR cut-off value was determined as 99.55%. Prognostic analysis showed that patients with D5-PBCR >/=99.55% more likely achieved complete remission (94.6% vs. 56.1%, P < 0.001) and maintained a relapse-free status than other patients (80.56% vs. 57.14%, P = 0.027). Survival analysis revealed that relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were longer in patients with D5-PBCR >/=99.55% than in other patients (two-year OS: 71.0% vs. 38.7%, P = 0.011; two-year RFS: 69.4% vs. 30.7%, P = 0.026). In cytogenetic-molecular intermediate-risk group, a subgroup with worse outcome could be distinguished on the basis of D5-PBCR (<99.55%; OS: P = 0.033, RFS: P = 0.086). CONCLUSIONS: An effective evaluation method of early treatment response was established by monitoring PB blasts through MFC. D5-PBCR cut-off value (99.55%) can be a reliable reference to predict treatment response and outcome in early stages of chemotherapy. The proposed marker may be used in induction regimen modification and help optimize cytogenetic-molecular prognostic risk stratification.",,"['Yu, Cong', 'Kong, Qing-lei', 'Zhang, Yun-xiang', 'Weng,

However, CLL remains largely incurable, with drug resistance and treatment relapse a common occurrence, leading to the search for novel treatments. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-specific inhibitors have been previously assessed but their efficacy is limited due to a positive feedback loop via mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), resulting in activation of prosurvival signaling. In this study, we show that the dual phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502 does not induce an mTORC2 positive feedback loop similar to other PI3K inhibitors but does induce substantial antitumor effects. PF-04691502 significantly reduced survival coincident with the induction of Noxa and Puma, independently of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutational status, CD38, and ZAP-70 expression. PF-04691502 inhibited both anti-immunoglobulin M-induced signaling and overcame stroma-induced survival signals and migratory stimuli from CXCL12. Equivalent in vitro activity was seen in the Emu-TCL1 murine model of CLL. In vivo, PF-04691502 treatment of tumor-bearing animals resulted in a transient lymphocytosis, followed by a clear reduction in tumor in the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. These data indicate that PF-04691502 or other dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in development may prove efficacious for the treatment of CLL, increasing our armamentarium to successfully manage this disease.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Blunt, Matthew D', 'Carter, Matthew J', 'Larrayoz, Marta', 'Smith, Lindsay D', 'Aguilar-Hernandez, Maria', 'Cox, Kerry L', 'Tipton, Thomas', 'Reynolds, Mark', 'Murphy, Sarah', 'Lemm, Elizabeth', 'Dias, Samantha', 'Duncombe, Andrew', 'Strefford, Jonathan C', 'Johnson, Peter W M', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Packham, Graham', 'Cragg, Mark S', 'Steele, Andrew J']","['Blunt MD', 'Carter MJ', 'Larrayoz M', 'Smith LD', 'Aguilar-Hernandez M', 'Cox KL', 'Tipton T', 'Reynolds M', 'Murphy S', 'Lemm E', 'Dias S', 'Duncombe A', 'Strefford JC', 'Johnson PW', 'Forconi F', 'Stevenson FK', 'Packham G', 'Cragg MS', 'Steele AJ']","['Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Cuicuilco, Mexico;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; Hematology Department, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom; and.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; Hematology Department, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom; and Cancer Research United Kingdom Centre, National Institute for Health Research, Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150508,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0', '(2-amino-8-(4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)cyclohexyl)-6-(6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-4-methylpyri', 'do(2,3-d)pyrimidin-7(8H)-one)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pyridones/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2015/05/10 06:00,2015/09/05 06:00,['2015/05/10 06:00'],"['2014/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31506-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-11-610329 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 25;125(26):4032-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-11-610329.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Bone marrow samples from 132 patients with AML were analyzed by nine-color multiparametric flow cytometry. We confirmed the presence of the mutation in diagnostic samples and in sorted cells by conventional RT-PCR and by patient-specific RQ-PCR. RESULTS: Within the CD34(+) cell fraction, we identified a discrete population expressing high levels of the IL3 receptor alpha-chain (CD123) and MIC-2 (CD99) in combination with the IL2 receptor alpha-chain (CD25). The presence of this population positively correlated with the internal tandem duplications (ITD) mutation in the FLT3 gene (r = 0.71). Receiver operating characteristics showed that, within the CD34(+) cell fraction a percentage of CD123/CD99/CD25(+) cells >/=11.7% predicted FLT3-ITD mutations with a specificity and sensitivity of >90%. CD34/CD123/CD99/CD25(+) clones were also detectable at presentation in 3 patients with FLT3 wild-type/NPM1(+) AML who relapsed with FLT3-ITD/NPM1(+) AML. Quantitative real-time PCR designed at relapse for each FLT3-ITD in these three cases confirmed the presence of low copy numbers of the mutation in diagnostic samples.

In 2008, liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) inhalation was shown to prevent IPA in a placebo-controlled trial. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are the subset of haematology patients at high risk for IPA. In 2008, L-AmB inhalation prophylaxis became the standard of care for all AML patients in Erasmus MC. In this study, the efficacy and cost effectiveness of L-AmB inhalation were evaluated in a prospective cohort of AML patients. In total, 127 consecutive AML patients received chemotherapy and prophylactically inhaled L-AmB during their first and second chemotherapy cycles; 108 patients treated for AML at the same sites from 2005-2008 served as controls. A standardised diagnostic protocol was used and probable/proven IPA served as the primary endpoint. Diagnostic and therapeutic costs were also comprehensively analysed and compared. A significant decrease in probable/proven IPA in the L-AmB inhalation group was observed (L-AmB 9.5% vs. controls 23.4%; P=0.0064). Systemic antifungal therapy given at any time during the entire AML therapy decreased from 52.8% to 29.9%. Per-patient equipment and drug costs for L-AmB inhalation (1292 euro/patient) were more than compensated for by a decrease in costs for diagnostics and therapeutic voriconazole use (-1816 euro/patient). No serious adverse events related to L-AmB inhalation were observed. In an unselected AML patient group, L-AmB inhalation resulted in a significant and substantial decrease in IPA and was cost saving. Now that azole resistance is more frequent, non-azole-based prophylaxis may become an attractive strategy.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.', 'All rights reserved.']","['Chong, Ga-Lai M', 'Broekman, Fleur', 'Polinder, Suzanne', 'Doorduijn, Jeanette K', 'Lugtenburg, Pieternella J', 'Verbon, Annelies', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Rijnders, Bart J A']","['Chong GL', 'Broekman F', 'Polinder S', 'Doorduijn JK', 'Lugtenburg PJ', 'Verbon A', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Rijnders BJ']","['Department of Haematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, PB 2040, 3000CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Center, PB 2040, 3000CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Center, PB 2040, 3000CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, PB 2040, 3000CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, PB 2040, 3000CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, PB 2040, 3000CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Center, PB 2040, 3000CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, PB 2040, 3000CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Center, PB 2040, 3000CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

The MYC oncogene is commonly overexpressed in AML but has remained an elusive target. We aimed to examine the consequences of targeting MYC both directly and indirectly in AML overexpressing MYC/Myc due to trisomy 8/15 (human/mouse), FLT3-ITD mutation, or gene amplification. METHODS: We performed in vivo knockdown of Myc (shRNAs) and both in vitro and in vivo experiments using four drugs with indirect anti-MYC activity: VX-680, GDC-0941, artemisinin, and JQ1. RESULTS: shRNA knockdown of Myc in mice prolonged survival, regardless of the mechanism underlying MYC overexpression. VX-680, an aurora kinase inhibitor, demonstrated in vitro efficacy against human MYC-overexpressing AMLs regardless of the mechanism of MYC overexpression, but was weakest against a MYC-amplified cell line. GDC-0941, a PI3-kinase inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy against several MYC-overexpressing AMLs, although only in vitro. Artemisinin, an antimalarial, did not demonstrate consistent efficacy against any of the human AMLs tested. JQ1, a bromodomain and extra-terminal bromodomain inhibitor, demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo efficacy against several MYC-overexpressing AMLs. We also confirmed a decrease in MYC levels at growth inhibitory doses for JQ1, and importantly, sensitivity of AML cell lines to JQ1 appeared independent of the mechanism of MYC overexpression.

In this report, we investigated the effect of arsantin, a sesquiterpene lactone compound present in Artemisia santolina, on cellular differentiation in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell culture system. Arsantin significantly induced HL-60 cell differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. Cytofluorometric analysis indicated that arsantin induced HL-60 cell differentiation predominantly into granulocytes. Both PKC and MAPK inhibitors suppressed the HL-60 cell differentiation induced by arsantin. Moreover, treatment with arsantin increased protein levels of PKCalpha and PKCbetaII isoforms, and also induced increased protein levels and phosphorylation form of MAPKs in HL-60 cells. Importantly, arsantin synergistically enhanced differentiation of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner when combined with either low doses of 1,25-(OH)2D3 or ATRA.

The discovery of TET-mediated demethylation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and technological advancements in next-generation sequencing have permitted the examination of other cytosine modifications, namely 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), in these myeloid malignancies on a genome-wide scale. Due to the prominence of mutations in epigenetic modifiers that can influence cytosine modifications in these disorders, including IDH1/2, TET2, and DNMT3A, many recent studies have evaluated the relative levels, distribution, and functional consequences of cytosine modifications in leukemic cells. Furthermore, several therapies are being used to treat AML and MDS that target various proteins within the cytosine modification pathway in an effort to revert the abnormal epigenetic patterns that contribute to the diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of cytosine modifications and selected technologies currently used to distinguish and analyze these epigenetic marks in the genome. Then, we discuss the role of mutant enzymes, including DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2, and the transcription factor, WT1, in disrupting normal patterns of 5mC and 5hmC in AML and MDS.

These mutations inactivate wild-type enzymatic activity and convey neomorphic function to produce d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG), which accumulates at millimolar levels within tumors. d-2HG can impact alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase activity and subsequently affect various cellular functions in these cancers. Inhibitors of the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 are currently in Phase I/II clinical trials for both solid and blood tumors. As IDH1 and IDH2 represent key enzymes within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, mutations have significant impact on intermediary metabolism. The loss of some wild-type metabolic activity is an important, potentially deleterious and therapeutically exploitable consequence of oncogenic IDH mutations and requires continued investigation in the future.

Hence, the Second International MPE Meeting was held in Boston in December 2014, with aims to: (1) develop conceptual and practical frameworks; (2) cultivate and expand opportunities; (3) address challenges; and (4) initiate the effort of specifying guidelines for MPE. The meeting mainly consisted of presentations of method developments and recent data in various malignant neoplasms and tumors (breast, prostate, ovarian and colorectal cancers, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and leukemia), followed by open discussion sessions on challenges and future plans. In particular, we recognized need for efforts to further develop statistical methodologies. This meeting provided an unprecedented opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration, consistent with the purposes of the Big Data to Knowledge, Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology, and Precision Medicine Initiative of the US National Institute of Health. The MPE meeting series can help advance transdisciplinary population science and optimize training and education systems for twenty-first century medicine and public health.",,"['Ogino, Shuji', 'Campbell, Peter T', 'Nishihara, Reiko', 'Phipps, Amanda I', 'Beck, Andrew H', 'Sherman, Mark E', 'Chan, Andrew T', 'Troester, Melissa A', 'Bass, Adam J', 'Fitzgerald, Kathryn C', 'Irizarry, Rafael A', 'Kelsey, Karl T', 'Nan, Hongmei', 'Peters, Ulrike', 'Poole, Elizabeth M', 'Qian, Zhi Rong', 'Tamimi, Rulla M', 'Tchetgen Tchetgen, Eric J', 'Tworoger, Shelley S', 'Zhang, Xuehong', 'Giovannucci, Edward L', 'van den Brandt, Piet A', 'Rosner, Bernard A', 'Wang, Molin', 'Chatterjee, Nilanjan', 'Begg, Colin B']","['Ogino S', 'Campbell PT', 'Nishihara R', 'Phipps AI', 'Beck AH', 'Sherman ME', 'Chan AT', 'Troester MA', 'Bass AJ', 'Fitzgerald KC', 'Irizarry RA', 'Kelsey KT', 'Nan H', 'Peters U', 'Poole EM', 'Qian ZR', 'Tamimi RM', 'Tchetgen Tchetgen EJ', 'Tworoger SS', 'Zhang X', 'Giovannucci EL', 'van den Brandt PA', 'Rosner BA', 'Wang M', 'Chatterjee N', 'Begg CB']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 450 Brookline Ave., Room M422, Boston, MA, 02215, USA, shuji_ogino@dfci.harvard.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Congress', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150509,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Animals', '*Genomics', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology/genetics']",,,2015/05/10 06:00,2016/04/05 06:00,['2015/05/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-015-0596-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2015 Jul;26(7):959-72. doi: 10.1007/s10552-015-0596-2.

METHODS: The ESTELLE study included 747 cases of CL [636 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 100 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)] diagnosed in France in 2010-2011 and 1,421 population controls frequency-matched with the cases on age and gender. Data were obtained from structured telephone questionnaires administered to the mothers. The odds ratios (OR) and their 95 % confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: AML, but not ALL, was non-significantly associated with alcohol drinking during pregnancy [OR = 1.3 (0.8-2.0)] with a significant positive dose-response trend (p-trend = 0.02). Pre-conception paternal smoking was significantly associated with ALL [OR = 1.2 (1.1-1.5)] and AML [OR = 1.5 (1.0-2.3)]. CL was not associated with maternal smoking [OR = 1.0 (0.8-1.2)], or maternal coffee [OR = 0.9 (0.8-1.1)] or tea drinking [OR = 0.9 (0.8-1.1)] during pregnancy. However, a high consumption of coffee (>2 cups/day) was significantly associated with ALL [OR = 1.3 (1.0-1.8)]. CONCLUSIONS: The findings constitute additional evidence that maternal alcohol drinking during pregnancy may be involved in AML, and that paternal smoking before pregnancy may be a risk factor for CL. The role of maternal coffee drinking in CL remains unclear and should be investigated further in consortium analyses and in large birth cohort studies with exposure assessment more contemporaneous with the exposure, before the occurrence of the disease.",,"['Orsi, L', 'Rudant, J', 'Ajrouche, R', 'Leverger, G', 'Baruchel, A', 'Nelken, B', 'Pasquet, M', 'Michel, G', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Ducassou, S', 'Gandemer, V', 'Lutz, P', 'Saumet, L', 'Moreau, P', 'Hemon, D', 'Clavel, J']","['Orsi L', 'Rudant J', 'Ajrouche R', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A', 'Nelken B', 'Pasquet M', 'Michel G', 'Bertrand Y', 'Ducassou S', 'Gandemer V', 'Lutz P', 'Saumet L', 'Moreau P', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['INSERM U1153 Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Team (EPICEA), Villejuif, France, laurent.orsi@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150509,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['0 (Coffee)', '0 (Tea)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coffee', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*epidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tea', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects']",,,2015/05/10 06:00,2016/04/05 06:00,['2015/05/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-015-0593-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2015 Jul;26(7):1003-17. doi: 10.1007/s10552-015-0593-5.

In non-neuronal cells, PML is a principal component of characteristic nuclear bodies. In the brain, PML has been implicated in the control of embryonic neurogenesis, and in certain physiological and pathological phenomena in the adult brain. Yet, the cellular and subcellular localization of the PML protein in the brain, including its presence in the nuclear bodies, has not been investigated comprehensively. Because the formation of PML bodies appears to be a key aspect in the function of the PML protein, we investigated the presence of these structures and their anatomical distribution, throughout the adult mouse brain. We found that PML is broadly expressed across the gray matter, with the highest levels in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. In the cerebral cortex PML is present exclusively in neurons, in which it forms well-defined nuclear inclusions containing SUMO-1, SUMO 2/3, but not Daxx. At the ultrastructural level, the appearance of neuronal PML bodies differs from the classic one, i.e., the solitary structure with more or less distinctive capsule. Rather, neuronal PML bodies have the form of small PML protein aggregates located in the close vicinity of chromatin threads. The number, size, and signal intensity of neuronal PML bodies are dynamically influenced by immobilization stress and seizures.

New genes defects causing immunodeficiency include phophoglucomutase 3 (PGM3), cytidine 5' triphosphate synthase 1 (CTPS1), nuclear factor kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 10 (BCL10), phosphoinositide-3 kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), IL21, and Jagunal homolog 1 (JAGN1). New case reports expanded the clinical spectrum of gene defects. For example, a specific recombination-activating gene 1 variant protein with partial recombinant activity might produce Omenn syndrome or a common variable immunodeficiency phenotype. Central and peripheral B-cell tolerance was investigated in patients with several primary immunodeficiencies, including common variable immunodeficiency and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, to explain the occurrence of autoimmunity and inflammatory disorders. The role of IL-12 and IL-15 in the enhancement of natural killer cell activity was reported. Newborn screening for T-cell deficiency is being implemented in more states and is achieving its goal of defining the true incidence of severe combined immunodeficiency and providing early treatment that offers the highest survival for these patients. Definitive treatment of severe immunodeficiency with both hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy was reported to be successful, with increasing definition of conditions needed for optimal outcomes.

In order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying bladder cancer, differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) and their target genes in bladder cancer were analyzed. In the present study, miRNA and mRNA expression profiles (GSE40355) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. These consisted of healthy bladder samples (n=8) and urothelial carcinoma samples (low-grade, n=8 and high-grade, n=8). DE-miRNAs and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package and the Benjamin and Hochberg method from the multtest package in R. Target genes of DE-miRNAs were screened. Associations between DEGs were investigated using STRING, and an interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for DEGs from the interaction network. 87 DE-miRNAs and 2058 DEGs were screened from low-grade bladder cancer samples, and 40 DE-miRNAs and 2477 DEGs were screened from high-grade bladder cancer samples. DE-target genes were significantly associated with the regulation of cell apoptosis. Bladder cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer biological pathways were found to be enriched. The results of the present study demonstrated that E2F transcription factor 1, which is targeted by miR-106b, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog-2, which are targeted by miR-125b, participate in the bladder cancer pathway.

To address this gap, we analyzed data from a Canadian population-based case-control study conducted in 1994-1997. Cases were 1064 adults with incident leukemia and controls were 5039 healthy adults. We used data from satellites and fixed-site monitoring stations to estimate residential concentrations of NO2 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for the period prior to diagnosis, starting in 1975 and ending in 1994. We modeled the average annual exposure of each subject. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, province, smoking, education, body mass index, income, and self-reported exposures to ionizing radiation and benzene. We found an 'n-shaped' response function between exposure to NO2 and all forms of leukemia: from the tenth percentile to the median (4.51 to 14.66 ppb), the OR was 1.20; 95% CI: 0.97-1.48 and from the 75th percentile to the 90th (22.75 to 29.7 ppb), the OR was 0.79; 95% CI 0.68-0.93. For PM2.5 we found a response function consistent with a linear model, with an OR per 10 mug/m(3) of 0.97 (95% CI 0.75-1.26). For chronic lymphocytic leukemia we found response functions that were consistent with a simple linear model, with an OR per 5 ppb of NO2 of 0.93 (95% CI 0.86-1.00) and an OR per 10 mug/m(3) of PM2.5 of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42-0.93). In summary, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia we found no evidence of an association with air pollution and with all forms of leukemia we found weak evidence of an association only at low concentrations of NO2. It is possible that these inconsistent results may have arisen because of unaccounted urban/rural differences or possibly from a selection effect, especially among controls.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

High LEF1 expression has been reported as a prognostic marker in several types of hematologic malignancies of adult patients. METHODS: In this study, LEF1 expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 122 children with newly diagnosed ALL treated on the China NPCAC97 protocols. Patients' samples were dichotomized at the median value of control group and divided into LEF1(low) and LEF1(high) groups. RESULTS: The LEF1 mRNA levels in patients with ALL were significantly higher than those of normal controls, and the LEF1 levels were dramatically decreased following induction therapy. In addition, LEF1(high) patients had lower white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis and lower minimal residual disease (MRD) levels at the time of complete remission as compared to LEF1(low) patients. Finally, our studies showed that high LEF1 expression is associated with favorable CR rate and overall survival (OS) in childhood ALL (5-year OS: LEF1(high) 92% vs. LEF1(low) 73%, P = 0.009). High LEF1 level was associated with a favorable relapse-free survival in standard-risk patients and also related to a better OS within the subgroup of patients with BCR-ABL-negative ALL. CONCLUSION: Overexpression of LEF1 is a favorable prognostic factor in childhood ALL.

Our case highlights a strategy for implant preservation in a patient with a history of recurrent cochlear implant infection. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented in 2005 with bilateral COM and sensorineural hearing loss meeting CI candidacy. Four months after left mastoid obliteration with abdominal fat graft and external auditory canal closure, a left CI was placed. Subsequent postauricular cellulitis resolved with oral antibiotics. A similar two-stage CI was performed on the right without complication. During the following year, numerous left-sided infections and fluid collections developed but were treated unsuccessfully with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and operative debridement. With concern for biofilm colonization, the implant was explanted and the electrode left in the cochlea. After reimplantation in 2010, infections resumed despite long-term IV antibiotics and incision and drainage. Intervention and technique In 2012, the left mastoid cavity was exteriorized and converted to standard canal wall-down anatomy. Bone pate was placed over the electrode, followed by cadaveric acellular dermis and a split-thickness skin graft. After more than 2 years, her better-performing CI remains infection-free. CONCLUSION: After 6 years of postoperative infections unresponsive to aggressive medical management, surgical interventions, and period of device removal, our patient's infections resolved after mastoid exteriorization and multilayered protection of the electrode.

This study explored novel functions of CD82 that contribute to AML progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed microarray analysis comparing the gene expression profiles between CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells transduced with CD82 shRNA and CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells transduced with control shRNA. Real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis were performed to examine the effect of CD82 knockdown on the expression of the polycomb group member, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), in leukemia cells. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to examine the effect of CD82 expression on the amount of EZH2 bound to the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes in leukemia cells. We also utilized methylation-specific PCR to examine whether CD82 expression influences the methylation status of the tumor suppressor gene promoter regions in leukemia cells. RESULTS: Microarray analysis revealed that levels of EZH2 decreased after shRNA-mediated depletion of CD82 in CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells. Moreover, the antibody-mediated blockade of CD82 in leukemia cells lowered EZH2 expression via activation of p38 MAPK signaling, decreased the amount of EZH2 bound to the promoter regions of the tumor suppressor genes, and inhibited histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation in these promoter regions, resulting in upregulation of the tumor suppressors at both the mRNA and protein levels.",,"['Nishioka, Chie', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Yang, Jing', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Nishioka C', 'Ikezoe T', 'Yang J', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of hematology and Respiratory Medicine immunology, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan.', 'Department of hematology and Respiratory Medicine immunology, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan.', 'Department of immunology, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan.', 'Department of hematology and Respiratory Medicine immunology, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150508,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD82 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Kangai-1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kangai-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Lysine/metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2015/05/09 06:00,2016/02/02 06:00,['2015/05/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0125017 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-44660 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 8;10(5):e0125017. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0125017. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4425466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood samples (50 ml) were obtained from three healthy volunteers and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from each via Ficoll-Conray density gradient centrifugation. Each suspension of PBMCs (1 x 10(6)/ml) was divided into two parts; CAPRI cells were obtained from one part through a series of induction, amplification and cytokine cultures, while CIK cells were obtained from the other part through induction with different cytokines. During the culture process, the proliferation and morphological changes were observed for the two cell types using Trypan blue staining. At day 14, the cytotoxic activity of the two cell types was examined through determining lactate dehydrogenase release in the presence of K562 leukemia cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In addition, secretory levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-2 were detected using enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) technology. The results revealed that at day 5 and 14 of culture, there were significantly fewer CAPRI cells compared with CIK cells (P<0.001), although the survival rate of each cell type was >95%. The cytotoxic activity of CAPRI cells towards the K562 cell line was effector-target ratio-dependent (40:1 and 20:1) with values of 55.1 +/- 3.25 and 35.0 +/- 2.65%, respectively, which were significantly reduced compared with the corresponding data in CIK cells, 60.0 +/- 3.03 and 39.7 +/- 3.42% (P=0.004 and 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, the cytotoxic activity of CAPRI cells towards MCF-7 cells were 71.5 +/- 3.06, 56.0 +/- 3.76 and 40.2 +/- 2.90% at effector-target ratios 40:1, 20:1 and 10:1, respectively. These data were significantly higher than the corresponding values in CIK cells, 65.4 +/- 3.86, 49.5 +/- 3.91 and 36.1 +/- 3.73% (P=0.002, 0.003 and 0.02, respectively). As determined using ELISPOT technology at different cell concentrations (1 x 10(6)/ml and 5 x 10(5)/ml), IFN-gamma secretion levels, determined by the number of spot-forming cells, of CAPRI cells were 126.2 +/- 10.31 and 48.8 +/- 10.99, respectively, which were significantly reduced compared with those of CIK cells, 409.3 +/- 7.76 and 159.3 +/- 15.45, respectively (P<0.001). IL-2 secretion levels in CAPRI cells were 325.1 +/- 16.24 and 113.8 +/- 11.29 at 1 x 10(6)/ml and 5 x 10(5)/ml, respectively, which were significantly increased compared with CIK cells, 212.0 +/- 16.58 and 70.7 +/- 10.57, respectively (P<0.001). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that CAPRI cells had a reduced proliferation rate compared with CIK cells as well as a less potent cytotoxic effect on K562 cells; however, the two cell types had potent cytotoxic activity towards solid tumor MCF-7 cells. In addition, CAPRI cells secreted lower levels of IFN-gamma and increased levels of IL-2 compared with CIK cells. These results indicated that antitumor activities of CAPRI and CIK cells proceeded via different mechanisms.",,"['Li, Gui-Xin', 'Zhao, Shu-Shu', 'Zhang, Xu-Guang', 'Wang, Wen-Hao', 'Liu, Jin', 'Xue, Ke-Wei', 'Li, Xiao-Yan', 'Guo, Ying-Xue', 'Wang, Li-Hua']","['Li GX', 'Zhao SS', 'Zhang XG', 'Wang WH', 'Liu J', 'Xue KW', 'Li XY', 'Guo YX', 'Wang LH']","['Department of Oncology, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong 261031, P.R.

Examinations of correlations between birth characteristics and leukemia risk markers have been limited to birth weight-related genetic polymorphisms. We integrated information on nongenetic and genetic markers by evaluating the relationship of birth characteristics, genetic markers for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility, and ALL risk together. The multiethnic study consisted of cases with childhood ALL (n=161) and healthy controls (n=261). Birth characteristic data were collected through questionnaires, and genotyping was achieved by TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. We observed risk associations for birth weight over 4000 g (odds ratios [OR]=1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-3.19), birth length (OR=1.18 per inch; 95% CI, 1.01-1.38), and with gestational age (OR=1.10 per week; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21). Only the HFE tag single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9366637 showed an inverse correlation with a birth characteristic, gestational age, with a gene-dosage effect (P=0.005), and in interaction with a transferrin receptor rs3817672 genotype (Pinteraction=0.05). This correlation translated into a strong association for rs9366637 with preterm birth (OR=5.0; 95% CI, 1.19-20.9). Our study provides evidence for the involvement of prenatal events in the development of childhood ALL. The inverse correlation of rs9366637 with gestational age has implications on the design of HFE association studies in birth weight and childhood conditions using full-term newborns as controls.",,"['Kennedy, Amy E', 'Kamdar, Kala Y', 'Lupo, Philip J', 'Okcu, Mehmet F', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Dorak, Mehmet T']","['Kennedy AE', 'Kamdar KY', 'Lupo PJ', 'Okcu MF', 'Scheurer ME', 'Dorak MT']","['*Department of Epidemiology, Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work, Florida International University, Miami, FL daggerDepartment of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (HFE protein, human)', '0 (Hemochromatosis Protein)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Birth Weight', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Gestational Age', 'Hemochromatosis Protein', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors']",,,2015/05/09 06:00,2015/08/27 06:00,['2015/05/09 06:00'],"['2015/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000347 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2015 Jul;37(5):e301-7. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000347.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the acquisition of drug resistance is a significant obstacle to the achievement of favourable outcomes, and autophagy is regarded as a mechanism that underlies chemoresistance. In this study, RT-qPCR was used to measure the expression of HMGB1 and Beclin1 in bone marrow mononuclear cells. A CCK-8 test was conducted to assess cell viability. Western blot, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopic analyses were performed to evaluate the autophagy levels. Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed to detect protein-protein interactions in the autophagy complexes. We found that HMGB1 expression correlated with the clinical status of ALL. In vitro, anticancer agent-induced cytotoxic effects were associated with autophagy-related drug resistance, and these effects were ameliorated by FIP200 depletion or the application of autophagy inhibitors. Moreover, the Ulk1Atg13-FIP200 complex, which promotes HMGB1 trafficking, acted upstream of the HMGB1-Beclin1 and PI3KC3-Beclin1 complexes and played a critical role in autophagy. Targeting the transformation of autophagic complexes or HMGB1 translocation may suppress autophagy and consequently overcome chemoresistance in leukaemia.",,"['Kong, Qian', 'Xu, Lu-Hong', 'Xu, Wei', 'Fang, Jian-Pei', 'Xu, Hong-Gui']","['Kong Q', 'Xu LH', 'Xu W', 'Fang JP', 'Xu HG']","['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumour Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, P.R.

Delphinidin exhibited a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect against NB4 cells. Almost no cell cycle arrest, but an apparent increase in the percentage of sub-G1 cells was observed in delphinidin-treated cells. The activation of caspase-8 and -9 was observed as early as 1-h post-exposure to delphinidin, followed by the activation of caspase-3 from 3-h post-exposure. A substantial decrease in the expression level of Bid was also observed as early as 1-h post-exposure. A modest decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) was observed at 3-h post-exposure, followed by a substantial time-dependent decrease in DeltaPsim in treated cells. Delphinidin exerted more potent cytotoxicity against NB4 cells than normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs). In addition, delphinidin in combination with an arsenic derivative arsenite (As(III)), which has demonstrated marked efficacy in patients with APL, achieved an enhanced cytocidal effect against NB4 cells, but lesser on PBMNCs. Treatment of NB4 cells with As(III) plus delphinidin did not increase, but decreased slightly, intracellular arsenic accumulation (As[i]) as compared to that treated with As(III) alone. These results suggested that delphinidin selectively sensitized NB4 cells to As(III), resulting in the enhancement of As(III) cytotoxicity by strengthening intrinsic/extrinsic pathway-mediated apoptosis induction, rather than affecting the As[i] levels. These observations may offer a rationale for the use of delphinidin to improve the clinical efficacy of As(III).",,"['Yuan, Bo', 'Okusumi, Saki', 'Yoshino, Yuta', 'Moriyama, Chihiro', 'Tanaka, Sachiko', 'Hirano, Toshihiko', 'Takagi, Norio', 'Toyoda, Hiroo']","['Yuan B', 'Okusumi S', 'Yoshino Y', 'Moriyama C', 'Tanaka S', 'Hirano T', 'Takagi N', 'Toyoda H']","['Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150508,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Anthocyanins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenites)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EM6MD4AEHE (delphinidin)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",IM,"['Anthocyanins/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects']",,,2015/05/09 06:00,2016/03/30 06:00,['2015/05/09 06:00'],"['2015/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2015.3963 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2015 Jul;34(1):431-8. doi: 10.3892/or.2015.3963.

There is a lack of definitive information regarding hospital-based cancer profile in Southern Punjab, which is a cotton growing area. Excess of toxins in the macro-environment is thought to be the reason for the high incidence of cancer in this area. AIMS: To generate data on the magnitude and pattern of cancer cases reporting in the medical college hospital and to plan activities for prevention of cancer in the field practice area. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A five year record-based retrospective study from 1(st)January 2007 to 31(st)December 2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cancer cases who reported either for diagnosis or for treatment (radiotherapy/chemotherapy/surgery) were included in the study. These confirmed cases of cancer were classified according to the International classification of Disease (ICD-10) given by WHO. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics, percentages. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1328 cancer cases, females accounted for 809 (60.9%) and males for 519 (39.1%) cases. Male to female ratio was 1:1.55. The maximum number of patients were seen in 35-64 yr age group (63.5%).

In haematology, the risk of reactivation of B hepatitis among HBsAg-positive patients has been documented; therefore, use of lamivudine prophylaxis is recommended before starting chemotherapy. Differently, for HBsAg-negative patients with markers of previous HBV infection (i.e., presence of isolated anti-HBc positivity) (anticore patients) management strategies are not univocal. We describe a rare case of HBV reactivation in an anticore patient after fludarabine therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The patient fully recovered after a 6-month course of lamivudine with persistent HBV-DNA clearance and loss of HBsAg. The most important feature of this case is that fludarabine alone infrequently determines HBV reactivation, especially in anticore patients. Therefore, we suggest that patients candidates to receive fludarabine therapy should be considered for lamivudine prophylaxis, not only if HBsAg-positive, but even if anticore-positive only.",,"['Toscanini, Federica', 'De Leo, Pasqualina', 'Calcagno, Giuseppe', 'Malfatti, Federica', 'Grasso, Alessandro', 'Anselmo, Marco']","['Toscanini F', 'De Leo P', 'Calcagno G', 'Malfatti F', 'Grasso A', 'Anselmo M']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, Via Genova 20, 17100 Savona, Italy.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, Via Genova 20, 17100 Savona, Italy.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, Via Genova 20, 17100 Savona, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology, San Paolo Hospital, 17100 Savona, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology, San Paolo Hospital, 17100 Savona, Italy.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, San Paolo Hospital, Via Genova 20, 17100 Savona, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110615,United States,Case Reports Hepatol,Case reports in hepatology,101622103,,,,,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2015/05/09 06:00'],"['2011/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/258791 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Reports Hepatol. 2011;2011:258791. doi: 10.1155/2011/258791.

It also acts as a modulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a cell development regulating process that affects tumor development and metastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of miR-429 in regulating growth and metastasis of renal cell carcinoma. METHODS: miR-429 expression was stably up-regulated or down-regulated in the renal cell carcinoma ACHN and A498 cell lines, and cell proliferation and metastasis were assessed. RESULTS: miR-429 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion. Suppression of endogenous miR-429 promoted cell growth and metastasis. miR-429 was shown to directly target the 3' untranslated regions of B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1) and E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3) transcripts, regulating their expression, as well as that of the downstream epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, p14, and p16.

Despite the introduction of novel therapeutic agents, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, the prognosis of patients with MM is still worse than that of most hematological malignancies. A better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the disease is essential to achieve any improvement of treatment outcome of MM patients. All MM cases pass through the phase of asymptomatic expansion of clonal plasma cells, referred to as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). It has long been believed that MM evolves linearly from MGUS to terminal phases, such as extramedullary tumors and plasma cell leukemia via the accumulation of novel mutations. However, recent studies using next-generation sequencing have disclosed the complex genomic architecture of the disease. At each step of progression, the acquisition of novel mutations is accompanied by subclonal evolution from reservoir clones with branching patterns. Each subclone may carry novel mutations and distinct phenotypes, including drug sensitivity. In addition, minor clones already exist at the MGUS stage, which could expand later in the clinical course, resulting in relapse and/or leukemic conversion. The ultimate goal of treatment is to eradicate all clones, including subclonal populations with distinct biological characteristics.

However, a role for epigenetics in physical DNA changes, such as chromosome rearrangements, is less obvious, and certainly less well understood.

Previous studies have showed that some galectin family members play a role in various types of leukemia. The present study aims at evaluating and clarifying the diagnostic and prognostic value of the expression of cancer-related galectins in relation to the clinicopathological characters of AML patients. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect expression profile of eight galectin family members (galectin-1, -2, -3, -4, -8, -9, -12, and -13) in 53 newly diagnosed de novo AML patients.

Our results show that patients with lower LGALS12 gene expression have a lower overall survival than those with higher expression (P value <0.026). Moreover, a statistically significant association between the LGALS4 gene expression and patient age is found. Hence, the higher expression of LGALS4 gene is associated with younger age (adjusted P value <0.001).

For cure, imatinib is a widely used tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but developing chemotherapeutic resistance has to be overcome. In this study, we aimed to determine differing genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles in imatinib resistant (K562/IMA-3 muM) and parental cells by targeting STAT5A via small interfering RNA (siRNA) applications. After determining possible therapeutic miRNAs, we aimed to check their effects upon cell viability and proliferation, apoptosis, and find a possible miRNA::mRNA interaction to discover the molecular basis of imatinib resistance. We detected that miR-2278 and miR-1245b-3p were most significantly regulated miRNAs according to miRNome array. Upregulating miR-2278 expression resulted in the inhibition of resistant leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, whereas miR-1245b-3p did not exhibit therapeutic results. Functional analyses indicated that AKT2, STAM2, and STAT5A mRNAs were functional targets for miR-2278 as mimic transfection decreased their expressions both at transcriptional and translational level, thus highlighting miR-2278 as a tumor suppressor.

As2O3 enters cells via the transmembrane protein aquaglyceroporin 9 (AQP9). Azacytidine, a demethylating agent that is approved for the treatment of AML, has been shown to have synergistic effect with As2O3. We tested the hypothesis that azacytidine might up-regulate AQP9 and enhances As2O3-mediated cytotoxicity in AML. METHODS: Arsenic-induced cytotoxicity, the expression of AQP9, and the intracellular uptake of As2O3 were determined in AML cell lines and primary AML cells with or without azacytidine pre-treatment. The mechanism of AQP9 up-regulation was then investigated by examining the expression of transcription factors for AQP9 gene and the methylation status of their gene promoters. RESULTS: As2O3-induced cytotoxicity in AML cell lines was significantly enhanced after azacytidine pre-treatment as a result of AQP9 up-regulation, leading to increased arsenic uptake and hence intracellular concentration. Blocking AQP9-mediated As2O3 uptake with mercury chloride abrogated the sensitization effect of azacytidine. AQP9 promoter does not contain CpG islands. Instead, azacytidine pre-treatment led to increased expression of HNF1A, a transcription activator of AQP9, through demethylation of HNF1A promoter. HNF1 knockdown abrogated azacytidine-induced AQP9 up-regulation and almost completely blocked intracellular As2O3 entry, confirming that azacytidine enhanced As2O3-mediated cell death via up-regulation of HNF1A and hence increased AQP9 and As2O3 intracellular concentration. Azacytidine sensitization to As2O3 treatment was re-capitulated also in primary AML samples. Finally, azacytidine did not enhance arsenic toxicity in a liver cell line, where HNF1A was largely unmethylated. CONCLUSIONS: Azacytidine sensitizes AML cells to As2O3 treatment, and our results provide proof-of-principle evidence that pharmacological up-regulation of AQP9 potentially expands the therapeutic spectrum of As2O3. Further clinical trial should evaluate the efficacy of azacytidine in combination with As2O3 in the treatment of AML.",,"['Chau, David', 'Ng, Karen', 'Chan, Thomas Sau-Yan', 'Cheng, Yuen-Yee', 'Fong, Bonnie', 'Tam, Sidney', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam', 'Tse, Eric']","['Chau D', 'Ng K', 'Chan TS', 'Cheng YY', 'Fong B', 'Tam S', 'Kwong YL', 'Tse E']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. dhwchau@gmail.com.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. karen.nmt@gmail.com.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. thomas28@netvigator.com.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. yuen_yee@yahoo.com.', 'Asbestos Diseases Research Institute, ADRI Bernie Banton Centre, University of Sydney, Concord Hospital, Sydney, Australia. yuen_yee@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pathology and Clinical Biochemistry, Queen Mary Hospital, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. fongmw@ha.org.hk.', 'Department of Pathology and Clinical Biochemistry, Queen Mary Hospital, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. sidneytam@hku.hk.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. ylkwong@hku.hk.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. ewctse@hku.hk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150508,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (AQP9 protein, human)', '0 (Aquaporins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Aquaporins/*biosynthesis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2015/05/09 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/05/09 06:00'],"['2015/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-015-0143-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-015-0143-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2015 May 8;8:46. doi: 10.1186/s13045-015-0143-3.,,PMC4431177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We collected 108 consecutive patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML). Clinical, hematological, and cytogenetic data were collected by searching the electronic medical record. TP53 sequencing was performed in all patients using a clinically validated next-generation sequencing-based gene panel assay. A previously published patient cohort consisting of 428 patients with de novo MDS/AML was included for comparison. RESULTS: We assessed 108 patients with t-MN, in which 40 patients (37%) had TP53 mutations. The mutation frequency was similar between t-MDS and t-AML; but significantly higher than de novo MDS/AML (62/428 patients, 14.5%) (p<0.0001). TP53 mutations in t-MN were mainly clustered in DNA-binding domains, with an allelic frequency of 37.0% (range, 7.1 to 98.8). Most mutations involved single nucleotide changes, of which, transitions (65.9%) were more common than transversions (34.1%). Missense mutations were the most frequent, followed by frameshift and nonsense mutations. This TP53 mutation pattern was strikingly similar to that observed in de novo MDS/AML. TP53 mutations in t-MN were associated with a complex karyotype (p<0.0001), a higher number of chromosomal abnormalities (p<0.0001), and an inferior overall survival in affected patients (6.1 vs 14.1 months) by univariate (p<0.0001) and multivariate analyses (p=0.0020). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the recent notion that heterozygous TP53 mutation may be a function of normal aging and that mutated cells are subject to selection upon exposure to cytotoxic therapy. t-MN carrying TP53 mutation have an aggressive clinical course independent of other confounding factors.",,"['Ok, Chi Young', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Routbort, Mark J', 'Peng, Jie', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Goswami, Maitrayee', 'Young, Ken H', 'Singh, Rajesh', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Ok CY', 'Patel KP', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Routbort MJ', 'Peng J', 'Tang G', 'Goswami M', 'Young KH', 'Singh R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Luthra R', 'Wang SA']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, USA. cok@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, USA. kppatel@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, USA. ggarciam@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, USA. mark.routbort@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, USA.

In this study, we compared the functionality of reconstituting NK cells, based on CD107alpha expression and interferon-gammasecretion, in a cohort of 29 patients that expressed (n = 8) or lacked (n = 21) class I human leukocyte antigens for donor inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) following T-cell-replete haplo-SCT. We also addressed whether recipient expression of class I ligands for donor inhibitory KIRs could predict relapse occurrence in another cohort of 188 patients. A longitudinal analysis indicated that patients presenting class I for all donor inhibitory KIRs showed more capable functional NK effector cells when tested against class I negative K562 cells and primary leukemic cells within 3 months of transplantation. The lowest 7-year relapse incidence was observed when donor KIRs were ligated by recipient class I (n = 60) compared with donor-host partnerships where donor KIR(+) cells were ligated by donor, but not recipient class I (n = 86, p = 0.026) or KIRs that were ligated by neither donor nor recipient class I (n = 42, p = 0.043). This study suggests that haplo-SCT recipients presenting class I for donor inhibitory KIRs promote NK-cell licensing, leading to decreased relapse rates.","['(c) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Mutations causing NS alter genes encoding proteins involved in the RAS-MAPK pathway. We and others identified Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene (CBL), which encodes an E3-ubiquitin ligase acting as a tumor suppressor in myeloid malignancies, as a disease gene underlying a condition clinically related to NS. Here, we further explored the spectrum of germline CBL mutations and their associated phenotype. CBL mutation scanning performed on 349 affected subjects with features overlapping NS and no mutation in NS genes allowed the identification of five different variants with pathological significance. Among them, two splice-site changes, one in-frame deletion, and one missense mutation affected the RING domain and/or the adjacent linker region, overlapping cancer-associated defects. A novel nonsense mutation generating a v-Cbl-like protein able to enhance signal flow through RAS was also identified. Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis performed on available records indicated that germline CBL mutations cause a variable phenotype characterized by a relatively high frequency of neurological features, predisposition to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and low prevalence of cardiac defects, reduced growth, and cryptorchidism.

However, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which loss of IKAROS activity may co-operate with BCR-ABL1 to transform lymphoid cells. To investigate this question, we used expression of a dominant-negative isoform of IKAROS (IK6) to suppress endogenous IKAROS activity in the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent mouse pro-B BA/F3 cell line and in an IL-3-independent BCR-ABL1(+) derivative. We then used intracellular phospho-flow cytometry to assess the effects of BCR-ABL1 and IK6, alone and in combination, on the signaling state of the cells before and after their stimulation with IL-3. BCR-ABL1 and IK6 each produced a constitutively activated signaling phenotype and also enhanced the signaling responses of BA/F3 cells to IL-3. These effects, however, were neither equivalent nor additive, and IK6 alone was insufficient to confer the IL-3-independent growth characteristic of BCR-ABL1(+) BA/F3 cells. In addition to its effects on lymphoid cells, IK6 also induced constitutively activated signaling in a subset of myeloid leukemia cell lines. Together, these studies indicate an ability of IK6 to enhance intracellular signaling in both lymphoid and myeloid cells, but not to synergize with BCR-ABL1 in this model system.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2015.

These discoveries have been rapidly incorporated into evolving molecular diagnostic algorithms. Whilst many of these mutations appear to have prognostic implications, establishing MPN diagnosis is of immediate clinical importance with selection, implementation and the continual evaluation of the appropriate laboratory methodology to achieve this diagnosis similarly vital. The advantages and limitations of these approaches in identifying and quantitating the common MPN-associated mutations are considered herein with particular regard to their clinical utility. The evolution of molecular diagnostic applications and platforms has occurred in parallel with the discovery of MPN-associated mutations, and it therefore appears likely that emerging technologies such as next-generation sequencing and digital PCR will in the future play an increasing role in the molecular diagnosis of MPN.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Aiming at designing structurally-simple inhibitors of MT assembly, we synthesized a series of thirty-one 3,4,5-trimethoxy-hydrazones and twenty-five derivatives or analogs. Docking simulations suggested that a representative N-acylhydrazone could adopt an appropriate stereochemistry inside the colchicine-binding domain of tubulin. Several of these compounds showed anti-leukemia effects in the nanomolar concentration range. Interference with MT polymerization was validated by the compounds' ability to inhibit MT assembly at the biochemical and cellular level.

Early events in diencephalic regionalization include its subdivision along the dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes. The prosomeric model by Puelles and Rubenstein (1993) suggests that the alar plate of the posterior diencephalon is partitioned into three different prosomeres (designated p1-p3), which develop into the pretectum, thalamus, and prethalamus, respectively. Here, we report the developmental consequences of genetic ablation of cell populations from the diencephalic basal plate. The strategy for conditionally regulated cell ablation is based on the targeted expression of the diphtheria toxin gene (DTA) to the diencephalic basal plate via tamoxifen- induced, Cre-mediated recombination of the ROSA(DTA) allele. We show that activation of DTA leads to specific cell loss in the basal plate of the posterior diencephalon, and disrupted early regionalization of distinct alar territories. In the basal plate-deficient embryos, the p1 alar plate exhibited reduced expression of subtype-specific markers in the pretectum, whereas p2 alar plate failed to further subdivide into two discrete thalamic subpopulations. We also show that these defects lead to abnormal nuclear organization at later developmental stages. Our data have implications for increased understanding of the interactive roles between discrete diencephalic compartments.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Lee, Bumwhee', 'Lam, Duc Tri', 'Baek, Kwanghee', 'Yoon, Jaeseung', 'Jeong, Yongsu']","['Lee B', 'Lam DT', 'Baek K', 'Yoon J', 'Jeong Y']","['Department of Genetic Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin-Si, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin-Si, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin-Si, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin-Si, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, College of Life Sciences and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin-Si, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150525,United States,Genesis,"Genesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)",100931242,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Shh protein, mouse)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Diencephalon/anatomy & histology/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/embryology/*metabolism', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Organogenesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['alar plate', 'basal plate', 'diencephalon', 'forebrain', 'regionalization']",2015/05/08 06:00,2016/04/02 06:00,['2015/05/08 06:00'],"['2014/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dvg.22857 [doi]'],ppublish,Genesis. 2015 Jun;53(6):356-65. doi: 10.1002/dvg.22857.

The anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family member myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) has a pro-survival role in various cell types; however, its contribution to oocyte survival is unconfirmed. We present a phenotypic characterization of oocytes deficient in Mcl-1, and establish its role in maintenance of the primordial follicle (PMF) pool, growing oocyte survival and oocyte quality. Mcl-1 depletion resulted in the premature exhaustion of the ovarian reserve, characterized by early PMF loss because of activation of apoptosis. The increasingly diminished surviving cohort of growing oocytes displayed elevated markers of autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mcl-1-deficient ovulated oocytes demonstrated an increased susceptibility to cellular fragmentation with activation of the apoptotic cascade. Concomitant deletion of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 member Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) rescued the PMF phenotype and ovulated oocyte death, but did not prevent the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with Mcl-1 deficiency and could not rescue long-term breeding performance. We thus recognize MCL-1 as the essential survival factor required for conservation of the postnatal PMF pool, growing follicle survival and effective oocyte mitochondrial function.",,"['Omari, S', 'Waters, M', 'Naranian, T', 'Kim, K', 'Perumalsamy, A L', 'Chi, M', 'Greenblatt, E', 'Moley, K H', 'Opferman, J T', 'Jurisicova, A']","['Omari S', 'Waters M', 'Naranian T', 'Kim K', 'Perumalsamy AL', 'Chi M', 'Greenblatt E', 'Moley KH', 'Opferman JT', 'Jurisicova A']","[""1] Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, 25 Orde Street, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3H7, Canada [2] Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada."", 'Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, 25 Orde Street, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3H7, Canada.', ""1] Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, 25 Orde Street, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3H7, Canada [2] Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada."", ""1] Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, 25 Orde Street, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3H7, Canada [2] Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada."", 'Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, 25 Orde Street, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3H7, Canada.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Washington University in St. Louis, 660S Euclid Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', '1] Centre for Fertility and Reproductive Health, Mount Sinai Hospital, 250 Dundas Street, Toronto, Ontario M5T 2Z5, Canada [2] Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Toronto, 92 College Street, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1L4, Canada.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Washington University in St. Louis, 660S Euclid Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', ""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, MS 340, Room D4063D, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""1] Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, 25 Orde Street, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3H7, Canada [2] Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada [3] Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Toronto, 92 College Street, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1L4, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150507,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*physiology', 'Oocytes/physiology', 'Ovarian Reserve/*physiology']",,,2015/05/08 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/05/08 06:00'],"['2014/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201595 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.95 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 May 7;6:e1755. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2015.95.,['FRN 123518/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC4669721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

25950076,,Publisher,,,,,,2005 Nov 29,,,,"Multiple myeloma is a progressive, debilitating malignancy characterized by the proliferation and accumulation of cancerous plasma cells and the overabundance of monoclonal paraprotein. It is part of a spectrum of diseases ranging from monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) to plasma cell leukemia. Extensive skeletal destruction with osteolytic lesions, osteopenia, and/or pathologic fractures is common, as well as anemia, hypercalcemia, and kidney dysfunction. Although treatable, multiple myeloma is considered incurable and accounts for approximately 2 percent of all cancer deaths.1 Historically, intermittent oral melphalan and prednisone (MP) was standard therapy for untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma. In more recent years, newer combination chemotherapy regimens have been used both as initial first-line chemotherapy and as salvage chemotherapy, with better response rates but little effect on overall survival. Example combination chemotherapy programs include VBCMP (vincristine, carmustine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and prednisone) and VAD (vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone). There is a survival benefit when patients responding to chemotherapy such as VAD are treated with high dose chemotherapy plus single or double autologous stem cell transplantation. Nonetheless, over 80 percent of patients still relapse within 7 years. Treatment programs that include transplantation have limited applicability due to toxicity and associated age, performance status, and organ function requirements. Nearly all patients with multiple myeloma will eventually relapse and become resistant to further treatment. Median survival remains approximately 4 years. Thalidomide, a glutamic acid derivative, was used as sedative in the late 1950s until it was withdrawn from the market because it caused severe birth defects. Thalidomide's anti-angiogenic properties were appreciated in the 1990s and because bone marrow angiogenesis plays a substantial role in the development of multiple myeloma, thalidomide has been tried in multiple myeloma. Since the first publication documenting objective responses with thalidomide in patients with refractory myeloma was published in 1999, there has been a rapid proliferation of published and abstract reports on the use of thalidomide in multiple myeloma. In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved thalidomide for use in treating leprosy (Hansen's disease); it is not currently FDA-approved for multiple myeloma. Thalidomide can only be prescribed under the System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety (S.T.E.P.S.) program, patented by Celgene Corporation. The key questions for this review were developed with experts in the field of oncology, health economics, and health policy. The key questions are as follows: 1. For patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, what is the effect of thalidomide compared to standard chemotherapy regimens (e.g., VBMCP (vincristine, carmustine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone) and VAD (vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone)) on 2-year survival, disease-free survival, CR, PR (m-protein), and quality of life? 2. For patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, what is the effect of thalidomide compared to standard chemotherapy regimens (e.g., VBMCP (vincristine, carmustine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone) and VAD (vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone)) on adverse effects, tolerability, and compliance? 3.

Although malignant B cells are also subjected on TACI signaling, there is a remarkable intradisease and interindividual variability of TACI expression in B-cell malignancies. The aim of our study was to explore the possible role of TACI signaling in the biology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), including its phenotypic and clinical characteristics and prognosis. Ninety-four patients and 19 healthy controls were studied. CLL patients exhibited variable TACI expression, with the majority of cases displaying low to undetectable TACI, along with low to undetectable BAFF and increased APRIL serum levels compared to healthy controls. CLL cells with high TACI expression displayed a better survival capacity in vitro, when cultured with BAFF and/or APRIL. Moreover, TACI expression was positively correlated with the presence of monoclonal gammopathy and inversely with CD11c expression. Therefore, our study provides further evidence for the contribution of BAFF/APRIL signaling to CLL biology, suggesting also that TACI detection might be useful in the selection of patients for novel targeting therapeutic approaches.",,"['Mamara, Antigoni', 'Germenis, Anastasios E', 'Kompoti, Maria', 'Palassopoulou, Maria', 'Mandala, Eudokia', 'Banti, Anastasia', 'Giannakoulas, Nikolaos', 'Speletas, Matthaios']","['Mamara A', 'Germenis AE', 'Kompoti M', 'Palassopoulou M', 'Mandala E', 'Banti A', 'Giannakoulas N', 'Speletas M']","['Department of Immunology & Histocompatibility, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Biopolis 3, 41500 Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology & Histocompatibility, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Biopolis 3, 41500 Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology & Histocompatibility, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Biopolis 3, 41500 Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Biopolis 3, 41500 Larissa, Greece.', 'Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Ippokration Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Konstantinoupoleos 49, 54642 Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Papageorgiou General Hospital, Periferiaki Odos Thessalonikis, Nea Efkarpia, 56429 Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Biopolis 3, 41500 Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology & Histocompatibility, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Biopolis 3, 41500 Larissa, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150409,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNFRSF13B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/genetics/immunology', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/*blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/pathology', 'CD11c Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/blood', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraproteinemias/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein/biosynthesis/*blood/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/*blood']",,,2015/05/08 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/05/08 06:00'],"['2014/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/478753 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol Res. 2015;2015:478753. doi: 10.1155/2015/478753.

Using retroviral transduction, T cells can be created that express an artificial T cell receptor (TCR) termed a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). We have generated a CAR, 4H11-28z, specific to MUC-16(ecto) antigen, which is the over-expressed on a majority of ovarian tumor cells and is the retained portion of MUC-16 after cleavage of CA-125. We previously demonstrated that T cells modified to express the 4H11-28z CAR eradicate orthotopic human ovarian cancer xenografts in SCID-Beige mice. However, despite the ability of CAR T cells to localize to tumors, their activation in the clinical setting can be inhibited by the tumor microenvironment, as is commonly seen for endogenous antitumor immune response. To potentially overcome this limitation, we have recently developed a construct that co-expresses both MUC16(ecto) CAR and IL-12 (4H11-28z/IL-12). In vitro, 4H11-28z/IL-12 CAR T cells show enhanced proliferation and robust IFNgamma secretion compared to 4H11-28z CAR T cells. In SCID-Beige mice with human ovarian cancer xenografts, IL-12 secreting CAR T cells exhibit enhanced antitumor efficacy as determined by increased survival, prolonged persistence of T cells, and higher systemic IFNgamma. Furthermore, in anticipation of translating these results into a phase I clinical trial which will be the first to study IL-12 secreting CAR T cells in ovarian cancer, an elimination gene has been included to allow for deletion of CAR T cells in the context of unforeseen or off-tumor on-target toxicity.",,"['Koneru, Mythili', 'Purdon, Terence J', 'Spriggs, David', 'Koneru, Susmith', 'Brentjens, Renier J']","['Koneru M', 'Purdon TJ', 'Spriggs D', 'Koneru S', 'Brentjens RJ']","['Department of Medicine; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ; New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ; New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ; New York, NY, USA.', 'Rutgers School of Public Health ; Newark, NJ USA.', 'Department of Medicine; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ; New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150123,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AAPCs, artificial antigen presenting cells; ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular', 'cytotoxicity; ALL, acute lymphocytic leukemia; CAR, chimeric antigen receptor;', 'EGFRt, truncated epidermal growth factor; EOC, epithelial ovarian cancer; i.p.,', 'intraperitoneal; IL-12, interleukin-12; i.v., intravenous; MDSC, myeloid-derived', 'suppressor cells; PBL, peripheral blood leukocytes; PBMCs, peripheral blood', 'mononuclear cells; scFv, single-chain fragment antibody; TAA, tumor-associated', 'antigen; TCR, T cell receptor; TIL, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; Tregs,', 'regulatory T cells.', '*IL-12', '*MUC16', '*chimeric antigen receptors', '*human ovarian cancer', '*tumor microenvironment']",2015/05/08 06:00,2015/05/08 06:01,['2015/05/08 06:00'],"['2014/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4161/2162402X.2014.994446 [doi]', '994446 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2015 Jan 23;4(3):e994446. doi: 10.4161/2162402X.2014.994446. eCollection 2015 Mar.,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4404840,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the activity of these enzymes was tested in 29 CML patients and 28 healthy subjects by monitoring the kynurenine (KYN)/tryptophan ratio. Serum samples taken prior to the therapy displayed a highly significant difference in KYN levels between the patient and control groups. However, increased KYN levels were detected in only 13 (44.8%) of these CML patients. The KYN levels in pretreatment sera of the patients correlated with the tumor burden. There was also a strong correlation between KYN levels and uric acid levels (UA). This suggests but does not prove the possible involvement of UA in activating IDO family of enzymes. Whenever tested, the increased KYN levels normalized in the course of the therapy. Patients with normal KYN levels in their pretreatment sera and subsequently treated with interferon-alpha, showed a transitory increase in their KYN levels.

Recent evidence indicates that allogeneic NK cells are useful to eliminate haematological cancer cells independently of MHC-I expression. However, it is unclear if transformed cells expressing mutations that confer anti-apoptotic properties and chemoresistance will be susceptible to NK cells. Allogeneic primary human NK cells were activated using different protocols and prospectively tested for their ability to eliminate diverse mutant haematological and apoptotic-resistant cancer cell lines as well as patient-derived B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with chemotherapy multiresistance. Here, we show that human NK cells from healthy donors activated in vitro with Epstein Barr virus positive (EBV(+))-lymphoblastoid cells display an enhanced cytotoxic and proliferative potential in comparison to other protocols of activation such a K562 cells plus interleukin (IL)2. This enhancement enables them to kill more efficiently a variety of haematological cancer cell lines, including a panel of transfectants that mimic natural mutations leading to oncogenic transformation and chemoresistance (e.g., overexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 or downregulation of p53, Bak/Bax or caspase activity). The effect was also observed against blasts from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients showing multi-resistance to chemotherapy.

Upon combined inhibition on Raji and CLL cells by mCRPs-specific siRNAs or neutralizing antibodies, CDC induced by RTX and by OFA was augmented. Similarly, CDC of REH cells was enhanced after mCRPs were inhibited upon treatment with ALM. All mAbs induced C3 opsonization, which was significantly augmented upon blocking mCRPs. C3 opsonization led to enhanced cell-mediated cytotoxicity of leukemia cells exposed to PBLs or macrophages. Furthermore, opsonized CLL cells were efficiently phagocytized by macrophages.

Therefore, we addressed the functional relevance of specific NK cell subsets distinguished by expression of CD117, CD27 and CD11b surface markers in graft-versus-leukemia (GVL)-reaction and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Our results clearly demonstrate that the subset of c-Kit(-)CD27(-)CD11b(+) NK cells expressed multiple cytotoxic pathway genes and provided optimal graft-versus-leukemia-effects, while significantly reducing T cell proliferation induced by allogeneic dendritic cells. Furthermore, these NK cells migrated to inflamed intestinal tissues where graft-versus-host-colitis was efficiently mitigated. For the first time, we identified the c-Kit(-)CD27(-)CD11b(+) NK cell population as the specific effector NK cell subset capable of significantly diminishing GVHD in fully mismatched bone marrow transplantation settings. In conclusion, the subset of c-Kit(-)CD27(-)CD11b(+) NK cells not only supports GVL, but also plays a unique role in the protection against GVHD by migrating to the peripheral GVHD target organs where they exert efficient immunoregulatory activities.

Thus, the detection of BCR-ABL1 is crucial and a false negative BCR-ABL1 result may adversely affect patient care. We report a case of a 76-year-old male with a new diagnosis of B-ALL who was initially found to be BCR-ABL1 negative by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A concurrent qualitative PCR was performed which detected a positive BCR-ABL1 result that was confirmed by a next generation sequencing (NGS) based assay and identified as the rare fusion variant e1a3 of p190(BCR-ABL). Based on this result, the patient was placed on dasatinib as a targeted therapy. In the era of molecular diagnostic medicine and targeted therapy, it is essential to have an understanding of the limitations of molecular assays and to follow a comprehensive diagnostic approach in order to detect common abnormalities and rare variants.

Their antileukemic property is mediated by the trapping and the subsequent degradation of a family of proteins, the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) leading to DNA demethylation, tumor suppressor gene re-expression and DNA damage. Here we studied the respective role of each DNMT in the human leukemia KG1 cell line using a RNA interference approach. In addition we addressed the role of DNA damage formation in DNA demethylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Our data show that DNMT1 is the main DNMT involved in DNA methylation maintenance in KG1 cells and in mediating DNA damage formation upon exposure to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Moreover, KG1 cells express the DNMT1 protein at a level above the one required to ensure DNA methylation maintenance, and we identified a threshold for DNMT1 depletion that needs to be exceeded to achieve DNA demethylation. Most interestingly, by combining DNMT1 siRNA and treatment with low dose of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, it is possible to uncouple DNA damage formation from DNA demethylation. This work strongly suggests that a direct pharmacological inhibition of DNMT1, unlike the use of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, should lead to tumor suppressor gene hypomethylation and re-expression without inducing major DNA damage in leukemia.",,"['Vispe, Stephane', 'Deroide, Arthur', 'Davoine, Emeline', 'Desjobert, Cecile', 'Lestienne, Fabrice', 'Fournier, Lucie', 'Novosad, Natacha', 'Breand, Sophie', 'Besse, Jerome', 'Busato, Florence', 'Tost, Jorg', 'De Vries, Luc', 'Cussac, Didier', 'Riond, Joelle', 'Arimondo, Paola B']","['Vispe S', 'Deroide A', 'Davoine E', 'Desjobert C', 'Lestienne F', 'Fournier L', 'Novosad N', 'Breand S', 'Besse J', 'Busato F', 'Tost J', 'De Vries L', 'Cussac D', 'Riond J', 'Arimondo PB']","['Unite de Service et de Recherche n degrees 3388 CNRS-Pierre Fabre, ETaC Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer, CRDPF, Toulouse, France.', 'Unite de Service et de Recherche n degrees 3388 CNRS-Pierre Fabre, ETaC Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer, CRDPF, Toulouse, France.', 'Unite de Service et de Recherche n degrees 3388 CNRS-Pierre Fabre, ETaC Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer, CRDPF, Toulouse, France.', 'Unite de Service et de Recherche n degrees 3388 CNRS-Pierre Fabre, ETaC Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer, CRDPF, Toulouse, France.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Department, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, Castres, France.', 'Unite de Service et de Recherche n degrees 3388 CNRS-Pierre Fabre, ETaC Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer, CRDPF, Toulouse, France.', 'Unite de Service et de Recherche n degrees 3388 CNRS-Pierre Fabre, ETaC Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer, CRDPF, Toulouse, France.', 'Informatique de Recherche (Bioinformatics and Statistics), Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, Castres, France.', 'Informatique de Recherche (Bioinformatics and Statistics), Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, Castres, France.', 'Laboratory for Epigenetics and Environment, Centre National de Genotypage, CEA-Institut de Genomique, Evry, France.', 'Laboratory for Epigenetics and Environment, Centre National de Genotypage, CEA-Institut de Genomique, Evry, France.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Department, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, Castres, France.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Department, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, Castres, France.', 'Unite de Service et de Recherche n degrees 3388 CNRS-Pierre Fabre, ETaC Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer, CRDPF, Toulouse, France.', 'Unite de Service et de Recherche n degrees 3388 CNRS-Pierre Fabre, ETaC Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer, CRDPF, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Decitabine', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"[""5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine"", 'DNA damage', 'DNA methylation', 'DNMT', 'leukemia']",2015/05/08 06:00,2016/04/30 06:00,['2015/05/08 06:00'],"['2014/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['3317 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3317 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Jun 20;6(17):15265-82. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3317.,,PMC4558150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cocrystallography studies determined the hydrogen bonding pattern between 2'-HCA and Pim-1. Notably, 2'-HCA binding altered the apo kinase structure in a manner that shielded the ligand from solvent, thereby acting as a gatekeeper loop. Biologically, 2'-HCA inhibited the growth of human erythroleukemia or squamous epidermoid carcinoma cells by inducing apoptosis. The compound was also effective as a chemopreventive agent against EGF-mediated neoplastic transformation.

A collaborative investigation with industry in preclinical studies has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy via ADCC for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and CCR4-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). In a phase I study, once-weekly administration of mogamulizumab (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) for 4 weeks was well tolerated. In a phase II study of once-weekly mogamulizumab (1.0 mg/kg) for 8 weeks in relapsed/refractory ATLL patients, an overall response rate of 50% including 30% complete response rate with a median progression-free survival of 5.2 months was observed. The drug was subsequently approved by Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency(PMDA) in March 2012. Because CCR4 is abundantly expressed on the surface of effector regulatory T cells, a phase I study is being conducted to enhance antitumor immune response in patients with solid tumors. However, approximately 60% of patients receiving mogamulizumab experience skin eruption with 19% showing grade >/= 3 rash. Postmarketing surveillance of mogamulizumab revealed a 3-4% incidence rate of skin-related serious adverse events (SAEs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Therefore we initiated a search for predictive genomic biomarkers in the blood of patients with ATLL or solid tumors prior to treatment with mogamulizumab for not only efficacy but also immune-related SAEs.

At present, the studies showed that the expression of CASP8AP2 gene was regulated by Homeobox proteins and DNA methylation, and could be silenced by miRNA-210. This protein was involved in apoptosis mediated by FAS and TNFalpha, NF-kappaB activation mediated by TNFalpha, regulation of gene expression induced by glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor, comprising Cajal body and histone locus body, transcription of replication-dependent histone, 3' end processing of histone, regulation of S phase progression, in addition to functioning as coactivator of transcription factors c-Myb and p73 to activating many genes' expression. On the other hand, low expression of CASP8AP2 gene was associated with relapse in childhood ALL. The deletion of this gene was related to the poor prognosis of children with T-ALL and T lymphoblastic lymphoma.

METHODS: Clinical data of 41 Burkitt's lymphoma patients, treated from Jannuary 2009 to June 2014 in Chinese PLA General Hospital, were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Out of the 41 patients, 33 were males and 8 were females, with a median age of 13 (range, 1-67), 18 cases (43.9%) were in Ann Arbor stage I/II, and 23 cases (56.1%) were in stage III/IV. The commonest pathologicalal sites were head and neck (23 cases, 56.1%), and then the abdominal (41.5%), bone marrow (22.0%) and central nervous system (22.0%) could also be involved, while 7 cases (17.1%) were patients transformed into acute lymphocytic leukemia-type L3, 18% cases (3/16) were infected by EBV and 29.9% cases (6/38) were infected by HBV, 29 cases were treated with chemotherapy, their overal remission rate was 93.1(27/29 cases), 2-year overall survival rate(OS) was 83.3%(10/12 cases); 13 cases were treated with rituximab, their remission rate was 92.3%(12/13 cases), and 2-year OS was 66.7%(4/6 cases). CONCLUSION: The 41 cases are more similar to the sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma, but the median age of its occurence is more younger, while the most common pathological sites are head and neck, and the short-term and high intensive chemotherapy with rituximab can obviously elevate remission rate for adult patients and prolong their survival time.",,"['Ding, Jie', 'Wang, Li-Xin', 'Zhao, Xiao-Li', 'Wang, Li-Jun', 'Li, Dan-Dan', 'Yao, Yu-Shi', 'Yu, Li']","['Ding J', 'Wang LX', 'Zhao XL', 'Wang LJ', 'Li DD', 'Yao YS', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Navy General Hospital of Chinese PLA, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.

METHODS: A 49 year old mal patient with CML who suffered pleural effusion(grade 3) associated with dasatinib was analyzed and summarized. RESULTS: the patient achieved complete molecular response(CMR) after treating with dasatinib 100 mg once daily for 3 months. However, the symptom of chest distress occured in the patient after dasatinib treatment for 6 months, the chest CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusion(grade 3), the pleural effusion related with dasatinib was diagnosed, therefore the diuretic and steriod drugs were given, thoracocentesis was also used to relieve the symptom, after treatment for 5 weeks the pleural effusion disappeared, but the pleural effusion recurred when the patient taken dasatinib again, thus the dasatimib was permanently discontinued, but the patient was in CMR. Six months later, the patient began to take Imatinib (first TKI) 300 mg/d, good effects were achieved and no serious adverse effects were observed. Up to now, the patient still is in CMR for 20 months. CONCLUSION: In the treatment of CML, appropriate TKI should be chose according to basic disease, and pleural effusion is one of the most common adverse effects during the therapy with dasatinib, close monitoring and timely intervention are necessary.

METHODS: Standard GHA regimen consisting of G-CSF: 100 microg/(m2.d) subcutaneous injection, d 0-14; homoharringtonine: 1.0 mg/(m2.d) intravenous drip, d 1-14; Ara-C: 7.5-10 mg/(m2.d) subcutaneous injection, q12h, d 1-14. Other regimens as GHAA/GHTA were combined respectively with aclarubicin 20 mg d 1-7, or pirarubicin 20 mg d 1-7. 74 patients with refractory AML and 46 patients with MDS received these priming chemotherapy. The clinical efficacy and toxicity of above-mentioned priming chemotherapy were compared with 56 patients received routine chemotherapy (MA/TAE) respectively. And the expression of costimulatory molecule B7.1 on leukemia cells in patients of different subtypes was also detected by immunofluoressence and its relationship with clinical efficiency was explored. RESULTS: (1) for AML patients treated with priming chemotherapy, the total remission was 67.56% (CR 54.05%, PR 13.51%), which was much higher than that of patients received routine chemotherapy (P<0.05). The CR rate of AML-M2 and AML-M5 group (65.51%, 61.90% respectively) was much higher than that of AML other subtypes (P<0.05), and the longest remission period lasted for 4 years; (2) for MDS patients treated with priming chemotherapy, the total remission was 60.87% (CR 45.65%, PR 15.22%), which was also significantly higher than that of patients received routine chemotherapy (P<0.05); (3) in comparison with patients received standard GHA priming regimen, the remission rate of combined priming chemotherapy GHAA/GHTA was significantly higher both in patients with AML (85.18%) and MDS (81.25%); (4) side effects after chemotheropy, including granulocyte deficiency, thrombocytopenia and anemia etc, lasted for 7-14 days; the severe infection rate was 1%, there were no severe bleeding, digest effect and damage of function in heart, liver and kidney. The therapy-related mortality was zero. Compared with routine chemotherapy, priming chemotherapy proved significantly safe and effective (P<0.05); (5) the expression rate of costimulatory molecule B7.1 showed large variance between AML and MDS, it was higher in AML-M2/AML-M5 and lower in AML of other subtypes (P<0.05). In the same case, B7.1 expression was positive correlated with efficiency of priming chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: GHA priming chemotherapy, as well as other combination regimens GHAA/GHTA, are well-tolerated, effective regimens for refractory AML and advanced MDS, without severe side effects and therapy-related mortality. Especially the new regimens GHAA/GHTA has better efficacy, which are proved more efficient than conventional GHA.

METHODS: Different concentrations of metformin were added in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to induce maturation, the matured adipocytes were detected by oil red O staining and quantified by absorbance value (OD). Real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression level of the key adipogenic genes PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha and FABP4(ap2). The adipocytes were co-cultured with GFP+-THP-1 cells, 1 microg/ml of cytarabine(Ara-C) was added and incubated for 48 hours, the flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis rate of GFP+-THP-1 cells. Adipocyte supernatant was collected and mixed with equal volume of tumor lysat medium (RPMI 1640) at 1:1 to culture tumor cells. The leukemia cell proliferation activity was detected by CCK-8; after 48 hours of adding 1 microg/ml Ara-C, the protective effect on chemotherapy was assayed by using cytometer. RESULTS: The metformin lowered the OD value, and the expression levels of both adipogenic genes C/EBPalpha and FABP4 were lower than those of controls, while the expression level of PPARgamma mRNA was not significantly changed, the apoptosis rate of leukemia cells co-caltured with metformin-treated adipocytes was higher than that of co-cultured cells without metformin treatment. The adipocytes promoted the leukimia cell proliferation and protected leukemia cells from chemotherapy, which could be abrogated by metformin.

METHODS: Cytogenetic abnormalities of 163 children with newly diagnosed ALL (0-17 years of age) were evaluated by conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization findings. RESULTS: Chromosome abnormalities were detected in 87.7% of patients (143/163). The ploidy levels most frequently observed among ALL patients were high hyperdiploidy (51-67 chromosomes) (45 cases, 27.6%), Chromosomes X and 21 were gained in 100% of these cases.

Higher levels of MIP-1alpha were found to be associated with several kinds of hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Moreover, MIP-1alpha has been reported to be an adverse prognostic factor for CLL. However, the impact of MIP-1alpha on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been poorly investigated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of MIP-1alpha on proliferction of AML cells. METHODS: Using MLL-AF9 induced AML mouse model, the expression of MIP-1alpha was measured by real time quantitative RT-PCR. AML cell proliferation was examined by cell counting and colony forming assay (CFC). The influence of blocking the MIP-1alpha action on the growth and pathogenic ability of AML cells was explored by using the small molecule antagonist for interfering interaction of MIP-1alpha with its receptor CCR1. RESULTS: The MIP-1alpha could promote the proliferation and colony formation of AML cells, the blocking MIP-1a could inhibit the growth of AML cells and delay onset of AML. CONCLUSION: The MIP-1a promotes the occurence and progression of AML, therefore blocking the MIP-1alpha signal pathway may be served as a strategy to inhibit the growth of AML cells, and MIP-1alpha can be a potential target for treatment of AML.",,"['Lu, Ping', 'Wang, Ya-Jie', 'Zheng, Ya-Wei', 'Dong, Fang', 'Pang, Ya-Kun', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Yuan, Wei-Ping', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Hao, Sha']","['Lu P', 'Wang YJ', 'Zheng YW', 'Dong F', 'Pang YK', 'Cheng H', 'Yuan WP', 'Cheng T', 'Hao S']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.

METHODS: The clinical data of 130 children aged <14 years with newly diagnosed AML from May 2006 to March 2013 were analyzed restrospectively. The CNV were analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Thirty-eight normal children were selected in control group. All the data were statistically analyzed using SPSS16.0 software. RESULTS: gene CNV of 2p24.3(MYCN), 10q23(PTEN) and 13q14(RB1, MIR15A, DLEU) were detected in more than 10% of the patients. CNV were detected in 49 cases(37.7%). The median loss and gain CNV frequencies per sample were 4. The CNV of TP53 correlated significantly with relapse.

According to European LeukemiaNet recommendations, the clinical response of CML patients receiving TKI therapy should be evaluated after 3, 6, and 12 months. For patients not achieving a satisfactory response within 3 months, the mean plasma concentration for the three months of TKI administration must be considered. In TKI therapy for CML patients, therapeutic drug monitoring is a new strategy for dosage optimization to obtain a faster and more effective clinical response. The imatinib plasma trough concentration (C(0)) should be set above 1000 ng/mL to obtain a response and below 3000 ng/mL to avoid serious adverse events such as neutropenia. For patients with a UGT1A1*6/*6, *6/*28, or *28/*28 genotype initially administered 300-400 mg/d, a target nilotinib C(0) of 500 ng/mL is recommended to prevent elevation of bilirubin levels, whereas for patients with the UGT1A1*1 allele initially administered 600 mg/d, a target nilotinib C(0) of 800 ng/mL is recommended. For dasatinib, it is recommended that a higher Cmax or C(2) (above 50 ng/mL) to obtain a clinical response and a lower C(0) (less than 2.5 ng/mL) to avoid pleural effusion be maintained by once daily administration of dasatinib.

Demographic and clinical data from both donors and recipients were obtained. The diagnostic criteria for the development of oGVHD DES from the National Institutes of Health were used to identify patients with the disease. Descriptive and inferential statistics were carried out. RESULTS: A total of 146 patients with a median follow-up time of 24.0 months (range 11.3-249.7 months) were included in this study. Sixty-six (45.2%) patients were women. Seventy-seven (52.7%) patients had oGVHD DES. The median age of patients was 57 years (range 25-71 years). Compared with other ethnicities, Caucasian patients were less likely to develop oGVHD DES, with an OR of 0.29 (p=0.01). Patients who received a transplant from Epstein-Barr-positive donors had a higher prevalence of oGVHD DES (OR=4.39, p=0.01). This was also found in patients with the following systemic involvement of cGVHD: grade 1-3 cGVHD skin involvement (OR=1.57, p=0.01), oral involvement (OR=2.51, p=0.01) and liver involvement (p=0.04). Patients with grade 2-3 overall cGVHD were also more susceptible to oGVHD DES (OR=2.72, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified risk factors associated with a higher prevalence of oGVHD DES in post-AHSCT patients with cGVHD.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, AMED, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Web of Science using the terms ""exercise"" OR ""physical activity"" AND ""myeloid leukemia."" Two reviewers performed duplicate title/abstract and full text screening of clinical trials comparing outcomes for people with myeloid leukemia participating in an exercise program. Initial searches yielded 149 articles. Two reviewers independently extracted data using piloted forms and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's tool. Data was extracted in relation to the study population, study intervention, comparator intervention, and outcomes assessed. RESULTS: Five trials were included in this review after 20 full-text articles were screened. Risk of bias was determined to be high in all five studies. Adherence rates were found to be low (<30 %) in all studies measuring this outcome. Positive improvements were found for fatigue, physical functioning, quality of life, and psychological distress for patients with AML; however, not all findings were significant. Leukocyte and BCR-ABL1 levels increased significantly post-exercise for participants with CML. Only one adverse event was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise interventions appear safe and feasible for individuals with AML. Not enough evidence was presented to comment on the feasibility of exercise programs for individuals with CML.

As a foundation of multicolor FISH, we first isolated 80 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes that specifically detect the peri-centromeres (peri-CEN) and subtelomeres (subTEL) of 24 different human chromosomes (nos. 1~22, X, and Y) by screening our homemade BAC library (Keio BAC library) consisting of 200,000 clones. Five-color FISH was performed using human DNA segments specific for peri-CEN or subTEL, which were labeled with five different fluorescent dyes [7-diethylaminocoumarin (DEAC): blue, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC): green, rhodamine 6G (R6G): yellow, TexRed: red, and cyanine5 (Cy5): purple]. To observe FISH signals under a fluorescence microscope, five optic filters were carefully chosen to avoid overlapping fluorescence emission. Five-color FISH and four-color FISH enabled us to accurately examine the numerical anomaly of human chromosomes. Three-color FISH using two specific BAC clones, that distinguish 5' half of oncogene epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from its 3' half, revealed the amplification and truncation of EGFR in EGFR-overproducing cancer cells. Moreover, two-color FISH readily detected a fusion gene in leukemia cells such as breakpoint cluster region (BCR)/Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homologue (ABL) on the Philadelphia (Ph') chromosome with interchromosomal translocation.

The oligomers contain both alpha- and beta-amino acid residues, with the density of the beta subunits low enough that an alpha-helix-like conformation can be adopted but high enough to interfere with protease activity. Previous studies with a different protein-recognition system that suggested ring-constrained beta residues can be superior to flexible beta residues in terms of maximizing alpha/beta-peptide affinity for a targeted protein surface. Here, we use mimicry of the 18-residue Bim BH3 domain to expand the scope of this strategy. Two significant advances have been achieved. First, we have developed and validated a new ring-constrained beta residue that bears an acidic side chain, which complements previously known analogues that are either hydrophobic or basic. Second, we have discovered that placing cyclic beta residues at sites that make direct contact with partner proteins can lead to substantial discrimination between structurally homologous binding partners, the proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Overall, this study helps to establish that alpha/beta-peptides containing ring-preorganized beta residues can reliably provide proteolytically resistant ligands for proteins that naturally evolved to recognize alpha-helical partners.",,"['Peterson-Kaufman, Kimberly J', 'Haase, Holly S', 'Boersma, Melissa D', 'Lee, Erinna F', 'Fairlie, W Douglas', 'Gellman, Samuel H']","['Peterson-Kaufman KJ', 'Haase HS', 'Boersma MD', 'Lee EF', 'Fairlie WD', 'Gellman SH']","['daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, 1101 University Ave., Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, 1101 University Ave., Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, 1101 University Ave., Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States.', 'section signStructural Biology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'double daggerDepartment of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia.', 'section signStructural Biology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'double daggerDepartment of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, 1101 University Ave., Madison, Wisconsin 53706, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150507,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/chemistry/*metabolism']",,,2015/05/08 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2015/05/08 06:00'],"['2015/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acschembio.5b00109 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2015 Jul 17;10(7):1667-75. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.5b00109.

We aimed to develop a method for estimating inpatient costs for pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) enrolled on NCI-funded Phase III trials, compare costs between AAML0531 treatment arms (standard chemotherapy +/- gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GMTZ)), and evaluate primary drivers of costs for newly diagnosed pediatric AML. PROCEDURE: Patients from the AAML0531 trial were matched on hospital, sex, and dates of birth and diagnosis to the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database to obtain daily billing data. Inpatient treatment costs were calculated as adjusted charges multiplied by hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios. Generalized linear models were used to compare costs between treatment arms and courses, and by patient characteristics. RESULTS: Inpatient costs did not differ by randomized treatment arm. Costs varied by course with stem cell transplant being most expensive, followed by Intensification II (cytarabine/mitoxantrone) and Induction I (cytarabine/daunorubicin/etoposide). Room/board and pharmacy were the largest contributors to inpatient treatment cost, representing 74% of the total cost. Higher AML risk group (P = 0.0003) and older age (P < 0.0001) were associated with significantly higher daily inpatient cost. CONCLUSIONS: Costs from external data sources can be successfully integrated into NCI-funded Phase III clinical trials. Inpatient treatment costs did not differ by GMTZ exposure but varied by chemotherapy course. Variation in cost by course was driven by differences in duration of hospitalization through room/board charges as well as increased clinical and pharmacy charges in specific courses.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Getz, Kelly D', 'Li, Yimei', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Hall, Matthew', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung', 'Arnold, Staci', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Miller, Tamara P', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Adamson, Peter C', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Keren, Ron', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Getz KD', 'Li Y', 'Alonzo TA', 'Hall M', 'Gerbing RB', 'Sung L', 'Huang YS', 'Arnold S', 'Seif AE', 'Miller TP', 'Bagatell R', 'Fisher BT', 'Adamson PC', 'Gamis A', 'Keren R', 'Aplenc R']","[""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Children's Hospital Association, Overland Park, Kansas."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California."", 'Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto.', ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri."", ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150506,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aminoglycosides/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Inpatients', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*economics', 'Male', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/economics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cost and cost analysis', 'pediatric', 'treatment cost']",2015/05/07 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2015/05/07 06:00'],"['2015/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25569 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Oct;62(10):1775-81. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25569.

The pathology of affected brain tissues demonstrates oligodendroglia-like cells with viral inclusions in their enlarged nuclei, a diagnostic hallmark of this disease. Today, the pathological features of this disease are expanding, partly due to an unsteady balance between viral virulence and host immunity. Intranuclear viral inclusions were initially thought to be amphophilic materials comprising the entire enlarged nucleus, based on HE staining (full inclusions). Howevewr, recent immunohistochemical analyses detected the presence of intranuclear viral inclusions in dots (dot-shaped inclusions). The dot-shaped inclusions reflect clustered progeny virions at punctuated subnuclear domains called promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, and are indicative of early-stage viral infection or suppressed viral proliferation. Second, the JC virus is usually reactivated in patients with impaired immunity, and therefore the inflammatory reactions are poor. However, the causes of immunosuppression are divergent, as seen with the frequent use of immunosuppressive drugs, including natalizumab. Therefore, the degree of host immunity is variable; some patients show marked anti-viral inflammatory reactions and a good prognosis, indicating that a strong resistance against viral infection remains. Recovery of the immune system may also induce paradoxical clinical worsening, known as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, the mechanism of which has not been clarified.

By taking advantage of the specific binding of BRD4 to acetylated lysine residues, we developed a FRET-based probe for visualizing histone H3 acetylation in living cells. BRD4, a protein known to be involved in acute myeloid leukemia and nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma, recognizes the acetylation of histone H3 via its bromodomains. The probe exhibited a significant change in FRET signaling that was dependent on histone H3 acetylation. Mutagenesis studies revealed that an increase in the emission ratio reflected the acetylation of either K9 or K14 of histone H3 within the probe.

However, there is a lack of adjuvants or adjuvant strategies, which directly target T cellular effector functions and memory. We here determined whether systemically toxic cytokines such as IL-2 can be restricted to the site of antigen presentation and used as 'natural adjuvants'. Therefore, we devised antigen-presenting virus-like nanoparticles (VNP) co-expressing IL-2 attached to different membrane-anchors and assessed their potency to modulate CD8+ T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Efficient targeting of IL-2 to lipid rafts and ultimately VNP was achieved by fusing IL-2 at its C-terminus to a minimal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor acceptor sequence. To identify optimal membrane-anchor dimensions we inserted one (1Ig), two (2Ig) or four (4Ig) immunoglobulin(Ig)-like domains of CD16b between IL-2 and the minimal GPI-anchor acceptor sequence of CD16b (GPI). We found that the 2IgGPI version was superior to all other evaluated IL-2 variants (IL-2v) in terms of its i) degree of targeting to lipid rafts and to the VNP surface, ii) biological activity, iii) co-stimulation of cognate T cells in the absence of bystander activation and iv) potency to induce differentiation and acquisition of CD8+ T cell effector functions in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, the GPI version rather favored memory precursor cell formation. These results exemplify novel beneficial features of membrane-bound IL-2, which in addition to its mere T cell stimulatory capacity include the induction of differential effector and memory functions in CD8+ T lymphocytes.",,"['Wojta-Stremayr, Daniela', 'Neunkirchner, Alina', 'Srinivasan, Bharani', 'Trapin, Doris', 'Schmetterer, Klaus G', 'Pickl, Winfried F']","['Wojta-Stremayr D', 'Neunkirchner A', 'Srinivasan B', 'Trapin D', 'Schmetterer KG', 'Pickl WF']","['Institute of Immunology, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Christian Doppler Laboratory for Immunomodulation, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Immunology, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Christian Doppler Laboratory for Immunomodulation, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Immunology, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Immunology, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Immunology, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Immunology, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Christian Doppler Laboratory for Immunomodulation, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150506,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (FCGR3B protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Microdomains/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Nanoparticles', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, IgG/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Vaccines, Virus-Like Particle/genetics/*immunology']",,,2015/05/07 06:00,2016/04/21 06:00,['2015/05/07 06:00'],"['2014/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0126034 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-37688 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 6;10(5):e0126034. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0126034. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4422701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we showed that SET was evidently overexpressed in human NSCLC cell lines and NSCLC tissues. Clinicopathologic analysis showed that SET expression was significantly correlated with clinical stage (p < 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with high SET expression had poorer overall survival rates than those with low SET expression. Moreover, knockdown of SET in NSCLC cells resulted in attenuated proliferative and invasive abilities. The biological effect of SET on proliferation and invasion was mediated by the inhibition of the PP2A, which in turn, activation of AKT and ERK, increased the expression of cyclin D1 and MMP9, and decreased the expression of p27. Furthermore, we observed that restoration of PP2A using SET antagonist FTY720 impaired proliferative and invasive potential in vitro, as well as inhibited tumor growth in vivo of NSCLC cells.

In the work reported in this paper, we further refined the technique by performing significantly more experiments to determine a universal correction factor to Stokes' equation in expressing the drag force on a microparticle as it falls towards an infinite plane. Specifically, a theoretical model for micron-sized spheres settling towards an infinite plane in a microfluidic environment is presented, and which was validated experimentally using five different sizes of micro polystyrene beads. The same sedimentation process was applied to two kinds of leukemic cancer cells with similar sizes in an OEK platform, and their density and mass were determined accordingly.

In the present study, 47 MPAL, 60 lymphoid antigen-positive acute myeloid leukemia (Ly(+)AML), and 90 acute myeloid leukemia with common myeloid immunophenotype (Ly(-)AML) patients were investigated. We found that, in MPAL patients, there were high proportions of blast cells in bone marrow and incidence of hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and Philadelphia chromosome. The overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in MPAL patients were significantly shorter than those in Ly(+)AML and Ly(-)AML. With regard to the patients with normal karyotype only, the OS and RFS of MPAL were significantly lower than those of the Ly(+)AML and Ly(-)AML; but there were no significant differences in OS and RFS among the patients with complex karyotype. The OS rates of 3 groups with complex karyotype were lower than those of patients with normal karyotype.

To gain detailed insight into EphB1 function in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), comprehensive analysis of EphB1 transcriptional regulation was conducted. In AML cells, EphB1 transcript was inversely correlated with EphB1 promoter methylation. The presence of EphB1 allowed EfnB1 ligand-mediated p53 DNA binding, leading to restoration of the DNA damage response (DDR) cascade by the activation of ATR, Chk1, p53, p21, p38, CDK1(tyr15), and Bax, and downregulation of HSP27 and Bcl2. Comparatively, reintroduction of EphB1 expression in EphB1-methylated AML cells enhanced the same cascade of ATR, Chk1, p21, and CDK1(tyr15), which consequently enforced programmed cell death. Interestingly, in pediatric AML samples, EphB1 peptide phosphorylation and mRNA expression were actively suppressed as compared with normal bone marrow, and a significant percentage of the primary AML specimens had EphB1 promoter hypermethylation. Finally, EphB1 repression associated with a poor overall survival in pediatric AML. Combined, the contribution of EphB1 to the DDR system reveals a tumor-suppressor function for EphB1 in pediatric AML. IMPLICATIONS: The tumor-suppressor function of EphB1 is clinically relevant across many malignancies, suggesting that EphB1 is an important regulator of common cancer cell transforming pathways.",['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Kampen, K R', 'Scherpen, F J G', 'Garcia-Manero, G', 'Yang, H', 'Kaspers, G J L', 'Cloos, J', 'Zwaan, C M', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M', 'Kornblau, S M', 'De Bont, E S J M']","['Kampen KR', 'Scherpen FJ', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Yang H', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Cloos J', 'Zwaan CM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Kornblau SM', 'De Bont ES']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands."", 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands. e.s.j.m.de.bont@umcg.nl.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150505,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (EPHB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphB2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Repair', '*Down-Regulation', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor, EphA1/metabolism', 'Receptor, EphB2/*metabolism']",,,2015/05/07 06:00,2016/03/19 06:00,['2015/05/07 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-14-0660-T [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-14-0660-T [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2015 Jun;13(6):982-92. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-14-0660-T.

Here, we investigated c-Abl regulation of the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), an important regulator of p53-dependent apoptosis. c-Abl phosphorylated HIPK2 at several sites, and phosphorylation by c-Abl protected HIPK2 from degradation mediated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Siah-1. c-Abl and HIPK2 synergized in activating p53 on apoptotic promoters in a reporter assay, and c-Abl was required for endogenous HIPK2 accumulation and phosphorylation of p53 at Ser(46) in response to DNA damage by gamma- and UV radiation. Accumulation of HIPK2 in nuclear speckles and association with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in response to DNA damage were also dependent on c-Abl activity. At high cell density, the Hippo pathway inhibits DNA damage-induced c-Abl activation. Under this condition, DNA damage-induced HIPK2 accumulation, phosphorylation of p53 at Ser(46), and apoptosis were attenuated.

This was done by real-time PCR in 24 leukemia cell lines and 39 leukemia patients, which included AML, MDS and CLL patients, some of whom received HDAC inhibitor treatment. Among the samples analyzed, there was no discernible pattern in HDAC expression. HDAC expression was generally increased in CLL patients, except for HDAC2 and HDAC4. HDAC expression was also generally increased in VPA-treated MOLT4 cells. However, this increased expression was not seen in AML patients treated with vorinostat. In summary, increased HDAC expression was noted in CLL patients in general, but the HDAC expression patterns in myeloid malignancies appear to be heterogeneous, which implies that the role of HDACs in leukemia may be related to global expression or protein function rather than specific expression patterns.",,"['Yang, Hui', 'Maddipoti, Sirisha', 'Quesada, Andres', 'Bohannan, Zachary', 'Cabrero Calvo, Monica', 'Colla, Simona', 'Wei, Yue', 'Estecio, Marcos', 'Wierda, William', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Yang H', 'Maddipoti S', 'Quesada A', 'Bohannan Z', 'Cabrero Calvo M', 'Colla S', 'Wei Y', 'Estecio M', 'Wierda W', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'b Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'c Department of Hematopathology , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150526,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Histone', 'gene expression', 'histone deacetylase', 'histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'leukemia']",2015/05/07 06:00,2016/09/22 06:00,['2015/05/07 06:00'],"['2015/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2015.1034705 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(12):3426-33. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2015.1034705.

Patients enrolled in the Korea University acute myeloid leukemia (AML) registry received remission induction chemotherapy with the same standard induction regimen (idarubicin and cytarabine 3 + 7). Postremission therapy was performed for three or four cycles according to one of the following regimens: high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m(2)) or combination of intermediate-dose cytarabine (1 g/m(2)) with anthracyclines (idarubicin or mitoxantrone). Among the 443 AML patients enrolled in the registry, 145 patients received consolidation chemotherapy. The median overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in the high-dose cytarabine group were significantly longer than those in the anthracycline combination group (OS, not reached vs. 16.6 months, p = 0.045; RFS, 38.6 months vs. 11.0 months, p = 0.011). The median duration of neutropenia was longer in the anthracycline combination group than in the high-dose cytarabine group (8 vs. 10 days, p = 0.001).

Recently, Beckman Coulter has introduced a line of dried reagents that, unlike liquid reagents and cocktails, require no refrigeration, titration, or manipulation before using. We evaluated custom tubes based on our standard lymphocyte screening panel, focusing on comparative analysis, ease of use, and advantages compared with our liquid reagent set. We tested 42 samples from blood (n = 15), bone marrow (n = 17), and tissue (n = 10) with the combination CD4/CD8/KAPPA/LAMBDA/CD19/CD56/CD5/CD20/CD10/CD3/CD45 and a vital dye by both methods and compared positivity and staining intensity for each antigen. Of the 42 samples, 5 were normal samples, 3 were red cell disorders, 20 were B-cell malignancies, 5 T-cell malignancies, 4 myeloid malignancies, and the remaining 5 were other diagnoses. Dried reagents gave equivalent staining intensity results to our standard panel in a variety of sample types, with diagnoses including reactive lymphocytosis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and various lymphomas. Our standard panel for evaluation of mature lymphoid malignancies allows rapid assessment of any sample type while providing direct assessment of viability. The dried reagent tube reduces preanalytical work, with simple addition of sample and the viability dye to the tube, saving time, reducing potential errors, and obviating need to titrate and monitor individual antibodies.

We characterized the impact of AML and its treatment on quality of life (QOL) and physical function in younger (age 18-59) and older (age 60+) patients with AML over 1year from diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML patients undergoing IC without stem-cell transplant at two tertiary care centers were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal study. Assessments were done pre-IC and at 7 time points over the next year. QOL, fatigue, and physical performance (grip strength, 2-minute walk test (2MWT), timed chair stands) were measured in all patients whereas daily function was measured only in older patients. Data were analyzed using mixed effects regression models. RESULTS: 237 patients were recruited (140 younger and 97 older, 56% male). One-year survival was 79% and 60% among younger and older patients, respectively. For patients in remission, global QOL and fatigue improved significantly over time (p<0.001 for both); trends were similar between older and younger patients. Grip strength did not change over time (p=0.58) whereas both the 2MWT (p<0.001) and timed chair stands (p<0.001) improved significantly. Daily function improved significantly over time (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of AML in remission after IC achieve significant improvements in QOL, fatigue, and physical function over time with similar trajectories for older and younger patients.

METHODS: A case-control study using California Cancer Registry data (1988-2007) was conducted to evaluate the risk of cancer among firefighters, stratified by race. RESULTS: This study identified 3,996 male firefighters with cancer. Firefighters were found to have a significantly elevated risk for melanoma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-2.1), multiple myeloma (OR 1.4; 95%CI 1.0-1.8), acute myeloid leukemia (OR 1.4; 95%CI 1.0-2.0), and cancers of the esophagus (OR 1.6; 95%CI 1.2-2.1), prostate (OR 1.5; 95%CI 1.3-1.7), brain (OR 1.5; 95%CI 1.2-2.0), and kidney (OR 1.3; 95%CI 1.0-1.6). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to observing cancer findings consistent with previous research, this study generated novel findings for firefighters with race/ethnicity other than white. It provides additional evidence to support the association between firefighting and several specific cancers.","['(c) 2015 This article has been contributed to by US Government employees and', 'their work is in the public domain in the USA.']","['Tsai, Rebecca J', 'Luckhaupt, Sara E', 'Schumacher, Pam', 'Cress, Rosemary D', 'Deapen, Dennis M', 'Calvert, Geoffrey M']","['Tsai RJ', 'Luckhaupt SE', 'Schumacher P', 'Cress RD', 'Deapen DM', 'Calvert GM']","['Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cincinnati, Ohio.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cincinnati, Ohio.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cincinnati, Ohio.', 'Public Health Institute, Cancer Registry of Greater California, Sacramento, California.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, UC Davis School of Medicine, Davis, California.', 'Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cincinnati, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20150506,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Adult', 'African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Firefighters/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hispanic or Latino/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'firefighters', 'occupation', 'registry', 'risk']",2015/05/07 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/05/07 06:00'],"['2015/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajim.22466 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2015 Jul;58(7):715-29. doi: 10.1002/ajim.22466.

Given that elevated fatty acid biosynthesis is a hallmark of many cancers and that these drugs can affect lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that BaP exerts anticancer effects by disrupting lipogenesis. We applied mass spectrometry-based lipidomics and gene and protein expression measurements of key lipogenic enzymes [acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)] to AML and eBL cell lines treated with BaP. BaP treatment decreased fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis from (13)C D-glucose. The proportion of phospholipid species with saturated and monounsaturated acyl chains was also decreased after treatment, whereas those with polyunsaturated chains increased. BaP decreased SCD1 protein levels in each cell line (0.46- to 0.62-fold; P < 0.023) and decreased FASN protein levels across all cell lines (0.87-fold decrease; P = 1.7 x 10(-4)). Changes to ACC1 protein levels were mostly insignificant. Supplementation with the SCD1 enzymatic product, oleate, rescued AML and e-BL cells from BaP cell killing and decreased levels of BaP-induced reactive oxygen species, whereas supplementation with the SCD1 substrate (and FASN product), palmitate, did not rescue cells. In conclusion, these data suggest that the critical anticancer actions of BaP are decreases in SCD1 levels and monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis.

To assess its effectiveness, we compared overall survival (OS) between azacitidine and conventional treatment (CCT) in high-risk MDS patients, excluding those undergoing stem cell transplantation, submitted to the Spanish MDS registry from 2000 to 2013. Several Cox regression and competing risk models, considering azacitidine as a time-dependent covariate, were used to assess survival and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) progression. Among 821 patients included, 251 received azacitidine. Median survival was 13.4 (11.8-16) months for azacitidine-treated patients and 12.2 (11-14.1) for patients under CCT (P=0.41). In a multivariate model, age, International prognostic scoring system and lactate dehydrogenase were predictors of OS whereas azacitidine was not (adjusted odds ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.35, P=0.49).

Pre-BCR expression provides the first checkpoint, which controls differentiation of pre-B to immature B-cells in normal haemopoiesis. Pre-BCR signalling regulates and co-ordinates diverse processes within the pre-B cell, including clonal selection, proliferation and subsequent maturation. In B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL), B-cell development is arrested at this checkpoint. Moreover, malignant blasts avoid clonal extinction by hijacking pre-BCR signalling in favour of the development of BCP-ALL. Here, we discuss three mechanisms that occur in different subtypes of BCP-ALL: (i) blocking pre-BCR expression; (ii) activating pre-BCR-mediated pro-survival and pro-proliferative signalling, while inhibiting cell cycle arrest and maturation; and (iii) bypassing the pre-BCR checkpoint and activating pro-survival signalling through pre-BCR independent alternative mechanisms.

Utilizing single-nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) and targeted gene sequencing (TGS) of 24 frequently mutated genes in MDS, we assessed the concordance of genetic abnormalities in BM and peripheral blood (PB) samples concurrently from 201 MDS patients. SNP-A karyotype in BM was abnormal in 108 (54%) and normal in 93 (46%) patients, with 95% (190/201) having an identical PB karyotype. The median copy number (CN) for deletions was significantly lower in BM (CN:1.4 (1-1.9)) than in PB (CN:1.5 (1-1.95), P<0.001). Using TGS, 71% (130/183) patients had BM somatic mutations with 95% (124/130) having identical mutations in PB.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CD47 is overexpressed on peripheral blasts and leukemia stem cells and inversely correlates with survival. Aim of the study was to investigate the correlation between CD47 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a bone marrow (BM) tissue microarray (TMA) and clinical outcome in AML patients. CD47 staining on BM leukemia blasts was scored semi-quantitatively and correlated with clinical parameters and known prognostic factors in AML. Low (scores 0-2) and high (score 3) CD47 protein expression were observed in 75% and 25% of AML patients. CD47 expression significantly correlated with percentage BM blast infiltration and peripheral blood blasts. Moreover, high CD47 expression was associated with nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene mutations. In contrast, CD47 expression did not significantly correlate with overall or progression free survival or response to therapy. In summary, a BM TMA permits rapid and reproducible semi-quantitative analysis of CD47 protein expression by IHC.

Lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1), a key mediator of Wnt signaling, has been linked to leukemic transformation, and LEF1 mutations have been identified in T-ALL. Here we found LEF1 is highly expressed in 25.0% adult ALL patients and LEF1 high expression was associated with high-risk leukemia factors (high WBC, Philadelphia chromosome positive, complex karyotype), shorter event-free survival (EFS), and high relapse rates in patients with B-ALL. LEF1 high expression is also associated with high mutation rate of Notch1 and JAK1 in T-ALL. We identified 2 novel LEF1 mutations (K86E and P106L) in 4 of 131 patients with ALL, and those patients with high-risk ALL (high WBC, complex karyotype). These results suggest a role for LEF1 mutations in leukemogenesis. We further explored the effect of the mutations on cell proliferation and found both mutations significantly promoted the proliferation of ALL cells. We also observed the effect of LEF1 and its mutations on the transcription of its targets, c-MYC and Cyclin D1. We found LEF1 increased the promoter activity of its targets c-MYC and Cyclin D1, and LEF1 K86E and P106L mutants further significantly enhanced this effect. We also observed that the c-MYC and Cyclin D1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in patients with LEF1 high expression compared with those with low expression.

In parallel, epigenetic modifiers that are altered in cancer play critical roles in normal hematopoietic development, influencing both self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells and differentiation into the different lineages. In this review, we aim to compare the role of several key DNA or histone modifying enzymes and complexes in normal development and hematopoietic malignancies, including DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1, IDH2, MLL1, MLL4, DOT1L, PRC1/2 and WSHC1/NSD2/MMSET.

Cellular and viral microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression. A better knowledge of the miRNA-mediated pathways affected by KSHV infection is therefore important for understanding viral infection and tumor pathogenesis. In this study, we used deep sequencing to analyze miRNA and cellular mRNA expression in a cell line with latent KSHV infection (SLKK) as compared to the uninfected SLK line. This approach revealed 153 differentially expressed human miRNAs, eight of which were independently confirmed by qRT-PCR. KSHV infection led to the dysregulation of ~15% of the human miRNA pool and most of these cellular miRNAs were down-regulated, including nearly all members of the 14q32 miRNA cluster, a genomic locus linked to cancer and that is deleted in a number of PEL cell lines. Furthermore, we identified 48 miRNAs that were associated with a total of 1,117 predicted or experimentally validated target mRNAs; of these mRNAs, a majority (73%) were inversely correlated to expression changes of their respective miRNAs, suggesting miRNA-mediated silencing mechanisms were involved in a number of these alterations. Several dysregulated miRNA-mRNA pairs may facilitate KSHV infection or tumor formation, such as up-regulated miR-708-5p, associated with a decrease in pro-apoptotic caspase-2 and leukemia inhibitory factor LIF, or down-regulated miR-409-5p, associated with an increase in the p53-inhibitor MDM2. Transfection of miRNA mimics provided further evidence that changes in miRNAs are driving some observed mRNA changes. Using filtered datasets, we also identified several canonical pathways that were significantly enriched in differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA pairs, such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the interleukin-8 signaling pathways. Overall, our data provide a more detailed understanding of KSHV latency and guide further studies of the biological significance of these changes.",,"['Viollet, Coralie', 'Davis, David A', 'Reczko, Martin', 'Ziegelbauer, Joseph M', 'Pezzella, Francesco', 'Ragoussis, Jiannis', 'Yarchoan, Robert']","['Viollet C', 'Davis DA', 'Reczko M', 'Ziegelbauer JM', 'Pezzella F', 'Ragoussis J', 'Yarchoan R']","['HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America; The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Institute of Molecular Oncology, Alexander Fleming Biomedical Sciences Research Center, Vari, Greece.', 'HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; Institute of Molecular Oncology, Alexander Fleming Biomedical Sciences Research Center, Vari, Greece; McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150505,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (MIRN409 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN708 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Primary Effusion/*genetics/virology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*genetics/virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2015/05/06 06:00,2016/04/26 06:00,['2015/05/06 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0126439 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-57070 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 5;10(5):e0126439. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0126439. eCollection 2015.,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '095493/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4420468,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current model for the microcephaly phenotype in MCPH invokes a premature shift from symmetric to asymmetric neural progenitor-cell divisions with a subsequent depletion of the progenitor pool. The isolated neural phenotype, despite the ubiquitous expression of CDK5RAP2, and reports of progressive microcephaly in individual MCPH cases prompted us to investigate neural and non-neural differentiation of Cdk5rap2-depleted and control murine embryonic stem cells (mESC). We demonstrate an accumulating proliferation defect of neurally differentiating Cdk5rap2-depleted mESC and cell death of proliferative and early postmitotic cells. A similar effect does not occur in non-neural differentiation into beating cardiomyocytes, which is in line with the lack of non-central nervous system features in MCPH patients.

We distinguished five treatment groups: Group Ia, chemotherapy only (n = 130); Ib, chemotherapy with cranial radiotherapy (n = 10); II, TBI conditioning allograft (n = 27); III, chemotherapy conditioning allograft (n = 4); IV, TBI conditioning autograft (n = 3). Twenty-three women had their first child at the mean age of 25.8 +/-3.0 years, i.e., 2.0 +/-2.9 years earlier than the general population of the Rhone-Alpes region (P = 0.003). The standardized fertility ratio (SFR), expressed as the number of actual births observed (O) to the number that would be expected in women of the same age in the general population (E) (SFR = O/E) was decreased for Group Ia (0.62; 95%CI, 0.52-0.74) and collapsed in Group II (0.17; 0.11-0.25). In univariate analysis, TBI (P = 0.013) and alkylating agents (P = 0.01) were negatively correlated with fecundity, but not with the age at diagnosis or the anthracyclines doses. In multivariate analysis including TBI and alkylating agents, we still found a negative correlation between TBI (P = 0.035), as well as alkylating agents (P = 0.028), and fecundity.

First, we introduced two fluorine atoms to position 2 of the skeleton. Second, we synthesized a set of hemiester prodrugs, which were intended to increase the solubility and activity. Starting from betulin, we obtained two hydroxyketones (derivatives of dihydrobetulinic acid and allobetulin) and their fluorination using DAST provided 2,2-difluoro-3-oxo-compounds as the main products. Then the 3-oxo group in each derivative was reduced by NaBH4 to obtain 3beta-hydroxy compounds suitable for modifying by various hemiesters. We prepared 21 compounds, 11 of them new, their cytotoxicity was tested on T lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM cells first and the most active derivatives were selected for screening on another six tumor and two non-tumor cell lines. All of them showed selectivity against cancer lines with therapeutic index between 2 and 8. All hemiesters had activity in the same range as the free hydroxyl derivatives and they would be suitable prodrugs for future in vivo experiments. Interestingly, all hemiesters of 2,2-difluorodihydrobetulonic acid had higher activity against p53 knock-out p53-/- cancer cell line than against the non-mutated analog.

We have previously reported that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) promotes retinoic acid (RA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of lineage bipotent HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells. VAF347, an AhR agonist, impairs the development of CD14(+)CD11b(+) monocytes from granulo-monocytic (GM) stage precursors. We thus hypothesized that VAF347 propels RA-induced granulocytic differentiation and impairs D3-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Our results show that VAF347 enhanced RA-induced cell cycle arrest, CD11b integrin expression and neutrophil respiratory burst. Granulocytic differentiation is known to be driven by MAPK signaling events regulated by Fgr and Lyn Src-family kinases, the CD38 cell membrane receptor, the Vav1 GEF, the c-Cbl adaptor, as well as AhR, all of which are embodied in a putative signalsome. We found that the VAF347 AhR ligand regulates the signalsome. VAF347 augments RA-induced expression of AhR, Lyn, Vav1, and c-Cbl as well as p47(phox). Several interactions of partners in the signalsome appear to be enhanced: Fgr interaction with c-Cbl, CD38, and with pS259c-Raf and AhR interaction with c-Cbl and Lyn. Thus, we report that, while VAF347 impedes monocytic differentiation induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, VAF347 promotes RA-induced differentiation. This effect seems to involve but not to be limited to Lyn, Vav1, c-Cbl, AhR, and Fgr.",,"['Ibabao, Christopher N', 'Bunaciu, Rodica P', 'Schaefer, Deanna M W', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Ibabao CN', 'Bunaciu RP', 'Schaefer DM', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150408,England,FEBS Open Bio,FEBS open bio,101580716,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['APC, allophycocyanin', 'APL, acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3', 'Differentiation', 'FICZ, 6-formylindolo (3,2-b) carbazole', 'GM, granulo-monocytic', 'Leukemia', 'PE, phycoerythrin', 'RA, all trans-retinoic acid', 'Retinoic acid', 'TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin', 'VAF347', 'VAF347, (4-(3-Chloro-phenyl)-pyrimidin-2-yl)-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-amine']",2015/05/06 06:00,2015/05/06 06:01,['2015/05/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.fob.2015.04.002 [doi]', 'S2211-5463(15)00032-7 [pii]']",epublish,FEBS Open Bio. 2015 Apr 8;5:308-18. doi: 10.1016/j.fob.2015.04.002. eCollection 2015.,"['R01 CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4412882,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A myriad of human cancer types have been shown to overexpress IGF-1R, including breast and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. IGF-1R signaling interferes with numerous receptor pathways, rendering tumor cells resistant to chemotherapy, anti-hormonal therapy, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also known as HER-1) and v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, (ERBB2, best known as HER-2) -targeted therapies. Targeting the IGF:IGF-1R axis with innovative peptide inhibitors and vaccine antibodies thus represents a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance and to provide new avenues for individualized and combinatorial treatment strategies. In this study, we designed, synthesized, and characterized several B-cell epitopes from the IGF-1:IGF-1R axis. The chimeric peptide epitopes were highly immunogenic in outbred rabbits, eliciting high levels of peptide vaccine antibodies. The IGF-1R peptide antibodies and peptide mimics inhibited cell proliferation and receptor phosphorylation, induced apoptosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and significantly inhibited tumor growth in the transplantable BxPC-3 pancreatic and JIMT-1 breast cancer models. Our results showed that the peptides and antibodies targeting residues 56-81 and 233-251 are potential therapeutic and vaccine candidates for the treatment of IGF-1R-expressing cancers, including those that are resistant to the HER-2-targeted antibody, trastuzumab. Additionally, we found additive antitumor effects for the combination treatment of the IGF-1R 56-81 epitope with HER-1-418 and HER-2-597 epitopes.

In contrast to solid tumors, the expression of CD44 standard and variant forms and their functional interplay with HA is less understood in hematological malignancies. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a highly abundant B-cell malignancy with a well coordinated balance between cell cycle-arrest and proliferation of tumor subpopulations. The long-term survival and proliferation of CLL cells requires their dynamic interactions with stromal and immune cells in lymphoid organs. Interactions of HA with CD44 and HA-mediated motility receptor (RHAMM) contribute to CLL cell localization, and hence CLL pathophysiology, by shaping homing, interstitial migration, and adhesion of the tumor cells. CD44 can complex with key prognostic factors of CLL, particularly CD38 and CD49d, bridging the gap between prognosis and cellular function.

However, resistance to immunotherapy due to loss of T-cell effector function remains a significant barrier, especially in solid malignancies. We describe an alternative chimeric immunoreceptor design in which we have fused a single-chain variable fragment for antigen recognition to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of KIR2DS2, a stimulatory killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR). We show that this simple, KIR-based CAR (KIR-CAR) triggers robust antigen-specific proliferation and effector function in vitro when introduced into human T cells with DAP12, an immunotyrosine-based activation motifs-containing adaptor.

We investigated the association between gene polymorphisms of the promoter region of IL-10 (-1082 G/A, IL-10-819 C/T, and -592 C/A) and the risk to develop myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and clinical features of MDS. Genomic DNA was extracted from 119 patients with MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and 202 healthy controls. Genotypes were determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. There were no statistically significant differences in the genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies of IL-10 -1082 G/A, IL-10-819 C/T, and -592 C/A between the patients with MDS and the control group. However, the IL-10 -592 CC genotype group (IL-10 high producer type) was associated with lower hemoglobin level (7.85 +/- 2.02 g/dL vs. 9.37 +/- 2.25 g/dL, P = 0.027) and poorer prognosis as compared to the IL-10 -592 non-CC genotype group (median survival time 50.2 m vs. not reached, p = 0.026). In addition, the IL-10 high producer haplotype group (GCC/ACC or ACC/ACC) was also associated with lower hemoglobin level and shorter survival time.

To evaluate the importance of glutaminase activity, we exploited a recently developed mutant of Helicobacter pylori ASNase (dm HpA), with amino acid substitutions M121C/T169M. The mutant form has the same asparaginase activity as wild-type but lacks glutaminase activity. Wild-type and dm HpA were compared with the clinically used ASNases from Escherichia coli (l-ASP) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ERWase). Asparaginase activity was similar for all isoforms, while glutaminase activity followed the rank order: ERWase>l-ASP>wild-type HpA>dm HpA. Cytotoxic efficacy of ASNases was tested on 11 human leukemia cell lines and two patient-derived ALL samples. Two cell lines which we had previously shown to be asparagine-dependent were equally sensitive to the asparaginase isoforms. The other nine lines and the two patient-derived samples were more sensitive to isoforms with higher glutaminase activities. ERWase was overall the most effective ASNase on all cell lines tested whereas dm HpA, having the lowest glutaminase activity, was the least effective. These data demonstrate that asparaginase activity alone may not be sufficient for ASNase cytotoxicity, and that glutaminase activity may be required for full anti-leukemic efficacy.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Granulocyte production increases following infection or in response to cytokine stimulation, and activation of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) transcription factor is required for such stress-induced granulopoiesis, whereas C/EBPalpha plays a critical role in maintaining steady-state granulopoiesis. Different roles of these C/EBP transcription factors in different modes of hematopoiesis are evolutionally conserved from zebrafish to humans. In addition to reactions against infections, C/EBPbeta is responsible for cancer-driven myelopoiesis, which promotes cancer progression, at least in part, by abrogating the immune response in the cancer microenvironment. The BCR-ABL fusion protein activates emergency-specific pathway of granulopoiesis by upregulating C/EBPbeta. This in turn causes chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia, which is characterized by myeloid expansion. The C/EBPbeta transcription factor also plays a role in other hematological malignancies of both myeloid and lymphoid lineage origin. Thus, elucidation of the upstream and downstream networks surrounding C/EBPbeta will lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases mediated by non-steady-state hematopoiesis.","['(c) 2015 The Authors.

In particular, the functional silencing of antigen-experienced T cells, called T cell exhaustion, has become implicated in immune evasion in CLL. In this study, we tested whether T cell exhaustion is recapitulated in the TCL1(tg) mouse model for CLL. We show that T cells express high levels of the inhibitory exhaustion markers programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1, also termed PD-1) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), whereas CLL cells express high levels of CD274 (also termed PD-ligand 1). In addition, the fraction of exhausted T cells increases with CLL progression. Finally, we demonstrate that exhausted T cells are reinvigorated towards CLL cytotoxicity by inhibition of PDCD1/CD274 interaction in vivo. These results suggest that T cell exhaustion contributes to CLL pathogenesis and that interference with PDCD1/CD274 signalling holds high potential for therapeutic approaches.","['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Previous single-center studies have demonstrated similar survival after unmanipulated haploidentical donor (HID) vs ISD HSCT for hematologic malignancies. To test the hypothesis that haploidentical HSCT would be a valid option as postremission therapy for AML patients in CR1 lacking a matched donor, we designed a disease-specific, prospective, multicenter study. Between July 2010 and November 2013, 450 patients were assigned to undergo HID (231 patients) or ISD HSCT (219 patients) according to donor availability. Among HID and ISD recipients, the 3-year disease-free survival rate was 74% and 78% (P = .34), respectively; the overall survival rate was 79% and 82% (P = .36), respectively; cumulative incidences of relapse were 15% and 15% (P = .98); and those of the nonrelapse-mortality were 13% and 8% (P = .13), respectively. In conclusion, unmanipulated haploidentical HSCT achieves outcomes similar to those of ISD HSCT for AML patients in CR1.

Its role in hematologic malignancies and, in particular, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is completely unknown. Here, we showed that SOX7 expression was regulated by DNA hypermethylation in AML but not in acute lymphoblastic leukemia or normal bone marrow cells. In cell lines (KG1, ML2, and K562) and in primary CD34(+) AML samples, SOX7 expression could be induced by the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Overexpression of SOX7 in K562 cells inhibited cell proliferation, with cell cycle delay in S/G2/M phases and reduced clonogenic activity. Apoptosis was unaffected. Ectopic expression of SOX7 in K562 and THP-1 cells, as well as primary CD33(+)CD34(+) AML cells, abrogated leukemia engraftment in xenogeneic transplantation. SOX7 expression inhibited the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway through direct protein binding to beta-catenin, and the antileukemia effects of SOX7 in THP-1 cells were significantly reduced by deletion of its beta-catenin binding site.

We postulated that the tumor microenvironment suppresses CAR-expressing T cells (CARTs) through the activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an intracellular enzyme that converts tryptophan into metabolites that inhibit T -: cell activity. To investigate the effects of tumor IDO on CD19-CART therapy, we used a xenograft lymphoma model expressing IDO as a transgene. CD19-CARTs inhibited IDO-negative tumor growth but had no effect on IDO-positive tumors. An IDO inhibitor (1-methyl-tryptophan) restored IDO-positive tumor control. Moreover, tryptophan metabolites inhibited interleukin (IL)-2-, IL-7-, and IL-15-dependent expansion of CARTs; diminished their proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine secretion in vitro in response to CD19 recognition; and increased their apoptosis. Inhibition of CD19-CARTs was not mitigated by the incorporation of costimulatory domains, such as 4-1BB, into the CD19-CAR. Finally, we found that fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, frequently used before CART administration, downregulated IDO expression in lymphoma cells and improved the antitumor activity of CD19-CART in vivo.

JAK2 I682F genetic mutation existed in the 4-8% of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, roles of this mutation in the development of B-ALL are still unknown. In order to investigation the mechanism of the JAK2 I682F mutation led to B-ALL, series of mutations were constructed. Mutations I682F, I682G, I682D and I682S significantly increased JAK2's activity and decreased its structural stability, while the I682L mutation almost had no effect on JAK2's activity and structural stability. Furthermore, the spectroscopic experiments implied that mutations I682F, I682G, I682D and I682S impaired the structure of JAK2 JH2 domain, and led JAK2 to the partially unfolded state. It may be this partially unfolded state that caused JAK2 I682F constitutive activation.

Invariably, patients have to self-finance their therapy. ""Out-of-pocket"" expenses tend to be high. Also, parents may face loss of job or business resulting in loss of income. Our objective was to assess the financial burden in families with a child with cancer. PROCEDURE: The cost to a family with a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during the first month of therapy was analyzed. Fifty families were given a cost diary in which details of expenditure (direct medical costs, living costs, transport cost) and lost income/employment were recorded. RESULTS: The families evaluated came from a distance of 260 +/- 218 km from hospital. Most families belonged to upper lower category (62%). The medical expenditure amounted to US dollar (USD) 524 (interquartile range (IQR) 395-777). Nonmedical expenditure was USD 207 (IQR 142-293), the maximum expenditure being on food. The monthly expenses were 7.2 times the monthly per capita income of India which was Indian rupee (INR) 5729 (USD 97) in 2012-2013. Thirty-nine families got financial help (USD 800-3225) from various sources, within 6 months of application. Of the families, 72% families suffered loss of income, 34% fathers lost their jobs. CONCLUSIONS: Families spend up to seven times their monthly income over a period of 1 month on an unforeseen illness. Despite financial aid from various sources, nonmedical costs amount to nearly 2.5 times the average per capita income.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The pathology database at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) was used to find patients with MIPG who underwent a kidney biopsy between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2013. Retrospective medical record review was conducted in the identified cohort (N=60). RESULTS: The median patient age was 56 years (interquartile range, 47-62 years) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 36 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (interquartile range, 22-52 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Most patients had IgG MIg deposits (90%; 54 of 60) and a membranoproliferative pattern (48%; 29 of 60). A circulating nephropathic MIg was detected by serum immunofixation (SIFE(+)) in 20% (12 of 59) and by abnormal serum free light chain ratio (sFLCR(+)) in 21% (12 of 56). The subsets of SIFE(+) and sFLCR(+) incompletely overlapped. The nephropathic clone was found by bone marrow testing (BM(+)) in 25% (10 of 40; 6 plasma cell clones [5 IgG; 1 IgA], 3 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [all IgG], and 1 lymphoplasmacytic clone [IgM]). The clone detection rate was significantly higher in patients with SIFE(+) (P<.001) and in those with SIFE(+) and/or sFLCR(+) (P<.001). Patients with SIFE(+) and BM(+) frequently had IgG1-restricted MIg deposits on renal biopsy immunofluorescence (P=.005). Most BM(+) patients required flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis of the marrow specimen for accurate diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Undetectable circulating nephropathic MIg and pathologic clones characterize most MIPG. Immunoglobulin isotype may predict detectability of MIg and clone by currently available technology. Bone marrow evaluation, including flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis, should be performed for SIFE(+) and/or sFLCR(+). More sensitive clone-identifying techniques in the marrow and extramedullary tissue are needed when SIFE and sFLCR test negative.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Some genetic polymorphisms can predict treatment-related toxicity, and be used individually in dose modification of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and methotrexate (MTX) in maintenance therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We investigated associations between clinical course and candidate gene polymorphisms less evaluated in Japanese patients. METHODS: Fifty-three children who received maintenance chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. The scheduled dose of oral 6-MP was 40 mg/m(2) daily and that of oral MTX was 25 mg/m(2) weekly. The doses were adjusted according to white blood cell count (target range, 2.5-3.5 x 10(9) /L) and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase level (< 750 IU/L). Eight polymorphisms in six candidate genes, TPMT, ITPA, MRP4, MTHFR, RFC1, and SLCO1B1, were genotyped using the Taqman PCR method. Clinical course was reviewed retrospectively from medical records. RESULTS: The average dose of 6-MP was lower in the patients with at least one variant allele at SLCO1B1 c.521 T > C than in the patients with wild homozygous genotype. The other analyzed polymorphisms were not associated with toxicity, 6-MP, or MTX dose. CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphism of SLCO1B1 c.521 T > C could be a strong predictor of 6-MP dose reduction in maintenance chemotherapy in childhood ALL.",['(c) 2015 Japan Pediatric Society.'],"['Suzuki, Ryoko', 'Fukushima, Hiroko', 'Noguchi, Emiko', 'Tsuchida, Masahiro', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Koike, Kazutoshi', 'Ma, Enbo', 'Takahashi, Hideto', 'Kobayashi, Chie', 'Nakajima-Yamaguchi, Ryoko', 'Sakai, Aiko', 'Saito, Makoto', 'Iwabuchi, Atsushi', 'Kato, Keisuke', 'Nakao, Tomohei', 'Yoshimi, Ai', 'Sumazaki, Ryo', 'Fukushima, Takashi']","['Suzuki R', 'Fukushima H', 'Noguchi E', 'Tsuchida M', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Koike K', 'Ma E', 'Takahashi H', 'Kobayashi C', 'Nakajima-Yamaguchi R', 'Sakai A', 'Saito M', 'Iwabuchi A', 'Kato K', 'Nakao T', 'Yoshimi A', 'Sumazaki R', 'Fukushima T']","['Department of Child Health, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences.', 'Departments of Child Health.', 'Genetics.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Ibaraki."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Ibaraki."", 'Clinical Trial and Clinical Epidemiology and.', 'Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.', 'School of Medicine, Information Management and Statistics, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Departments of Child Health.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Tsukuba.', 'Department of Child Health, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences.', 'Departments of Child Health.', 'Departments of Child Health.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Ibaraki."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Ibaraki."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Ibaraki."", 'Departments of Child Health.', 'Departments of Child Health.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1)', '0 (SLCO1B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine', 'SLCO1B1', 'childhood', 'leukemia', 'methotrexate', 'polymorphism']",2015/05/06 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ped.12682 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2015 Aug;57(4):572-7. doi: 10.1111/ped.12682.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While older patients represent the majority of those with newly diagnosed disease, there remains no consensus regarding optimal therapy. Older age is associated with increased risk of treatment-related toxicity and worse survival compared to younger adults. Age-related outcome disparity in the setting of AML therapy is clearly attributed in part to differences in tumor biology conferring resistance to therapy. However, physiologic changes of aging that decrease treatment tolerance also influence outcomes and vary among patients of the same chronologic age. Measurable patient characteristics such as comorbidity and physical function can reflect the heterogeneity of physiologic aging among older patients and help predict resilience during and after the stress of diagnosis and treatment. To improve outcomes for older adults with AML, it will be critical to investigate the predictive utility of patient characteristics in parallel with tumor biology to improve decision-making, inform trial design, and identify actionable targets for supportive care interventions.

In this study, we explored the effect and underlying molecular mechanism of JARID2 on leukemia cell proliferation. Real-time PCR and Western assay were carried out to detect JARID2 and CCND1 expression. Cell number and cell cycle change were detected using hemocytometer and flow cytometry, and a ChIP assay was utilized to investigate JARID2 and H3K27me3 enrichment on the CCND1 promoter. JARID2 is down-regulated in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and acute monocytic leukemia (AMOL), and knockdown of JARID2 promotes leukemia cell proliferation via acceleration of the G1/S transition. Conversely, ectopic expression of JARID2 inhibits these malignant phenotypes. Mechanistic studies show that JARID2 negatively regulates CCND1 expression by increasing H3K27 trimethylation on the CCND1 promoter.

Somatic and germline variants in CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene) have been associated with JMML. We report an incompletely penetrant CBL Y371C mutation discovered by whole-exome sequencing in three individuals with JMML in a large pedigree with 35 years of follow-up. The Y371 residue is highly evolutionarily conserved among CBL orthologs and paralogs. In silico bioinformatics prediction programs suggested that the Y371C mutation is highly deleterious. Protein structural modeling revealed that the Y371C mutation abrogated the ability of the CBL protein to adopt a conformation that is required for ubiquitination. Clinically, the three mutation-positive JMML individuals exhibited variable clinical courses; in two out of three, primary hematologic abnormalities persisted into adulthood with minimal clinical symptoms. The penetrance of the CBL Y371C mutation was 30% for JMML and 40% for all leukemia. Of the 8 mutation carriers in the family with available photographs, only one had significant dysmorphic features; we found no evidence of a clinical phenotype consistent with a ""CBL syndrome"".

In the current study, we aimed to examine whether SIN is capable of inducing the degranulation of basophilic leukemia 2H3 (RBL-2H3) cells to elucidate how the anaphylactic reaction occurs. The results revealed that SIN could up-regulate beta-hexosaminidase levels in RBL-2H3 cells without significant cytotoxicity, suggesting that SIN could induce the degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells. Furthermore, SIN increased the release of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in RBL-2H3 cells via promoting the expression of phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (P-ERK), the cleavage of Annexin A1 (ANXA1), and phosphorylated-cytosolic phospholipase A2 (P-cPLA2), as well as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The ERK inhibitor, PD98059, significantly attenuated the up-regulatory effect of SIN on cPLA2 phosphorylation. Interestingly, SIN did not significantly increase Ca(2+) influx in the cells.

To elucidate mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance, we determined the prednisolone sensitivity of primary leukemia cells from 444 patients newly diagnosed with ALL and found significantly higher expression of CASP1 (encoding caspase 1) and its activator NLRP3 in glucocorticoid-resistant leukemia cells, resulting from significantly lower somatic methylation of the CASP1 and NLRP3 promoters. Overexpression of CASP1 resulted in cleavage of the glucocorticoid receptor, diminished the glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional response and increased glucocorticoid resistance. Knockdown or inhibition of CASP1 significantly increased glucocorticoid receptor levels and mitigated glucocorticoid resistance in CASP1-overexpressing ALL. Our findings establish a new mechanism by which the NLRP3-CASP1 inflammasome modulates cellular levels of the glucocorticoid receptor and diminishes cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids. The broad impact on the glucocorticoid transcriptional response suggests that this mechanism could also modify glucocorticoid effects in other diseases.",,"['Paugh, Steven W', 'Bonten, Erik J', 'Savic, Daniel', 'Ramsey, Laura B', 'Thierfelder, William E', 'Gurung, Prajwal', 'Malireddi, R K Subbarao', 'Actis, Marcelo', 'Mayasundari, Anand', 'Min, Jaeki', 'Coss, David R', 'Laudermilk, Lucas T', 'Panetta, John C', 'McCorkle, J Robert', 'Fan, Yiping', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Stocco, Gabriele', 'Wilkinson, Mark R', 'Ferreira, Antonio M', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Karol, Seth E', 'Fernandez, Christian A', 'Diouf, Barthelemy', 'Smith, Colton', 'Hicks, J Kevin', 'Zanut, Alessandra', 'Giordanengo, Audrey', 'Crona, Daniel', 'Bianchi, Joy J', 'Holmfeldt, Linda', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Dunwell, Thomas L', 'Latif, Farida', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Carroll, William L', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Myers, Richard M', 'Guy, R Kiplin', 'Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Evans, William E']","['Paugh SW', 'Bonten EJ', 'Savic D', 'Ramsey LB', 'Thierfelder WE', 'Gurung P', 'Malireddi RK', 'Actis M', 'Mayasundari A', 'Min J', 'Coss DR', 'Laudermilk LT', 'Panetta JC', 'McCorkle JR', 'Fan Y', 'Crews KR', 'Stocco G', 'Wilkinson MR', 'Ferreira AM', 'Cheng C', 'Yang W', 'Karol SE', 'Fernandez CA', 'Diouf B', 'Smith C', 'Hicks JK', 'Zanut A', 'Giordanengo A', 'Crona D', 'Bianchi JJ', 'Holmfeldt L', 'Mullighan CG', 'den Boer ML', 'Pieters R', 'Jeha S', 'Dunwell TL', 'Latif F', 'Bhojwani D', 'Carroll WL', 'Pui CH', 'Myers RM', 'Guy RK', 'Kanneganti TD', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE']","[""1] Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

Since rAML is considered to originate from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), we investigated the frequency and spectrum of radiation-induced chromosomal abnormalities in human CD34(+) cells. We then measured stable chromosomal abnormalities, a possible biomarker of leukemia risk, in clonally expanded cell populations which were grown for 14 days in a 3D-matrix (CFU-assay). We compared two radiation qualities used in radiotherapy, sparsely ionizing X-rays and densely ionizing carbon ions (29 and 60-85 keV/mum, doses between 0.5 and 4 Gy). Only a negligible number of de novo arising, unstable aberrations (</= 0.05 aberrations/cell, 97% breaks) were measured in the descendants of irradiated HSPC. However, stable aberrations were detected in colonies formed by irradiated HSPC. All cells of the affected colonies exhibited one or more identical aberrations, indicating their clonal origin. The majority of the clonal rearrangements (92%) were simple exchanges such as translocations (77%) and pericentric inversions (15%), which are known to contribute to the development of rAML. Carbon ions were more efficient in inducing cell killing (maximum of approximately 30-35% apoptotic cells for 2 Gy carbon ions compared to approximately 25% for X-rays) and chromosomal aberrations in the first cell-cycle after exposure ( approximately 70% and approximately 40% for 1 Gy of carbon ions and X-rays, respectively), with a higher fraction of non-transmissible aberrations. In contrast, for both radiation qualities the percentage of clones with chromosomal abnormalities was similar (40%). Using the frequency of colonies with clonal aberrations as a surrogate marker for the leukemia risk following radiotherapy of solid tumors, charged particle therapy is not expected to lead to an increased risk of leukemia in patients.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the QOL of leukemia patients allografted with the Mexican reduced-intensity conditioning regimen in two Mexican academic medical centers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: By means of the quality metric short form 36 version 2 to measure generic health concepts, relevant QOL was analyzed in leukemia patients who underwent allo-HCT using reduced-intensity conditioning on an outpatient basis at either the Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla of the Clinica Ruiz or the Hematology Service of the Internal Medicine Department of the Hospital ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez"" of the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, and who had survived more than 12 months after the allograft, who could be approached, who were in a continued complete remission (with or without graft-versus-host disease), and who were willing to respond to the questionnaire. Thirty-five patients fulfilling these requirements were included, and a sex- and age-matched group of 35 reference subjects was also studied. RESULTS: Allografted patients were found to have a slightly better mental component summary than the reference subjects (53.23 vs. 48.66 points; p = 0.01), whereas the physical component summary did not show a difference (54.53 vs. 52.05 points; p = 0.59). Most of the differences between allografted individuals and reference subject controls were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Despite several sources of bias, these data suggest that allografted individuals employing the Mexican reduced-intensity conditioning regimen enjoy a health-related QOL life similar to that of reference subjects, adding another advantage of this method of conducting stem cell allografts. However, more work needs to be done to elucidate the impact of reduced-intensity conditioning on post allo-HCT QOL.",,"['Gonzalez-Ramirez, Monica P', 'Miravete-Lagunes, Karla', 'Gomez-de-Leon, Andres', 'Ponce-de-Leon, Sergio', 'Tenorio-Rojo, Andrea P', 'Martagon-Herrera, Nora A', 'Hernandez-Reyes, Jesus A', 'Garcia-Villasenor, Arturo', 'Burguette, Esteban', 'Vallejo-Villalobos, Maria Fernanda', 'Ruiz-Delgado, Guillermo J', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, Guillermo J']","['Gonzalez-Ramirez MP', 'Miravete-Lagunes K', 'Gomez-de-Leon A', 'Ponce-de-Leon S', 'Tenorio-Rojo AP', 'Martagon-Herrera NA', 'Hernandez-Reyes JA', 'Garcia-Villasenor A', 'Burguette E', 'Vallejo-Villalobos MF', 'Ruiz-Delgado GJ', 'Gomez-Almaguer D', 'Ruiz-Arguelles GJ']","['Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna, Clinica RUIZ, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Universidad de las Americas Puebla, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Universidad de las Americas Puebla, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Hospital Universitario ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez"", Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, N.L., Mexico.', 'Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico, D.F., Mexico.', 'Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico, D.F., Mexico.', 'Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna, Clinica RUIZ, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Universidad de las Americas Puebla, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna, Clinica RUIZ, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Universidad Popular Autonoma del Estado de Puebla, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna, Clinica RUIZ, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Universidad del Valle de Mexico, Campus Villahermosa, Tabasco, Tab., Mexico.', 'Universidad de las Americas Puebla, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Universidad de las Americas Puebla, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Universidad Popular Autonoma del Estado de Puebla, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Laboratorios Clinicos de Puebla, Clinica RUIZ, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna, Clinica RUIZ, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Universidad Popular Autonoma del Estado de Puebla, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Laboratorios Clinicos de Puebla, Clinica RUIZ, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Hospital Universitario ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez"", Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, N.L., Mexico.', 'Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna, Clinica RUIZ, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Universidad Popular Autonoma del Estado de Puebla, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Universidad de las Americas Puebla, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.', 'Laboratorios Clinicos de Puebla, Clinica RUIZ, Puebla, Pue., Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,,IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/05/06 06:00,2015/05/06 06:01,['2015/05/05 06:00'],"['2015/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2015 Mar-Apr;67(2):109-16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human acute myeloid leukemia cases, the enhancer lacks point mutations but binds the RUNX1-ETO oncoprotein. The enhancer contains the H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac histone modifications, denoting an active enhancer, at progressively increasing levels as long-term hematopoietic stem cells transition to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. We previously identified four enhancer sites that bind RUNX1 and demonstrated that their integrity is required for maximal enhancer activity in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The +37 kb Cebpa enhancer also contains C/EBP, Ets factor, Myb, GATA, and E-box consensus sites conserved in the human +42 kb CEBPA enhancer. Mutation of the two C/EBP, seven Ets, one Myb, two GATA, or two E-box sites reduces activity of an enhancer-promoter reporter in 32Dcl3 cells. In 293T gel shift assays, exogenous C/EBPalpha binds both C/EBP sites, c-Myb binds the Myb site, PU.1 binds the second Ets site, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, and Ets1 bind the sixth Ets site, GATA2 binds both GATA sites, and SCL binds the second E-box. Endogenous hematopoietic RUNX1, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, C/EBPalpha, GATA2, and SCL were previously shown to bind the enhancer, and we find that endogenous PU.1 binds the second Ets site in 32Dcl3 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed 32Dcl3 lines in which the wild-type enhancer alleles are replaced with a variant mutant in the seven Ets sites. These lines have 20-fold reduced Cebpa mRNA when cultured in IL-3 or G-CSF, demonstrating a critical requirement for enhancer integrity for optimal Cebpa expression.

We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of MDS patients at Samsung Medical Center between August 2008 and August 2011. The response assessment was conducted using the International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for MDS. We analyzed 101 MDS patients (total 613 cycles) who received decitabine for a median of four cycles. The overall response was 52.5% (n = 53/101). The median time to any response was two cycles with the median overall survival of 16.7 months. Patients who showed hematologic improvement had significantly longer survival than those who did not (9.8 vs. 22.9 months, p = 0.004). The difference in OS was evident in the Intermediate-2/High risk group (p = 0.002) but not in the Intermediate-1 risk group (p = 0.145). Multivariate analysis confirmed that platelet response (no platelet transfusions for at least 3 days) during the second cycle of treatment was an independent predictor for response, OS and Leukemia free survival.

We and others have previously documented that the uPAR88-92 sequence, even in the form of synthetic linear peptide (SRSRY), interacts with the formyl peptide receptor type 1 (FPR1), henceforth inducing cell migration of several cell lines, including monocytes. FPR1 is mainly expressed by mammalian phagocytic leukocytes and plays a crucial role in chemotaxis. In this study, we present evidence that the cyclization of the SRSRY sequence generates a new potent and stable inhibitor of monocyte trafficking. In rat basophilic leukaemia RBL-2H3/ETFR cells expressing high levels of constitutively activated FPR1, the cyclic SRSRY peptide ([SRSRY]) blocks FPR1 mediated cell migration by interfering with both internalization and ligand-uptake of FPR1. Similarly to RBL-2H3/ETFR cells, [SRSRY] competes with fMLF for binding to FPR1 and prevents agonist-induced FPR1 internalization in human monocyte THP-1 cells. Unlike scramble [RSSYR], [SRSRY] inhibits fMLF-directed migration of monocytes in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 value of 0.01 nM. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cell exposure to fMLF gradient causes a marked cytoskeletal re-organization with the formation of F-actin rich pseudopodia that are prevented by the addition of [SRSRY]. Furthermore, [SRSRY] prevents migration of human primary monocytes and trans-endothelial migration of monocytes. Our findings indicate that [SRSRY] is a new FPR1 inhibitor which may suggest the development of new drugs for treating pathological conditions sustained by increased motility of monocytes, such as chronic inflammatory diseases.",,"['Yousif, Ali Munaim', 'Minopoli, Michele', 'Bifulco, Katia', 'Ingangi, Vincenzo', 'Di Carluccio, Gioconda', 'Merlino, Francesco', 'Motti, Maria Letizia', 'Grieco, Paolo', 'Carriero, Maria Vincenza']","['Yousif AM', 'Minopoli M', 'Bifulco K', 'Ingangi V', 'Di Carluccio G', 'Merlino F', 'Motti ML', 'Grieco P', 'Carriero MV']","['Department of Pharmacy, University Federico II, Naples, Italy.', 'Neoplastic Progression Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori ""Fondazione G.

Histopathologic scores and adhesion scores of endometriotic foci and levels of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), Cytochrome c (Cyt-c), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl) mRNA gene expressions of endometriotic foci. Bevacizumab treatment decreased the endometriotic explant size compared with control. Bevacizumab-treated rats had lower total adhesion scores when compared with the control group. Semi-quantitative evaluation of the persistence of endometrial epithelial cells in the explants showed a lower score in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist-treated rats compared with control rats. In Bevacizumab increased expression of Bax 3.1-fold, Cyt-c 1.3-fold and decreased expression of Bcl-2 0.4-fold, Bcl-xl 0.8-fold compared with the control group.

The combination of rituximab with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FCR) significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone in first-line treatment of CLL. However, because of its high toxicity, FCR is only recommended for younger, fit patients who can tolerate the treatment. This excludes a large fraction of CLL patients who are elderly and/or who have comorbidities. Thus, determining the appropriate treatment choices for this group of patients who are unfit for FCR treatment is a significant challenge in CLL. Current treatment choices in Canadian practice include bendamustine with rituximab, fludarabine with rituximab, and chlorambucil with rituximab. Two novel monoclonal antibodies, ofatumumab and obinutuzumab, have also recently received Health Canada approval for the first-line treatment of CLL patients in combination with chlorambucil. In addition, the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ibrutinib, has recently been approved by Health Canada for the first-line treatment of CLL patients with deletion 17p. In the coming years, several other novel agents that are being developed are likely to change the CLL treatment landscape dramatically, however, because these novel agents are currently unavailable, the purpose of this review is to recommend the best treatment approaches in Canada using currently available therapies.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Mitochondrial dynamics participate in the response to various stresses, and mainly involve mitophagy and mitochondrial fusion and fission. Bcl-2 family proteins play critical roles in orchestrating mitochondrial dynamics, and are involved in the resistance to cisplatin. Here we reported that ABT737, combined with cisplatin, can promote cholangiocarcinoma cells to undergo apoptosis. We found that the combined treatment decreased the Mcl-1 pro-survival form and increased Bak. Cells undergoing cisplatin treatment showed hyperfused mitochondria, whereas fragmentation was dominant in the mitochondria of cells exposed to the combined treatment, with higher Fis1 levels, decreased Mfn2 and OPA1 levels, increased ratio of Drp1 60kD to 80kD form, and more Drp1 located on mitochondria. More p62 aggregates were observed in cells with fragmented mitochondria, and they gradually translocated to mitochondria. Mitophagy was induced by the combined treatment. Knockdown p62 decreased the Drp1 ratio, increased Tom20, and increased cell viability. Our data indicated that mitochondrial dynamics play an important role in the response of cholangiocarcinoma to cisplatin.

Targeted delivery of chemotherapy drugs could reduce their side effects and increase the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs. Biocompatibility and large surface area of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) make these nanoparticles great candidates for biomedical applications. In this study sgc8c aptamer (Apt)-Dau-AuNPs complex was designed and evaluated for treatment of Molt-4 cells (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-cell, target). Apt-Dau-AuNPs complex formation was analyzed by fluorometric analysis and gel retardation assay. Dau release profiles from the complex were evaluated in pHs 5.5 and 7.4. For cytotoxic studies (MTT assay) U266 (B lymphocyte human myeloma, nontarget) and Molt-4 cells (target) were treated with Dau Apt-Dau conjugate and Apt-Dau-AuNPs complex. Internalization was monitored by flow cytometry and confocal imaging. 12 muM Dau was efficiently loaded onto 1 mL of Apt-modified AuNPs. Dau was released from the complex in a pH-dependent manner (higher rate of release at pH 5.5). The results of flow cytometry analysis and confocal imaging showed that the complex was effectively internalized into Molt-4 cells, but not into U266 cells. The results of MTT assay also confirmed the internalization data. Apt-Dau-AuNPs complex was less cytotoxic in U266 cells compared to Dau alone and even Apt-Dau conjugate. The complex was more cytotoxic in target cells in comparison with Dau alone and even Apt-Dau conjugate. In conclusion, Apt-Dau-AuNPs complex was able to selectively target Molt-4 cells. Another advantage of this system was pH-dependent release of drug from the complex.

Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (EPS8), whose function is pivotal for tumor proliferation, progression and metastasis, has been found to be overexpressed in most human tumor types, while its expression in normal tissue is low. The aim of the present study was to identify human leukemia antigen (HLA)-A*0201-restricted epitopes of EPS8 by using a reverse immunology approach. To achieve this, computer algorithms were used to predict HLA-A*0201 molecular binding, proteasome cleavage patterns as well as translocation of transporters associated with antigen processing. Candidate peptides were experimentally validated by T2 binding affinity assay and brefeldin-A decay assay. The functional avidity of peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) induced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers were evaluated by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay and a cytotoxicity assay. Four peptides, designated as P455, P92, P276 and P360, had high affinity and stability of binding towards the HLA-A*0201 molecule, and specific CTLs induced by them significantly responded to the corresponding peptides and secreted IFN-gamma. At the same time, the CTLs were able to specifically lyse EPS8-expressing cell lines in an HLA-A*0201-restricted manner.

However, the mechanisms of the perturbed TCL1A regulation are largely unknown. To characterize TCL1A-upstream networks, we functionally screened for TCL1A-repressive micro-RNAs (miRs) and their transcriptional regulators. We identified the novel miR-484 to target TCL1A's 3'-UTR and to be downregulated in CLL. In chromatin immunoprecipitations and reporter assays, the oncogenic transcription factor of myeloid cells, EVI1, bound and activated the miR-484 promoter. Most common in CLL was a pan-EVI1 transcript variant. EVI1 protein expression revealed distinct normal-tissue and leukemia-associated patterns of EVI1/TCL1A co-regulation. EVI1 levels were particularly low in TCL1A-high CLL or such cellular subsets. Global gene expression profiles from a 337-patient set linked EVI1 networks to BCR signaling and cell survival via TCL1A, BTK and other molecules of relevance in CLL.

The leukemic plasmacytoid dendritic cell line PMDC05 containing the HLA-A02/24 antigen, which was previously established in our laboratory (Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan), was used in the present study. It exhibited higher expression levels of CD80 following transduction with lentiviruses encoding the CD80 gene. This CD80-expressing PMDC05 was named PMDC11. In order to establish a more potent antigen-presenting cell for cellular immunotherapy of tumors or severe infections, PMDC11 cells were transduced with a constitutively active (ca) toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene using the Tet-On system (caTLR4-PMDC11). CD8(+) T cells from healthy donors with HLA-A02 were co-cultured with mutant WT1 peptide-pulsed PMDC11, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated PMDC11 or caTLR4-PMDC11 cells. Interleukin (IL)-2 (50 IU/ml) and IL-7 (10 ng/ml) were added on day three of culture. Priming with mutant WT1 peptide-pulsed PMDC11, LPS-stimulated PMDC11 or caTLR4-PMDC11 cells was conducted once per week and two thirds of the IL-2/IL-7 containing medium was replenished every 3-4 days. Immediately prior to the priming with these various PMDC11 cells, the cultured cells were analyzed for the secretion of interferon (IFN)-gamma in addition to the percentage and number of CD8(+)/WT1 tetramer(+) T cells using flow cytometry. caTLR4-PMDC11 cells were observed to possess greater antigen-presenting abilities compared with those of PMDC11 or LPS-stimulated PMDC11 cells in a mixed leukocyte culture. CD8 T cells positive for the WT1 tetramer were generated following 3-4 weeks of culture and CD8(+)/WT1 tetramer+ T cells were markedly increased in caTLR4-PMDC11-primed CD8(+) T cell culture compared with PMDC11 or LPS-stimulated PMDC11-primed CD8(+) T cell culture. These CD8(+) T cells co-cultured with caTLR4-PMDC11 cells were demonstrated to secrete IFN-gamma and to be cytotoxic to WT1-expressing target cells. These data suggested that the antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-inducing ability of PMDC11 was potentiated via transduction of the caTLR4 gene. The present study also suggested that caTLR4-PMDC11 cells may be applied as potent antigen-presenting cells for generating antigen-specific CTLs in adoptive cellular immunotherapy against tumors and severe viral infections.",,"['Iwabuchi, Minami', 'Narita, Miwako', 'Uchiyama, Takayoshi', 'Iwaya, Shunpei', 'Oiwa, Eri', 'Nishizawa, Yoshinori', 'Hashimoto, Shigeo', 'Bonehill, Aude', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki', 'Takizawa, Jun', 'Takahashi, Masuhiro']","['Iwabuchi M', 'Narita M', 'Uchiyama T', 'Iwaya S', 'Oiwa E', 'Nishizawa Y', 'Hashimoto S', 'Bonehill A', 'Kasahara N', 'Takizawa J', 'Takahashi M']","['Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, Nagaoka, Niigata 9518518, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, Nagaoka, Niigata 9518518, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, Nagaoka, Niigata 9518518, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, Nagaoka, Niigata 9518518, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, Nagaoka, Niigata 9518518, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, Nagaoka, Niigata 9518518, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, Nagaoka, Niigata 9518518, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Therapy, Department of Physiology and Immunology, Medical School of the Free University Brussels (VUB), Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.', 'CURE Vector Core & JCCC Vector Shared Resource Facility, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University, Niigata 9518510, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, Nagaoka, Niigata 9518518, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150424,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (IL7 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics/immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Vectors/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-A Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*genetics/immunology', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'WT1 Proteins/pharmacology']",,,2015/05/06 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/05/05 06:00'],"['2014/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr.2015.3685 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2015 Aug;12(2):2443-50. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2015.3685.

The serum level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) is known to reflect the immune activity and tumour volume in aggressive NHL; however, the release of sIL-2R in LBL has not been extensively studied. Further, the relationship between sIL-2R release and the expression level of IL-2R alpha subunit (CD25) remains unknown. In the present study, we examined the serum level of sIL-2R in 23 patients with T lymphoblactic lymphoma (T-LBL) and compared these with the levels in 20 patient with T acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), 40 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 40 patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), not otherwise specified. The release of sIL-2R into the serum in patients with T-LBL was significantly lower than that for T-ALL, DLBCL and PTCL (p<0.001). Immunohistochemistry revealed that CD25 expression was correlated with the serum level of sIL-2R in T-LBL (p=0.0069), whereas no correlation was found to exist between serum sIL-2R levels and CD25 expression in patients with DLBCL (p=0.348) and PTCL (p=0.266). Furthermore, double immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CD25-positive cells were also found to be Foxp3-positive non-neoplastic T-cells. In conclusion, CD25-positive non-neoplastic T-cells in T-LBL are presumed to be the primary source of sIL-2R, and the low number of cells present results in a lower level of sIL-2R released into the serum compared with the other aggressive and highly aggressive lymphomas.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

We hypothesized that direct contact between ASM and CD4(+) T cells facilitated the transfer of anti-apoptotic proteins via nanotubes, resulting in increased survival of activated CD4(+) T cells. CD4(+) T cells, isolated from PBMCs of healthy subjects, when activated and cocultured with ASM cells for 24 h, formed nanotubes that were visualized by immunofluorescence and atomic force microscopy. Cell-to-cell transfer of the fluorescent dye calcein-AM confirmed cytoplasmic communication via nanotubes. Immunoreactive B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1), two major anti-apoptotic proteins, were present within the nanotubes. Downregulation of Mcl-1 by small interfering RNA in ASM cells significantly increased T cell apoptosis, whereas downregulation of Bcl-2 had no effect. Transfer of GFP-tagged Mcl-1 from ASM cells to CD4(+) T cells via the nanotubes confirmed directionality of transfer. In conclusion, activated T cells communicate with ASM cells via nanotube formation. Direct transfer of Mcl-1 from ASM to CD(+) T cells via nanotubes is involved in T cell survival.

CALR mutations account for approximately 30% of cases of essential thrombocythemia. In a retrospective study, we examined the frequency of MPL and CALR mutations in JAK2 V617F-negative cases of essential thrombocythemia (n=103). In addition, we compared the clinical phenotype and outcome of CALR mutant cases of essential thrombocythemia with a cohort of JAK2 V617F-positive essential thrombocythemia (n=57). CALR-positive cases represented 63.7% of double-negative cases of essential thrombocythemia, and most carried CALR type 1 or type 2 indels. However, we also identified one patient who was positive for both the JAK2 V617F and the CALR mutations. This study revealed that CALR mutant essential thrombocythemia is associated with younger age, higher platelet counts, lower erythrocyte counts, leukocyte counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, and increased risk of progression to myelofibrosis in comparison with JAK2 V617F-positive essential thrombocythemia. Analysis of the CALR mutant group according to indel type showed that CALR type 1 deletion is strongly associated with male gender. CALR mutant patients had a better overall survival than JAK2 V617F-positive patients, in particular patients of age 60 years or younger. In conclusion, this study in a Belgian cohort of patients supports and extends the growing body of evidence that CALR mutant cases of essential thrombocythemia are phenotypically distinct from JAK2 V617F-positive cases, with regards to clinical and hematologic presentation as well as overall survival.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Al Assaf, Carla', 'Van Obbergh, Florence', 'Billiet, Johan', 'Lierman, Els', 'Devos, Timothy', 'Graux, Carlos', 'Hervent, Anne-Sophie', 'Emmerechts, Jan', 'Tousseyn, Thomas', 'De Paepe, Pascale', 'Papadopoulos, Petros', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Vandenberghe, Peter']","['Al Assaf C', 'Van Obbergh F', 'Billiet J', 'Lierman E', 'Devos T', 'Graux C', 'Hervent AS', 'Emmerechts J', 'Tousseyn T', 'De Paepe P', 'Papadopoulos P', 'Michaux L', 'Vandenberghe P']","['Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, AZ -Jan, Brugge, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Mont-Godinne University Hospital, Yvoir, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, AZ -Jan, Brugge, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, AZ -Jan, Brugge, Belgium.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pathology, AZ Sint-Jan, Brugge, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium Department of Hematology, University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium peter.vandenberghe@uzleuven.be.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150501,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet Count', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications/*genetics/mortality/pathology']",,,2015/05/03 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/05/03 06:00'],"['2014/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.118299 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.118299 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Jul;100(7):893-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.118299.

Recently, CD37 has gained interest as a therapeutic target. We developed AGS67E, an antibody-drug conjugate that targets CD37 for the potential treatment of B/T-cell malignancies. It is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody (AGS67C) conjugated, via a protease-cleavable linker, to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). AGS67E induces potent cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell-cycle alterations in many non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell lines and patient-derived samples in vitro. It also shows potent antitumor activity in NHL and CLL xenografts, including Rituxan-refractory models. During profiling studies to confirm the reported expression of CD37 in normal tissues and B-cell malignancies, we made the novel discovery that the CD37 protein was expressed in T-cell lymphomas and in AML. AGS67E bound to >80% of NHL and T-cell lymphomas, 100% of CLL and 100% of AML patient-derived samples, including CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemic stem cells. It also induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell-cycle alterations in AML cell lines and antitumor efficacy in orthotopic AML xenografts. Taken together, this study shows not only that AGS67E may serve as a potential therapeutic for B/T-cell malignancies, but it also demonstrates, for the first time, that CD37 is well expressed and a potential drug target in AML.",['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Pereira, Daniel S', 'Guevara, Claudia I', 'Jin, Liqing', 'Mbong, Nathan', 'Verlinsky, Alla', 'Hsu, Ssucheng J', 'Avina, Hector', 'Karki, Sher', 'Abad, Joseph D', 'Yang, Peng', 'Moon, Sung-Ju', 'Malik, Faisal', 'Choi, Michael Y', 'An, Zili', 'Morrison, Kendall', 'Challita-Eid, Pia M', 'Donate, Fernando', 'Joseph, Ingrid B J', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Dick, John E', 'Stover, David R']","['Pereira DS', 'Guevara CI', 'Jin L', 'Mbong N', 'Verlinsky A', 'Hsu SJ', 'Avina H', 'Karki S', 'Abad JD', 'Yang P', 'Moon SJ', 'Malik F', 'Choi MY', 'An Z', 'Morrison K', 'Challita-Eid PM', 'Donate F', 'Joseph IB', 'Kipps TJ', 'Dick JE', 'Stover DR']","['Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California. dpereira@agensys.com.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, and Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, and Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of California, San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of California, San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, and Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Agensys Inc., an Affiliate of Astellas Pharma Inc., Santa Monica, California.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150501,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (AGS67E)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD37 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Tetraspanins)', 'V7I58RC5EJ (monomethyl auristatin E)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligopeptides/immunology/metabolism', 'Tetraspanins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2015/05/03 06:00,2016/05/11 06:00,['2015/05/03 06:00'],"['2015/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-15-0067 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0067 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2015 Jul;14(7):1650-60. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0067.

It nevertheless has a strong clinical and biological heterogeneity with rarer but very different symptoms (endocrinological anomalies, autoimmune disorders, obesity, etc.). Clinical diagnosis is difficult because it is based on a spectrum of clinical, radiological, and biological factors. Complications are numerous, sometimes interpenetrating, and early diagnosis of the disease is essential for optimal management. The development of genetic testing is therefore essential for the diagnosis of this disease. Recently, exome sequencing has helped identify two genes responsible for the disease: KMT2D (lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D, better known as MLL2 - mixed lineage leukemia), and KDM6A (lysine-specific demethylase 6A). Functional studies of these genes should help clarify their role in the pathogenesis of the disease, in particular to test the hypothesis of epigenetic changes during embryogenesis and development. Finally, understanding the interactions between KMT2D and its target genes could unravel other candidate genes for hitherto unexplained Kabuki syndrome cases.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the clinical aspects, cytogenetic abnormalities, molecular gene mutations and outcomes of adult AML patients with CNS involvement. Three hundred and ninety-five patients with newly diagnosed AML were reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty (5.1%) patients had CNS involvement, including 7 (1.8%) with initial CNS disease and 4 (1%) who suffered an isolated CNS relapse. The patients with CNS involvement were younger, had higher leukocyte, platelet, and peripheral blast cell counts, FAB M4 morphology, and chromosome translocations involving 11q23 (11q23 abnormalities) more frequently than did the patients without CNS involvement. No differences in sex, haemoglobin levels, serum LDH levels, immunophenotype of leukaemia cells, or molecular gene mutations were observed between the two groups. Multivariate analyses showed that age </= 45 years (OR, 5.933; 95% CI, 1.82 to 19.343), leukocyte counts >/= 50,000/mul (OR, 3.136; 95% CI, 1.083 to 9.078), and the presence of 11q23 abnormalities (OR, 5.548; 95% CI, 1.208 to 25.489) were significant predictors of CNS involvement. Patients with initial CNS disease had 5-year overall survival and relapse-free survival rates that were similar to those without initial CNS disease. However, three of four patients who suffered an isolated CNS relapse died, and their prognosis was as poor as that of patients who suffered a bone marrow relapse. CONCLUSION: CNS involvement in adult patients with AML is rare. Three significant risk factors for CNS involvement including age </= 45 years, leukocyte counts >/= 50,000/mul and the presence of 11q23 abnormalities were identified in this study. Future investigations to determine whether adult AML patients having these specific risk factors would benefit from CNS prophylactic therapy are necessary.",,"['Cheng, Chieh-Lung', 'Li, Chi-Cheng', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Fang, Wei-Quan', 'Chang, Chin-Hao', 'Lin, Chien-Ting', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Yao, Ming', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Cheng CL', 'Li CC', 'Hou HA', 'Fang WQ', 'Chang CH', 'Lin CT', 'Tang JL', 'Chou WC', 'Chen CY', 'Yao M', 'Huang SY', 'Ko BS', 'Wu SJ', 'Tsay W', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan. meteor.prince@msa.hinet.net.', 'Taicheng stem cell therapy center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. kevinlcc1234@gmail.com.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan. hsinanhou@gmail.com.', 'Taiwan Clinical Trial Bioinformatics and Statistical Center, Training Center, and Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Taipei, Taiwan. wqfang@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Medical Research, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. chinhao@ntuh.gov.tw.', 'Taicheng stem cell therapy center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. antony.lin@ylhealth.org.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan. tangjh@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan. wchou@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. wchou@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan. cjy5988@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan. yaoming@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan. sy551225@ms7.hinet.net.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan. kevinkomd@gmail.com.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan. no_bighead@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan. woei@ntuh.gov.tw.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 100, Taiwan. hftien@ntu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150502,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/complications/*pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/complications/*pathology', '*Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2015/05/03 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/05/03 06:00'],"['2014/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-015-1376-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-015-1376-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2015 May 2;15:344. doi: 10.1186/s12885-015-1376-9.,,PMC4419415,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low-dose cytarabine can be combined with valproic acid and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as AML-stabilizing treatment. We have investigated the possible risk of immunotoxicity by this combination. We examined the effects of cytarabine combined with valproic acid and ATRA on in vitro activated human T cells, and we tested cytarabine at concentrations reached during in vivo treatment with high doses, conventional doses and low doses. METHODS: T cells derived from blood donors were activated in vitro in cell culture medium alone or supplemented with ATRA (1 muM), valproic acid (500 or 1000 muM) or cytarabine (0.01-44 muM). Cell characteristics were assessed by flow cytometry. Supernatants were analyzed for cytokines by ELISA or Luminex. Effects on primary human AML cell viability and proliferation of low-dose cytarabine (0.01-0.5 muM) were also assessed. Statistical tests include ANOVA and Cluster analyses. RESULTS: Only cytarabine 44 muM had both antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. Additionally, this concentration increased the CD4:CD8 T cell ratio, prolonged the expression of the CD69 activation marker, inhibited CD95L and heat shock protein (HSP) 90 release, and decreased the release of several cytokines. In contrast, the lowest concentrations (0.35 and 0.01 muM) did not have or showed minor antiproliferative or cytotoxic effects, did not alter activation marker expression (CD38, CD69) or the release of CD95L and HSP90, but inhibited the release of certain T cell cytokines. Even when these lower cytarabine concentrations were combined with ATRA and/or valproic acid there was still no or minor effects on T cell viability. However, these combinations had strong antiproliferative effects, the expression of both CD38 and CD69 was altered and there was a stronger inhibition of the release of FasL, HSP90 as well as several cytokines. Cytarabine (0.01-0.05 muM) showed a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on AML cells, and in contrast to the T cells this effect reached statistical significance even at 0.01 muM. CONCLUSIONS: Even low levels of cytarabine, and especially when combined with ATRA and valproic acid, can decrease T cell viability, alter activation-induced membrane-molecule expression and decrease the cytokine release.",,"['Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Brenner, Annette K', 'Vetas, Kristin', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Ersvaer E', 'Brenner AK', 'Vetas K', 'Reikvam H', 'Bruserud O']","['Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. elisabeth.ersver@hib.no.', 'Institute of Biomedical Laboratory Sciences, Bergen University College, Nygardsgaten 112, P.O.

Its role in maintaining established leukemia stem cells, which are more directly relevant to patients with disease, however, is less clear. To address what role Wnt signaling may play in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we used a stably integrated fluorescent Wnt reporter construct to interrogate endogenous Wnt signaling activity in vivo. In this study, we report that active Wnt signaling is restricted to minor subpopulations within bulk tumors, that these Wnt-active subsets are highly enriched for leukemia-initiating cells (LICs), and that genetic inactivation of beta-catenin severely reduces LIC frequency. We show further that beta-catenin transcription is upregulated by hypoxia through hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (Hif1alpha) stabilization, and that deletion of Hif1alpha also severely reduces LIC frequency. Of note, the deletion of beta-catenin or Hif1alpha did not impair the growth or viability of bulk tumor cells, suggesting that elements of the Wnt and Hif pathways specifically support leukemia stem cells. We also confirm the relevance of these findings to human disease using cell lines and patient-derived xenografts, suggesting that targeting these pathways could benefit patients with T-ALL.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Giambra, Vincenzo', 'Jenkins, Catherine E', 'Lam, Sonya H', 'Hoofd, Catherine', 'Belmonte, Miriam', 'Wang, Xuehai', 'Gusscott, Sam', 'Gracias, Deanne', 'Weng, Andrew P']","['Giambra V', 'Jenkins CE', 'Lam SH', 'Hoofd C', 'Belmonte M', 'Wang X', 'Gusscott S', 'Gracias D', 'Weng AP']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150501,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*physiology', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,,2015/05/03 06:00,2015/08/27 06:00,['2015/05/03 06:00'],"['2014/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31530-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-609370 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 18;125(25):3917-27. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-609370.

Improvements in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and the amelioration of bleeding complications in DIC patients were reported to be greater with rTM therapy than with unfractionated heparin therapy. However, it remains unknown whether rTM therapy affects the outcomes of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). DESIGN AND METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed 103 patients with AML and compared outcomes between patients treated with low molecular weight heparin therapy and rTM. The diagnostic criteria for DIC were previously proposed by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. Comparisons between qualitative variables were carried out using the chi(2) test. Survival probabilities were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences in survival distributions were evaluated using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients developed DIC due to chemotherapy or their disease status. Fourteen patients were treated with rTM, while 33 patients were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). The log-rank test revealed that overall survival was significantly worse in the DIC group than in the non-DIC group (P=0.003), and was signfiacntly better in the rTM group than the LMWH group (P=0.016). CONCLUSION: rTM was more efficient than LMWH because of the improvements it induced in overall survival.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Many nerve axons are insulated by a myelin sheath and their demyelination not only prevents saltatory electrical signal conduction along the axons but also removes their metabolic support leading to irreversible neurodegeneration, which currently is untreatable. There is much interest in potential therapeutics that promote remyelination and here we explore use of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine known to play a key regulatory role in self-tolerant immunity and recently identified as a pro-myelination factor. In this study, we tested a nanoparticle-based strategy for targeted delivery of LIF to oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) to promote their differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes able to repair myelin. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-based nanoparticles of approximately 120 nm diameter were constructed with LIF as cargo (LIF-NP) with surface antibodies against NG-2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, expressed on OPC. In vitro, NG2-targeted LIF-NP bound to OPCs, activated pSTAT-3 signalling and induced OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. In vivo, using a model of focal CNS demyelination, we show that NG2-targeted LIF-NP increased myelin repair, both at the level of increased number of myelinated axons, and increased thickness of myelin per axon. Potency was high: a single NP dose delivering picomolar quantities of LIF is sufficient to increase remyelination. Impact statement Nanotherapy-based delivery of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) directly to OPCs proved to be highly potent in promoting myelin repair in vivo: this delivery strategy introduces a novel approach to delivering drugs or biologics targeted to myelin repair in diseases such as MS.",['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

A significant proportion of patients develop cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). METHODS: To investigate risk factors for and the clinical course of CVT in ALL patients, we describe all cases of CVT which occurred in a well-defined cohort of 240 adults, treated for newly diagnosed ALL in the HOVON (Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group)-37 study. We conducted a nested case-control study to explore the relevance of early symptoms and risk factors for CVT in ALL patients. RESULTS: Nine of 240 patients developed CVT (4%). CVT occurred during or shortly after L-asparaginase therapy (in 8 cases) and shortly after intrathecal methotrexate injections (in all cases) during cycle I of remission induction treatment. CVT was associated with prior headache and seizures. In 5 of 9 patients with CVT, headache before the diagnosis of CVT occurred within 3 days after lumbar puncture and initially had a postural character. CONCLUSIONS: CVT is relatively common in adult ALL patients. Our data suggest that CVT in adult ALL patients results from the additive effects of multiple risk factors, with a particular role for asparaginase and the effects of lumbar punctures for intrathecal therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2015 National Stroke Association.

Although recurrent translocations have been identified in AML, almost half of adult AML patients present with a normal karyotype (NK-AML). While cell line models exist to study AML, they frequently have abnormal/unstable karyotypes, while primary cells from NK-AML patients are difficult to maintain in vitro. Here we provide a thorough molecular characterization of a recently established cell line, CG-SH, which has normal cytogenetics, representing a useful new model for NK-AML. Using high-throughput DNA sequencing, we first defined the genetic background of this cell line. In addition to identifying potentially deleterious SNVs in genes relevant to AML, we also found insertions in both GATA2 and EZH2, two genes previously linked to AML. We further characterized the growth of this model system in vitro with a cytokine mix that promotes faster cell growth.

Ilorasertib alone or in combination with azacitidine demonstrated activity in preclinical models in various hematological malignancies, indicating that pan-Aurora kinase and multiple kinase inhibition may have preferential antileukemic activity. This phase 1 trial determined the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of ilorasertib alone or combined with azacitidine in advanced hematologic malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients (median age, 67 years; 35 % with >4 prior regimens) with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML; n = 38), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 12), or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (n = 2) received 3 or 6 doses of ilorasertib per 28-day cycle and were assigned to arm A (once-weekly oral), B (twice-weekly oral), C (once-weekly oral plus azacitidine), or D (once-weekly intravenous) treatment. RESULTS: Maximum tolerated doses were not determined; the recommended phase 2 oral monotherapy doses were 540 mg once weekly and 480 mg twice weekly. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were hypertension (28.8 %), hypokalemia (15.4 %), anemia (13.5 %), and hypophosphatemia (11.5 %). Oral ilorasertib pharmacokinetics appeared dose proportional, with a 15-hour half-life and no interaction with azacitidine. Ilorasertib inhibited biomarkers for Aurora kinase and VEGF receptors, and demonstrated clinical responses in 3 AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ilorasertib exhibited acceptable safety and pharmacokinetics at or below the recommended phase 2 dose, displayed evidence of dual Aurora kinase and VEGF receptor kinase inhibition, and activity in AML.",,"['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Tibes, Raoul', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Arellano, Martha', 'Knight, Emily A', 'Xiong, Hao', 'Qin, Qin', 'Munasinghe, Wijith', 'Roberts-Rapp, Lisa', 'Ansell, Peter', 'Albert, Daniel H', 'Oliver, Brian', 'McKee, Mark D', 'Ricker, Justin L', 'Khoury, Hanna Jean']","['Garcia-Manero G', 'Tibes R', 'Kadia T', 'Kantarjian H', 'Arellano M', 'Knight EA', 'Xiong H', 'Qin Q', 'Munasinghe W', 'Roberts-Rapp L', 'Ansell P', 'Albert DH', 'Oliver B', 'McKee MD', 'Ricker JL', 'Khoury HJ']","['MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA, ggarciam@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150502,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '6L5D03D975 (ilorasertib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Aminopyridines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Aurora Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', '*Phenylurea Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor']",,,2015/05/03 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/05/03 06:00'],"['2015/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-015-0242-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2015 Aug;33(4):870-80. doi: 10.1007/s10637-015-0242-6.

The specificity of exosome uptake by different target cells remains unknown. In this study, we observed that MCL exosomes are taken up rapidly and preferentially by MCL cells. Only a minor fraction of exosomes was internalized into T-cell leukemia and bone marrow stroma cell lines, when these cells were co-cultured with MCL cells. Moreover, MCL patients' exosomes were taken up by both healthy and patients' B-lymphocytes with no apparent internalization to T lymphocytes and NK cells. Exosome internalization was not inhibited by specific siRNA against caveolin1 and clathrin but was found to be mediated by a cholesterol-dependent pathway.

In order to perform a prospective, mono-centric surveillance of complications in clinical routine due to short-term central venous catheters (CVCs) in consecutive patients receiving chemotherapy from March 2013 to September 2014, IPS was calculated at CVC insertion and removal (mIPSin and mIPSex, respectively). We used the 2012 Infectious Diseases Working Party of the German Society of Haematology and Medical Oncology (AGIHO/DGHO) criteria to define CRBSI. In total, 143 patients (mean 59.5 years, 61.4 % male) with 267 triple-lumen CVCs (4044 CVC days; mean 15.1 days, range 1-60 days) were analysed. CVCs were inserted for therapy of acute leukaemia (53.2 %), multiple myeloma (24.3 %) or lymphoma (11.2 %), and 93.6 % were inserted in the jugular vein. A total of 66 CRBSI cases (24.7 %) were documented (12 definite/13 probable/41 possible). The incidence was 16.3/1000 CVC days (2.9/3.1/10.1 per 1000 CVC days for definite/probable/possible CRBSI, respectively). In CRBSI cases, the mIPSex was higher as compared to cases without CRBSI (13.1 vs. 7.1; p < 0.001). The best mIPSex cutoff for CRBSI prediction was 8 points (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.77; sensitivity = 84.9 %, specificity = 60.7 %, negative predictive value = 92.4 %). For patients with an mIPSex >/=8, the risk for a CRBSI was high (odds ratio [OR] = 5.9; p < 0.001) and even increased if, additionally, CVC had been in use for about 10 days (OR = 9.8; p < 0.001). In case other causes of infection are excluded, a mIPSex >/=8 and duration of CVC use of about 10 days predict a very high risk of CRBSI.

Profiling of drug responses was performed with a drug sensitivity and resistance testing platform comprising 295 anticancer agents. Overall, drug sensitivity scores and the drug response profiles of cell line and primary cell samples correlated well and were distinct from other types of leukemia samples. The cell lines were highly sensitive to TKIs and the clinically TKI-resistant patient samples were also resistant ex vivo. Comparison of cell line and patient sample data identified new candidate drugs for CML BC, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitors.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: F-FDG PET/computed tomography was performed in 206 women with breast cancer, and the standardized uptake value (SUV) in breast cancer was analyzed to test associations with prognostic parameters. RESULTS: PET/computed tomography sensitivity for primary tumor detection was 90.4% (206/228) and sensitivity and specificity for metastatic axillary lymph node were 72.6% (45/62) and 84.7% (122/144), respectively. A high SUV was significantly associated with large tumor size (>2 cm, P<0.001), positive axillary lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), distant metastasis (P=0.016), higher tumor node metastasis stage (P<0.001), higher histologic grade (P<0.001), higher nuclear grade (P<0.001), estrogen receptor negativity (P<0.001), progesterone receptor negativity (P<0.001), triple negativity (P=0.006), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 negativity (P=0.031), cytokeratin 5/6 positivity (P=0.001), epidermal growth factor receptor positivity (P=0.005), and Ki67 positivity (P=0.003).

It is of great interest to test whether WT1 single nucleotide polymorphism can be used as a molecular marker in other types of cancer, to improve risk and treatment stratification. We performed sequencing analysis of exons 7 and 9 of WT1, which are known mutational hotspots, in a total of 73 patients with BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and 93 healthy controls. No previously reported WT1 mutations were identified in the present study. In Korean patients with BCR-ABL1-negative MPN, WT1 genetic variant rs16754 had no significant impact on clinical outcomes. We observed a significant difference in the allelic frequencies of WT1 rs16754 in Koreans between BCR-ABL1-negative MPN cases and healthy controls. Individuals carrying variant G alleles of WT1 rs16754 showed a relatively low prevalence of BCR-ABL1-negative MPN, compared with those carrying wild A alleles of WT1 rs16754 (Hazard ratio 0.10-0.65, P<0.05).

METHODS: Seventy one and 21 AML patients with t(8;21) and inv(16) were enrolled in this study, respectively. NPM1, CEBPA, c-KIT, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, EZH2, WT1, and CBL mutations were analyzed by direct sequencing. Patients were categorized with respect to c-KIT and WT1 mutation status, and both clinical features and prognoses were compared. RESULTS: The incidences of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), NPM1, CEBPA, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, EZH2, and CBL mutations were low (</=5%) in CBF AML patients. However, c-KIT and WT1 mutations occurred frequently (10.9% and 13.8%, respectively). t(8;21) patients with c-KIT mutations showed significantly shorter overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) periods than those without mutations (P<0.001, for both); however, although the limited number of t(8;21) patients were analyzed, WT1 mutation status did not affect prognosis significantly. Relapse or death during follow-up occurred more frequently in t(8;21) patients carrying c-KIT mutations than in those without the mutation, although the difference was significant only in a specific patient subgroup with no WT1 mutations (P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of mutations in epigenetic genes are very low in CBF AML; however, c-KIT and WT1 mutations occur more frequently than others. The poor prognostic impact of c-KIT mutation in t(8;21) AML patients only applies in a specific patient subgroup without WT1 mutations.

Initial cytotoxic induction chemotherapy is often able to reduce tumor burden to a level sufficient to meet the current criteria for ""complete"" remission. Nevertheless, most AML patients ultimately die from their disease, most commonly as clinically evident relapsed AML. Despite a variety of available salvage therapy options, prognosis in patients with relapsed or refractory AML is generally poor. In this review, we outline the commonly utilized salvage cytotoxic therapy interventions and then highlight novel investigational efforts currently in clinical trials using both pathway-targeted agents and immunotherapy based approaches.

Its clinical presentation is variable and ranges from isolated skin or bone disease to a life-threatening multisystem condition. LCH can occur at any age but is more frequent in the pediatric population. The diagnosis depends on clinical, histopathological and radiographic examination and should be confirmed by immunohistochemical study with CD1a, S100 protein and langerin, three markers used widely for identifying Langerhans cells. Herein, we report an adolescent with acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M2) who was treated just with surgical management alone for LCH.

METHODS: Patients were divided into imatinib and non-imatinib group according to whether receiving imatinib therapy before transplantation or not. Hematopoietic engraftment, prognosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD), graft versus host disease (GVHD), hemorrhagic cystitis and infections were compared between the two groups in early stage of transplantation (within 100 days after transplantation). RESULTS: Compared to non-imatinib group, imatinib group neither had a significantly longer engraftment time nor higher incidence of HVOD, GVHD, hemorrhagic cystitis and infections (P > 0.05). However, imatinib group tended to have a statistically higher incidence of CHF (29.6% vs 8.6%, P = 0.037) and a higher 0.5-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) (27.8% vs 5.9%, P = 0.001). The estimated 10-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and 10-year overall survival (OS) were not statistically significant between the two groups (79.6% vs 62.4% P = 0.432, 68.9% vs 55.5% P = 0.086, respectively). CONCLUSION: Thus, prior exposure to imatinib before transplantation does not influence the hematopoietic engraftment and incidence of early transplant-related complications. While, imatinib therapy pre-HSCT probably increases the risk of CHF and TRM in early stage of post-HSCT, and this effect can be enhanced in older age patients. However, Imatinib therapy doesn't impact RFS and OS on a long view.",,"['Shen, Kefeng', 'Liu, Qifa', 'Sun, Jing', 'Jiang, Qianli', 'Ye, Yanyan', 'Huang, Hao', 'Meng, Fanyi', 'Zhou, Yongjun', 'Yang, Mo']","['Shen K', 'Liu Q', 'Sun J', 'Jiang Q', 'Ye Y', 'Huang H', 'Meng F', 'Zhou Y', 'Yang M']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University Guangzhou, P.

To date, only a paucity of literature has described the mortality burden of LD. This study updates LD mortality using U.S. multiple-cause-of-death data from 2000-2010. METHODS: We calculated crude and age-adjusted rates for LD mortality for age, sex, race, state, Census region, and year. We conducted Poisson regression to assess seasonal and temporal trends. We generated matched odds ratios (MORs) to describe the association between LD-related deaths and other comorbid conditions listed on the death certificates. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1,171 LD-related deaths during 2000-2010. The age-adjusted mortality rate remained relatively static from 2000 (0.038 per 100,000 population, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.031, 0.046) to 2010 (0.040 per 100,000 population, 95% CI 0.033, 0.047). The absolute number increased from 107 to 135 deaths during this period, with adults >/=45 years of age having the highest caseload. Overall, LD mortality rates were 2.2 times higher in men than in women. White people accounted for nearly 83.3% of all LD-related deaths, but the age-adjusted mortality rates for black and white people were similar. Comorbid conditions such as leukemia (MOR=4.8, 95% CI 3.5, 6.6) and rheumatoid arthritis (MOR=5.6, 95% CI 3.3, 9.4) were associated with LD diagnosis on death certificates. CONCLUSION: Comorbid conditions that could lead to an immunocompromised state were associated with fatal LD on U.S. death certificates.

The delineation of pathways essential within an individual patient's mutational background might overcome this limitation and facilitate personalized treatment. We report the results of a large-scale lentiviral loss-of-function RNA interference (RNAi) screen in primary leukemic cells. Stringent validation identified 6 genes (BNIPL1, ROCK1, RPS13, STK3, SNX27, WDHD1) whose knockdown impaired growth and viability of the cells. Dependence on these genes was not caused by mutation or overexpression, and although some of the candidates seemed to be rather patient specific, others were essential in cells isolated from other AML patients. In addition to the phenotype observed after ROCK1 knockdown, treatment with the approved ROCK inhibitor fasudil resulted in increased apoptosis and decreased viability of primary AML cells. In contrast to observations in some other malignancies, ROCK1 inhibition did not foster growth of immature malignant progenitors but was toxic to this cell fraction in feeder coculture and xenotransplant experiments, indicating a distinct effect of ROCK1 inhibition on leukemic progenitors.

In this study, we show that the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), one of the major Ser/Thr phosphatases, is in an inhibited form because of the synergistic contribution of 2 events, the interaction with its physiologic inhibitor SET and the phosphorylation of Y307 of the catalytic subunit of PP2A. The latter event is mediated by Lyn, a Src family kinase previously found to be overexpressed, delocalized, and constitutively active in CLL cells. This Lyn/PP2A axis accounts for the persistent high level of phosphorylation of the phosphatase's targets and represents a key connection linking phosphotyrosine- and phosphoserine/threonine-mediated oncogenic signals. The data herein presented show that the disruption of the SET/PP2A complex by a novel FTY720-analog (MP07-66) devoid of immunosuppressive effects leads to the reactivation of PP2A, which in turn triggers apoptosis of CLL cells. When used in combination with SFK inhibitors, the action of MP07-66 is synergistically amplified, providing a new option in the therapeutic strategy for CLL patients.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Zonta, Francesca', 'Pagano, Mario Angelo', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Tibaldi, Elena', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Trimarco, Valentina', 'Facco, Monica', 'Zagotto, Giuseppe', 'Pavan, Valeria', 'Ribaudo, Giovanni', 'Bordin, Luciana', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Brunati, Anna Maria']","['Zonta F', 'Pagano MA', 'Trentin L', 'Tibaldi E', 'Frezzato F', 'Trimarco V', 'Facco M', 'Zagotto G', 'Pavan V', 'Ribaudo G', 'Bordin L', 'Semenzato G', 'Brunati AM']","['Department of Molecular Medicine.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; and Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; and Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; and Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; and Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, and.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; and Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150430,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Histone Chaperones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Propylene Glycols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Interaction Maps/drug effects', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2015/05/02 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/05/02 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31549-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-12-619155 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 11;125(24):3747-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-12-619155.

To define the biological functions of miR-142, which is preferentially and abundantly expressed in immune cells, we created a mouse line with a targeted deletion of this gene. Our analysis of miR-142(-/-) mice revealed a critical role for this miRNA in the development and homeostasis of lymphocytes. Marginal zone B cells expand in the knockout spleen, whereas the number of T and B1 B cells in the periphery is reduced. Abnormal development of hematopoietic lineages in miR-142(-/-) animals is accompanied by a profound immunodeficiency, manifested by hypoimmunoglobulinemia and failure to mount a productive immune response to soluble antigens and virus. miR-142(-/-) B cells express elevated levels of B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) receptor (BAFF-R) and as a result proliferate more robustly in response to BAFF stimulation. Lowering the BAFF-R gene dose in miR-142(-/-) mice rescues the B-cell expansion defect, suggesting that BAFF-R is a bona fide miR-142 target through which it controls B-cell homeostasis. Collectively, our results uncover miR-142 as an essential regulator of lymphopoiesis, and suggest that lesions in this miRNA gene may lead to primary immunodeficiency.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Kramer, Nicholas J', 'Wang, Wei-Le', 'Reyes, Estefany Y', 'Kumar, Bijender', 'Chen, Ching-Cheng', 'Ramakrishna, Chandran', 'Cantin, Edouard M', 'Vonderfecht, Steven L', 'Taganov, Konstantin D', 'Chau, Nelson', 'Boldin, Mark P']","['Kramer NJ', 'Wang WL', 'Reyes EY', 'Kumar B', 'Chen CC', 'Ramakrishna C', 'Cantin EM', 'Vonderfecht SL', 'Taganov KD', 'Chau N', 'Boldin MP']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research.', 'Department of Virology, and.', 'Department of Virology, and.', 'Division of Comparative Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA; and.', 'Regulus Therapeutics, San Diego, CA.', 'Regulus Therapeutics, San Diego, CA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150430,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn142 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Tnfrsf13c protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunity, Humoral', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Immunoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/immunology/pathology', '*Lymphopoiesis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/immunology']",,,2015/05/02 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/05/02 06:00'],"['2014/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31547-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-603951 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 11;125(24):3720-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-603951.

Despite the high cure rates obtained with this drug combination, resistance to arsenic is recently emerging. Moreover, patients with APL carrying the PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein are partially resistant to ATRA treatment. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) activation has been recently reported in APL, and EZN-2208 (PEG-SN38) is a compound with HIF-1alpha inhibitory function currently tested in clinical trials. This study investigates the effect of EZN-2208 in different preclinical APL models, either alone or in combination with ATRA. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Efficacy of EZN-2208 in APL was measured in vitro by assessing expression of HIF-1alpha target genes, cell migration, clonogenicity, and differentiation, vis a vis the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of this compound. In vivo, EZN-2208 was used in mouse models of APL driven by PML-RARalpha or PLZF-RARalpha, either alone or in combination with ATRA. RESULTS: Treatment of APL cell lines with noncytotoxic doses of EZN-2208 causes dose-dependent downregulation of HIF-1alpha bona fide target genes and affects cell migration and clonogenicity in methylcellulose. In vivo, EZN-2208 impairs leukemia progression and prolongs mice survival in APL mouse models. More importantly, when used in combination with ATRA, EZN-2208 synergizes in debulking leukemia and eradicating leukemia-initiating cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our preclinical data suggest that the combination ATRA-EZN-2208 may be tested to treat patients with APL who develop resistance to ATO or patients carrying the PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein.",['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Coltella, Nadia', 'Valsecchi, Roberta', 'Ponente, Manfredi', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Bernardi, Rosa']","['Coltella N', 'Valsecchi R', 'Ponente M', 'Ponzoni M', 'Bernardi R']","['Laboratory of Pre-clinical Models of Cancer, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.

Twenty-one (10.1%) children developed ON and 42 (20.2%) TE on therapy. Thromboembolism was a significant predictor of ON on univariate (OR 8.85) and multivariate analysis, along with older age and PEGylated asparaginase.

METHODS: All patients at the Mayo Clinic between January 1999 and July 2013 who had newly diagnosed CLL and had a baseline assessment of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) were included. The relation between hypogammaglobulinemia at diagnosis and the novel prognostic parameters time to first treatment (TFT) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 1485 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 382 (26%) had hypogammaglobulinemia (median IgG, 624 mg/dL), whereas the remaining 1103 patients (74%) had normal serum IgG levels (median IgG, 1040 mg/dL). Patients who had hypogammaglobulinemia at diagnosis were more likely to have advanced Rai stage (III-IV; P = .001) and higher expression of CD49d (P < .001) compared with patients who had normal IgG levels. Although the median TFT for patients who had hypogammaglobulinemia was shorter compared with that for patients who had normal IgG levels (3.8 years vs 7.4 years; P < .001), on multivariable analysis, there was no difference in OS between these 2 groups (12.8 years vs 11.3 years, respectively; P = .73). Of 1103 patients who had CLL with normal IgG levels at diagnosis and who did not receive CLL therapy, the risk of acquired hypogammaglobulinemia was 11% at 5 years and 23% at 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Hypogammaglobulinemia is present in 25% of patients with newly diagnosed CLL. Approximately 25% of patients who have CLL with normal IgG levels at diagnosis will subsequently develop hypogammaglobulinemia on long-term follow-up.

These results led us to propose a model of a developmental switch in B lymphopoiesis, similar to the well-known switch in fetal to adult erythropoiesis. More recent global analysis of mRNA and microRNA expression comparing these two types of pro-B cells revealed differential expression of Lin28b and microRNAs from the Let-7 family, indicating that this regulatory axis plays a role in the switch. Further analysis has provided data supporting this model, implicating Arid3a as a key transcription factor in mediating fetal-type B cell development. Function of this regulatory axis in human B lineage precursors may also explain the predominance of CD5(+) B cells in cord blood. We suggest that Lin28b-promoted B cell development generates many cells expressing CD5 as a consequence of positively selected self-reactivity.

Increased AKT1 activity is frequently seen in AML patients, providing leukemic cells with growth and survival promoting signals. An important aspect of AKT1 function is its involvement in cellular metabolism and energy production. Under some circumstances, strong activation of AKT1 increases oxidative stress, which can cause apoptosis when cells progressively build up excess free radicals. This has been described in hematopoietic cells overexpressing activated AKT1; however, whether this is true in cells coexpressing other genetic events involved in leukemia is not known. This prompted us to investigate the effect of constitutively active AKT1 (myristoylated AKT1) in hematopoietic progenitor cells expressing constitutively active signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication, or antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2. Surprisingly, myristoylated AKT1 was incompatible with proliferation driven by both signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication, which triggered cell cycle block and apoptosis. Moreover, transplantable cells of B-cell lymphoma 2-transgenic mice were impaired in their engraftment ability to recipient mice when expressing hyperactivated AKT1. This was linked to AKT1-mediated proapoptotic functions and not to impairment in homing to the bone marrow. Although cells expressing hyperactivated AKT1 displayed higher levels of reactive oxygen species both in vitro and in vivo, the addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine significantly reduced apoptosis. Taken together, the results indicate that constitutive AKT1 activity is incompatible with growth- and survival-promoting ability of other activated genes in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Cell death was accompanied by a significant increase in phosphorylated p53 at serine 15 and accumulation of PTEN. In addition, resveratrol inhibited the over-expression of p-AKT and p-ERK1/2.

In remission patients, the assessment of the disease response to early intensive therapy through the detection and monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) can accurately refine the individual prognosis and is increasingly used to support a risk-oriented treatment strategy. In this way, only the patients with an unfavorable MRD response are preferably selected for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, irrespective of their clinical risk class.

Elevated expression, sustained nuclear accumulation, and uncontrolled activation of Bcl-3 causes increased cellular proliferation or survival, dependent on the tissue and type of stimuli. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer at Skane University Hospital in Malmo between 1st of January 1990 and 31st of December 1991. Bcl-3 localization in colorectal cancer was assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray and freshly isolated colon from patients. Correlation between Bcl-3 localization and clinicopathological parameters of the cohort were evaluated using the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient. In addition, Bcl-3 expression and localization in colon adenocarcinoma cells were analysed by western blot, immunohistochemistry and subcellular fractionation separately. RESULTS: We found that Bcl-3 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm in the tumour tissue isolated from colon cancer patients. Normal colon samples from the same patients showed Bcl-3 localization in the nucleus. In three out of six colon cancer cell lines, we detected elevated levels of Bcl-3. In these cell lines Bcl-3 was accumulated in the cytosol. We confirmed these findings by analysing Bcl-3 localization in a colon tissue micro array consisting of 270 cases. In these samples Bcl-3 localization correlated with the proliferation marker Ki-67, but not with the apoptotic marker Caspase 3. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that analysis of the subcellular localization of Bcl-3 could be a potential-early diagnostic marker in colon cancer.",,"['Saamarthy, Karunakar', 'Bjorner, Sofie', 'Johansson, Martin', 'Landberg, Goran', 'Massoumi, Ramin', 'Jirstrom, Karin', 'Masoumi, Katarzyna Chmielarska']","['Saamarthy K', 'Bjorner S', 'Johansson M', 'Landberg G', 'Massoumi R', 'Jirstrom K', 'Masoumi KC']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Translational Cancer Research, Division of Molecular Tumour Pathology, Lund University, Medicon Village, Building 404:A3, 223 83, Lund, Sweden.

The viability of most cell types in a steady state is preserved by the interplay of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, wherein the anti-apoptotic members inhibit the action of their pro-apoptotic counterparts. Neutrophils, however, display absent or severely reduced expression of several anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Hence, they rely on the expression of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, for survival. This protein is uniquely short-lived relative to related proteins and its loss likely precipitates the induction of apoptosis in neutrophils. This review describes the role of Mcl-1 in the neutrophil in the context of apoptosis and highlights the proteins' importance to the cell.

We report on the clinical and molecular features of monozygotic twins with a de novo mutation in KMT2A. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray was done on both twins and whole-exome sequencing was done using both parents and one of the affected twins. SNP microarray confirmed that they were monozygotic twins. A de novo heterozygous variant (p. Arg1083*) in the KMT2A gene was identified through whole-exome sequencing, confirming the diagnosis of WSS. In this study, we have identified a de novo mutation in KMT2A associated with psychomotor developmental delay, facial dysmorphism, short stature, hypertrichosis cubiti, and small kidneys. This finding in monozygotic twins gives specificity to the WSS. The description of more cases of WSS is needed for further delineation of this condition.

The t(8;21) chromosomal translocation produces AML1-ETO, an oncogenic fusion protein that compromises the function of AML1, a transcription factor critical for myeloid cell differentiation. Because of the pressing need for new therapies in the treatment of acute myleoid leukemia, we investigated the genome-wide occupancy of AML1-ETO in leukemic cells to discover novel regulatory mechanisms involving AML-ETO bound genes. RESULTS: We report the co-localization of AML1-ETO with the N-CoR co-repressor to be primarily on genomic regions distal to transcriptional start sites (TSSs). These regions exhibit over-representation of the motif for PU.1, a key hematopoietic regulator and member of the ETS family of transcription factors. A significant discovery of our study is that genes co-occupied by AML1-ETO and N-CoR (e.g., TYROBP and LAPTM5) are associated with the leukemic phenotype, as determined by analyses of gene ontology and by the observation that these genes are predominantly up-regulated upon AML1-ETO depletion. In contrast, the AML1-ETO/p300 gene network is less responsive to AML1-ETO depletion and less associated with the differentiation block characteristic of leukemic cells.

A subset of these proteins (Oct4, Sox2, Prdm14) also plays crucial roles for the establishment of primordial germ cells (PGCs). Here we demonstrate that the Mad2l2 (MAD2B, Rev7) gene product is not only required by PGCs, but also by pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), depending on the growth conditions. Mad2l2(-/-) ESCs were unstable in LIF/serum medium, and differentiated into primitive endoderm. However, they could be stably propagated using small molecule inhibitors of MAPK signaling. Several components of the MAPK cascade were up- or downregulated even in undifferentiated Mad2l2(-/-) ESCs. Global levels of repressive histone H3 variants were increased in mutant ESCs, and the epigenetic signatures on pluripotency-, primitive endoderm-, and MAPK-related loci differed. Thus, H3K9me2 repressed the Nanog promoter, while the promoter of Gata4 lost H3K27me3 and became de-repressed in LIF/serum condition. Promoters associated with genes involved in MAPK signaling also showed misregulation of these histone marks. Such epigenetic modifications could be indirect consequences of mutating Mad2l2. However, our previous observations suggested the histone methyltransferases as direct (G9a) or indirect (Ezh2) targets of Mad2l2. In effect, the intricate balance necessary for pluripotency becomes perturbed in the absence of Mad2l2.",,"['Pirouz, Mehdi', 'Rahjouei, Ali', 'Shamsi, Farnaz', 'Eckermann, Kolja Neil', 'Salinas-Riester, Gabriela', 'Pommerenke, Claudia', 'Kessel, Michael']","['Pirouz M', 'Rahjouei A', 'Shamsi F', 'Eckermann KN', 'Salinas-Riester G', 'Pommerenke C', 'Kessel M']",['a Department of Molecular Cell Biology ; Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry ; Goettingen ; Germany.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chir 99021)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Mad2 Proteins)', '0 (Mad2l2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '86K0J5AK6M (mirdametinib)', '9N3CBB0BIQ (Diphenylamine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diphenylamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Embryoid Bodies/cytology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mad2 Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['MAP kinase', 'Mad2B', 'Rev7', 'differentiation', 'embryonic stem cells', 'pluripotency', 'primitive endoderm']",2015/05/01 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/05/01 06:00'],"['2015/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384101.2015.1026485 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2015;14(10):1596-610. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2015.1026485.,,PMC4614513,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and others have previously reported that 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) is a histone methylation inhibitor that has a wide range of anticancer effects in various human cancers. Here, focusing on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a model, we reported a less toxic analog of DZNep, named D9, which is shown to be efficacious in AML cell lines and patient-derived samples in vitro, as well as AML tumorigenesis in vivo. Gene expression analysis in a panel of AML cell lines treated with D9 identified a set of genes that is associated with D9 sensitivity and implicated in multiple oncogenic signaling pathways.

The lncRNA, CCDC26, is related to childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because its copy number is altered in AML patients. RESULTS: We found that CCDC26 transcripts were abundant in the nuclear fraction of K562 human myeloid leukemia cells. To examine the function of CCDC26, gene knockdown (KD) was performed using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and four KD clones, in which CCDC26 expression was suppressed to 1% of its normal level, were isolated. This down-regulation included suppression of CCDC26 intron-containing transcripts (the CCDC26 precursor mRNA), indicating that transcriptional gene suppression (TGS), not post-transcriptional suppression, was occurring. The shRNA targeting one of the two CCDC26 splice variants also suppressed the other splice variant, which is further evidence for TGS. Growth rates of KD clones were reduced compared with non-KD control cells in media containing normal or high serum concentrations. In contrast, enhanced growth rates in media containing much lower serum concentrations and increased survival periods after serum withdrawal were observed for KD clones. DNA microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction screening for differentially expressed genes between KD clones and non-KD control cells revealed significant up-regulation of the tyrosine kinase receptor, KIT, hyperactive mutations of which are often found in AML. Treatment of KD clones with ISCK03, a KIT-specific inhibitor, eliminated the increased survival of KD clones in the absence of serum.

While the effect of maternal ageing on fertilization and reproduction is well known and several studies have shown that women over 35 years have a higher risk of infertility, pregnancy complications, spontaneous abortion, congenital anomalies, and perinatal complications. The effect of paternal age on semen quality and reproductive function is controversial for several reasons. First, there is no universal definition for advanced paternal ageing. Secondly, the literature is full of studies with conflicting results, especially for the most common parameters tested. Advancing paternal age also has been associated with increased risk of genetic disease. Our exhaustive literature review has demonstrated negative effects on sperm quality and testicular functions with increasing paternal age. Epigenetics changes, DNA mutations along with chromosomal aneuploidies have been associated with increasing paternal age. In addition to increased risk of male infertility, paternal age has also been demonstrated to impact reproductive and fertility outcomes including a decrease in IVF/ICSI success rate and increasing rate of preterm birth. Increasing paternal age has shown to increase the incidence of different types of disorders like autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and childhood leukemia in the progeny. It is thereby essential to educate the infertile couples on the disturbing links between increased paternal age and rising disorders in their offspring, to better counsel them during their reproductive years.",,"['Sharma, Rakesh', 'Agarwal, Ashok', 'Rohra, Vikram K', 'Assidi, Mourad', 'Abu-Elmagd, Muhammad', 'Turki, Rola F']","['Sharma R', 'Agarwal A', 'Rohra VK', 'Assidi M', 'Abu-Elmagd M', 'Turki RF']","['Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA. sharmar@ccf.org.', 'Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA. agarwaa@ccf.org.', 'Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA. vikrohra@alfaisal.edu.', 'Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King AbdulAziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. mourad.assidi@gmail.com.', 'KACST Technology Innovation Center in Personalized Medicine at King AbdulAziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. mourad.assidi@gmail.com.', 'Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King AbdulAziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. mabuelmagd@kau.edu.sa.', 'KACST Technology Innovation Center in Personalized Medicine at King AbdulAziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. mabuelmagd@kau.edu.sa.', 'KACST Technology Innovation Center in Personalized Medicine at King AbdulAziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. rola_turki@yahoo.com.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. rola_turki@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150419,England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aging/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/genetics', '*Paternal Age', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Reproduction/*genetics', 'Risk Assessment', '*Semen Analysis', 'Telomere Shortening']",,,2015/05/01 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2015/05/01 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12958-015-0028-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12958-015-0028-x [pii]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2015 Apr 19;13:35. doi: 10.1186/s12958-015-0028-x.,,PMC4455614,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A motion equation for a bead bound to a cell was applied to describe the mechanical characteristics of the cell cytoskeleton. By comparing between the modeling results and experimental results from the optical tweezer, the stiffness and viscosity of the Jurkat cells before and after the ART treatment were obtained. The results demonstrate a weak power-law dependency of cell stiffness with frequency. Furthermore, the stiffness and viscosity were increased after the treatment.

This non-selective toxicity is the root cause of untoward side effects that limits the effectiveness of therapy. In order to improve chemotherapeutic options for cancer patients, there is a need to identify novel compounds with higher discrimination for cancer cells. In the past, methine dyes that increase the sensitivity of photographic emulsions have been investigated for anti-cancer properties. In the 1970's, Kodak Laboratories initiated a screen of approximately 7000 dye structural variants for selective toxicity. Among these, D112 was identified as a promising compound with elevated toxicity against a colon cancer cell line in comparison to a non-transformed cell line. Despite these results changing industry priorities led to a halt in further studies on D112. We decided to revive investigations on D112 and have further characterized D112-induced cellular toxicity. We identified that in response to D112 treatment, the T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat showed caspase activation, mitochondrial depolarization, and phosphatidylserine externalization, all of which are hallmarks of apoptosis. Chemical inhibition of caspase enzymatic activity and blockade of the mitochondrial pathway through Bcl-2 expression inhibited D112-induced apoptosis. At lower concentrations, D112 induced growth arrest. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of D112 induced mitochondrial dysfunction, we analyzed the intracellular localization of D112, and found that D112 associated with mitochondria. Interestingly, in the cell lines that we tested, D112 showed increased toxicity toward transformed versus non-transformed cells.

However, the presence of viral contaminations in cell cultures is still a matter of debate and cannot be determined with general detection methods. In the present study we screened 577 human cell lines for the presence of murine leukemia viruses (MLV). Nineteen cell lines were found to be contaminated with MLV, including 22RV1 which is contaminated with the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus variant of MLV. Of these, 17 cell lines were shown to produce active retroviruses determined by product enhanced reverse transcriptase PCR assay for reverse transcriptase activity. The contaminated cell lines derive from various solid tumor types as well as from leukemia and lymphoma types. A contamination of primary human cells from healthy volunteers could not be substantiated. Sequence analyses of 17 MLV PCR products and five complete MLV genomes of different infected cell lines revealed at least three groups of related MLV genotypes. The viruses harvested from the supernatants of infected cell cultures were infectious to uninfected cell cultures. In the course of the study we found that contamination of human genomic DNA preparations with murine DNA can lead to false-positive results. Presumably, xenotransplantations of the human tumor cells into immune-deficient mice to determine the tumorigenicity of the cells are mainly responsible for the MLV contaminations. Furthermore, the use of murine feeder layer cells during the establishment of human cell lines and a cross-contamination with MLV from infected cultures might be sources of infection. A screening of cell cultures for MLV contamination is recommended given a contamination rate of 3.3%.",,"['Uphoff, Cord C', 'Lange, Sandra', 'Denkmann, Sabine A', 'Garritsen, Henk S P', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Uphoff CC', 'Lange S', 'Denkmann SA', 'Garritsen HS', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Transfusion Medicine, Municipal Hospital, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150430,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genome, Viral/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2015/05/01 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2015/05/01 06:00'],"['2015/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0125622 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-00768 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 30;10(4):e0125622. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0125622. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4416031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study determines gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of fibrosis-related IL-6-type cytokines in cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced gingival overgrowth (GO). METHODS: Eighty non-smokers were included (40 CsA-medicated renal transplant patients with GO [GO+; n = 20] or without GO [GO-; n = 20], 20 individuals with gingivitis, and 20 healthy participants). Probing depth and plaque, papilla bleeding, and hyperplastic index scores were recorded. GCF samples were obtained from the mesio-buccal aspects of two teeth. GCF IL-6, IL-1beta, OSM, LIF, and IL-11 levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The GO+ and GO- groups had higher IL-6 total amounts than the healthy group (P <0.008). IL-1beta total amounts in the GO+ group were significantly higher than in both the healthy and GO- groups (P <0.008). OSM total amount was elevated in the GO+ and GO- groups compared with both the gingivitis and healthy groups (P <0.008). All groups had similar LIF and IL-11 total amounts (P >0.008). Moderate positive correlations were detected among IL-6, IL-1beta, OSM, and IL-11 total amount in GCF and clinical parameters (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 and OSM increases in GCF as a result of CsA usage or an immunosuppressed state irrespective of the severity of inflammation and the presence of GO. The IL-6 family of cytokines might not be directly involved in biologic mechanisms associated with CsA-induced GO.

25927124,,Publisher,,,,,,2005 Nov 23,,,,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant clonal disorder of blood cells resulting from the cancerous transformation of a very primitive hematopoietic stem cell. CML's hallmark is the chromosome 9;22 translocation that produces the BCR-ABL gene, which is present in more than 95 percent of all cases of CML. Imatinib (Gleevec(R)) is an orally administered drug that competitively inhibits the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, a cellular enzyme that is encoded in the BCR-ABL gene. Imatinib works by blocking, or turning off, the signal from the tyrosine kinase protein, so that cancerous cells stop growing. Imatinib is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients in the first-line and relapsed settings of all phases of CML. There are three clinical phases of CML-chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP), and blastic phase/blast crisis (BP)-distinguished by their prognoses and clinical presentation. Therapeutic options include imatinib, interferon-alpha with or without cytarabine, hydroxyurea, busulfan, other conventional chemotherapies, and stem cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation, SCT). Allogeneic SCT is the only curative treatment for CML, however it is only available for 20-25 percent of patients predominantly due to lack of a suitable donor; 15-30 percent treatment-related mortality can be expected with SCT. This assessment of imatinib for treatment of CML was performed at the request of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and is designed to inform the likely health outcomes associated with a current demonstration project which provides for payment for certain oral medications, including imatinib for CML, that are prescribed as replacements for other drugs currently covered under Medicare Part B.",,"['Abernethy, Amy P', 'McCrory, Douglas C']","['Abernethy AP', 'McCrory DC']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book']",,Rockville (MD),,,,,,,,,2015/05/01 06:00,2015/05/01 06:00,,,['NBK286013 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20150501,['Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US)'],['AHRQ Technology Assessments'],"['Report on the Relative Efficacy of Oral Cancer Therapy for Medicare Beneficiaries', 'Versus Currently Covered Therapy: Part 3, Imatinib for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', '(CML)']",['2015/05/01 06:00']

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 66 cases referred for sperm banking prior to initiation of chemotherapy over a 15-year period (1999~2014). Patients who had previously received cancer treatment including chemotherapy or radiotherapy were not included in this study. RESULTS: We studied a total of 66 cancer patients referred for cryopreservation of sperm prior to chemotherapy. The mean age of the patients at the time of banking was 32.0+/-7.9 years (range, 19~58 years). The types of cancer were testicular cancer (31 cases, 47.0%), non-Hodgkin's disease (10 cases, 15.1%), Hodgkin's disease (5 cases, 7.6%), leukemia (8 cases, 12.1%), gastrointestinal malignancy (5 cases, 7.6%), and musculoskeletal malignancy (5 cases, 7.6%). There were significant differences in sperm concentration and viability among the various types of cancer, but no significant difference in semen volume or sperm motility and morphology. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found that sperm quality could decrease even before chemotherapy.

We are pioneering approaches to treat advanced CaP that employ conditionally replication-competent oncolytic adenoviruses that simultaneously produce a systemically active cancer-specific therapeutic cytokine, mda-7/IL-24, Cancer Terminator Viruses (CTV). A truncated version of the CCN1/CYR61 gene promoter, tCCN1-Prom, was more active than progression elevated gene-3 promoter (PEG-Prom) in regulating transformation-selective transgene expression in CaP and oncogene-transformed rat embryo cells. Accordingly, we developed a new CTV, Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7, which displayed dose-dependent killing of CaP without harming normal prostate epithelial cells in vitro with significant anti-cancer activity in vivo in both nude mouse CaP xenograft and transgenic Hi-Myc mice (using ultrasound-targeted microbubble (MB)-destruction, UTMD, with decorated MBs). Resistance to mda-7/IL-24-induced cell death correlated with overexpression of Bcl-2 family proteins. Inhibiting Mcl-1 using an enhanced BH3 mimetic, BI-97D6, sensitized CaP cell lines to mda-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis. Combining BI-97D6 with Ads expressing mda-7/IL-24 promoted ER stress, decreased anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 expression and enhanced mda-7/IL-24 expression through mRNA stabilization selectively in CaP cells. In Hi-myc mice, the combination induced enhanced apoptosis and tumor growth suppression.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 330 consecutive older patients who were diagnosed with AML between May 1, 2005 and December 23, 2011, at 2 hospitals in Boston to examine their health care utilization and end-of-life care. Using multivariable logistic and linear regression models adjusting for covariates, we also compared health care utilization between patients who received intensive induction chemotherapy (n = 197; cytarabine/ anthracycline combination) versus nonintensive chemotherapy (n = 133; single-agent therapy). RESULTS: The median number of hospitalizations for the entire cohort was 4.2 (range, 1-18 hospitalizations). Patients who died spent a mean of 28.3% of their life after diagnosis in the hospital and 13.8% of their life attending outpatient clinic appointments. Although the majority of patients (87.9%) died during the 2-year follow-up period, a minority received palliative care (16.2%) or hospice (23.1%) services. Within 30 days of death, 84.5% of patients were hospitalized, and 61% died in the hospital. Among the patients who died, those who received intensive induction therapy (vs nonintensive therapy) spent 30% more of their life after diagnosis in the hospital (P < .0001) and were less likely to receive hospice services (odds ratio, 0.45; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: The current findings highlight the intensity of health care utilization among older patients with AML, regardless of treatment modality.

Cu complexes possess the ability to overcome MDR in cancer. Therefore, the search for new Cu complexes is of great clinical significance and we address the anticancer effects of a previously synthesized novel 9-phenyldibenzo[a,c]phenazin-9-ium cation [1(+)] as [1] [CuCl2] and as [1] [I]. METHODS: The existence of the monovalent Cu(I) in [1] [CuCl2] was proven by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies and in vivo anticancer effects were studied in animals. RESULTS: The monovalent nature of the Cu ion in [1] [CuCl2] was determined through EPR. The mean survival time of mice bearing doxorubicin-resistant Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells is longer when [1] [I] is injected intraperitoneally whereas [1] [CuCl2] does not significantly increase the median survival in tumor-bearing mice. Compounds do not follow the immunomodulatory route and only [1] [I] shows cytotoxic activity in both MDR and drug-sensitive leukemia cell lines. CONCLUSION: An organic iodide complex rather than a cupric complex possesses direct cytotoxic potential.","['(c) 2015 S.

Polatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate containing an anti-CD79B monoclonal antibody conjugated to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E. We aimed to assess the safety and clinical activity of polatuzumab vedotin in relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). METHODS: In this phase 1, multicentre, open-label study, we enrolled patients with documented NHL or CLL expected to express CD79B (confirmation of CD79B expression was not required) and for whom no suitable therapy of curative intent or higher priority existed from 13 centres. The primary endpoints of the study were to assess safety and tolerability, determine the maximum tolerated dose, and identify the recommended phase 2 dose of polatuzumab vedotin as a single agent and in combination with rituximab. A 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was used in which we treated patients with polatuzumab vedotin (0.1-2.4 mg/kg every 21 days) in separate dose-escalation cohorts for NHL and CLL. After determination of the recommended phase 2 dose, we enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and relapsed or refractory indolent NHL into indication-specific cohorts. We also enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory NHL into an additional cohort to assess the feasibility of the combination of polatuzumab vedotin and rituximab 375 mg/m(2). Patients who received any dose of polatuzumab vedotin were available for safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01290549. FINDINGS: Between March 21, 2011, and Nov 30, 2012, we enrolled 95 patients (34 to the NHL dose-escalation cohort, 18 to the CLL dose-escalation cohort, 34 with NHL to the expansion cohort at the recommended phase 2 dose, and nine with NHL to the rituximab combination cohort; no expansion cohort of CLL was started due to lack of activity in the dose-escalation cohort). The recommended phase 2 dose in NHL was 2.4 mg/kg as a single agent and in combination with rituximab; the maximum tolerated dose in CLL was 1.0 mg/kg as a result of dose-limiting toxic effects reported in two of five patients given 1.8 mg/kg. Grade 3-4 adverse events were reported in 26 (58%) of 45 patients with NHL treated at the single-agent recommended phase 2 dose, and the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (18 [40%] of 45), anaemia (five [11%]), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (four [9%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 17 (38%) of 45 patients, and included diarrhoea (two patients), lung infection (two patients), disease progression (two patients), and lung disorder (two patients). Seven (77%) of nine patients in the rituximab combination cohort had a grade 3-4 adverse event, with neutropenia (five [56%]), anaemia (two [22%]), and febrile neutropenia (two [22%]) reported in more than one patient. 11 (12%) of 95 patients died during the study: eight with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (due to progressive disease in four patients, infections in three patients [two treatment related], and treatment-related worsening ascites in one patient) and three with relapsed or refractory CLL (due to progressive disease, pulmonary infection, and pneumonia; none thought to be treatment-related). At the recommended phase 2 dose, objective responses were noted in 23 of 42 activity-evaluable patients with NHL given single-agent polatuzumab vedotin (14 of 25 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, seven of 15 with indolent NHL, and two with mantle-cell lymphoma) and seven of nine patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin combined with rituximab. No objective responses were observed in patients with CLL. INTERPRETATION: Polatuzumab vedotin has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in patients with NHL but not in those with CLL. Its clinical activity should be further assessed in NHL. FUNDING: Genentech.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: The studies were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ChinaInfo and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases from the inception to June 20, 2014. Thereafter, the eligible studies were selected based on the predefined criteria, and the literature quality was assessed. The meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.2 software. The pooled effect size was relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 8 studies containing 480 cases were included, among which 264 were assigned to the ATRA + ATO group and the other 216 to the ATRA group. The meta-analysis showed that ATRA + ATO combination therapy significantly improved the complete remission (CR) rate (RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.03-1.16, p = 0.004), decreased the early mortality rate (RR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.20-0.9, p = 0.03) and relapse rate (RR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.07-0.42, p < 0.0001), but increased the high risk of liver dysfunction (RR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.72-3.41, p < 0.00001), comparing with ATRA monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The ATRA + ATO combination therapy may be more effective for newly diagnosed APL with a higher CR rate but lower early mortality rate and relapse rate. However, the risks of liver damage should be of concern.","['(c) 2015 S.

Like many retroviruses, KoRV induces lymphoma, leukemia and an immunodeficiency that is associated with opportunistic infections in the virus-infected animals. We recently reported the induction of neutralizing antibodies by immunization with the recombinant ectodomain of the transmembrane envelope protein p15E of KoRV. Since the neutralization titers of the p15E-specific sera were only moderate, we investigated the use of the surface envelope protein gp70 to induce neutralizing antibodies. FINDINGS: We immunized rats and goats with the recombinant gp70 protein of the KoRV, an unglycosylated protein of 52kD (rgp70/p52) or with the corresponding DNA. In parallel we immunized with recombinant rp15E or with a combination of rp15E and rgp70/p52. In all cases binding and neutralizing antibodies were induced. The gp70-specific sera had titers of neutralizing antibodies that were 15-fold higher than the p15E-specific sera. Combining rp15E and rgp70/p52 did not significantly increase neutralizing titers compared to rgp70/p52 alone. High titers of neutralizing antibodies specific for gp70 were also induced by immunization with DNA. Since KoRV and PERV are closely related, we investigated cross-neutralization of the antisera. The antisera against p15E and gp70 of PERV and KoRV inhibited infection by both viruses. CONCLUSION: The envelope proteins of the KoRV may therefore form the basis of an effective preventive vaccine to protect uninfected koalas from infection and possibly an immunotherapeutic treatment for those already infected.",,"['Fiebig, Uwe', 'Dieckhoff, Britta', 'Wurzbacher, Christian', 'Moller, Annekathrin', 'Kurth, Reinhard', 'Denner, Joachim']","['Fiebig U', 'Dieckhoff B', 'Wurzbacher C', 'Moller A', 'Kurth R', 'Denner J']","['Robert Koch-Institute, Nordufer 20, D-13353, Berlin, Germany.

We demonstrate here for the first time that BMI1 also prevents autophagy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines, to support their proliferation and clonogenic activity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified CCNG2/cyclin G2 (CCNG2) as a direct BMI1 target. BMI1 downregulation in CD34+ CML cells by PTC-209 pharmacological treatment or shBMI1 transduction triggered CCNG2 expression and decreased clonogenic activity. Also, ectopic expression of CCNG2 in CD34+ CML cells strongly decreased their clonogenicity. CCNG2 was shown to act by disrupting the phosphatase 2A complex, which activates a PKCzeta-AMPK-JNK-ERK pathway that engages autophagy. We observed that BMI1 and CCNG2 levels evolved inversely during the progression of CML towards an acute deadly phase, and therefore hypothesized that BMI1 could support acute transformation of CML through the silencing of a CCNG2-mediated tumor-suppressive autophagy response.",,"['Mourgues, L', 'Imbert, V', 'Nebout, M', 'Colosetti, P', 'Neffati, Z', 'Lagadec, P', 'Verhoeyen, E', 'Peng, C', 'Duprez, E', 'Legros, L', 'Rochet, N', 'Maguer-Satta, V', 'Nicolini, F-E', 'Mary, D', 'Peyron, J-F']","['Mourgues L', 'Imbert V', 'Nebout M', 'Colosetti P', 'Neffati Z', 'Lagadec P', 'Verhoeyen E', 'Peng C', 'Duprez E', 'Legros L', 'Rochet N', 'Maguer-Satta V', 'Nicolini FE', 'Mary D', 'Peyron JF']","['INSERM, UMR1065 Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire C3M, Nice, France.', 'Equipe Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France.', 'Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, UFR Medecine, Nice, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1065 Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire C3M, Nice, France.', 'Equipe Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France.', 'Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, UFR Medecine, Nice, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1065 Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire C3M, Nice, France.', 'Equipe Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France.', 'Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, UFR Medecine, Nice, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1065 Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire C3M, Nice, France.', 'Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, UFR Medecine, Nice, France.', 'Equipe Cell Death, Differentiation and Cancer, Nice, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1065 Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire C3M, Nice, France.', 'Equipe Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France.', 'Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, UFR Medecine, Nice, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1065 Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire C3M, Nice, France.', 'Equipe Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France.', 'Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, UFR Medecine, Nice, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1065 Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire C3M, Nice, France.', 'Equipe Cell Death, Differentiation and Cancer, Nice, France.', 'Equipe Metabolic control of Cell Death in Cancer, Nice, France.', 'Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'CRCM, U1068, INSERM, Marseille, France.', 'Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, UFR Medecine, Nice, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Archet 1, Nice, France."", 'Institut de Biologie Valrose (iBV), UMR CNRS 7277-UMR INSERM 1091, Nice, France.', 'Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, UFR Medecine, Nice, France.', 'Institut de Biologie Valrose (iBV), UMR CNRS 7277-UMR INSERM 1091, Nice, France.', 'CNRS, UMR5386, INSERM, U1052, Lyon, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France."", 'INSERM, UMR1065 Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire C3M, Nice, France.', 'Equipe Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France.', 'Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, UFR Medecine, Nice, France.', 'INSERM, UMR1065 Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire C3M, Nice, France.', 'Equipe Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France.', 'Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, UFR Medecine, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150430,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (CCNG2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin G2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin G2/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2015/05/01 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/05/01 06:00'],"['2014/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015112 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.112 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Oct;29(10):1993-2002. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.112.

We therefore tested the safety and feasibility of haploidentical natural killer cell therapy in this patient population. PROCEDURE: Twenty-nine children who had relapsed or refractory leukemia were treated with chemotherapy followed by the infusion of haploidentical NK cells. Cohort 1 included 14 children who had not undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), whereas Cohort 2 included 15 children with leukemia that had relapsed after HCT. RESULTS: Twenty-six (90%) NK donors were KIR mismatched (14 with one KIR and 12 with 2 KIRs). The peak NK chimerism levels were >10% donor in 87% of the evaluable recipients. In Cohort 1, 10 had responsive disease and 12 proceeded to HCT thereafter. Currently, 5 (36%) are alive without leukemia. In Cohort 2, 10 had responsive disease after NK therapy and successfully proceeded to second HCT. At present, 4 (27%) are alive and leukemia-free.

Correspondingly, TRAIL-based therapies to eliminate human cancer cells via enforced induction of apoptosis have been established and represent a promising approach in anti-cancer research. However, due to frequently appearing intrinsic or acquired resistances of tumor cells against apoptosis, TRAIL-based apoptotic strategies for the treatment of cancer patients have shown limited efficacy. As a potential alternative, regulated necrosis (and necroptosis triggered e.g. by TRAIL receptors 1/2) has recently gained considerable attention. Regulated necrosis represents a mode of RCD molecularly distinct from apoptosis whose potential in anti-cancer therapy is almost uncharacterized. Since in most cancer cells survival pathways counteract the effects of TRAIL-induced RCD, sensitizers such as cycloheximide (CHX) are frequently added in cell culture to overcome this problem. Unfortunately, those sensitizers are cytotoxic and therefore not suitable for the treatment of cancer patients. Here, we have alternatively employed homoharringtonine (HHT), a plant alkaloid which was recently approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with chronic myeloid lymphoma. RESULTS: We show that HHT is an efficient sensitizer for TRAIL-induced necroptosis in multiple human cancer cell lines. In addition, HHT-enhanced TRAIL-mediated necroptosis occurs via the same signaling pathways (involving RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL) as CHX-enhanced necroptosis. Importantly, consecutive treatment schedules of necroptosis and apoptosis in either combination revealed remarkable additive effects not reached by repetitive apoptotic treatments alone. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data demonstrate that HHT can replace harmful substances such as CHX to sensitize human cancer cells to TRAIL-induced necroptosis. Thus, HHT represents a promising enhancer in TRAIL-based necroptotic anti-cancer therapies also in patients.",,"['Philipp, Stephan', 'Sosna, Justyna', 'Plenge, Johannes', 'Kalthoff, Holger', 'Adam, Dieter']","['Philipp S', 'Sosna J', 'Plenge J', 'Kalthoff H', 'Adam D']","['Institut fur Immunologie, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat, Kiel, Germany. philipp@immunologie.uni-kiel.de.', 'Institut fur Immunologie, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat, Kiel, Germany. sosna.immunologie@uksh-kiel.de.', 'Institut fur Immunologie, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat, Kiel, Germany. johannes.plenge@gmx.de.', 'Institut fur Experimentelle Tumorforschung, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat, Kiel, Germany. hkalthoff@email.uni-kiel.de.', 'Institut fur Immunologie, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat, Kiel, Germany. dadam@email.uni-kiel.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150429,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",,,2015/05/01 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2015/05/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12964-015-0103-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12964-015-0103-0 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2015 Apr 29;13:25. doi: 10.1186/s12964-015-0103-0.,,PMC4411737,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously determined two key parameters that underlie the target DNA preference for prototype foamy virus (PFV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration: flexible pyrimidine (Y)/purine (R) dinucleotide steps at the centers of the integration sites, and base contacts with specific integrase residues, such as Ala188 in PFV integrase and Ser119 in HIV-1 integrase. Here we examined the dinucleotide preference profiles of a range of retroviruses and correlated these findings with respect to length of target site duplication (TSD). RESULTS: Integration datasets covering six viral genera and the three lengths of TSD were accessed from the literature or generated in this work. All viruses exhibited significant enrichments of flexible YR and/or selection against rigid RY dinucleotide steps at the centers of integration sites, and the magnitude of this enrichment inversely correlated with TSD length. The DNA sequence environments of in vivo-generated HIV-1 and PFV sites were consistent with integration into nucleosomes, however, the local sequence preferences were largely independent of target DNA chromatinization. Integration sites derived from cells infected with the gammaretrovirus reticuloendotheliosis virus strain A (Rev-A), which yields a 5 bp TSD, revealed the targeting of global chromatin features most similar to those of Moloney murine leukemia virus, which yields a 4 bp duplication. In vitro assays revealed that Rev-A integrase interacts with and is catalytically stimulated by cellular bromodomain containing 4 protein. CONCLUSIONS: Retroviral integrases have likely evolved to bend target DNA to fit scissile phosphodiester bonds into two active sites for integration, and viruses that cut target DNA with a 6 bp stagger may not need to bend DNA as sharply as viruses that cleave with 4 bp or 5 bp staggers. For PFV and HIV-1, the selection of signature bases and central flexibility at sites of integration is largely independent of chromatin structure. Furthermore, global Rev-A integration is likely directed to chromatin features by bromodomain and extraterminal domain proteins.",,"['Serrao, Erik', 'Ballandras-Colas, Allison', 'Cherepanov, Peter', 'Maertens, Goedele N', 'Engelman, Alan N']","['Serrao E', 'Ballandras-Colas A', 'Cherepanov P', 'Maertens GN', 'Engelman AN']","['Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.

The aim of this meta-analysis is to resolve this controversial issue. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and CBM was performed to identify studies that assessed the prognostic value of CD56 in AML patients. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % CIs for complete remission rate (CRR) and relapse rate (RR) were calculated. RESULTS: Totally, 32 studies with 4074 patients were included. For AML with t(8;21) translocation, CD56 overexpression was associated with shorter OS (HR 2.22; 95 % CI 1.30-3.78) and DFS (HR 2.63; 95 % CI 1.10-6.29) and increased RR (OR 3.29; 95 % CI 1.67-6.48), but did not affect CRR (OR 0.94; 95 % CI 0.49-1.80).

High MAPKBP1 expression (MAPKBP1high) was associated with significantly shorter event-free survival (EFS; P = 0.0004) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.0006) than low MAPKBP1 expression (MAPKBP1low) in a cohort of 157 CN-AML patients.

Neoplastic hematologic disorders of the myeloid lineage have been reported in association with GEH in 4 patients. A clonal association between GEH and the underlying leukemia was suspected in these patients but could only be confirmed in one patient. OBSERVATIONS: A male patient in his 20s presented with asymptomatic red to brown macules and papules. A skin biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of GEH. His blood cell count revealed hypereosinophilia. Morphologic and molecular analyses from bone marrow and blood samples revealed FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive chronic eosinophilic leukemia. The patient was treated with imatinib and achieved complete clinical remission of his leukemia and the GEH. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with GEH associated with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive chronic eosinophilic leukemia. Generalized eruptive histiocytosis in association with a myeloid neoplasm may occur in 2 variants: a reactive condition or a clonal derivative of the underlying leukemia. In this case, both diseases responded well after initiation of treatment with imatinib.",,"['Ziegler, Birgit', 'Peitsch, Wiebke K', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Marx, Alexander', 'Goerdt, Sergij', 'Geraud, Cyrill']","['Ziegler B', 'Peitsch WK', 'Reiter A', 'Marx A', 'Goerdt S', 'Geraud C']","['Department of Dermatology, Venereology, and Allergology, University Medical Center, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany2Center of Excellence in Dermatology, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology, and Allergology, University Medical Center, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany2Center of Excellence in Dermatology, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology, and Allergology, University Medical Center, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany2Center of Excellence in Dermatology, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology, and Allergology, University Medical Center, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany2Center of Excellence in Dermatology, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,JAMA Dermatol,JAMA dermatology,101589530,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'Pdgfra-Associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*complications/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*genetics', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*genetics']",,,2015/04/30 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2015/04/30 06:00'],"['2015/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['2280384 [pii]', '10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.0154 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Dermatol. 2015 Jul;151(7):766-9. doi: 10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.0154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, here we have analyzed the association between eIF4E phosphorylation and cellular resistance to oxidative stress, starvation, and DNA-damaging agents in vitro. Using immortalized and cancer cell lines, retroviral expression of a phosphomimetic (S209D) form of eIF4E, but not phospho-dead (S209A) eIF4E or GFP control, significantly increased cellular resistance to stress induced by DNA-damaging agents (cisplatin), starvation (glucose+glutamine withdrawal), and oxidative stress (arsenite). De novo accumulation of eIF4E-containing cytoplasmic bodies colocalizing with the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T was observed after expression of phosphomimetic S209D, but not S209A or wild-type eIF4E. Increased resistance to cellular stress induced by eIF4E-S209D was lost upon knockdown of endogenous 4E-T or use of an eIF4E-W73A-S209D mutant unable to bind 4E-T. Cancer cells treated with the Mnk1/2 inhibitor CGP57380 to prevent eIF4E phosphorylation and mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Mnk1/2 knockout mice were also more sensitive to arsenite and cisplatin treatment. Polysome analysis revealed an 80S peak 2 hours after arsenite treatment in cells overexpressing phosphomimetic eIF4E, indicating translational stalling. Nonetheless, a selective increase was observed in the synthesis of some proteins (cyclin D1, HuR, and Mcl-1). We conclude that phosphorylation of eIF4E confers resistance to various cell stressors and that a direct interaction or regulation of 4E-T by eIF4E is required. Further delineation of this process may identify novel therapeutic avenues for cancer treatment, and these results support the use of modern Mnk1/2 inhibitors in conjunction with standard therapy.",,"['Martinez, Alba', 'Sese, Marta', 'Losa, Javier Hernandez', 'Robichaud, Nathaniel', 'Sonenberg, Nahum', 'Aasen, Trond', 'Ramon Y Cajal, Santiago']","['Martinez A', 'Sese M', 'Losa JH', 'Robichaud N', 'Sonenberg N', 'Aasen T', 'Ramon Y Cajal S']","[""Molecular Pathology, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca, VHIR, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Molecular Pathology, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca, VHIR, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Pathology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain."", 'McGill University, Department of Biochemistry, Goodman Cancer Research Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'McGill University, Department of Biochemistry, Goodman Cancer Research Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Molecular Pathology, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca, VHIR, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Molecular Pathology, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca, VHIR, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Pathology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150429,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (CGP 57380)', '0 (EIF4ENIF1 protein, human)', '0 (ELAV-Like Protein 1)', '0 (Elavl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Mknk1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Mknk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Arsenites/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'ELAV-Like Protein 1/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Purines/pharmacology']",,,2015/04/30 06:00,2016/02/02 06:00,['2015/04/30 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0123352 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-22227 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 29;10(4):e0123352. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0123352. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4414544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spuriously elevated automated platelet counts have been reported in some acute leukaemia (AL) cases because of fragmentation of circulating blast cells (pseudoplatelets). Haemorrhagic diathesis is a common manifestation of AL, which is often caused by severe thrombocytopenia. Therefore, overestimation of the actual platelet count in patients with AL can affect its clinical management. We aimed to detect the frequency of pseudoplatelets in patients with AL. METHODS: Complete blood cell counts were performed on 86 AL patients with three automated analysers (ADVIA 2120, Coulter LH 750 and Sysmex XE-2100D). Platelet counts were also performed by quantitative flow cytometry (QFC). The platelet counts of the automatic analysers were compared to the platelet counts by QFC. Blood smears were checked for the presence of pseudoplatelets. RESULTS: The automated analysers overestimated the platelet count due to the presence of pseudoplatelets in patients with AL. Pseudoplatelets were observed in the blood smears of 11 patients (13%). Three of these patients were near the prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold. CONCLUSION: Spurious increases in automated platelet counts by blast cell fragments are little known but frequent artefacts that should be ruled out by careful examination of peripheral blood smears.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Frotscher, B', 'Salignac, S', 'Muller, M', 'Latger-Cannard, V', 'Feugier, P', 'Lesesve, J F']","['Frotscher B', 'Salignac S', 'Muller M', 'Latger-Cannard V', 'Feugier P', 'Lesesve JF']","['Department of Laboratory Haematology, University Hospital of Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Haemophilia Treatment Centre, University Hospital of Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Department of Laboratory Haematology, University Hospital of Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Department of Laboratory Haematology, University Hospital of Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Laboratory of Genetics, University Hospital of Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Department of Laboratory Haematology, University Hospital of Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Flow Cytometry Plateform, University Hospital of Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, University Hospital of Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Department of Laboratory Haematology, University Hospital of Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Flow Cytometry Plateform, University Hospital of Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150428,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Automation, Laboratory', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*blood/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*pathology', 'Platelet Count/*methods/*standards', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Platelets', 'acute leukaemia', 'automated blood cell counter', 'blast cell fragments', 'pseudoplatelets']",2015/04/30 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2015/04/30 06:00'],"['2014/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12371 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2015 Oct;37(5):613-9. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12371.

The accumulation of CD5+CD19+ B lymphocytes in peripheral blood is due to a defect in the apoptotic pathway rather than excessive proliferation in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. Despite a number of treatments, CLL remains an incurable disease. Valproic acid (VPA) activity, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, could restore the epigenetic changes underlying the pathogenesis of CLL and thus induce cell death. OBJECTIVES: In the present study we hypothesized that VPA could induce CLL primary cells death through activation of apoptosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 53 CLL patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated through density gradient centrifugation and were the subject of a 24-hour cell culture with 10 mM of VPA. The cytotoxic effect of VPA was evaluated with an XTT test and thereafter confirmed using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry techniques. RESULTS: In this study, a median VPA cytotoxicity of 13.88% with a range of 0-54.65% was observed. Annexin V/PI staining confirmed that the demonstrated cytotoxicity was caused by increased apoptosis in the VPA treated cells as compared to control cells. Statistical analysis showed that VPA's effect on CLL cells depends on lactate dehydrogenase serum levels, but is independent of all other prognostic markers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present experiments found that VPA at a clinically applicable concentration significantly induces apoptosis independently of the disease stage and might be a valuable therapeutic agent for all CLL patients.",,"['Karp, Marta', 'Kosior, Kamila', 'Karczmarczyk, Agnieszka', 'Zajac, Malgorzata', 'Zaleska, Joanna', 'Tomczak, Waldemar', 'Chocholska, Sylwia', 'Hus, Marek', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof']","['Karp M', 'Kosior K', 'Karczmarczyk A', 'Zajac M', 'Zaleska J', 'Tomczak W', 'Chocholska S', 'Hus M', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Giannopoulos K']","['Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland; Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Annexin A5', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cytotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",,,2015/04/30 06:00,2015/06/03 06:00,['2015/04/30 06:00'],"['2015/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17219/acem/29264 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2015 Jan-Feb;24(1):55-62. doi: 10.17219/acem/29264.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the molecular machinery controlling mitotic arrest on MTA treatment, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), appears well defined, the molecular components executing cell death, as well as factors connecting both networks remain poorly understood. Here we conduct a mini screen exploring systematically the contribution of individual BCL2 family proteins at single cell resolution to death on extended mitotic arrest, and demonstrate that the mitotic phosphorylation of BCL2 and BCLX represent a priming event for apoptosis that is ultimately triggered by NOXA-dependent MCL1 degradation, enabling BIM-dependent cell death.

Present study highlights the basic requirements of these patients in Iran. Better understanding of these issues may lead to improve the healthcare standards toward leukemia diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: This descriptive study included 101 specialists in hematology-oncology and pathology serving in oncology centers. The participants were then asked to fill out a standard questionnaire on the issues around diagnosis and treatment of blood malignancies. RESULTS: According to specialists, unfair distribution of facilities across the country, delayed diagnosis of disease, absence of psychological support for patients, and insufficient financial support were the main reasons of inappropriate diagnosis and treatment in leukemia patients.

Here we investigated the role of Hsp70 in survival induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors in human leukemia U937 cells. Quercetin, a major dietary flavonoid, or specific silencing affected the expression level of Hsp70 and did not allow the upregulation of inositol-requiring kinase 1alpha (IRE1alpha), the prototype ER stress sensor regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR), that protects the cells against the stress of misfolded proteins in the ER. The reduction of Hsp70 prevented the upregulation of immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP), but not of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP), and induced apoptosis. Also specific silencing of IRE1alpha or inhibition of its endoribonuclease activity by 4mu8c hampered the upregulation of BiP, but not of CHOP, and induced apoptosis.

The IkappaB family protein BCL-3 stabilizes a NF-kappaB p50 homodimer.DNA complex through inhibition of p50 ubiquitination. This complex inhibits the binding of the transcriptionally active NF-kappaB subunits p65 and c-Rel on the promoters of NF-kappaB target genes and functions to suppress inflammatory gene expression. We have previously shown that the direct interaction between p50 and BCL-3 is required for BCL-3-mediated inhibition of pro-inflammatory gene expression. In this study we have used immobilized peptide array technology to define regions of BCl-3 that mediate interaction with p50 homodimers. Our data show that BCL-3 makes extensive contacts with p50 homodimers and in particular with ankyrin repeats (ANK) 1, 6, and 7, and the N-terminal region of Bcl-3. Using these data we have designed a BCL-3 mimetic peptide based on a region of the ANK1 of BCL-3 that interacts with p50 and shares low sequence similarity with other IkappaB proteins. When fused to a cargo carrying peptide sequence this BCL-3-derived peptide, but not a mutated peptide, inhibited Toll-like receptor-induced cytokine expression in vitro. The BCL-3 mimetic peptide was also effective in preventing inflammation in vivo in the carrageenan-induced paw edema mouse model. This study demonstrates that therapeutic strategies aimed at mimicking the functional activity of BCL-3 may be effective in the treatment of inflammatory disease.","['(c) 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Collins, Patricia E', 'Grassia, Gianluca', 'Colleran, Amy', 'Kiely, Patrick A', 'Ialenti, Armando', 'Maffia, Pasquale', 'Carmody, Ruaidhri J']","['Collins PE', 'Grassia G', 'Colleran A', 'Kiely PA', 'Ialenti A', 'Maffia P', 'Carmody RJ']","['Centre for Immunobiology, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8TA, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Immunobiology, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8TA, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Life Sciences, and Materials and Surface Science Institute, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Napoli Federico II, Naples 80131, Italy.', 'Centre for Immunobiology, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8TA, United Kingdom; Department of Pharmacy, University of Napoli Federico II, Naples 80131, Italy.', 'Centre for Immunobiology, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8TA, United Kingdom.

Cytarabine (Ara-C) is a key drug in the treatment of AML patients, there is still uncertainly regarding its optimal dose and infusion schedule. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the Ara-C infusion schedule used as part of an intensive salvage regimen, in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 252 adult patients (median age 59 years) with relapsed or refractory AML were randomly allocated to receive either Mito-FLAG with Ara-C as bolus (B) (1000 mg/m(2) over 1 h, every 12 h, days 1-5), or continuous infusion (CI) (150 mg/m(2) over 24 h, days 1-5) in combination with mitoxantrone, fludarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation was offered as consolidation therapy. Primary end point was the rate of complete remissions (CRs) after the first cycle of Mito-FLAG. RESULTS: The CR rates after Mito-FLAG (B) and Mito-FLAG (CI) were 54% and 43%, respectively (P = 0.1). There was no statistical difference between rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, renal, and liver toxicity. More infections occurred, however, after Mito-FLAG (B) compared with Mito-FLAG (CI) (80% versus 69%, P = 0.01). The early death rate by day 42 was 13% in both arms. Median disease-free survival was comparable in the two arms (7.8 versus 7.1 months, P = 0.53) as was overall survival (7.1 versus 6.6 months, P = 0.53). CONCLUSION: A 5-day course of Ara-C 2 x 1000 mg/m(2) administered as bolus versus Ara-C 150 mg/m(2) administered by CI (in combination with mitoxantrone, fludarabine, and G-CSF), resulted in a nonsignificant trend in response rates in favor of Mito-FLAG (B) at the selected dose levels, but no differences in the survival outcome in relapsed or refractory AML.

Thirty-four patients with hematologic malignancies who were in an advanced stage or at a high risk of relapse at the time of transplantation were enrolled. Among them, 7 patients underwent transplantation as a second transplantation because of relapse after the previous allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine, busulfan, and ATG (Fresenius, 8 mg/kg), and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg). All patients except 1 (97.1%) achieved donor-type engraftment. Rapid hematopoietic engraftment was achieved, with neutrophils > .5 x 10(9)/L on day 11 and platelets > 20 x 10(9)/L on day 17.5. Treatment was started for >/=grade I GVHD, and the cumulative incidences of acute grade I and grade II to IV GVHD were 27.5% and 30.7%, respectively. The incidence of chronic GVHD (extensive type) was 20%. Fourteen patients (41.2%) had a relapse. The cumulative incidence of transplantation-related mortality at 1 year after transplantation was 26.5%. The survival rate at day 100 was 88.2%. The survival rates at 1 year for patients with complete remission (CR)/chronic phase (n = 8) and non-CR (n = 26) status before transplantation were 62.5% and 42.3%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, non-CR status before transplantation was the only factor significant prognostic factor of increased relapse (P = .0424), which tended to be associated with a lower survival rate (P = .0524). This transplantation protocol is safe and feasible, if a suitable donor is not available in a timely manner. As the main cause of death was relapse and not GVHD, more intensified conditioning or attenuation of GVHD prophylaxis and/or donor lymphocyte infusion may be desirable for patients with non-CR status.","['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

MLL-fusion leukemia has a consistently poor outcome. One of the most common translocation partners is AF9 (MLLT3). MLL-AF9 recruits DOT1L, a histone 3 lysine 79 methyltransferase (H3K79me1/me2/me3), leading to aberrant gene transcription. We show that DOT1L has three AF9 binding sites and present the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of a DOT1L-AF9 complex. We generate structure-guided point mutations and find that they have graded effects on recruitment of DOT1L to MLL-AF9. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of H3K79me2 and H3K79me3 show that graded reduction of the DOT1L interaction with MLL-AF9 results in differential loss of H3K79me2 and me3 at MLL-AF9 target genes.

A huge number of studies have clearly demonstrated that in CML cytogenetic and molecular responses are strictly correlated to the final outcome of the patients and the correct use of standardized methods to assess the achievement of specific degrees of disease reduction at specific time points during treatment has become an essential part of proper clinical management of CML. The target to be achieved and the corresponding ""optimal response"" definition are however evolving, and at least for some patients, they may be represented not only by best possible overall survival (OS) but also by the possibility to discontinue the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment and therefore to live in a treatment-free remission (TFR) status. Therefore, at least for some patients, deep degrees of molecular response, as MR(4) and MR(4.5), whose precise definition has been recently introduced and that are prerequisites to try to discontinuation, are becoming the target to be achieved even in common clinical practice. As a fast initial decline of the disease burden after therapy start may be highly predictive for the final outcome of patients not only in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and of PS but also in terms of possibility of achieving deep molecular responses, a more intense and punctual monitoring of the response of CML patients during the first 6 months of TKI therapy is now recommended by the more recent versions of the European Leukemia Net (ELN) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, as this represents the major driver to decide therapy.",,"['Morotti, Alessandro', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Morotti A', 'Fava C', 'Saglio G']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, ""San Luigi Gonzaga"" University Hospital, 10043, Orbassano, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2015/04/30 06:00,2016/02/18 06:00,['2015/04/30 06:00'],"['2015/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-015-0258-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2015 Jun;10(2):167-72. doi: 10.1007/s11899-015-0258-1.,,PMC4445481,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting the BCR/ABL1 oncoprotein has changed the landscape of the disease. Today, the expected survival of CML patients, if properly managed, is likely to be similar to the general population. Imatinib is the first-approved TKI in CML treatment, and for several years, it was the only option in the frontline setting. Four years ago, second-generation TKIs (nilotinib and dasatinib) were approved as alternative frontline options. Now, clinicians are faced the challenge of making decision for which TKI to chose upfront. Second-generation TKIs have been demonstrated to induce deeper and faster responses compared to imatinib; however, none of three TKIs have been shown to have a clear survival advantage, they all are reasonable options. In contrast, when considering therapy in individual patients, the case may be stronger for a specific TKI. Co-morbidities of the patient and side effect profile of the TKI of interest should be an important consideration in decision making. At present, the cost nilotinib or dasatinib is not remarkably different from imatinib. However, patent for imatinib is expected to expire soon, and it will be available as a generic. Clinicians, then, need to weigh the advantages some patients gain with nilotinib or dasatinib in the frontline setting against the difference in cost.

HIF-2alpha expression was high in subsets of human and mouse leukemia and lymphoma cells, whereas it was low in normal bone marrow leukocytes. To investigate the role of HIF-2alpha, we transduced human HIF-2alpha cDNA in mouse syngeneic models of myeloid preleukemia and a transgenic model of B lymphoma. Ectopic expression of HIF-2alpha accelerated leukemia cell proliferation in vitro. Mice transplanted with cells transduced with HIF-2alpha died significantly faster of leukemia or B lymphoma than control mice transplanted with empty vector-transduced cells. Conversely, HIF-2alpha knockdown in human myeloid leukemia HL60 cells decreased proliferation in vitro and significantly prolonged animal survival following transplantation. In human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), HIF-2alpha mRNA was significantly elevated in several subsets such as the t(15;17), inv(16), complex karyotype and favorable cytogenetic groups.

Although its effects on cancer are significant, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we sought to elucidate possible links between DADS and pyruvate kinase (PKM2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: KG1alpha, a leukemia cell line highly expressing PKM2 was used with a cell counting kit (CCK)-8 and flow cytometry (FCM) to investigate the effects of DADS. Relationships between PKM2 and DADS associated with phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2 and MEK, were assessed by western blot analysis. RESULTS: In KG1alpha cells highly expressing PKM2, we found that DADS could affect proliferation, apoptosis and EGFR/ERK/PKM2 signaling pathways, abrogating EGF-induced nuclear accumulation of PKM2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that DADS suppressed the proliferation of KG1alpha cells, providing evidence that its proapoptotic effects are mediated through the inhibition of EGFR/ERK/PKM2 signaling pathways.",,"['Luo, Nian', 'Zhao, Lv-Cui', 'Shi, Qing-Qiang', 'Feng, Zi-Qiang', 'Chen, Di-Long', 'Li, Jing']","['Luo N', 'Zhao LC', 'Shi QQ', 'Feng ZQ', 'Chen DL', 'Li J']","['Laboratory of Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China E-mail : lijingyangyang@126.com.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Thyroid Hormones)', '0 (thyroid hormone-binding proteins)', '5HI47O6OA7 (diallyl disulfide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Allyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/*drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thyroid Hormones/metabolism']",,,2015/04/30 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/04/30 06:00'],"['2015/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.8.3509 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2015;16(8):3509-15. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.8.3509.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated mTOR pathway activation in T-cell lymphoma (TCL) cell lines and assessed antitumor activity in patients with relapsed/refractory TCL in a phase 2 trial. The mTOR pathway was activated in all 6 TCL cell lines tested and everolimus strongly inhibited malignant T-cell proliferation with minimal cytotoxic effects. Everolimus completely inhibited phosphorylation of ribosomal S6, a raptor/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) target, without a compensatory activation of the rictor/mTORC2 target Akt (S475). In the clinical trial, 16 patients with relapsed TCL were enrolled and received everolimus 10 mg by mouth daily. Seven patients (44%) had cutaneous (all mycosis fungoides); 4 (25%) had peripheral T cell not otherwise specified; 2 (13%) had anaplastic large cell; and 1 each had extranodal natural killer/T cell, angioimmunoblastic, and precursor T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma types. The overall response rate was 44% (7/16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 20% to 70%). The median progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95% CI, 1.5-6.5) and the median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI, 2.6-44.3). The median duration of response for the 7 responders was 8.5 months (95% CI, 1.0 to not reached). These studies indicate that everolimus has antitumor activity and provide proof-of-concept that targeting the mTORC1 pathway in TCL is clinically relevant.

Initially identified on histone proteins in the 1960s, lysine acetylation is now considered as an important form of post-translational modification that rivals phosphorylation. However, only about a dozen of human lysine acetyltransferases have been identified. Among them are MOZ (monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein; a.k.a. MYST3 and KAT6A) and its paralog MORF (a.k.a. MYST4 and KAT6B). Although there is a distantly related protein in Drosophila and sea urchin, these two enzymes are vertebrate-specific. They form tetrameric complexes with BRPF1 (bromodomain- and PHD finger-containing protein 1) and two small non-catalytic subunits. These two acetyltransferases and BRPF1 play key roles in various developmental processes; for example, they are important for development of hematopoietic and neural stem cells. The human KAT6A and KAT6B genes are recurrently mutated in leukemia, non-hematologic malignancies, and multiple developmental disorders displaying intellectual disability and various other abnormalities.

Studies have examined the relationship between CRLF2 alterations such as over-expression or deregulation and clinical outcome in childhood ALL, but the results are conflicting. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the association between CRLF2 alterations and survival of pediatric patients with ALL. METHODS: Electronic databases updated to March 2014 were searched for relevant studies. A meta-analysis was made of twelve studies including 5945 patients to evaluate the prognostic significance of CRLF2 alterations on survival in childhood ALL. Hazards ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled across the studies using a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: CRLF2 over-expression in childhood ALL was associated with poor prognosis in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS; HR=1.70, 95% CI=1.28-2.24, P=0.000), event-free survival (EFS; HR=1.78, 95% CI=1.05-3.01, P=0.032), and overall survival (OS; HR=2.28, 95% CI=1.42-3.65, P=0.001). The combined data also suggested that CRLF2 deregulation in childhood ALL was correlated with poor EFS (HR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46-2.61, P=0.000), RFS (HR=2.20, 95% CI=1.53-3.18, P=0.000), and OS (HR=1.89, 95% CI=1.24-2.87, P=0.003). Subgroup analysis on multivariate HRs showed that CRLF2 deregulation independently predicted a poor prognosis for childhood ALL. CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis reveals that both CRLF2 over-expression and deregulation are associated with poor prognosis in pediatric patients with ALL.",,"['Jia, Ming', 'Wang, Zhu-Jun', 'Zhao, Hai-Zhao', 'Shen, He-Ping', 'Cheng, Yu-Ping', 'Luo, Ze-Bin', 'Tang, Yong-Min']","['Jia M', 'Wang ZJ', 'Zhao HZ', 'Shen HP', 'Cheng YP', 'Luo ZB', 'Tang YM']","[""Division of Hematology-oncology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics (Zhejiang University), Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, 310003, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150430,Switzerland,World J Pediatr,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,101278599,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2015/04/30 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/04/30 06:00'],"['2013/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12519-015-0019-1 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Pediatr. 2015 May;11(2):126-33. doi: 10.1007/s12519-015-0019-1.

CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) is a key transcription factor that regulates myeloid differentiation. This study is aimed to know the prognostic value of CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha expression and correlate its expression with response to imatinib therapy. METHODS: We quantified the expression of C/EBPalpha gene in 126 chronic myeloid leukaemia samples (82 from newly diagnosed and 44 from imatinib-resistant patients) and 20 control samples. C/EBPalpha mRNA level was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction using the DeltaDeltaCT method. RESULTS: C/EBPalpha expression level was significantly lower in the imatinib-resistant group than in the pretreatment and control group (P = 0.0398). Low CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha levels in the imatinib-resistant group were significantly associated with advanced phase (P = 0.04), with more peripheral blasts (P = 0.0001), high BCR-ABL levels (P = 0.018) and T315I and P-loop mutations (P = 0.0002). In the pretreatment group, low expression showed association with high EUTOS risk score (P = 0.03) and possible partial cytogenetic response (P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that low expression of CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha might have a role in the response to imatinib and progression of disease in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia.","['(c) The Author 2015.

This pattern is highly non-specific. We recently became aware of a ""tumefactive pattern"" of NL, neuroleukemiosis (NLK) and neuroplasmacytoma (NPLC), which we believe is exclusive to hematologic diseases affecting peripheral nerves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We defined a ""tumefactive"" appearance as complex, fusiform, hyperintense on T2WI, circumferential tumor masses encasing the involved peripheral nerves. The nerves appear to be infiltrated by the tumor. Both structures show varying levels of homogenous enhancement. We reviewed our series of 52 cases of NL in search of this pattern; two extra outside cases of NL, three cases of NLK, and one case of NPLC were added to the series. RESULTS: We identified 20 tumefactive lesions in 18 patients (14 NL, three NLK, one NPLC). The brachial plexus (n = 7) was most commonly affected, followed by the sciatic nerve (n = 6) and lumbosacral plexus (n = 3). Four patients had involvement of other nerves. All were proven by biopsy: the diagnosis was high-grade lymphoma (n = 12), low-grade lymphoma (n = 3), acute leukemia (n = 2), and plasmacytoma (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: We present a new imaging pattern of ""tumefactive"" neurolymphomatosis, neuroleukemiosis, or neuroplasmacytoma in a series of 18 cases. We believe this pattern is associated with hematologic diseases directly involving the peripheral nerves. Knowledge of this association can provide a clue to clinicians in establishing the correct diagnosis. Bearing in mind that tumefactive NL, NLK, and NPLC is a newly introduced imaging pattern, we still recommend to biopsy patients with suspicion of a malignancy.",,"['Capek, Stepan', 'Hebert-Blouin, Marie-Noelle', 'Puffer, Ross C', 'Martinoli, Carlo', 'Frick, Matthew A', 'Amrami, Kimberly K', 'Spinner, Robert J']","['Capek S', 'Hebert-Blouin MN', 'Puffer RC', 'Martinoli C', 'Frick MA', 'Amrami KK', 'Spinner RJ']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, Gonda 8-214, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150429,Germany,Skeletal Radiol,Skeletal radiology,7701953,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Nerves/*pathology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,2015/04/30 06:00,2016/03/26 06:00,['2015/04/30 06:00'],"['2014/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00256-015-2151-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Skeletal Radiol. 2015 Jul;44(7):1001-9. doi: 10.1007/s00256-015-2151-3.

Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) is a major therapeutic option despite its risks, which include graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and infection. In Germany, about 1600 patients with myeloid malignancies undergo SCT each year. The indications for SCT have changed since the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and improved methods of SCT. METHODS: This article is based on relevant guidelines from Germany and abroad and on a selective review of the literature from 2010 onward. RESULTS: The individual indication for SCT is based on the risk of disease progression, accompanying illnesses, the probability that SCT will result in cure, and the risk of complications. There is good evidence favoring allogeneic SCT in the following situations affecting 20% to 50% of patients with the respective disease: advanced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or CML that does not respond to TKI, Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (Ph- MPN) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with a high risk of progression, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that has high-risk cytogenetic features or is recurrent. Good evidence is accumulating in favor of allogeneic SCT in older patients as well. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of patients with myeloid neoplasm can now be assessed more accurately than before. This facilitates well-founded clinical decision-making about SCT, which is the only potentially curative treatment for most patients with myeloid neoplasm. Patients up to about age 75 should be referred to a transplantation center for consultation at an early stage of their disease so that the treatment options can be evaluated. A major goal of current research is to reduce toxicity with innovative forms of treatment.",,"['Muller, Lutz P', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Muller LP', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Internal Medicine IV, University Hospital of Halle (Saale).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,,IM,"['Allografts', 'Clinical Decision-Making/*methods', 'Graft Rejection/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/*therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/04/30 06:00,2016/03/29 06:00,['2015/04/30 06:00'],"['2014/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['arztebl.2015.0262 [pii]', '10.3238/arztebl.2015.0262 [doi]']",ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2015 Apr 10;112(15):262-70. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2015.0262.,,PMC4419367,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we describe an exception to this paradigm. TRIM33 is identified here as a lineage dependency in B cell neoplasms and is shown to perform this essential function by associating with a single cis element. ChIP-seq analysis of TRIM33 in murine B cell leukemia revealed a preferential association with two lineage-specific enhancers that harbor an exceptional density of motifs recognized by the PU.1 TF. TRIM33 is recruited to these elements by PU.1, yet acts to antagonize PU.1 function. One of the PU.1/TRIM33 co-occupied enhancers is upstream of the pro-apoptotic gene Bim, and deleting this enhancer renders TRIM33 dispensable for leukemia cell survival.

However, inhibition of BCR/ABL alone is unable to eradicate Ph(+) leukemia. The t(9;22) is a reciprocal translocation which encodes not only for the der22 (Philadelphia chromosome) related BCR/ABL, but also for der9 related ABL/BCR fusion proteins, which can be detected in 65% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 100% of patients with Ph+ acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL). ABL/BCRs are oncogenes able to influence the lineage commitment of hematopoietic progenitors. Aim of this study was to further disclose the role of p96(ABL/BCR) for the pathogenesis of Ph(+) ALL. The co-expression of p96(ABL/BCR) enhanced the kinase activity and as a consequence, the transformation potential of p185(BCR/ABL). Targeting p96(ABL/BCR) by RNAi inhibited growth of Ph(+) ALL cell lines and Ph(+) ALL patient-derived long-term cultures (PD-LTCs). Our in vitro and in vivo stem cell studies further revealed a functional hierarchy of p96(ABL/BCR) and p185(BCR/AB)L in hematopoietic stem cells. Co-expression of p96(ABL/BCR) abolished the capacity of p185(BCR/ABL) to induce a CML-like disease and led to the induction of ALL.

However, cancer cells also express increased levels of antioxidant proteins which detoxify ROS. This includes glutathione, the major antioxidant in human cells, which has recently been identified to have dysregulated metabolism in human leukaemia. This suggests that critical balance of intracellular ROS levels is required for cancer cell function, growth, and survival. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) transcription factor plays a dual role in cancer. Primarily, NRF2 is a transcription factor functioning to protect nonmalignant cells from malignant transformation and oxidative stress through transcriptional activation of detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. However, once malignant transformation has occurred within a cell, NRF2 functions to protect the tumour from oxidative stress and chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, inhibition of the NRF2 oxidative stress pathway in leukaemia cells renders them more sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Our improved understanding of NRF2 biology in human leukaemia may permit mechanisms by which we could potentially improve future cancer therapies. This review highlights the mechanisms by which leukaemic cells exploit the NRF2/ROS response to promote their growth and survival.",,"['Abdul-Aziz, Amina', 'MacEwan, David J', 'Bowles, Kristian M', 'Rushworth, Stuart A']","['Abdul-Aziz A', 'MacEwan DJ', 'Bowles KM', 'Rushworth SA']","['Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich NR4 7UQ, UK.', 'Department of Molecular & Clinical Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GE, UK.', 'Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich NR4 7UQ, UK ; Department of Haematology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals National Health Service Trust, Norwich NR4 7UY, UK.', 'Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich NR4 7UQ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150330,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Damage', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/04/29 06:00'],"['2014/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/454659 [doi]'],ppublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2015;2015:454659. doi: 10.1155/2015/454659.

Participants of the CML Study IV, a randomized 5-arm trial designed to optimize imatinib therapy, were analyzed for comorbidities at diagnosis using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI); 511 indexed comorbidities were reported in 1519 CML patients. Age was an additional risk factor in 863 patients. Resulting CCI scores were as follows: CCI 2, n = 589; CCI 3 or 4, n = 599; CCI 5 or 6, n = 229; and CCI >/= 7, n = 102. No differences in cumulative incidences of accelerated phase, blast crisis, or remission rates were observed between patients in the different CCI groups. Higher CCI was significantly associated with lower OS probabilities. The 8-year OS probabilities were 93.6%, 89.4%, 77.6%, and 46.4% for patients with CCI 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6, and >/=7, respectively. In multivariate analysis, CCI was the most powerful predictor of OS, which was still valid after removal of its age-related components. Comorbidities have no impact on treatment success but do have a negative effect on OS, indicating that survival of patients with CML is determined more by comorbidities than by CML itself. OS may therefore be inappropriate as an outcome measure for specific CML treatments.

Mcl-1, a Bcl-2 family protein, functions as an oncogenic protein. The connection between mTORC2 and Mcl-1 stability has not been established and was thus the focus of this study. Mcl-1 levels in cancer cells were decreased by mTOR kinase inhibitors (TORKinibs), which inhibit both mTORCs, by knocking down rictor and by knocking out rictor or Sin1 but not by silencing raptor. TORKinib treatment and rictor knockdown did not alter Mcl-1 mRNA levels but rather decreased its protein stability. Moreover, TORKinib-induced Mcl-1 reduction was rescued by proteasome inhibition. Consistently, TORKinib increased Mcl-1 ubiquitination. Hence, it is clear that inhibition of mTORC2 enhances Mcl-1 degradation, resulting in Mcl-1 reduction. Suppression of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) or FBXW7 rescued Mcl-1 reduction induced by TORKinibs or rictor knockdown. Thus, mTORC2 inhibition apparently induces Mcl-1 degradation through a GSK3-dependent and SCF-FBXW7-mediated mechanism. Intriguingly, we detected a direct association between mTORC2 and SCF-FBXW7; this association could be inhibited by TORKinib treatment, suggesting that mTORC2 may directly associate with and inhibit the SCF-FBXW7 complex, resulting in delayed Mcl-1 degradation. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel mechanism by which mTORC2 regulates cell survival and growth by stabilizing Mcl-1.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Unfolding of the extracellular negative regulatory region (NRR), enabling successive proteolysis by the enzymes Adam10 and gamma-secretase, is rate-limiting in NOTCH activation. Mutations in the NOTCH1 NRR are associated with ligand-independent activation and frequently found in human T-cell malignancies. In mammals four NOTCH receptors and five Delta/Jagged ligands exist, but mutations in the NRR are only rarely reported for receptors other than NOTCH1. Using biochemical and functional assays, we compared the molecular mechanisms of ligand-independent signaling in NOTCH1 and the highly related NOTCH2 receptor. Both murine Notch1 and Notch2 require the metalloprotease protease Adam17, but not Adam10 during ligand-independent activation. Interestingly, the human NOTCH2 receptor is resistant to ligand-independent activation compared with its human homologs or murine orthologs. Taken together, our data reveal subtle but functionally important differences for the NRR among NOTCH paralogs and homologs.","['(c) 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Habets, Roger A J', 'Groot, Arjan J', 'Yahyanejad, Sanaz', 'Tiyanont, Kittichoat', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Vooijs, Marc']","['Habets RA', 'Groot AJ', 'Yahyanejad S', 'Tiyanont K', 'Blacklow SC', 'Vooijs M']","['From the Department of Radiotherapy (MaastRO)/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology, Maastricht University, 6200 MD Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'From the Department of Radiotherapy (MaastRO)/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology, Maastricht University, 6200 MD Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'From the Department of Radiotherapy (MaastRO)/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology, Maastricht University, 6200 MD Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, and.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, and Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.', 'From the Department of Radiotherapy (MaastRO)/GROW, School for Developmental Biology & Oncology, Maastricht University, 6200 MD Maastricht, The Netherlands, marc.vooijs@maastrichtuniversity.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150427,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Notch2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (Adam17 protein, mouse)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/*metabolism', 'ADAM17 Protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Unfolding', 'Receptor, Notch1/chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch2/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2015/04/29 06:00'],"['2015/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)79529-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.643676 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Jun 5;290(23):14705-16. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.643676.

Patients with ARTEMIS deficiency usually present with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and cellular radiosensitivity, but hypomorphic mutations can cause milder phenotypes (leaky SCID). OBJECTIVE: We sought to correlate the functional effect of human DCLRE1C mutations on phenotypic presentation in patients with ARTEMIS deficiency. METHODS: We studied the recombination and DNA repair activity of 41 human DCLRE1C mutations in Dclre1c(-/-) v-abl kinase-transformed pro-B cells retrovirally engineered with a construct that allows quantification of recombination activity by means of flow cytometry. For assessment of DNA repair efficacy, resolution of gammaH2AX accumulation was studied after ionizing radiation. RESULTS: Low or absent activity was detected for mutations causing a typical SCID phenotype. Most of the patients with leaky SCID were compound heterozygous for 1 loss-of-function and 1 hypomorphic allele, with significant residual levels of recombination and DNA repair activity. Deletions disrupting the C-terminus result in truncated but partially functional proteins and are often associated with leaky SCID. Overexpression of hypomorphic mutants might improve the functional defect. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between the nature and location of DCLRE1C mutations, functional activity, and the clinical phenotype has been observed. Hypomorphic variants that have been reported in the general population can be disease causing if combined in trans with a loss-of-function allele. Therapeutic strategies aimed at inducing overexpression of hypomorphic alleles might be beneficial.","['Copyright (c) 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

However, we observed modest up-regulation of Ssb1 levels in Ssb2(-/-) MEFs as well as in Ssb2(-/-) thymus and spleen, suggesting that Ssb1 is likely able to compensate for the loss of Ssb2 in mice.

Recent studies have indicated that microRNAs play a significant role in this mechanism and can function as either tumor suppressor or tumor promoters. However the effect of miRNA in lung cancer chemoresistance is poorly understood. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the role of two distinct miR members, the miR-205 and the tumor suppressor miR-218 in the proliferation, invasion and induction of apoptosis in lung cancer cells after carboplatin treatment. The results showed that miR-205 overexpression in A549 and H1975 lung cancer cells is concurrent with the down regulation of miR-218 and in linked with carboplatin sensitivity and chemoresistance. Interestingly, ectopic miR-218 overexpression reduced cell proliferation, invasion and migration of lung cancer cells, whereas miR-205 rescued the suppressive effect of miR-218 by altering the expression levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins PARP, Caspase 3, Bax and upregulating the anti-apoptotic markers Mcl-1 and Survivin. Taken together our findings imply that the miRNAs miR-205 and miR-218 play a key role in the development of lung cancer acquired chemoresistance and the tumor suppressor role of miR-218 in inhibiting lung cancer cell tumorigenesis and overcoming platinum chemoresistance is significant for future cancer therapeutic approaches.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS: CEM cells were more sensitive to 6-TG and PDX in vitro than Molt4. In vivo, CEM cells were very sensitive to PDX and 6-TG, whereas Molt4 cells were highly resistant to 6-TG. A well-tolerated combination of PDX and 6-TG achieved significant tumor regression in CEM xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: The loss of MTAP expression may be therapeutically exploited in T-cell ALL. The combination of 6-TG and PDX, with the inclusion of leucovorin rescue, allows for a safe and effective regimen in MTAP-deficient T-cell ALL.",,"['Tedeschi, Philip M', 'Kathari, Yamini K', 'Johnson-Farley, Nadine', 'Bertino, Joseph R']","['Tedeschi PM', 'Kathari YK', 'Johnson-Farley N', 'Bertino JR']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 195 Little Albany Street, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150428,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)']",IM,"['Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Heterografts/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*deficiency/genetics', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2015/04/29 06:00'],"['2014/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-015-2747-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2015 Jun;75(6):1247-52. doi: 10.1007/s00280-015-2747-2.

The dynamic interplay of isoforms p110delta and p110gamma in leukocytes support the hypothesis that dual blockade may provide a therapeutic benefit. IPI-145, an oral inhibitor of p110delta and p110gamma isoforms, sensitizes BCR-stimulated and/or stromal co-cultured primary CLL cells to apoptosis (median 20%, n=57; P<0.0001) including samples with poor prognostic markers, unmutated IgVH (n=28) and prior treatment (n=15; P<0.0001). IPI-145 potently inhibits the CD40L/IL-2/IL-10 induced proliferation of CLL cells with an IC50 in sub-nanomolar range. A corresponding dose-responsive inhibition of pAKT(Ser473) is observed with an IC50 of 0.36 nM. IPI-145 diminishes the BCR-induced chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 secretion to 17% and 37%, respectively. Pre-treatment with 1 muM IPI-145 inhibits the chemotaxis toward CXCL12; reduces pseudoemperipolesis to median 50%, inferring its ability to interfere with homing capabilities of CLL cells.

Despite its relatively low recurrence risk, this subgroup generates a high proportion of relapses. The cause and origin of these relapses remains obscure. We therefore explored the mutational landscape in high hyperdiploid (HD) ALL with whole-exome (n=19) and subsequent targeted deep sequencing of 60 genes in 100 relapsing and 51 non-relapsing cases. We identified multiple clones at diagnosis that were primarily defined by a variety of mutations in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras pathway and chromatin-modifying genes. The relapse clones consisted of reappearing as well as new mutations, and overall contained more mutations. Although RTK/Ras pathway mutations were similarly frequent between diagnosis and relapse, both intergenic and intragenic heterogeneity was essentially lost at relapse. CREBBP mutations, however, increased from initially 18-30% at relapse, then commonly co-occurred with KRAS mutations (P<0.001) and these relapses appeared primarily early (P=0.012). Our results confirm the exceptional susceptibility of HD ALL to RTK/Ras pathway and CREBBP mutations, but, more importantly, suggest that mutant KRAS and CREBBP might cooperate and equip cells with the necessary capacity to evolve into a relapse-generating clone.",,"['Malinowska-Ozdowy, K', 'Frech, C', 'Schonegger, A', 'Eckert, C', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Stanulla, M', 'zur Stadt, U', 'Mecklenbrauker, A', 'Schuster, M', 'Kneidinger, D', 'von Stackelberg, A', 'Locatelli, F', 'Schrappe, M', 'Horstmann, M A', 'Attarbaschi, A', 'Bock, C', 'Mann, G', 'Haas, O A', 'Panzer-Grumayer, R']","['Malinowska-Ozdowy K', 'Frech C', 'Schonegger A', 'Eckert C', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Stanulla M', 'zur Stadt U', 'Mecklenbrauker A', 'Schuster M', 'Kneidinger D', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Locatelli F', 'Schrappe M', 'Horstmann MA', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Bock C', 'Mann G', 'Haas OA', 'Panzer-Grumayer R']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Leukemia Biology Group, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Leukemia Biology Group, Vienna, Austria."", 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM), Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Leukemia Biology Group, Vienna, Austria."", 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM), Vienna, Austria.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Leukemia Biology Group, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Schleswig Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'St. Anna Kinderspital, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM), Vienna, Austria.', 'St. Anna Kinderspital, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', ""1] Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Leukemia Biology Group, Vienna, Austria [2] St. Anna Kinderspital, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Leukemia Biology Group, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150428,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clonal Evolution', '*Diploidy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Survival Rate', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/04/29 06:00'],"['2015/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015107 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.107 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1656-67. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.107.

We analyze the immunobiology of MSCs derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and their impact on NK cell function. In contrast to the inhibitory effects on the immune response exerted by MSCs from healthy donors (Healthy-MSCs), we demonstrate that MSCs derived from low/intermediate risk ALL patients at diagnosis (ALL-MSCs) promote an efficient NK cell response including cytokine production, phenotypic activation and most importantly, cytotoxicity. Longitudinal studies indicate that these immunostimulatory effects of ALL-MSCs are progressively attenuated. Healthy-MSCs adopt ALL-MSC-like immunomodulatory features when exposed to leukemia cells, acquiring the ability to stimulate NK cell antitumor function. The mechanisms underlying to these functional changes of ALL-MSCs include reduced production of soluble inhibitory factors, differential expression of costimulatory and coinhibitory molecules, increased expression of specific TLRs and Notch pathway activation.

Studies have identified that not only MDR1 but other ATP-binding cassette transport proteins (ABC transporters) are involved in the development of imatinib resistance. Here, we tried to study the role of COX-2 in the regulation of other ABC transporters such as MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, ABCA2 and ABCG2 that have been already implicated in imatinib resistance development. The results of the study clearly indicated that overexpression of COX-2 lead to upregulation of MRP family proteins in IR-K562 cells and celecoxib down-regulated the ABC transporters through Wnt and MEK signaling pathways.

Data addressing the incidence and phenotypic features of abnormal B lymphoblasts in CML, and whether the detection of B lymphoblasts inexorably heralds blast phase in CML, though, are limited. METHODS: We reviewed a consecutive series of patients with newly diagnosed CML who had undergone bone marrow examination with flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Polychromatic immunophenotyping data were reviewed, and clinical follow-up data were obtained. RESULTS: A precursor B-cell population with an abnormal composite immunophenotype was detected in 4 of 36 (11.1%) diagnostic bone marrow samples, at levels ranging from 0.01% to 0.30% of viable single cells acquired. The most common phenotypic aberrations were abnormally bright expression of CD10 and CD19 (seen in four and three cases, respectively), and abnormally dim expression of CD38 (seen in four cases). All three patients with adequate clinical follow-up have achieved and maintained a deep or major molecular response with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and none has progressed to B-lymphoblastic blast phase (follow-up duration: 17-46 months). CONCLUSIONS: In chronic-phase CML, a small (<0.5%) abnormal B-lymphoblast population is present in a significant minority of diagnostic bone marrow samples, but does not inevitably herald progression to B-lymphoblastic blast phase.

METHODS: 298 patients with de novo MDS from the first affiliated hospital of medical school, Zhejiang University were enrolled in the retrospective analysis of WHO classification, karyotype, and prognosis. Follow-up study was also conducted. RESULTS: The WHO classifications at first diagnosis were as follows: refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD), 18 cases; refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), 8 cases; refractory cytopenia with multiline dysplasia (RCMD), 104 cases; refractory anemia with excess blasts-1, 76 cases; refractory anemia with excess blasts-2, 85 cases; MDS unclassified (MDS-U), 5 cases involved; and single del (5q), 2 cases. 39.6% of MDS patients carried karyotypic abnormalities. Among them, the frequency of numerical abnormalities, structural abnormalities and the existence of composite abnormalities were 45, 31, and 42, respectively. The composite abnormalities were unbalanced translocations and complex chromosomal abnormalities. The incidence of both karyotypic abnormalities and complex chromosomal abnormalities in RAEB group was higher than that in non-RAEB group (P<0. 05). An analysis based on IPSS-R Scoring System showed that advanced risk stratification (except the low-risk group) gradually enhanced the incidence of karyotypic abnormalities (P<0.05). In addition, the probability of evolution to leukemia increased with the higher IPSS-R score (P<0.05). In RAEB group, the cases with +8 chromosome, accounting for 19.5% of karyotypic abnormalities, had worse prognosis than those with normal chromosomes. CONCLUSION: Karyotype was identified with an independent risk factor in MDS patients. Therefore, the information on cytogenetic analysis was critical for diagnosis, prognosis and individual treatment. MDS patients presenting+8 chromosome, an intermediate risk factor, were associated with a poorer outcome compared to cases with normal chromosomes in RAEB group.",,"['Yan, Xuefen', 'Wei, Juying', 'Wang, Jinghan', 'Ren, Yanling', 'Zhou, Xinping', 'Mei, Chen', 'Ye, Li', 'Xie, Lili', 'Hu, Chao', 'Jin, Jie', 'Tong, Hongyan']","['Yan X', 'Wei J', 'Wang J', 'Ren Y', 'Zhou X', 'Mei C', 'Ye L', 'Xie L', 'Hu C', 'Jin J', 'Tong H']","['MDS Center, 1st Affiliated Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'MDS Center, 1st Affiliated Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'MDS Center, 1st Affiliated Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'MDS Center, 1st Affiliated Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'MDS Center, 1st Affiliated Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'MDS Center, 1st Affiliated Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'MDS Center, 1st Affiliated Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'MDS Center, 1st Affiliated Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'MDS Center, 1st Affiliated Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'MDS Center, 1st Affiliated Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'MDS Center, 1st Affiliated Hospital College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['*Abnormal Karyotype', 'Anemia, Refractory', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'World Health Organization']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2015/04/29 06:00'],"['2015/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2015.04.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2015 Apr;36(4):297-301. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2015.04.008.,,PMC7342621,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequent autosomal monosomies were -7 and -17. 70 patients had complex karyotype (CK), in all patients and patients with abnormal karyotype accounted for 14.1% and 30.0%, respectively. Patients with MK were associated with significantly older (median age 62.5 vs 52 years, P=0.003), and lower HGB concentrations (62.5 vs 77 g/L, P=0.009) and lower WBC counts (7.0x10(9)/L vs 11.7x10(9)/L, P=0.008).

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 95 cases of Ph-aALL patients treated between January 2004 and December 2012 with Tongji-96 regimen in Tongji hospital, Shanghai. RESULTS: Among these 95 patients, the overall complete remission (CR) rate was 92.6%, 7-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were (39.3+/-5.9)% and (31.5+/-5.3)%, respectively, with the median survival of 28 months. Based on multivariable COX proportional hazards regression model analysis, patients with the poor karyotype and failed to achieve CR after first course induction therapy had a higher risk of mortality compared to those who had good or normal cytogenetics and achieved CR after 1 course of induction treatment [the risk ratios (RR) were 3.380 (95% CI 1.530-7.463, P=0.003) and 3.005 (95% CI 1.522-5.933, P=0.002)respectively]. By means of Kaplan-Meier analysis and Log-rank testpatients aged less than 60 years and successively achieved CR after first induction therapy had more favorable 7-year OS and EFS rates.

TKI resistance occurs in nearly all patients who receive TKI-targeting therapy, resulting in a modest overall survival benefit. Therefore, establishing a biomarker for early prediction and exploring the mechanism of primary TKI resistance is essential for improving the therapeutic efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer patients. In this study, we provide evidence indicating that paxillin (PXN) overexpression may confer TKI resistance in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, PXN-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation is responsible for TKI resistance via decreased Bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) and increased Mcl-1 expression due to modulating their protein stabilities by phosphorylation of BIM at serine 69 and Mcl-1 at threonine 163. The mechanistic action in the cell model was further confirmed by the observation of xenograft tumors in nude mice, revealing that the PXN-mediated TKI resistance was conquered by ERK inhibitor (AZD6244) and Bcl-2 family inhibitor (obatoclax), but the TKI resistance overcome by AZD6244 is more effective than that of obatoclax. Therefore, we suggest that PXN expression may be useful in predicting primary TKI resistance, and combining TKI with ERK inhibitors may clinically benefit EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumors exhibit high PXN expression.",,"['Wu, D-W', 'Chen, C-Y', 'Chu, C-L', 'Lee, H']","['Wu DW', 'Chen CY', 'Chu CL', 'Lee H']","['Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Cancer Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Surgery, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Cancer Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150427,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Paxillin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Random Allocation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2015/04/28 06:00'],"['2014/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2015120 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.120 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Feb 4;35(5):621-30. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.120.

Plk3 contributes to the control and progression of the cell cycle while acting as a mediator of apoptosis and various types of cellular stress.

To identify dyregulated genes in SeS, we performed transcriptional profiling of Sezary cells (SCs) obtained from peripheral blood of patients with SeS. We identified versican as the highest upregulated gene in SCs. VCAN is an extracellular matrix proteoglycan, which is known to interfere with different cellular processes in cancer. Versican isoform V1 was the most commonly upregulated isoform in SCs. Using a lentiviral plasmid, we overexpressed versican V1 isoform in lymphoid cell lines, which altered their growth behavior by promoting formation of smaller cell clusters and by increasing their migratory capacity towards stromal cell-derived factor 1, thus promoting skin homing. Versican V1 overexpression exerted an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, partially by promoting activation-induced cell death. Furthermore, V1 overexpression in lymphoid cell lines increased their sensitivity to doxorubicin and gemcitabine. In conclusion, we confirm versican as one of the dysregulated genes in SeS and describe its effects on the biology of SCs. Although versican overexpression confers lymphoid cells with increased migratory capacity, it also makes them more sensitive to activation-induced cell death and some chemotherapeutics, which could be exploited further for therapeutic purposes.",,"['Fujii, K', 'Karpova, M B', 'Asagoe, K', 'Georgiev, O', 'Dummer, R', 'Urosevic-Maiwald, M']","['Fujii K', 'Karpova MB', 'Asagoe K', 'Georgiev O', 'Dummer R', 'Urosevic-Maiwald M']","['Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150427,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (VCAN protein, human)', '126968-45-4 (Versicans)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Movement', '*Cell Proliferation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sezary Syndrome/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Versicans/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015103 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.103 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Oct;29(10):2024-32. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.103.

In particular, it remains untested whether microRNA dysregulation could contribute to the emergence of the aggressive subset of B-cell lymphomas that coexpress MYC and BCL2. Here, we identify microRNA-124 (miR-124) as a negative regulator of MYC and BCL2 expression in B-cell lymphomas. Concordantly, stable or transient ectopic expression of miR-124 suppressed cell proliferation and survival, whereas genetic inhibition of this miRNA enhanced the fitness of these tumors. Mechanistically, the activities of miR-124 towards MYC and BCL2 intersect with both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive pathways. In respect to the former, we show that miR-124 directly targets nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65, and using genetic approaches, we demonstrate that this interaction accounts for the miR-124-mediated suppression of MYC and BCL2. We also characterized miR-124 promoter region and identified a functional p53 binding site. In agreement with this finding, endogenous or ectopic expression of wild-type, but not mutant, p53 increased miR-124 levels and suppressed p65, MYC and BCL2.

In a multivariate analysis, the presence of EMD did not affect either OS (hazard ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-1.09), LFS (0.98, 0.89-1.09), TRM (relative risk 0.92, 95% CI 0.80-1.16, P=0.23) or relapse (relative risk=1.03, 95% CI, 0.92-1.16; P=0.62). Furthermore, the outcome of patients with EMD was not influenced by the location, timing of EMD, or intensity of conditioning regimen. The presence of EMD in AML does not affect transplant outcomes and should not be viewed as an independent adverse prognostic feature.",,"['Goyal, S D', 'Zhang, M-J', 'Wang, H-L', 'Akpek, G', 'Copelan, E A', 'Freytes, C', 'Gale, R P', 'Hamadani, M', 'Inamoto, Y', 'Kamble, R T', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Marks, D I', 'Nishihori, T', 'Olsson, R F', 'Reshef, R', 'Ritchie, D S', 'Saber, W', 'Savani, B N', 'Seber, A', 'Shea, T C', 'Tallman, M S', 'Wirk, B', 'Bunjes, D W', 'Devine, S M', 'de Lima, M', 'Weisdorf, D J', 'Uy, G L']","['Goyal SD', 'Zhang MJ', 'Wang HL', 'Akpek G', 'Copelan EA', 'Freytes C', 'Gale RP', 'Hamadani M', 'Inamoto Y', 'Kamble RT', 'Lazarus HM', 'Marks DI', 'Nishihori T', 'Olsson RF', 'Reshef R', 'Ritchie DS', 'Saber W', 'Savani BN', 'Seber A', 'Shea TC', 'Tallman MS', 'Wirk B', 'Bunjes DW', 'Devine SM', 'de Lima M', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Uy GL']","['St Louis University Medical Center, St Louis, MO, USA.', '1] Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA [2] Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Society, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Section of Hematology Oncology, Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center, Gilbert, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Levine Cancer Institute, Carolinas HealthCare System, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'South Texas Veterans Health Care System and University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Hematology Research Centre, Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Seidman Cancer Center, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

Our objective was to determine the impact of a patient-reported outcome (PRO) coordinator on HRQL questionnaire completion rates during a pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) trial. METHODS: AAML1031 is a multicenter Children's Oncology Group therapeutic trial for de novo AML with a secondary aim to assess HRQL of children and adolescents treated with chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Parents/guardians are the primary respondents and four questionnaires are administered at eight time points. The questionnaires are the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales, PedsQL 3.0 Acute Cancer Module, PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, and the Pediatric Inventory for Parents. To improve response rates, a central PRO coordinator was instituted and reminded sites about upcoming and delinquent questionnaires. The proportion of HRQL questionnaires completed were compared prior to, and following institution of the PRO coordinator. This analysis evaluated the first five assessment time points. RESULTS: There were231 families who consented to participate in the HRQL aim. Overall response rates for all questionnaires were 73-83%. At time point 1, within 14 days of chemotherapy initiation, post-PRO coordinator completion rates were significantly higher for three of four questionnaires. However, the effect was not sustained and at time point 4, one month following last chemotherapy or HSCT, completion rates were significantly lower post-PRO coordinator for all four questionnaires. CONCLUSION: Addition of a central PRO coordinator did not result in sustained improvement in HRQL questionnaire completion rates. Efforts to improve response rates must consider other strategies.",,"['Johnston, Donna', 'Gerbing, Robert', 'Alonzo, Todd', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Nagarajan, Rajaram', 'Schulte, Fiona', 'Cullen, Patricia', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Johnston D', 'Gerbing R', 'Alonzo T', 'Aplenc R', 'Nagarajan R', 'Schulte F', 'Cullen P', 'Sung L']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California, United States of America."", 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.', ""Pediatric Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."", ""Division of Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", 'Departments of Oncology and Pediatrics, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Loretto Heights School of Nursing, Regis University, Denver, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150427,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology/therapy', '*Quality of Life/psychology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods', '*Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2016/04/19 06:00,['2015/04/28 06:00'],"['2014/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0125290 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-31741 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 27;10(4):e0125290. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0125290. eCollection 2015.,"['1U10CA180886-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1U10CA180899-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4411136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of medulloblastoma cell survival and proliferation, but the molecular mechanisms and downstream effectors underlying PI3K signaling still remain elusive. The impact of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of PI3K isoforms p110alpha and p110delta on global gene expression was investigated by DNA microarray analysis in medulloblastoma cell lines. A subset of genes with selectively altered expression upon p110alpha silencing in comparison to silencing of the closely related p110delta isoform was revealed. Among these genes, the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor alpha (LIFR alpha) was validated as a novel p110alpha target in medulloblastoma. A network involving c-Myc and miR-125b was shown to be involved in the control of LIFRalpha expression downstream of p110alpha. Targeting the LIFRalpha by RNAi, or by using neutralizing reagents impaired medulloblastoma cell proliferation in vitro and induced a tumor volume reduction in vivo. An analysis of primary tumors revealed that LIFRalpha and p110alpha expression were elevated in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup of medulloblastoma, indicating its clinical relevance. Together, these data reveal a novel molecular signaling network, in which PI3K isoform p110alpha controls the expression of LIFRalpha via c-Myc and miR-125b to promote MB cell proliferation.",,"['Salm, Fabiana', 'Dimitrova, Valeriya', 'von Bueren, Andre O', 'Cwiek, Paulina', 'Rehrauer, Hubert', 'Djonov, Valentin', 'Anderle, Pascale', 'Arcaro, Alexandre']","['Salm F', 'Dimitrova V', 'von Bueren AO', 'Cwiek P', 'Rehrauer H', 'Djonov V', 'Anderle P', 'Arcaro A']","['Department of Clinical Research, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Georg August University Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Functional Genomics Center Zurich, ETH and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Anatomy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Bern, Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research TransCure, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research Molecular Oncology, Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, School of Life Sciences, Lausanne, Switzerland; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150427,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Medulloblastoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2016/01/19 06:00,['2015/04/28 06:00'],"['2014/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0123958 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-37239 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 27;10(4):e0123958. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0123958. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4411098,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we sought to define the mechanism of the anti-leukemic effect of eltrombopag. Our studies demonstrate that, at a concentration of 5 muM E in 2% serum, E induces apoptosis in leukemia cells by triggering PARP cleavage and activation of caspase cascades within 2-6 hours. The induction of apoptotic enzymes is critically dependent on drug concentration and the concentration of serum. This effect is not associated with an alteration in mitochondrial potential but is associated with a rapid decrease in a reactive oxygen species (ROS) in particular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Interestingly, E also decreases mitochondrial maximal and spare respiratory capacities suggesting an induced mitochondrial dysfunction that may not be readily apparent under basal conditions but becomes manifest only under stress. Co-treatment of MOLM14 AML cells with E plus Tempol or H2O2 provides a partial rescue of cell toxicity. Ferric ammonioum citrate (FAC) also antagonized the E induced toxicity, by inducing notable increase in ROS level.

However, the mechanisms responsible for microenvironment-mediated chemoprotection remain unclear. We showed that bone marrow (BM) stromal cytochrome P450 (CYP)26 enzymes protect normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the pro-differentiation effects of retinoic acid. Here, we investigated if stromal expression of CYPs is a general mechanism of chemoprotection. We found that similar to human hepatocytes, human BM-derived stromal cells expressed a variety of drug-metabolizing enzymes. CYP3A4, the liver's major drug-metabolizing enzyme, was at least partially responsible for BM stroma's ability to protect multiple myeloma (MM) and leukemia cells from bortezomib and etoposide, respectively, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, clarithromycin overcame stromal-mediated MM resistance to dexamethasone, suggesting that CYP3A4 inhibition plays a role in its ability to augment the activity of lenalidomide and dexamethasone as part of the BiRd regimen. We uncovered a novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance, whereby the BM niche creates a sanctuary site from drugs.

In hematologic malignancies normal hematopoiesis is interrupted by uncontrolled growth of a genetically altered stem or progenitor cell (HSPC) that maintains its ability of self-renewal. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) not only regulate the mammalian cell cycle, but also influence other vital cellular processes, such as stem cell renewal, differentiation, transcription, epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Chromosomal translocations, amplification, overexpression and altered CDK activities have been described in different types of human cancer, which have made them attractive targets for pharmacological inhibition. Mouse models deficient for one or more CDKs have significantly contributed to our current understanding of the physiological functions of CDKs, as well as their roles in human cancer. The present review focuses on selected cell cycle kinases with recent emerging key functions in hematopoiesis and in hematopoietic malignancies, such as CDK6 and its role in MLL-rearranged leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, CDK1 and its regulator WEE-1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and cyclin C/CDK8/CDK19 complexes in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. The knowledge gained from gene knockout experiments in mice of these kinases is also summarized. An overview of compounds targeting these kinases, which are currently in clinical development in various solid tumors and hematopoietic malignances, is presented. These include the CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors (palbociclib, LEE011, LY2835219), pan-CDK inhibitors that target CDK1 (dinaciclib, flavopiridol, AT7519, TG02, P276-00, terampeprocol and RGB 286638) as well as the WEE-1 kinase inhibitor, MK-1775.

Promising immune targets include the toll-like receptors, calreticulin/CD47, the stimulator of interferon genes pathway, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).

In a preceding published study, we utilized real-time PCR measurement of Indicator genes in acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) as a way of application of microarray gene signatures. More to the point, the specificity of such genes for this distinction was investigated by their measurement in cases afflicted with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and with normal bone marrow (BM). MATERIAL AND METHOD: Mononuclear cells were sorted into unselected (total), CD34+ve, and CD34-ve fractions, mRNA globally amplified by using PolyA PCR. Moreover, the level of expression of 17 Indicator genes was identified by using real-time PCR. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed in expression for any gene among CML cases. Cyclin D3 (p</=0.04) was exclusively upregulated in CML in the CD34+ fraction, notwithstanding upregulation of HkrT-1 (p</=0.02) and fumarylacetoacetate (p</=0.03) in AML. HOXA9 experienced a non-significant upregulation in AML; however, in combination with proteoglycan 1 distinguished between AML and normal samples in the CD34- fraction in unsupervised clustering. Unsupervised clustering distinguished among AML and the other diagnostic groups.

Cell viability, subdiploid DNA and cell cycle were analysed by propidium iodide permeability and flow cytometry analyses. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V-Fluorescein isothiocyanate assays. Western-blot analysis was used for determination of expression levels of apoptotic factors (p53, Bax and Bcl2), intracellular kinases [serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)], NFkappaB factor and caspases. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was usefully applied to study DNA-NFkappaB interaction. In NB4 cells, vinblastine produces alteration of p53 and DNA fragmentation. Vinblastine treatment had an antiproliferative effect via the induction of apoptosis producing Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance. Vinblastine treatment suppressed NFkappaB expression and depressed NFkappaB-DNA binding activity while maintaining JNK activation that subsequently resulted in apoptotic response through caspase-dependent pathway. Our study provides a possible anti-cancer mechanism of vinblastine action on NB4 cells by deregulation of the intracellular signalling cascade affecting to JNK activation and NFkappaB expression. Moreover, JNK activation and NFkappaB depression can be very significant factors in apoptosis induction by vinblastine.","['Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Calvino, Eva', 'Tejedor, M Cristina', 'Sancho, Pilar', 'Herraez, Angel', 'Diez, Jose C']","['Calvino E', 'Tejedor MC', 'Sancho P', 'Herraez A', 'Diez JC']","['Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Dpto. de Biologia de Sistemas, Facultad de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Campus Universitario, Universidad de Alcala, Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Dpto. de Biologia de Sistemas, Facultad de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Campus Universitario, Universidad de Alcala, Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Dpto. de Biologia de Sistemas, Facultad de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Campus Universitario, Universidad de Alcala, Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Dpto. de Biologia de Sistemas, Facultad de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Campus Universitario, Universidad de Alcala, Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Dpto. de Biologia de Sistemas, Facultad de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Campus Universitario, Universidad de Alcala, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150423,England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bax', 'Bcl-2', 'JNK', 'NFkappaB', 'apoptosis', 'leukaemia', 'p53', 'vinblastine']",2015/04/29 06:00,2016/03/16 06:00,['2015/04/28 06:00'],"['2014/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbf.3105 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 2015 Jun;33(4):211-9. doi: 10.1002/cbf.3105.

However, results are disappointing, and these agents can cause some serious side effects. Therefore, recent studies have focused on the possible roles of natural products to overcome these limitations. METHODS: Salivary gland cancer cells treated with or without Convallaria keiskei (MECK) for 24 hours. Apoptotic changes were evaluated by live/dead assay, immunoblotting, and expression levels of caspase-3 and B-cell lymphoma-2 family member. RESULTS: MECK significantly inhibited salivary gland cancer growth. At the molecular level, MECK dramatically reduced myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in a translation-dependent manner and thereby induced apoptosis through Bax/Bid. Furthermore, we found that Mcl-1 could be a potential therapeutic target of MECK-induced apoptosis and its stability is regulated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling CONCLUSION: MECK can be used as a safe and efficient therapeutic alternative for the treatment of salivary gland cancer.

The temporal and spatial integrity of the genome ensures continued survival of a cell. DNA breakage is the first step towards creation of chromosomal translocations. In this review, we highlight the factors contributing towards the breakage of chromosomal DNA. It has been well-established that the structure and sequence of DNA play a critical role in selective fragility of the genome. Several non-B-DNA structures such as Z-DNA, cruciform DNA, G-quadruplexes, R loops and triplexes have been implicated in generation of genomic fragility leading to translocations. Similarly, specific sequences targeted by proteins such as Recombination Activating Genes and Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase are involved in translocations. Processes that ensure the integrity of the genome through repair may lead to persistence of breakage and eventually translocations if their actions are anomalous. An insufficient supply of nucleotides and chromatin architecture may also play a critical role.

Here, we report the outcome of 97 pediatric patients with de novo AMKL (excluding Down syndrome [DS]) enrolled in the prospective multicenter studies AML-BFM 98 and AML-BFM 04 (1998-2014). AMKL occurred in 7.4 % of pediatric AML cases, at younger age (median 1.44 years) and with lower white blood cell count (mean 16.5 x 10(9)/L) as compared to other AML subgroups. With 60 +/- 5 %, children with AMKL had a lower 5-year overall survival (5-year OS; vs. 68 +/- 1 %, P log rank = 0.038). Yet, we achieved an improved 5-year OS in AML-BFM 04 compared to AML-BFM 98 (70 +/- 6 % vs. 45 +/- 8 %, P log rank = 0.041). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first remission did not provide a significant survival benefit (5-year OS 70 +/- 11 % vs. 63 +/- 6 %; P Mantel-Byar = 0.85). Cytogenetic data were available for n = 78 patients. AMKL patients with gain of chromosome 21 had a superior 5-year OS (80 +/- 9 %, P log rank = 0.034), whereas translocation t(1;22)(p13;q13) was associated with an inferior 5-year event-free survival (38 +/- 17 %, P log rank = 0.04). However, multivariate analysis showed that treatment response (bone marrow morphology on day 15 and 28) was the only independent prognostic marker (RR = 4.39; 95 % CI, 1.97-9.78). Interestingly, GATA1-mutations were detected in six patients (11 %) without previously known trisomy 21. Thus, AMKL (excluding DS) remains an AML subgroup with inferior outcome.

Computational approaches have been considered as appropriate methods for prior safety assessment of chemicals and tools to aid in structural designing. The present study is an attempt to investigate the chemical attributes of a wide variety of ILs towards their cytotoxicity in leukemia rat cell line IPC-81 through the development of nonlinear quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models in the light of the OECD principles for QSAR development. Here, the cascade correlation network (CCN), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and generalized regression neural networks (GRNN) QSAR models were established for the discrimination of ILs in four categories of cytotoxicity and their end-point prediction using few simple descriptors. The diversity and nonlinearity of the considered dataset were evaluated through computing the Euclidean distance and Brock-Dechert-Scheinkman statistics. The constructed QSAR models were validated with external test data. The predictive power of these models was established through a variety of stringent parameters recommended in QSAR literature. The classification QSARs rendered the accuracy of >86%, and the regression models yielded correlation (R(2)) of >0.90 in test data. The developed QSAR models exhibited high statistical confidence and identified the structural elements of the ILs responsible for their cytotoxicity and, hence, could be useful tools in structural designing of safer and green ILs.",,"['Gupta, Shikha', 'Basant, Nikita', 'Singh, Kunwar P']","['Gupta S', 'Basant N', 'Singh KP']","['Environmental Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Post Box 80, Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Lucknow, 226 001, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150428,Germany,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,Environmental science and pollution research international,9441769,['0 (Ionic Liquids)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Ionic Liquids/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', '*Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rats', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2016/02/27 06:00,['2015/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11356-015-4526-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2015 Aug;22(16):12699-710. doi: 10.1007/s11356-015-4526-3.

In this study, we aimed to describe variations regarding clinical features, treatment modalities, time of restarting chemotherapy, and outcome in children with IFI and acute leukemia (AL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The charts of all pediatric AL patients in our clinic between the years of 2001 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients received prophylactic fluconazole during the chemotherapy period. RESULTS: IFI was identified in 25 (14%) of 174 AL patients. Most of them were in the consolidation phase of chemotherapy and the patients had severe neutropenia. The median time between leukemia diagnosis and definition of IFI was 122 days. Twenty-four patients had pulmonary IFI. The most frequent finding on computed tomography was typical parenchymal nodules. The episodes were defined as proven in 4 (16%) patients, probable in 7 (28%) patients, and possible in 14 (56%) patients. The median time for discontinuation of chemotherapy was 27 days. IFI was treated successfully in all patients with voriconazole, amphotericin B, caspofungin, or posaconazole alone or in combination. Chemotherapy was restarted in 50% of the patients safely within 4 weeks and none of those patients experienced reactivation of IFI. All of them were given secondary prophylaxis. The median time for antifungal treatment and for secondary prophylaxis was 26 and 90 days, respectively. None of the patients died due to IFI. CONCLUSION: Our data show that rapid and effective antifungal therapy with rational treatment modalities may decrease the incidence of death and that restarting chemotherapy within several weeks may be safe in children with AL and IFI.",,"['Tufekci, Ozlem', 'Yilmaz Bengoa, Sebnem', 'Demir Yenigurbuz, Fatma', 'Simsek, Erdem', 'Karapinar, Tuba Hilkay', 'Irken, Gulersu', 'Oren, Hale']","['Tufekci O', 'Yilmaz Bengoa S', 'Demir Yenigurbuz F', 'Simsek E', 'Karapinar TH', 'Irken G', 'Oren H']","['Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey Phone: +90 532 666 90 50 E-mail: hale.oren@deu.edu.tr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150427,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Febrile Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/drug therapy/etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2017/01/19 06:00,['2015/04/28 06:00'],"['2015/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.2014.0035 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2015 Dec;32(4):329-37. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2014.0035.

Although retroviral infection is prevalent in domestic cats, the roles of feline TRIM25 in the immune response against these viral infections are poorly understood. Because feline TRIM25 is expected to modulate the infection of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), we investigated its effects on early- and late-stage FeLV replication. This study revealed that ectopic expression of feline TRIM25 in HEK293T cells reduced viral protein levels leading to the inhibition of FeLV release.

We investigated the role of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) counteracting and recognizing LSC. Leukemia-associated antigens (LAA) represent immunogenic structures to target LSC. We enriched the LSC-containing fraction of 20 AML patients and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) of healthy volunteers. Using microarray analysis and qRT-PCR we detected high expression of several LAA in AML cells but also in LSC. PRAME (p = 0.0085), RHAMM (p = 0.03), WT1 (p = 0.04) and Proteinase 3 (p = 0.04) showed significant differential expression in LSC compared with HSC. PRAME, RHAMM and WT1 are furthermore also lower expressed on leukemic bulk. In contrast, Proteinase 3 indicates a higher expression on leukemic bulk than on LSC. In colony forming unit (CFU) immunoassays, T cells stimulated against various LAA indicated a significant inhibition of CFUs in AML patient samples. The LAA PRAME, RHAMM and WT1 showed highest immunogenic responses with a range up to 58-83%. In a proof of principle xenotransplant mouse model, PRAME-stimulated CTL targeted AML stem cells, reflected by a delayed engraftment of leukemia (p = 0.0159). Taken together, we demonstrated the expression of several LAA in LSC.

We therefore conducted a prospective study in commonly used xenograft recipient strains. From BALB/c nude mice engrafted with MCF7 human mammary carcinoma cells, we isolated a virus that was virtually identical to Bxv1, a locus encoding replication-competent xenotropic MLV (XMLV). XMLV was detected in 9/17 (53%) independently isolated explants. XMLV was not found in primary leukemias or in THP1 leukemia cells grown in Bxv1-negative NSG (NOD/SCID/gammaCnull) mice, although MCF7 explants harbored replication-defective MLV proviruses. To assess the significance of infection for xenograft behavior in vivo, we examined changes in growth and global transcription in MCF7 and the highly susceptible Raji Burkitt lymphoma cell line chronically infected with XMLV. Raji cells showed a stronger transcriptional response that included up-regulation of chemokines and effectors of innate antiviral immunity. In conclusion, the risk of de novo XMLV infection of xenografts is high in Bxv1 positive mice, while infection can have positive or negative effects on xenograft growth potential with significant consequences for interpretation of many xenograft studies.",,"['Naseer, Asif', 'Terry, Anne', 'Gilroy, Kathryn', 'Kilbey, Anna', 'Watts, Ciorsdaidh', 'Mackay, Nancy', 'Bell, Margaret', 'Mason, Susan', 'Blyth, Karen', 'Cameron, Ewan', 'Neil, James C']","['Naseer A', 'Terry A', 'Gilroy K', 'Kilbey A', 'Watts C', 'Mackay N', 'Bell M', 'Mason S', 'Blyth K', 'Cameron E', 'Neil JC']","['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Garscube Estate, Bearsden Road, G61 1QH Glasgow, UK. a.naseer.1@research.gla.ac.uk.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Garscube Estate, Bearsden Road, G61 1QH Glasgow, UK. anne.terry@glasgow.ac.uk.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Garscube Estate, Bearsden Road, G61 1QH Glasgow, UK. kathryn.gilroy@glasgow.ac.uk.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Garscube Estate, Bearsden Road, G61 1QH Glasgow, UK. anna.kilbey@glasgow.ac.uk.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Garscube Estate, Bearsden Road, G61 1QH Glasgow, UK. ciorsdaidh.watts@glasgow.ac.uk.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Garscube Estate, Bearsden Road, G61 1QH Glasgow, UK. annie.mackay@glasgow.ac.uk.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow, Garscube Estate, Bearsden Road, G61 1QH Glasgow, UK. margaret.bell@glasgow.ac.uk.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Garscube Estate, Switchback Road, Bearsden, G61 1BD Glasgow, UK. s.mason@beatson.gla.ac.uk.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Garscube Estate, Switchback Road, Bearsden, G61 1BD Glasgow, UK. k.blyth@beatson.gla.ac.uk.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow, Garscube Estate, Bearsden Road, G61 1QH Glasgow, UK. ewan.cameron@glasgow.ac.uk.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Garscube Estate, Bearsden Road, G61 1QH Glasgow, UK. james.neil@glasgow.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150417,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,,IM,"['Animals', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*isolation & purification', 'Heterografts/*virology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms/*virology', 'Prospective Studies']",,,2015/04/29 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/04/28 06:00'],"['2014/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['v7042014 [pii]', '10.3390/v7042014 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2015 Apr 17;7(4):2014-29. doi: 10.3390/v7042014.,"['11951/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A11951/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",PMC4411688,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are regularly associated with complex syndromes, including DiGeorge syndrome and Holt-Oram syndrome, which are characterised by haploinsufficiency for the T-box transcription factors TBX1 and TBX5, respectively. The histone acetyltransferase monocytic leukaemia zinc finger protein, MOZ (MYST3/KAT6A), is required for the expression of the Tbx1 and Tbx5 genes. Homozygous loss of MOZ results in DiGeorge syndrome-like defects including VSD. The Moz gene is expressed in the ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal aspects of the developing pharyngeal apparatus and heart; however it is unclear in which of these tissues MOZ is required for heart development. The role of MOZ in the activation of Tbx1 would suggest a requirement for MOZ in the mesoderm, because deletion of Tbx1 in the mesoderm causes VSDs. Here, we investigated the tissue-specific requirements for MOZ in the mesoderm. We demonstrate that Mesp1-cre-mediated deletion of Moz results in high penetrance of VSDs and overriding aorta and a significant decrease in MOZ-dependant Tbx1 and Tbx5 expression. Together, our data suggest that the molecular pathogenesis of VSDs in Moz germline mutant mice is due to loss of MOZ-dependant activation of mesodermal Tbx1 and Tbx5 expression.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore we assessed three structurally related PI3K inhibitors targeting the PI3K-delta isoform for their ability to inhibit the survival of freshly isolated CLL cells. The purely PI3K-delta-selective inhibitor idelalisib was compared to copanlisib (BAY 80-6946) and duvelisib (IPI-145), with isoform target profiles that additionally include PI3K-alpha or PI3K-gamma, respectively. The concentrations leading to half-maximal reduction of the survival of CLL cells were more than ten-fold lower for copanlisib than for idelalisib and duvelisib. At concentrations reflecting the biological availability of the different inhibitors, high levels of apoptotic response among CLL samples were attained more consistently with copanlisib than with idelalisib. Copanlisib selectively reduced the survival of CLL cells compared to T cells and to B cells from healthy donors. In addition copanlisib and duvelisib impaired the migration of CLL cells towards CXCL12 to a greater extent than equimolar idelalisib. Similarly copanlisib and duvelisib reduced the survival of CLL cells in co-cultures with the bone marrow stroma cell line HS-5 more strongly than idelalisib. Survival inhibition by copanlisib and idelalisib was enhanced by the monoclonal CD20 antibodies rituximab and obinutuzumab (GA101), while antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mediated by alemtuzumab and peripheral blood mononuclear cells was not substantially impaired by both PI3K inhibitors for the CLL-derived JVM-3 cell line as target cells.

AID can also be pathogenic by contributing to autoimmune diseases and oncogenic mutations. Moreover, AID can exert noncanonical functions when aberrantly expressed in epithelial cells. The lack of specific inhibitors prevents therapeutic applications to modulate AID functions. Here, we have exploited our previous finding that the HSP90 molecular chaperoning pathway stabilizes AID in B cells, to test whether HSP90 inhibitors could target AID in vivo. We demonstrate that chronic administration of HSP90 inhibitors decreases AID protein levels and isotype switching in immunized mice. HSP90 inhibitors also reduce disease severity in a mouse model of acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia in which AID accelerates disease progression. We further show that human AID protein levels are sensitive to HSP90 inhibition in normal and leukemic B cells, and that HSP90 inhibition prevents AID-dependent epithelial to mesenchymal transition in a human breast cancer cell line in vitro. Thus, we provide proof-of-concept that HSP90 inhibitors indirectly target AID in vivo and that endogenous human AID is widely sensitive to them, which could have therapeutic applications.","['(c) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Twenty patients were treated with OPB-51602 at doses of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 mg in the ""3 + 3"" dose escalation design. The most common treatment-related adverse events included nausea (55%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (45%), and diarrhea (40%). The most frequently observed grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events were neutropenia (20%), leukopenia (15%), lymphopenia (10%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). The MTD was 6 mg, with dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 lactic acidosis and increased blood lactic acid levels observed in one of three patients and grade 1-2 peripheral neuropathy in three of three patients. The recommended dose was determined to be 4 mg. OPB-51602 was rapidly absorbed, and exposure tended to increase in a dose-dependent manner. Accumulation of OPB-51602 was seen with 4 weeks of multiple treatments. No clear therapeutic response was observed. Durable stable disease was observed in two patients with acute myeloid leukemia and one with myeloma. In conclusion, the MTD of OPB-51602 was 6 mg. OPB-51602 was safe and well tolerated in a dose range of 1-4 mg. However, long-term administration at higher doses was difficult with the daily dosing schedule, and no response was seen.

The significance of FLT3-ITD at diagnosis was retrospectively estimated for allo-HSCT (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) outcomes in 140 patients, median age of 38, undergoing allo-HSCT after myeloablative conditioning in first complete remission of AML. FLT3-ITD was detected at AML diagnosis in 42/140 (30%) of included into this study patients. At 3 years, relapse incidence (RI) following allo-HSCT in AML patients with intermediate or normal karyotype was significantly higher in those FLT3-ITD positive than FLT3-ITD negative [52.9 vs. 20.4%, P = 0.002]. Additionally, patients with mild chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) had significantly lower RI compared to patients with moderate or severe grade cGvHD or those not experiencing cGvHD, respectively, 4.8 vs. 36.0 vs. 27.8%, P = 0.032. FLT3-ITD was harboring a poor prognosis in AML with intermediate or normal karyotype and significantly increased risk of relapse following allo-HSCT. It appears that allo-HSCT does not cure patients with FLT3-ITD, unless they develop symptoms of mild cGvHD and graft versus leukemia, which may decrease RI.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We present most recently available data from the Benghazi Cancer Registry concerning cancer incidence and mortality as well as the most comprehensive survival data set so far generated for cases diagnosed during 2003 to 2005 in Eastern Libya. METHODS: We collected and analyzed data on cancer incidence, mortality and survival that were obtained over a 3-year study period from January 1st 2003 to December 31st 2005 from the Benghazi Cancer Registry. RESULTS: A total of 3307 cancer patients were registered among residents during the study period. The world age-standardized incidence rate for all sites was 135.4 and 107.1 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively. The most common malignancies in men were cancers of lung (18.9%), colorectum (10.4%), bladder (10.1%), and prostate (9.4%); among women, they were breast (23.2%), colorectum (11.2%), corpus uteri (6.7%), and leukemia (5.1%). A total of 1367 deaths for cancer were recorded from 2003 to 2005; the leading causes of cancer death were cancers of the lung (29.3%), colorectum (8.2%), and brain (7.3%) in males and cancers of breast (14.8%), colorectum (10.6%), and liver (7%) in females. The 5-year relative survival for all cancer combined was 22.3%; survival was lower in men (19.8%) than in women (28.2%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an updated report on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival, in Eastern Libya which may represent a useful tool for planning future interventions toward a better cancer control.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, as half of the patients fail to respond to the treatment, the aim of this study was to evaluate circulating CLL cell depletion and clinical response according to the context of complement activation and FcgammaRIIIA polymorphism in ten CLL patients with relapsed/refractory disease. At the end of the treatment, results indicated that circulating CD5(+) CD19(+) CLL cell depletion was major (<0.01 x 10(9) /L) in 4 of 10 patients, partial (>50% decrease) in 4 of 10 patients and ineffective for the two other patients. No clinical modifications were observed following ofatumumab introduction. Ofatumumab administration leads to a rapid and important exhaustion of complement C4 levels in patients with initial lymphocytosis. C4 exhaustion was accelerated in a non-responder patient, and incomplete in two patients with partial circulating depletion. Moreover, delaying weekly to monthly ofatumumab injections improved CLL cell depletion in two patients. FcgammaRIIIA 158 polymorphism (FF n = 6 and VF n = 4) was not associated with major and/or partial circulating CLL cell depletion.

In this study, a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) approach was used to direct T cells to recognize B7H6(+) tumor cells. B7H6 is a specific ligand for the NK cell-activating receptor NKp30. B7H6 is expressed on various types of primary human tumors, including leukemia, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but it is not constitutively expressed on normal tissues. Data from this study showed that B7H6-specific BiTEs direct T cells to mediate cellular cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma secretion upon coculturing with B7H6(+) tumors. Furthermore, B7H6-specific BiTE exhibited no self-reactivity to proinflammatory monocytes. In vivo, B7H6-specific BiTE greatly enhanced the survival benefit of RMA/B7H6 lymphoma-bearing mice through perforin and IFN-gamma effector mechanisms. In addition, long-term survivor mice were protected against an RMA lymphoma tumor rechallenge. The B7H6-specific BiTE therapy also decreased tumor burden in murine melanoma and ovarian cancer models. In conclusion, B7H6-specific BiTE activates host T cells and has the potential to treat various B7H6(+) hematological and solid tumors.","['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Wu, Ming-Ru', 'Zhang, Tong', 'Gacerez, Albert T', 'Coupet, Tiffany A', 'DeMars, Leslie R', 'Sentman, Charles L']","['Wu MR', 'Zhang T', 'Gacerez AT', 'Coupet TA', 'DeMars LR', 'Sentman CL']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH 03756; and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH 03756; and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH 03756; and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH 03756; and.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH 03756.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH 03756; and Charles.L.Sentman@dartmouth.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150424,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B7 Antigens)', '0 (NCR3LG1 protein, human)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'B7 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interferon-gamma/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Melanoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Perforin/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,2015/04/26 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/04/26 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1402517 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1402517 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Jun 1;194(11):5305-11. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1402517.

Patients were randomized to rituximab maintenance (n=338) or observation (n=345). At a median follow-up of 45 months, the event-free survival rate (the primary endpoint) at 3 years was 80.1% for rituximab maintenance versus 76.5% for observation. This difference was not statistically significant for the intent-to-treat population (likelihood ratio P=0.0670). The hazard ratio by treatment arm was 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.57-1.08; P=0.1433). The secondary endpoint, progression-free survival was also not met for the whole statistical model (likelihood ratio P=0.3646). Of note, rituximab maintenance was superior to observation when treatment arms only were compared (hazard ratio: 0.62; 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.90; P=0.0120). Overall survival remained unchanged (92.0 versus 90.3%). In subgroup analysis male patients benefited from rituximab maintenance with regards to both event-free survival (84.1% versus 74.4%) (hazard ratio: 0.58; 95% confidence interval 0.36-0.94; P=0.0267) and progression-free survival (89.0% versus 77.6%) (hazard ratio: 0.45; 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.79; P=0.0058). Women had more grade 3/4 adverse events (P=0.0297) and infections (P=0.0341). Men with a low International Prognostic Index treated with rituximab had the best outcome. In summary, rituximab maintenance in first remission after R-CHOP-like treatment did not prolong event-free, progression-free or overall survival of patients with aggressive B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The significantly better outcome of men warrants further studies prior to the routine use of rituximab maintenance in men with low International Prognostic Index.

Here we show that Pbx3 and Meis1 need to dimerize to support Hox-induced leukemia and we analyze the molecular details of this cooperation. In the absence of Pbx3, Meis1 was highly unstable. As shown by a deletion analysis Meis1 degradation was contingent on a motif coinciding with the Pbx-binding domain. Either deletion of this sequence or binding to Pbx3 prolonged the half-life of Meis1 by preventing its ubiquitination. Meis1 break-down could also be blocked by inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system, indicating tight post-transcriptional control. In addition, Meis1 and Pbx3 cooperated genetically as overexpression of Pbx3 induced endogenous Meis1 transcription. These functional interactions translated into in vivo activity. Blocking Meis1/Pbx3 dimerization abrogated the ability to enhance proliferation and colony-forming cell numbers in primary cells transformed by Hoxa9. Furthermore, expression of Meis1 target genes Flt3 and Trib2 was dependent on Pbx3/Meis1 dimerization. This correlated with the requirement of Meis1 to bind Pbx3 in order to form high affinity DNA/Hoxa9/Meis1/Pbx3 complexes in vitro. Finally, kinetics and severity of disease in transplantation assays indicated that Pbx3/Meis1 dimers are rate-limiting factors for Hoxa9-induced leukemia.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Garcia-Cuellar, Maria-Paz', 'Steger, Julia', 'Fuller, Elisa', 'Hetzner, Katrin', 'Slany, Robert K']","['Garcia-Cuellar MP', 'Steger J', 'Fuller E', 'Hetzner K', 'Slany RK']","['Department of Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen, Germany robert.slany@fau.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150424,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (tribbles 2 protein, mouse)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitination', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",,,2015/04/26 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/04/26 06:00'],"['2015/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2015.124032 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.124032 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Jul;100(7):905-13. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.124032.

Such a 3D scaffold system has been previously developed in our group [1]. Additionally to the BM architectural characteristics, parameters such as oxygen and glucose concentration are crucial as their value could differ between patients as well as within the same patient at different stages of treatment, consequently affecting the resistance of leukaemia to chemotherapy. The effect of oxidative and glucose stress-at levels close to human physiologic ones-on the proliferation and metabolic evolution of an AML model system (K-562 cell line) in conventional 2D cultures as well as in 3D scaffolds were studied. We observed that the K-562 cell line can proliferate and remain alive for 2 weeks in medium with glucose close to physiological levels both in 20 and 5% O2. We report interesting differences on the cellular response to the environmental, i.e., oxidative and/or nutritional stress stimuli in 2D and 3D. Higher adaptation to oxidative stress under non-starving conditions is observed in the 3D system. The glucose level in the medium has more impact on the cellular proliferation in the 3D compared to the 2D system.

Analysis of Oil Red O staining and the expression of adipogenic genes, including PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, FAS and LPL, indicated that WEHI-3 cells significantly inhibited 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocyte cells from differentiating into adipocytes. In vivo, fat vacuoles in mice injected with WEHI-3 cells were also remarkably reduced in the murine bone marrow pimelosis model. Moreover, the key gene in the Rho signaling pathway, ROCKII, and the key gene in the Wnt signaling pathway, beta-catenin, were both upregulated compared with the control group. siRNA-mediated knockdown of ROCKII and beta-catenin reversed these WEHI-3-mediated anti-adipogenic effects.

At the megakaryocytic/erythroid bifurcation, the cross-antagonism of krueppel-like factor 1 (KLF1) and friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1) has such a decisive role. However, how this antagonism is resolved during lineage specification is poorly understood. We found that runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) inhibits erythroid differentiation of murine megakaryocytic/erythroid progenitors and primary human CD34(+) progenitor cells. We show that RUNX1 represses the erythroid gene expression program during megakaryocytic differentiation by epigenetic repression of the erythroid master regulator KLF1. RUNX1 binding to the KLF1 locus is increased during megakaryocytic differentiation and counterbalances the activating role of T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL1). We found that corepressor recruitment by RUNX1 contributes to a block of the KLF1-dependent erythroid gene expression program. Our data indicate that the repressive function of RUNX1 influences the balance between erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation by shifting the balance between KLF1 and FLI1 in the direction of FLI1.

The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole in saliva with the pharmacokinetics of unbound and total voriconazole in plasma in order to clinically validate saliva as an alternative to plasma in voriconazole TDM. METHODS: In this pharmacokinetic study, paired plasma and saliva samples were taken at steady state in adult haematology and pneumology patients treated with voriconazole. Unbound and bound plasma voriconazole concentrations were separated using high-throughput equilibrium dialysis. Voriconazole concentrations were determined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using log-linear regression. RESULTS: Sixty-three paired samples were obtained from ten patients (seven haematology and three pneumology patients). Pearson's correlation coefficients (R values) for saliva versus unbound and total plasma voriconazole concentrations showed a very strong correlation, with values of 0.970 (p < 0.001) and 0.891 (p < 0.001), respectively. Linear mixed modelling revealed strong agreement between voriconazole concentrations in saliva and unbound plasma voriconazole concentrations, with a mean bias of -0.03 (95 % confidence interval -0.14 to 0.09; p = 0.60). For total concentrations below 10 mg/L, the mean ratio of saliva to total plasma voriconazole concentrations was 0.51 +/- 0.08 (n = 63), which did not differ significantly (p = 0.76) from the unbound fraction of voriconazole in plasma of 0.49 +/- 0.03 (n = 36). CONCLUSIONS: Saliva can serve as a reliable alternative to plasma in voriconazole TDM, and it can easily be implemented in clinical practice.",,"['Vanstraelen, Kim', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Augustijns, Patrick', 'Lagrou, Katrien', 'de Loor, Henriette', 'Mols, Raf', 'Annaert, Pieter', 'Malfroot, Anne', 'Spriet, Isabel']","['Vanstraelen K', 'Maertens J', 'Augustijns P', 'Lagrou K', 'de Loor H', 'Mols R', 'Annaert P', 'Malfroot A', 'Spriet I']","['Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, KU Leuven Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Herestraat 49, 3000, Leuven, Belgium. kim_vanstraelen@hotmail.com.', 'Acute Leukaemia and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Clinical Department of Haematology, University Hospitals Leuven, Herestraat 49, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Drug Delivery and Disposition, KU Leuven Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Herestraat 49, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Clinical Department of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University Hospitals Leuven, Herestraat 49, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, KU Leuven Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Herestraat 49, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Drug Delivery and Disposition, KU Leuven Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Herestraat 49, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Drug Delivery and Disposition, KU Leuven Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Herestraat 49, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Cystic Fibrosis Clinic, Research Group GRON, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (UZ Brussel); Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, KU Leuven Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Herestraat 49, 3000, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Aspergillosis/*drug therapy', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Saliva/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Voriconazole/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",,,2015/04/26 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2015/04/26 06:00'],"['2015/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40262-015-0269-z [doi]', '10.1007/s40262-015-0269-z [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2015 Nov;54(11):1151-60. doi: 10.1007/s40262-015-0269-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the impact of complications associated to these devices in patients with hematologic malignancies, we revised the catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and the catheter-related thrombotic complications (CRTC) observed at our institute between January 2009 and December 2012. METHODS: A total of 612 PICCs were inserted into 483 patients at diagnosis or in subsequent phases of their hematologic disease. PICCs were successfully inserted in all cases. The median duration of in situ PICC placement was 101 days (interquartile range, 48-184 days). RESULTS: A CRBSI occurred in 47 cases (7.7 %), with a rate of 0.59 per 1000 PICC days. A CRTC was recorded in 16 cases (2.6 %), with a rate of 0.20 per 1000 PICC days. No serious complication was associated to these events. Cox regression analyses of variables associated to CRBSIs and to CRTCs showed that only the type of disease (acute leukemia compared to other diseases) was significantly associated to a higher incidence of CRBSIs, while no feature was predictive for a higher risk of CRTCs. CONCLUSIONS: PICCs represent a useful and safe alternative to conventional CVAD for the management of patients with hematologic malignancies.",,"['Morano, Salvatore Giacomo', 'Latagliata, Roberto',

None of the trials studied the effects of the timing of pegfilgrastim administration on the outcomes of mobilization. We conducted a randomized triple blind control trial comparing the outcomes of filgrastim 5 microg/kg daily from day 3 onwards, 'early' pegfilgrastim 6 mg on day 3 and 'delayed' pegfilgrastim 6 mg on day 7 in cyclophosphamide PBSCM in patients with no previous history of mobilization. Peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cell count was checked on day 8 and day 11 onward. Apheresis was started when PB CD34+ >/= 10/microl from day 11 onward. The primary outcome was the successful mobilization rate, defined as cumulative collection of >/= 2 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells in three or less apheresis. The secondary outcomes were the day of neutrophil and platelet engraftment post transplantation. There were 156 patients randomized and 134 patients' data analyzed. Pegfilgrastim 6 mg day 7 produced highest percentage of successful mobilization, 34 out of 48 (70.8%) analyzed patients, followed by daily filgrastim, 28 out of 44 (63.6%) and day 3 pegfilgrastim, 20 out of 42 (47.6%) (p = 0.075). Pegfilgrastim day 7 and daily filgrastim reported 1.48 (p = 0.014) and 1.49 (p = 0.013) times higher successful mobilization rate respectively as compared to pegfilgrastim day 3 after adjusting for disease, gender and exposure to myelotoxic agent. Multiple myeloma patients were three times more likely to achieve successful mobilization as compared to acute leukemia or lymphoma patients.

For this purpose, the robust modeling of gene expression data using some powerful distributions known as normal/independent distributions is considered. These distributions include the Student's t and normal distributions which have been used previously, but also include extensions such as the slash, the contaminated normal and the Laplace distributions. The purpose of this paper is to identify differentially expressed genes by considering these distributional assumptions instead of the normal distribution. A Bayesian approach using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is adopted for parameter estimation. Two publicly available gene expression data sets are analyzed using the proposed approach. The use of the robust models for detecting differentially expressed genes is investigated. This investigation shows that the choice of model for differentiating gene expression data is very important. This is due to the small number of replicates for each gene and the existence of outlying data.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate mRNA and protein expression, and several miRNAs, deregulated in CLL, might play roles as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. We have studied the miRNA profile of CLL, and its response to IL-4, by oligonucleotide microarrays, resulting in the detection of a set of 129 mature miRNAs consistently expressed in CLL, which included 41 differentially expressed compared to normal B cells (NBC), and 6 significantly underexpressed in ZAP-70 positive patients. IL-4 stimulation brought about up-regulation of the 5p and 3p mature variants of the miR-21 gene, which maps immediately downstream to the VMP1 gene, and of the mature forms generated from the miR-362 (3p and 5p), miR-500a (3p), miR-502 (3p), and miR-532 (3p and 5p) genes, which map within the third intron of the CLCN5 gene. Both genes are in turn regulated by IL-4, suggesting that these miRNAs were regulated by IL-4 as passengers from their carrier genes. Their levels of up-regulation by IL-4 significantly correlated with cytoprotection. MiR-21 has been reported to be leukemogenic, associated to bad prognosis in CLL, and the miRNA more frequently overexpressed in human cancer. Up-regulation by IL-4 of miR-21 and the miRNAs hosted in the CLCN5 locus may contribute to evasion of apoptosis of CLL cells.

Defective NK cytotoxicity is due to decreased expression of the Natural Cytotoxicity Receptors (NCRs), 2B4/CD244/p38, or NKG2D. This prompted us to test the expression of these molecules on circulating NK cells from patients with AIDS-related lymphomas (RL) in comparison with HIV + patients without lymphoma, healthy subjects and HIV-negative patients with lymphoma. METHODS: Blood samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for NCRs, 2B4/CD244/p38 and NKG2D expression on NK cells defined as CD3-/CD56+ lymphocytes. We also analyzed by quantitative PCR specific RNA for NKp30/NCR3 and NKp46/NCR1. RESULTS: We could not detect any defect in NKp46/NCR1 expression between all groups. NKp44/NCR2, NKp30/NCR3 and NKG2D had lower expression in AIDS-RL in comparison with HIV + patients without lymphoma when compared to patients with similar (>0.3 G/L) CD4+ lymphocyte levels. Expression of 2B4/CD244/p38 was lower in AIDS-RL than in HIV-negative lymphoma. Comparison of specific NKp30/NCR3 and NKp46/NCR1 RNA showed increased steady state levels, despite decreased surface expression for NKp30/NCR3, suggesting abnormal post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: We show a more pronounced defect in NK activating molecule when HIV infection is associated with lymphoma than when only one condition (HIV positivity or lymphoma) is present. Defective NK phenotype, in addition to CD4+ depletion and dysfunction, may participate to the increased incidence of lymphoma in HIV patients.",,"['Mercier-Bataille, Delphine', 'Sanchez, Carole', 'Baier, Celine', 'Le Treut, Therese', 'Mounier, Nicolas', 'Mokhtari, Saadia', 'Olive, Daniel', 'Baumstarck, Karine', 'Sebahoun, Gerard', 'Besson, Caroline', 'Costello, Regis T']","['Mercier-Bataille D', 'Sanchez C', 'Baier C', 'Le Treut T', 'Mounier N', 'Mokhtari S', 'Olive D', 'Baumstarck K', 'Sebahoun G', 'Besson C', 'Costello RT']","[""Universite Aix-Marseille, Hopital Nord, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Chemin des Bourrely, 13915 Marseille Cedex 20, France."", ""Universite Aix-Marseille, Hopital Nord, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Chemin des Bourrely, 13915 Marseille Cedex 20, France ; Technologies Avancees pour la Genomique et la Clinique (TAGC)/unite INSERM U1090, route de Luminy, 13008 Marseille, France."", 'Technologies Avancees pour la Genomique et la Clinique (TAGC)/unite INSERM U1090, route de Luminy, 13008 Marseille, France.', ""Universite Aix-Marseille, Hopital Nord, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Chemin des Bourrely, 13915 Marseille Cedex 20, France."", ""Service d'Oncologie-Hematologie, CHU de Nice, Hopital Larchet, 151 Rte Saint Antoine Ginestiere, BP 7906202 Nice Cedex 3, France."", 'Universite Aix-Marseille, Hopital Nord, Service des maladies infectieuses, Chemin des Bourrely, 13915 Marseille Cedex 20, France.', ""Laboratoire d'immunologie des tumeurs, Institut Paoli-Calmette, bd Lei Roure, 13008 Marseille, France."", ""Universite Aix-Marseille, Faculte de La Timone, Unite d'Aide Methodologique, 27 Boulevard Jean Moulin, 13005 Marseille, France."", ""Universite Aix-Marseille, Hopital Nord, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Chemin des Bourrely, 13915 Marseille Cedex 20, France."", ""Service d'hematologie et immunologie clinique, CHU Bicetre, 78 rue du Gal Leclerc, 94275 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France."", ""Technologies Avancees pour la Genomique et la Clinique (TAGC)/unite INSERM U1090, route de Luminy, 13008 Marseille, France ; Universite Aix-Marseille, Hopital La Conception, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, 147 Boulevard Baille, 13005 Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141124,England,AIDS Res Ther,AIDS research and therapy,101237921,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antitumor immune response', 'HIV-1', 'Lymphoma', 'Natural cytotoxicity receptors', 'Natural killer cells']",2014/01/01 00:00,2014/01/01 00:01,['2015/04/25 06:00'],"['2014/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/1742-6405-11-38 [doi]', '328 [pii]']",epublish,AIDS Res Ther. 2014 Nov 24;11:38. doi: 10.1186/1742-6405-11-38. eCollection 2014.,,PMC4407549,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially for those where early lifetime exposures and conditions are thought to play an important role. The collection and storage of biological samples is a critical component in epidemiological studies, notably for research regarding prenatal exposures to various environmental factors as well as for DNA extraction. Our feasibility study for a birth cohort within the scope of etiology of childhood leukemia with prospective sampling of mothers and their future newborns aimed to investigate the willingness of pregnant women to participate in a birth cohort study involving collection of blood and umbilical cord blood samples. The overall aim was to develop practice-based research recommendations for a possible German birth cohort study. METHODS: The study was conducted in Bremen, Germany, between January 2012 and March 2013. Pregnant women were eligible for recruitment if (i) their expected date of delivery was during the study recruitment phase (September 2012-February 2013), (ii) they planned to give birth at the cooperating hospital's obstetric unit and (iii) their knowledge of the German language was sufficient to understand study materials, details of participation and to fill out the prenatal self-administered questionnaire. Maternal blood and umbilical cord blood samples to be used for later research activities were collected and stored at a stem cell bank already collaborating with the hospital. 22 primary care gynecologists were invited to enroll pregnant women for the study and cooperation with one hospital was established. Expectant women were recruited during the last trimester of pregnancy, either during one of their prenatal care visits at their primary care gynecologist or later on in hospital by the attending obstetricians or project staff. RESULTS: Of the 22 invited primary care gynecologists requested to enroll pregnant women for the study, 8 gynecologists actually collaborated. A total of 200 eligible women were invited to participate in the study, 48 (24%) of whom agreed. 34 women were enrolled by primary care gynecologists, with one gynecologist enrolling 26 women. Twelve of 14 women recruited via hospitals were enrolled by study staff. A total of 41 women consented to the collection of umbilical cord blood and maternal blood samples, and samples could be stored for 54% of them. Reason for non-participation were the uncertainty whether or not the full study would be conducted and the fact that the participants were not willing to decide for their children whether or not genetic information (cord blood) can be stored for research purposes. CONCLUSION: Enrolling parents in a birth cohort study that includes biosampling is a challenge, but participation can be improved through close collaboration with primary care gynecologists and maternity hospitals. Cord blood collection may impede participation, especially when maternity hospitals offer an alternative option for cord blood donation.",,"['Ernst, Sinja Alexandra', 'Gunther, Kathrin', 'Frambach, Torsten', 'Zeeb, Hajo']","['Ernst SA', 'Gunther K', 'Frambach T', 'Zeeb H']","['Leibniz-Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany.', 'St. Joseph-Stift Krankenhaus, Bremen, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150414,Germany,Ger Med Sci,German medical science : GMS e-journal,101227686,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Specimen Collection', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', '*Fetal Blood', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Gynecology/economics', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Midwifery/economics', 'Motivation', '*Patient Selection', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['birth cohort study', 'children', 'feasibility study', 'leukemia', 'umbilical cord blood']",2015/04/25 06:00,2015/11/18 06:00,['2015/04/25 06:00'],"['2014/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3205/000208 [doi]', '000208 [pii]', 'Doc04 [pii]']",epublish,Ger Med Sci. 2015 Apr 14;13:Doc04. doi: 10.3205/000208. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4397994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A characteristic feature of this pathway is the assembly of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (APBs) at telomeres. Here, we dissected the role of APBs in a human ALT cell line by performing an RNA interference screen using an automated 3D fluorescence microscopy platform and advanced 3D image analysis. We identified 29 proteins that affected APB formation, which included proteins involved in telomere and chromatin organization, protein sumoylation and DNA repair. By integrating and extending these findings, we found that APB formation induced clustering of telomere repeats, telomere compaction and concomitant depletion of the shelterin protein TRF2 (also known as TERF2). These APB-dependent changes correlated with the induction of a DNA damage response at telomeres in APBs as evident by a strong enrichment of the phosphorylated form of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. Accordingly, we propose that APBs promote telomere maintenance by inducing a DNA damage response in ALT-positive tumor cells through changing the telomeric chromatin state to trigger ATM phosphorylation.",['(c) 2015.

However, how the components of this system are wired together to coordinate multiple aspects of the response, such as directionality, speed, and sensitivity to stimulus, remains poorly understood. Here we developed a method to shape chemoattractant gradients optically and analyze cellular chemotaxis responses of hundreds of living cells per well in 96-well format by measuring speed changes and directional accuracy. We then systematically characterized migration and chemotaxis phenotypes for 285 siRNA perturbations. A key finding was that the G-protein Gialpha subunit selectively controls the direction of migration while the receptor and Gbeta subunit proportionally control both speed and direction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that neutrophils chemotax persistently in response to gradients of fMLF but only transiently in response to gradients of ATP. The method we introduce is applicable for diverse chemical cues and systematic perturbations, can be used to measure multiple cell migration and signaling parameters, and is compatible with low- and high-resolution fluorescence microscopy.",['(c) 2015 The Authors.

We also analyze the benefits and risks of milrinone administration in an unmonitored setting. METHOD: We describe the case of a patient with refractory leukemia and end-stage CHF who developed severe dyspnea after discontinuation of milrinone. At that point, despite starting opioids, she had been severely dyspneic and anxious, requiring admission to the palliative care unit (PCU) for symptom control. After negotiation with hospital administrators, milrinone was administered in an unmonitored setting such as the PCU. A multidisciplinary team approach was also provided. RESULTS: Milrinone produced a dramatic improvement in the patient's symptom scores and performance status. The patient was eventually discharged to home hospice on a milrinone infusion with excellent symptom control. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This case suggests that milrinone may be of benefit for short-term inpatient administration for dyspnea management, even in unmonitored settings and consequently during hospice in do-not-resuscitate (DNR) patients.

The disease typically occurs in elderly patients and has a highly variable clinical course. Leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations that impair apoptosis of clonal B-cells. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis is established by blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B-lymphocytes, which identify a clonal B-cell population carrying the CD5 antigen as well as B-cell markers. PROGNOSIS: Two prognostic staging systems exist, the Rai and Binet staging systems, which are established by physical examination and blood counts. Various biological and genetic markers also have prognostic value. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)) predict resistance to available chemotherapies. Comprehensive prognostic scores are currently being developed. THERAPY: Patients with active or symptomatic disease or with advanced Binet or Rai stages require therapy. For physical fit patients, chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab remains the current standard therapy. For unfit patients, treatment with an anti-CD20 antibody (obinutuzumab or rituximab or ofatumumab) plus a milder chemotherapy (Chlorambucil) may be applied. At relapse, the initial treatment may be repeated, if the treatment-free interval exceeds two to three years. If the disease relapses earlier, therapy should be changed using alternative agents such as bendamustine (plus rituximab), alemtuzumab, lenalidomide, ofatumumab, ibrutinib, or idelalisib. Patients with a del(17p) or TP53 mutation can be treated with ibrutinib or a combination of idelalisib and rituximab. An allogeneic SCT may be considered in relapsing patients with TP53 mutations or del(17p) or patients that are refractory to repeated chemoimmunotherapies. Future challenges: Several new agents (e.g., ibrutinib, idelalisib, obinutuzumab) hold the potential to improve the outcome of patients with CLL. However, their optimal use (in terms of combination, sequence, and duration) is unknown. Therefore, CLL patients should be treated in clinical trials whenever possible.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hallek, Michael']",['Hallek M'],"['Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Koln Bonn, Center of Excellence on ""Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases"", University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD20/genetics/metabolism', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,2015/04/25 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2015/04/25 06:00'],"['2015/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23979 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 May;90(5):446-60. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23979.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of c-MET signaling induces apoptosis in a variety of cancers. It has also been recognized as a novel anticancer therapy approach. Furthermore, reports have also indicated that constitutive expression of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) is involved in the HGF/c-MET-related pathway of multidrug resistance ABCB1-positive human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. We previously reported that elevated expression levels of PKCdelta and AP-1 downstream genes, and HGF receptor (c-MET) and ABCB1, in the drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Moreover, leukemia cell lines overexpressing ABCB1 have also been shown to be more resistant to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate. These findings suggest that chemoresistant cancer cells may also develop a similar mechanism against chemotherapy agents. To circumvent clinical complications arising from drug resistance during cancer therapy, the present study was designed to investigate apoptosis induction in ABCB1-overexpressed cancer cells using c-MET-targeted RNA interference technology in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that cell viability decreased and apoptosis rate increased in c-MET shRNA-transfected HGF/c-MET pathway-positive MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF-7/ADR2 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.

Data were synthesized to estimate hazard ratios of dose-escalated treatments versus R-CHOP using a Weibull proportional hazards model within a Bayesian meta-analysis framework. Eleven studies examining 394 patients were included. Patients were treated with either front-line R-CHOP (n = 180), R-EPOCH (n = 91), or R-Hyper-CVAD/rituximab, methotrexate, cytarabine (R-M/C), R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC (DI) (n = 123). Our meta-analysis revealed that median progression-free survival (n = 350) for the R-CHOP, R-EPOCH and DI groups was 12.1, 22.2, and 18.9 months, respectively.

Thus, regulation of endogenous neuroprotective factors may be key for cell survival and attenuation of disease progression. Important neuroprotective factors in the retina include H2O2 generated by injured photoreceptors, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expressed in Muller glia cells in response to photoreceptor damage. RESULTS: We present evidence that H2O2 connects to the LIF response by inducing stabilization of Lif transcripts in Muller cells. This process was independent of active gene transcription and p38 MAPK, but relied on AU-rich elements (AREs), which we identified within the highly conserved Lif 3'UTR. Affinity purification combined with quantitative mass spectrometry identified several proteins that bound to these AREs. Among those, interleukin enhancer binding factor 3 (ILF3) was confirmed to participate in the redox-dependent Lif mRNA stabilization. Additionally we show that KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) was crucial for maintaining basal Lif expression levels in non-stressed Muller cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that H2O2-induced redox signaling increases Lif transcript levels through ILF3 mediated mRNA stabilization. Generation of H2O2 by injured photoreceptors may thus enhance stability of Lif mRNA and therefore augment neuroprotective LIF signaling during degenerative conditions in vivo.",,"['Agca, Cavit', 'Boldt, Karsten', 'Gubler, Andrea', 'Meneau, Isabelle', 'Corpet, Armelle', 'Samardzija, Marijana', 'Stucki, Manuel', 'Ueffing, Marius', 'Grimm, Christian']","['Agca C', 'Boldt K', 'Gubler A', 'Meneau I', 'Corpet A', 'Samardzija M', 'Stucki M', 'Ueffing M', 'Grimm C']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, University of Zurich, Wagistrasse 14, Zurich, 8091, Switzerland. cavitagca@gmail.com.', 'Present address: Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, 4031, Switzerland. cavitagca@gmail.com.', 'Division of Experimental Ophthalmology and Medical Proteome Center, Centre for Ophthalmology, University of Tubingen, 72076, Tubingen, Germany. karsten.boldt@uni-tuebingen.de.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, University of Zurich, Wagistrasse 14, Zurich, 8091, Switzerland. andrea.gubler@usz.ch.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, University of Zurich, Wagistrasse 14, Zurich, 8091, Switzerland. isabelle.meneau@usz.ch.', 'Department of Gynecology, University of Zurich, Zurich, 8091, Switzerland. armelle.corpet@univ-lyon1.fr.', 'Present address: Center for Molecular and Cellular Physiology and Genetics, University Lyon I, Villeurbanne, France. armelle.corpet@univ-lyon1.fr.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, University of Zurich, Wagistrasse 14, Zurich, 8091, Switzerland. samam@usz.uzh.ch.', 'Department of Gynecology, University of Zurich, Zurich, 8091, Switzerland. manuel.stucki@usz.ch.', 'Division of Experimental Ophthalmology and Medical Proteome Center, Centre for Ophthalmology, University of Tubingen, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.

Evi1 is a common site of activating integrations in murine leukemia virus (MLV)-induced AML and in retroviral and lentiviral gene-modified HCS. Still, a model of overt AML induced by Evi1 has not been generated. Cell lines from MLV-induced AML are growth factor-dependent and non-transplantable. Hence, for the leukemia maintenance in the infected animals, a growth factor source such as chronic immune response has been suggested. We have investigated whether these leukemias are transplantable if provided with growth factors. We show that the Evi1(+)DA-3 cells modified to express an intracellular form of GM-CSF, acquired growth factor independence and transplantability and caused an overt leukemia in syngeneic hosts, without increasing serum GM-CSF levels.

A correlation between posaconazole serum levels and breakthrough invasive fungal infections (IFI) has not been clearly demonstrated so far. We analysed posaconazole serum levels in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) during induction therapy and correlated them with the incidence of breakthrough IFI and the need of systemic antifungal therapy. Overall, 77 AML patients receiving posaconazole were evaluated for serum levels; breakthrough IFI were observed in five with at least one posaconazole TDM (6.5%). Median serum level was 534 ng ml(-1) (IQ range: 298.5-750.5 ng ml(-1) ) and did not change significantly over time. Four of the 40 patients with median posaconazole levels <500 ng ml(-1) developed IFI, as compared with only 1 of the 37 patients with median levels >/=500 (10% vs. 2.7%, P = 0.19). Median posaconazole levels on day 7 were 384.5 ng ml(-1) (IQ range: 207-659 ng ml(-1) ) and 560.5 ng ml(-1) (IQ range: 395-756 ng ml(-1) ) in patients requiring or not systemic antifungal treatment respectively (P = 0.067). These results seem to confirm that higher median serum levels of posaconazole correlate with higher prophylactic efficacy against proven/probable IFI and with lesser need of systemic antifungal therapy.",['(c) 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.'],"['Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Panzali, Annafranca', 'Passi, Angela', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Lamorgese, Cinzia', 'Petulla, Marta', 'Re, Alessandro', 'Caimi, Luigi', 'Rossi, Giuseppe']","['Cattaneo C', 'Panzali A', 'Passi A', 'Borlenghi E', 'Lamorgese C', 'Petulla M', 'Re A', 'Caimi L', 'Rossi G']","['Hematology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Hormonology and Toxicology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Hormonology and Toxicology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Clinical Biochemistry, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150423,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Fungemia/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Serum/chemistry', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukaemia', 'invasive fungal infections', 'posaconazole prophylaxis', 'therapeutic drug monitoring']",2015/04/25 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/04/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/myc.12326 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2015 Jun;58(6):362-7. doi: 10.1111/myc.12326.

Firstly, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between six Mdr2-knockout (Mdr2-KO) mutant mice samples (3-month-old and 12-month-old) and six control mice samples were identified. Then, the enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways of those DEGs were obtained using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). Finally, protein-protein interactions (PPI) network of those DEGs were constructed using STRING database ( http://www.string-db.org/) and visualized by Cytoscape software, at the same time, genes with high degree were selected out. Several novel biomarkers that might play important roles in liver cancer were identified through the analysis of gene microarray in GEO. Also, some genes such as Tyrobp, Ctss and pathways such as Pathways in cancer, ECM-receptor interaction that had been researched previously were further confirmed in this study.

Among them, a cationic antimicrobial peptide, scolopendrasin VII, was selected based on its physicochemical properties, such as length, charge, and isoelectric point. Here, we assessed the anticancer activities of scolopendrasin VII against U937 and Jurkat leukemia cell lines. The results showed that scolopendrasin VII decreased the viability of the leukemia cells in MTS assays. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining revealed that scolopendrasin VII induced necrosis in the leukemia cells. Scolopendrasin VII-induced necrosis was mediated by specific interaction with phosphatidylserine, which is enriched in the membrane of cancer cells. Taken together, these data indicated that scolopendrasin VII induced necrotic cell death in leukemia cells, probably through interaction with phosphatidylserine.

Gain of function mutations, loss of function mutations, and overexpression of GATA2 have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia. In previous studies, we and others showed that GATA2 overexpression at high levels, similar to that seen in hematopoietic stem cells, blocked differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. To better understand the effects of GATA2, we designed a Tamoxifen-inducible GATA2-estrogen receptor (ERT) vector. In the absence of Tamoxifen, small amounts of GATA2-ERT were still able to enter the nucleus in mouse bone marrow (BM) cells, providing us with a tool to test the effects of low-level GATA2 overexpression. We observed that this low-level GATA2 overexpression enhanced self-renewal of myeloid progenitors in vitro and resulted in immortalization of BM cells to myeloid cell lines. Continuous GATA2-ERT expression was required for the proliferation of these immortalized lines. Myeloid expansion and a block in T and B lineage differentiation were observed in mice transplanted with GATA2-ERT-expressing BM cells. Myeloid expansion occurred after the granulocyte monocyte progenitor stage, and lymphoid block was distal to the common lymphoid progenitor in transgenic mice. GATA2 appeared to induce growth via downstream activation of Nmyc and Hoxa9. Our results demonstrate that GATA2 overexpression at low level confers self-renewal capacity to myeloid progenitors and is relevant to myeloid leukemia development.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

High-throughput sequencing of the tumors revealed significant dysregulation of approximately 250 genes. Amongst these, the transcription factor Egr1 was consistently upregulated in mice deficient for miR-146a. Interestingly, transcriptional targets of Egr1 were enriched in both the high-throughput dataset and in a larger set of miR-146a-deficient tumors. miR-146a overexpression led to downregulation of Egr1 and downstream targets with concomitant decrease in cell growth. Direct targeting of the human EGR1 by miR-146a was seen by luciferase assay. Together our findings illuminate a bona fide role for miR-146a in the modulation of B-cell oncogenesis and reveal the importance of understanding microRNA function in a cell- and disease-specific context.",,"['Contreras, Jorge R', 'Palanichamy, Jayanth Kumar', 'Tran, Tiffany M', 'Fernando, Thilini R', 'Rodriguez-Malave, Norma I', 'Goswami, Neha', 'Arboleda, Valerie A', 'Casero, David', 'Rao, Dinesh S']","['Contreras JR', 'Palanichamy JK', 'Tran TM', 'Fernando TR', 'Rodriguez-Malave NI', 'Goswami N', 'Arboleda VA', 'Casero D', 'Rao DS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Cellular and Molecular Pathology Ph.D. Program, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Cellular and Molecular Pathology Ph.D. Program, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Broad Stem Cell Research Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn146 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell', 'c-Myc', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'microRNA']",2015/04/25 06:00,2016/03/16 06:00,['2015/04/25 06:00'],"['2015/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['3433 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3433 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 May 10;6(13):11023-37. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3433.,"['NIH T32CA009120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08CA133521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH T32CA009056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA133521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI028697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA166450-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4484436,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emergence of carbapenemases in the isolates of Enterobacteriaceae limits therapeutic options. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae have emerged since 2008 throughout Croatia. In Osijek-Baranja County carbapenem-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae were not reported until 2013. The first carbapenem-resistant strain (Enterobacter cloacae) was identified in August 2013 in a patient previously hospitalized at University Hospital Center Zagreb for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Molecular analysis revealed the production of VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL). In spite of the metallo-beta-lactamase production the strain was not resistant to imipenem and meropenem in disk-diffusion and microdilution test. This report shows that routine susceptibility testing carried out in most laboratories does not necessarily detect carbapenemase production in Enterobacteriaceae. Since these enzymes are encoded on mobile genetic elements there is a risk of horizontal spread to other enterobacterial isolates and the development of hospital outbreaks.,,"['Bedenic, Branka', 'Zujic Atalic, Vlasta', 'Bogdan, Maja', 'Beader, Natasa', 'Godic Torkar, Karmen', 'Izakovic, Senka']","['Bedenic B', 'Zujic Atalic V', 'Bogdan M', 'Beader N', 'Godic Torkar K', 'Izakovic S']",,['hrv'],['Journal Article'],,Croatia,Lijec Vjesn,Lijecnicki vjesnik,0074253,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Carbapenems)', 'EC 3.5.2.- (VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (carbapenemase)']",IM,"['Bacterial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Carbapenems/*pharmacology', 'Croatia', 'Cross Infection/microbiology', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Enterobacter cloacae/*drug effects/*enzymology', 'Enterobacteriaceae Infections/microbiology', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'beta-Lactamases/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",,,2015/04/25 06:00,2015/10/17 06:00,['2015/04/25 06:00'],"['2015/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Lijec Vjesn. 2015 Jan-Feb;137(1-2):17-21.,,,,,,,,,,,Prvi opis karbapenemaze u osjecko-baranjskoj zupaniji u unesenom izolatu Enterobactera cloacae in vitro osjetljivom na karbapeneme.,,,,,,,,,

However, it is still unknown whether this theory is applicable to other malignancies. In this study, we demonstrate that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) overexpression is a founder abnormality for the development of T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-LBL) using LSD1 transgenic mice. LSD1 expression is tightly regulated via alternative splicing and transcriptional repression in HSCs and is altered in most leukemias, especially T-LBL. Overexpression of the shortest isoform of LSD1, which is specifically repressed in quiescent HSCs and demethylates histone H3K9 more efficiently than other isoforms, increases self-renewal potential via upregulation of the HoxA family but retains multidifferentiation ability with a skewed differentiation to T-cell lineages at transcriptome levels in HSCs. Transgenic mice overexpressing LSD1 in HSCs did not show obvious abnormalities but developed T-LBL at very high frequency after gamma-irradiation. LSD1 overexpression appears to be the first hit in T-cell leukemogenesis and provides an insight into novel strategies for early diagnosis and effective treatment of the disease.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Wada, Taeko', 'Koyama, Daisuke', 'Kikuchi, Jiro', 'Honda, Hiroaki', 'Furukawa, Yusuke']","['Wada T', 'Koyama D', 'Kikuchi J', 'Honda H', 'Furukawa Y']","['Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan; and.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan; and.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan; and.', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150422,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/pathology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Histone Demethylases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', '*Up-Regulation']",,,2015/04/24 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/04/24 06:00'],"['2014/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31548-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-11-610907 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 11;125(24):3731-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-11-610907.

Yet, hundreds of RNA molecules remain in mature sperm. The biological significance of the vast majority of these molecules is unclear. To better understand the processes that generate sperm small RNAs and what roles they may have, we sequenced and characterized the small RNA content of sperm samples from two human fertile individuals. We detected 182 microRNAs, some of which are highly abundant. The most abundant microRNA in sperm is miR-1246 with predicted targets among sperm-specific genes. The most abundant class of small noncoding RNAs in sperm are PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Surprisingly, we found that human sperm cells contain piRNAs processed from pseudogenes. Clusters of piRNAs from human testes contain pseudogenes transcribed in the antisense strand and processed into small RNAs. Several human protein-coding genes contain antisense predicted targets of pseudogene-derived piRNAs in the male germline and these piRNAs are still found in mature sperm. Our study provides the most extensive data set and annotation of human sperm small RNAs to date and is a resource for further functional studies on the roles of sperm small RNAs. In addition, we propose that some of the pseudogene-derived human piRNAs may regulate expression of their parent gene in the male germline.","['(c) 2015 Pantano et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the', 'RNA Society.']","['Pantano, Lorena', 'Jodar, Meritxell', 'Bak, Mads', 'Ballesca, Josep Lluis', 'Tommerup, Niels', 'Oliva, Rafael', 'Vavouri, Tanya']","['Pantano L', 'Jodar M', 'Bak M', 'Ballesca JL', 'Tommerup N', 'Oliva R', 'Vavouri T']","['Institute of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (IMPPC), Can Ruti Campus, Badalona, Barcelona 08916, Spain.', ""Genetics Unit, Department of Physiological Sciences, University of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Service, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Center for non-coding RNA in Technology and Health (RTH), University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark Wilhelm Johannsen Centre for Functional Genome Research, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Science, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Andrology Unit, Institut Clinic de Ginecologia, Obstetricia i Neonatologia, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for non-coding RNA in Technology and Health (RTH), University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark Wilhelm Johannsen Centre for Functional Genome Research, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Science, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Genetics Unit, Department of Physiological Sciences, University of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Service, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Institute of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (IMPPC), Can Ruti Campus, Badalona, Barcelona 08916, Spain Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), ICO-Hospital GermansTrias i Pujol, Badalona, Barcelona 08916, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150422,United States,RNA,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",9509184,"['0 (MIRN1246 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/metabolism', '*Pseudogenes', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/methods', 'Spermatozoa/*metabolism', 'Testis/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['PIWI', 'RNA', 'microRNA', 'piRNA', 'pseudogene', 'sperm']",2015/04/24 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2015/04/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['rna.046482.114 [pii]', '10.1261/rna.046482.114 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA. 2015 Jun;21(6):1085-95. doi: 10.1261/rna.046482.114.

It thus poses unique challenges for understanding risks associated with exposure. N(2-)hydroxymethyl-dG (N(2)-HOMe-dG) is the main formaldehyde-induced DNA mono-adduct, which together with DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) and toxicity-induced cell proliferation, play important roles in a mutagenic mode of action for cancer. In this study, N(2)-HOMe-dG was shown to be an excellent biomarker for direct adduction of formaldehyde to DNA and the hydrolysis of DPCs. The use of inhaled [(13)CD2]-formaldehyde exposures of rats and primates coupled with ultrasensitive nano ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry permitted accurate determinations of endogenous and exogenous formaldehyde DNA damage. The results show that inhaled formaldehyde only reached rat and monkey noses, but not tissues distant to the site of initial contact. The amounts of exogenous adducts were remarkably lower than those of endogenous adducts in exposed nasal epithelium. Moreover, exogenous adducts accumulated in rat nasal epithelium over the 28-days exposure to reach steady-state concentrations, followed by elimination with a half-life (t1/2) of 7.1 days. Additionally, we examined artifact formation during DNA preparation to ensure the accuracy of nonlabeled N(2)-HOMe-dG measurements. These novel findings provide critical new data for understanding major issues identified by the National Research Council Review of the 2010 Environmental Protection Agency's Draft Integrated Risk Information System Formaldehyde Risk Assessment. They support a data-driven need for reflection on whether risks have been overestimated for inhaled formaldehyde, whereas underappreciating endogenous formaldehyde as the primary source of exposure that results in bone marrow toxicity and leukemia in susceptible humans and rodents deficient in DNA repair.","['(c) The Author 2015.

In the presence of AgN, different changes of their survival time were observed depending on cell differentiation. Differentiated cells showed a significantly higher resistance than the non-differentiated cells, depending on the contact time and AgN concentration. In the presence of AgN at concentration of 25 mg/l, fraction of non-differentiated cells alive after 24 h was equal to 45 %; for granulocytes this number increased to 75 % and for macrophages to 65 %.

In the present study, we explored the effects of evodiamine on cell growth and apoptosis in human oral cancer cell lines. Our data revealed that evodiamine significantly inhibited the proliferation of human oral cancer cells and resulted in the cleavages of PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) and caspase-3, in addition to causing the typical characteristics of apoptosis. Evodiamine also increased Bax protein levels and caused translocation of Bax into mitochondria and Bax oligomerization. In addition, evodiamine decreased expression of myeloid cell leukemia (Mcl-1) at the transcriptional modification, and knockdown of Mcl-1 clearly resulted in an increase in expression of Bax and active Bax, resulting in induction of apoptosis. Evodiamine reduced expression of phosphorylated AKT, and LY294002 potentiated evodiamine-induced apoptosis by regulating Mcl-1 protein. Our results suggest that evodiamine induces apoptosis in human oral cancer cells through the AKT pathway.

Currently, drug-induced differentiation is considered as a promising approach to eradicate this tumor-driving cell population. Recently, the effect of cannabinoids (CBs) in promoting glial differentiation and inhibiting gliomagenesis has been evidenced. Herein, we demonstrated that cannabidiol (CBD) by activating transient receptor potential vanilloid-2 (TRPV2) triggers GSCs differentiation activating the autophagic process and inhibits GSCs proliferation and clonogenic capability. Above all, CBD and carmustine (BCNU) in combination overcome the high resistance of GSCs to BCNU treatment, by inducing apoptotic cell death. Acute myeloid leukemia (Aml-1) transcription factors play a pivotal role in GBM proliferation and differentiation and it is known that Aml-1 control the expression of several nociceptive receptors. So, we evaluated the expression levels of Aml-1 spliced variants (Aml-1a, b and c) in GSCs and during their differentiation. We found that Aml-1a is upregulated during GSCs differentiation, and its downregulation restores a stem cell phenotype in differentiated GSCs. Since it was demonstrated that CBD induces also TRPV2 expression and that TRPV2 is involved in GSCs differentiation, we evaluated if Aml-1a interacted directly with TRPV2 promoters. Herein, we found that Aml-1a binds TRPV2 promoters and that Aml-1a expression is upregulated by CBD treatment, in a TRPV2 and PI3K/AKT dependent manner. Altogether, these results support a novel mechanism by which CBD inducing TRPV2-dependent autophagic process stimulates Aml-1a-dependent GSCs differentiation, abrogating the BCNU chemoresistance in GSCs.",['(c) 2015 UICC.'],"['Nabissi, Massimo', 'Morelli, Maria Beatrice', 'Amantini, Consuelo', 'Liberati, Sonia', 'Santoni, Matteo', 'Ricci-Vitiani, Lucia', 'Pallini, Roberto', 'Santoni, Giorgio']","['Nabissi M', 'Morelli MB', 'Amantini C', 'Liberati S', 'Santoni M', 'Ricci-Vitiani L', 'Pallini R', 'Santoni G']","['Section of Experimental Medicine, School of Pharmacy, University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy.', 'Section of Experimental Medicine, School of Pharmacy, University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'School of Biosciences and Veterinary Medicine, University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Clinica Di Oncologia Medica, AOU Ospedali Riuniti-Universita Politecnica Delle Marche, Ancona, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore Di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Universita Cattolica Del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Section of Experimental Medicine, School of Pharmacy, University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150508,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPV2 protein, human)', '19GBJ60SN5 (Cannabidiol)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Autophagy', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cannabidiol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Glioma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TRPV Cation Channels/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['Aml-1', 'autophagy', 'cannabidiol', 'chemosensitivity', 'differentiation', 'glioblastoma stem-like cells']",2015/04/24 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/04/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29573 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Oct 15;137(8):1855-69. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29573.

The median day to neutrophil engraftment was similar in all groups. The median day to platelet engraftment was longer in the UCB group. The number of HLA mismatch was higher in the UCB group (p = 0.034); however, the cumulative incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD was not different among all groups (p = 0.125); furthermore, cGVHD was lower in the UCB group (p = 0.078).

The morphologic features in the livers of rats afflicted with LGL leukemia were diffuse, uniform-sized, granular, or micronodular lesions consisting of hepatocytes showing centrilobular atrophy and perilobular hypertrophy (CAPH) without fibrosis. With progression in the stage of the LGL leukemia, the severity of the CAPH of hepatocytes increased resulting in fatty change and/or single-cell necrosis, along with compensatory hyperplasia of the hepatocytes, finally resulting in lesions similar to those seen in nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) in the human liver. The CAPH of hepatocytes was a nonspecific tissue adaptation against ischemia or hypoxemia and/or imbalance in blood supply due to disturbance in the portal circulation and hemolytic anemia induced by the leukemia cells. In addition, direct and/or indirect hepatocellular injuries by leukemia cells were considered to be necessary for the formation of human NRH-like lesions.

The aim of the present study was to identify additional as well as cooperative genetic events in T-ALL. METHODS: A population-based pediatric T-ALL series comprising 47 cases was investigated by SNP array and deep sequencing analyses of 75 genes, in order to ascertain pathogenetically pertinent aberrations and to identify cooperative events. RESULTS: The majority (92%) of cases harbored copy number aberrations/uniparental isodisomies (UPIDs), with a median of three changes (range 0-11) per case. The genes recurrently deleted comprised CDKN2A, CDKN2B, LEF1, PTEN, RBI, and STIL. No case had a whole chromosome UPID; in fact, literature data show that this is a rare phenomenon in T-ALL. However, segmental UPIDs (sUPIDs) were seen in 42% of our cases, with most being sUPID9p that always were associated with homozygous CDKN2A deletions, with a heterozygous deletion occurring prior to the sUPID9p in all instances. Among the 75 genes sequenced, 14 (19%) were mutated in 28 (72%) of 39 analyzed cases. The genes targeted are involved in signaling transduction, epigenetic regulation, and transcription. In some cases, NOTCH1 mutations were seen in minor subclones and lost at relapse; thus, such mutations can be secondary events. CONCLUSIONS: Deep sequencing and SNP array analyses of T-ALL revealed lack of wUPIDs, a high proportion of sUPID9p targeting CDKN2A, NOTCH1 mutations in subclones, and recurrent mutations of genes involved in signaling transduction, epigenetic regulation, and transcription.",,"['Karrman, Kristina', 'Castor, Anders', 'Behrendtz, Mikael', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Olsson, Linda', 'Ehinger, Mats', 'Biloglav, Andrea', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Paulsson, Kajsa', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Karrman K', 'Castor A', 'Behrendtz M', 'Forestier E', 'Olsson L', 'Ehinger M', 'Biloglav A', 'Fioretos T', 'Paulsson K', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Region Skane, SE-221 85, Lund, Sweden.

Nevertheless, in atypical cases, the hypothesis of an inherited thrombocytopenia has to be investigated. We report a series of cases of a newly described entity, genetic thrombocytopenia with mutation in the ankyrine 26 gene, diagnosed from the exploration of five pediatric cases of thrombocytopenia. This entity is characterized by a moderate thrombocytopenia with normal mean platelet volume, and poorly bleeding. Its transmission is autosomal dominant. Final diagnosis is made by sequencing of a short DNA region of ANKRD26 gene. This pathology can be considered as an hematological malignancy predisposition syndrome. CONCLUSION: We report the first cohort of pediatric patients diagnosed with thrombocytopenia with mutation in the ankyrine 26. The aim is to underline the specificities of this entity in children and bring it to the knowledge of pediatricians who may be in first place to manage these patients.

Previously, chronic rhinitis patients were demonstrated to elicit a specific IgE response to nontoxic strains of M. aeruginosa by skin-prick testing, indicating that cyanobacteria allergenicity resides in a non-toxin-producing component of the organism. OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify and characterize M. aeruginosa peptide(s) responsible for allergic sensitization in susceptible individuals, and we investigated the functional interactions between cyanobacterial toxins and their coexpressed immunogenic peptides. METHODS: Sera from patients and extracts from M. aeruginosa toxic [MC(+)] and nontoxic [MC(-)] strains were used to test IgE-specific reactivity by direct and indirect ELISAs; 2D gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblots and mass spectrometry (MS), was performed to identify the relevant sensitizing peptides. Cytotoxicity and mediator release assays were performed using the MC(+) and MC(-) lysates. RESULTS: We found specific IgE to be increased more in response to the MC(-) strain than the MC(+) strain. This response was inhibited by preincubation of MC(-) lysate with increasing concentrations of microcystin. MS revealed that phycocyanin and the core-membrane linker peptide are the responsible allergens, and MC(-) extracts containing these proteins induced beta-hexosaminidase release in rat basophil leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: Phycobiliprotein complexes in M. aeruginosa have been identified as the relevant sensitizing proteins. Our finding that allergenicity is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by microcystin toxin suggests that further investigation is warranted to understand the interplay between immunogenicity and toxicity of cyanobacteria under diverse environmental conditions.

However, the role of MSCs in graftversusleukemia remains to be determined. In the present study, we cocultured C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow (BM)derived MSCs with A20 murine B lymphoma, FBL3 murine erythroleukemia and P388 murine acute lymphocytic leukemia cells. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle progression and the amount of cytokine secretion were then measured using a Cell Counting kit8, Annexin V/propidium iodide staining, flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. We also established a model of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using BALB/c mice. Following the administration of A20 cells and MSCs, we recorded the symptoms and the survival of the mice for 4 weeks, assessed the T cell subsets present in peripheral blood, and, after the mice were sacrifice, we determined the infiltration of MSCs into the organs by histological staining. Our results revealed that the MSCs inhibited the proliferation of the mouse lymphoma and leukemia cells in vitro, leading to cell cycle arrest and reducing the secretion of interleukin (IL)10. In our model of allogeneic BMT, the intravenous injection of MSCs into the mice injected wth A20 cells decreased the incidence of lymphoma, improved survival, increased the fraction of CD3+CD8+ T cells, decreased the fraction of CD3+CD4+ T cells and CD4+CD25+ T cells in peripheral blood, and ameliorated the manifestation of aGVHD. The results from the present study indicate that MSCs may be safe and effective when used in allogeneic BMT for the treatment of hemotological malignancies.",,"['Song, Ningxia', 'Gao, Lei', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Huang, Chongmei', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Lv, Shuqing', 'Chen, Li', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Song N', 'Gao L', 'Qiu H', 'Huang C', 'Cheng H', 'Zhou H', 'Lv S', 'Chen L', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, PLA, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, P.R.

We have previously shown that treatment of AML patients with high-dose cytarabine is preferentially beneficial for those harboring oncogenic RAS. On the basis of a murine AML cell culture model, we ascribed this effect to a RAS-driven, p53-dependent induction of differentiation. Hence, in this study we sought to confirm the correlation between RAS status and differentiation of primary blasts obtained from AML patients. The gene expression signature of AML blasts with oncogenic NRAS indeed corresponded to a more mature profile compared to blasts with wildtype RAS, as demonstrated by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and real-time PCR analysis of myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 homolog (MEIS1) in a unique cohort of AML patients. In addition, in vitro cell culture experiments with established cell lines and a second set of primary AML cells showed that oncogenic NRAS mutations predisposed cells to cytarabine (AraC) driven differentiation. Taken together, our findings show that AML with inv(16) and NRAS mutation have a differentiation gene signature, supporting the notion that NRAS mutation may predispose leukemic cells to AraC induced differentiation. We therefore suggest that promotion of differentiation pathways by specific genetic alterations could explain the superior treatment outcome after therapy in some AML patient subgroups. Whether a differentiation gene expression status may generally predict for a superior treatment outcome in AML needs to be addressed in future studies.",,"['Brendel, Cornelia', 'Teichler, Sabine', 'Millahn, Axel', 'Stiewe, Thorsten', 'Krause, Michael', 'Stabla, Kathleen', 'Ross, Petra', 'Huynh, Minh', 'Illmer, Thomas', 'Mernberger, Marco', 'Barckhausen, Christina', 'Neubauer, Andreas']","['Brendel C', 'Teichler S', 'Millahn A', 'Stiewe T', 'Krause M', 'Stabla K', 'Ross P', 'Huynh M', 'Illmer T', 'Mernberger M', 'Barckhausen C', 'Neubauer A']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University of Marburg, and University Clinic Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University of Marburg, and University Clinic Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University of Marburg, and University Clinic Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University of Marburg, and University Clinic Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University of Marburg, and University Clinic Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University of Marburg, and University Clinic Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Clinic of Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Molecular Oncology, Philipps University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University of Marburg, and University Clinic Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University of Marburg, and University Clinic Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150422,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (inv(16) fusion protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,2015/04/23 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/04/23 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0123181 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-41900 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 22;10(4):e0123181. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0123181. eCollection 2015.,,PMC4406710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using sensitive technologies in a cellular model of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, we demonstrate that while Decitabine reduces the global levels of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), it results in paradoxical increase of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) levels. Hitherto, the only biological mechanism known to generate 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC, involving oxidation of 5mC by members of Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) dioxygenase family, was not observed to undergo any alteration during DAC treatment. Using a multi-compartmental model of DNA methylation, we show that partial selectivity of TET enzymes for hemi-methylated CpG dinucleotides could lead to such alterations in 5hmC content. Furthermore, we investigated the binding of TET1-catalytic domain (CD)-GFP to DNA by Fluorescent Correlation Spectroscopy in live cells and detected the gradual increase of the DNA bound fraction of TET1-CD-GFP after treatment with Decitabine. Our study provides novel insights on the therapeutic activity of DAC in the backdrop of the newly discovered derivatives of 5mC and suggests that 5hmC has the potential to serve as a biomarker for monitoring the clinical success of patients receiving DAC.",,"['Chowdhury, Basudev', 'McGovern, Andrew', 'Cui, Yi', 'Choudhury, Samrat Roy', 'Cho, Il-Hoon', 'Cooper, Bruce', 'Chevassut, Timothy', 'Lossie, Amy C', 'Irudayaraj, Joseph']","['Chowdhury B', 'McGovern A', 'Cui Y', 'Choudhury SR', 'Cho IH', 'Cooper B', 'Chevassut T', 'Lossie AC', 'Irudayaraj J']","['1] Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette 47907, IN [2] Bindley Biosciences Center, Discovery Park, Purdue University, West Lafayette 47907, IN.', '1] Department of Healthcare Management and Policy, University of Surrey, Guildford, GY2 7XH, UK [2] Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Falmer, Brighton, East Sussex, BN1 9PS, UK.', '1] Bindley Biosciences Center, Discovery Park, Purdue University, West Lafayette 47907, IN [2] Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907.', '1] Bindley Biosciences Center, Discovery Park, Purdue University, West Lafayette 47907, IN [2] Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907.', '1] Bindley Biosciences Center, Discovery Park, Purdue University, West Lafayette 47907, IN [2] Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907.', 'Bindley Biosciences Center, Discovery Park, Purdue University, West Lafayette 47907, IN.', 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Falmer, Brighton, East Sussex, BN1 9PS, UK.', '1] Bindley Biosciences Center, Discovery Park, Purdue University, West Lafayette 47907, IN [2] Department of Animal Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907.', '1] Bindley Biosciences Center, Discovery Park, Purdue University, West Lafayette 47907, IN [2] Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150422,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (5-carboxylcytosine)', '0 (5-formylcytosine)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine/chemistry', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,,2015/04/23 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/04/23 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['srep09281 [pii]', '10.1038/srep09281 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Apr 22;5:9281. doi: 10.1038/srep09281.,"['R25 CA128770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000006/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25CA128770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TR000006/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4894448,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed stage IA or stage IIA Hodgkin's lymphoma received three cycles of ABVD and then underwent PET scanning. Patients with negative PET findings were randomly assigned to receive involved-field radiotherapy or no further treatment; patients with positive PET findings received a fourth cycle of ABVD and radiotherapy. This trial assessing the noninferiority of no further treatment was designed to exclude a difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate of 7 or more percentage points from the assumed 95% progression-free survival rate in the radiotherapy group. RESULTS: A total of 602 patients (53.3% male; median age, 34 years) were recruited, and 571 patients underwent PET scanning. The PET findings were negative in 426 of these patients (74.6%), 420 of whom were randomly assigned to a study group (209 to the radiotherapy group and 211 to no further therapy). At a median of 60 months of follow-up, there had been 8 instances of disease progression in the radiotherapy group, and 8 patients had died (3 with disease progression, 1 of whom died from Hodgkin's lymphoma); there had been 20 instances of disease progression in the group with no further therapy, and 4 patients had died (2 with disease progression and none from Hodgkin's lymphoma). In the radiotherapy group, 5 of the deaths occurred in patients who received no radiotherapy. The 3-year progression-free survival rate was 94.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.5 to 97.7) in the radiotherapy group and 90.8% (95% CI, 86.9 to 94.8) in the group that received no further therapy, with an absolute risk difference of -3.8 percentage points (95% CI, -8.8 to 1.3). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study did not show the noninferiority of the strategy of no further treatment after chemotherapy with regard to progression-free survival. Nevertheless, patients in this study with early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma and negative PET findings after three cycles of ABVD had a very good prognosis either with or without consolidation radiotherapy.

RESEARCH APPROACH: Descriptive, qualitative study based on exploratory, in-depth interviews that were recorded, transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed. SETTING: Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A purposive sample of 45 individuals with hematologic cancer who had to relocate for specialist treatment. METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: A descriptive, qualitative methodology actioned through open-ended, in-depth interviews with 45 participants who relocated for specialist treatment. FINDINGS: The findings indicate that relocation happens at a time when patients are particularly emotionally vulnerable from the shock of their diagnosis or relapse and the confrontation with a potentially life-threatening condition. During this time, when the need for the comfort and support of home and family is heightened, patients have to separate from their family and travel to metropolitan specialist centers. For patients from regional, rural, and remote locations, which are lengthy distances from metropolitan hospitals, the choice to return home during treatment is not a realistic option. Distance also can be a barrier that prevents family from visiting the hospital to provide support. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who have to relocate require psychosocial support. Because of the stresses associated with relocation for specialist care, many patients from regional, rural, and remote areas would prefer to be treated locally. INTERPRETATION: Understanding and responding to family issues associated with relocation for specialist treatment is an important aspect of oncology nursing care for patients who have to relocate from regional, rural, and remote areas. Because centralization of specialist hematology treatment is a worldwide trend, the findings have relevance to an international nursing audience.",,"['McGrath, Pam']",['McGrath P'],"['Centre for Community Science in Griffith Health Institute at Griffith University in Meadowbrook, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Family/*psychology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*nursing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncology Nursing/*organization & administration', 'Patient Transfer/*organization & administration', 'Patients/*psychology', 'Qualitative Research', 'Queensland', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Travel/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['family', 'hematologic malignancies', 'nursing', 'qualitative research', 'relocation']",2015/04/23 06:00,2016/02/03 06:00,['2015/04/23 06:00'],"['2015/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1188/15.ONF.E250-E256 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2015 May;42(3):E250-6. doi: 10.1188/15.ONF.E250-E256.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The signals that prime NK cells are not completely understood, and, although the importance of IFN type I is well recognized, the role of type III IFN is comparatively very poorly studied. IL-28R-deficient mice were resistant to LPS and cecal ligation puncture-induced septic shock, and hallmark cytokines in these disease models were dysregulated in the absence of IL-28R. IL-28R-deficient mice were more sensitive to experimental tumor metastasis and carcinogen-induced tumor formation than WT mice, and additional blockade of interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (IFNAR1), but not IFN-gamma, further enhanced metastasis and tumor development. IL-28R-deficient mice were also more susceptible to growth of the NK cell-sensitive lymphoma, RMAs. Specific loss of IL-28R in NK cells transferred into lymphocyte-deficient mice resulted in reduced LPS-induced IFN-gamma levels and enhanced tumor metastasis.

Subset #8 patients experience aggressive disease and exhibit the highest risk for Richter transformation among all CLL. In order to obtain biological insight into this behavior, we profiled the antigen reactivity and signaling capacity of subset #8 vs other clinically aggressive stereotyped subsets, namely subsets #1 and #2. Twenty-seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from subsets #1, #2, and #8 CLL clones were prepared as recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 and used as primary antibodies in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays against representatives of the major classes of established antigenic targets for CLL. Subset #8 CLL mAbs exhibited broad polyreactivity as they bound to all antigens tested, in clear contrast with the mAbs from the other subsets. Antigen challenge of primary CLL cells indicated that the promiscuous antigen-binding activity of subset #8 mAbs could lead to significant cell activation, again in contrast to the less responsive CLL cells from subsets #1 and #2. These features constitute a distinctive profile for CLL subset #8, supporting the existence of distinct mechanisms of aggressiveness in different immunogenetic subsets of CLL.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Gounari, Maria', 'Ntoufa, Stavroula', 'Apollonio, Benedetta', 'Papakonstantinou, Nikos', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Chu, Charles C', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Gounari M', 'Ntoufa S', 'Apollonio B', 'Papakonstantinou N', 'Ponzoni M', 'Chu CC', 'Rossi D', 'Gaidano G', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Ghia P']","['Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele and Department of Onco-Hematology, Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy;', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece;', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele and Department of Onco-Hematology, Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; Section of Internal Medicine, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, and.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece;', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele and Department of Onco-Hematology, Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; Section of Internal Medicine, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, and Pathology Unit, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milan, Italy;', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Manhasset, NY;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy; and.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Manhasset, NY;', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece; Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele and Department of Onco-Hematology, Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; Section of Internal Medicine, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, and.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150421,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*pathology', 'Male']",,,2015/04/23 06:00,2015/08/13 06:00,['2015/04/23 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31578-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-09-603217 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 4;125(23):3580-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-09-603217.

We evaluated the prognostic value of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene usage and mutational status in FL patients. One hundred and four IGH sequences were obtained in tumour samples from 99 patients. The IGHV3 subgroup had the highest usage frequency (57.7%) with IGHV3-23 being the most common sequence. Patients with the IGHV5 subgroup or IGHV sequences from more than one subgroup had significantly less favourable prognosis with an estimated 5-year survival of 62.5 and 50.0%, respectively, as compared with a 5-year survival of 95.1% for patients with other IGHV subgroups (P=0.013 and P<0.001, log-rank). The poor survival associated with IGHV5 or >1 IGHV subgroup usage was an independent prognostic factor in Cox multivariate analysis (P=0.005). IGHV genes were unmutated showing >98% homology in 15.2% of cases. Contrasting the situation in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the presence of unmutated sequences did not yield prognostic information, although unmutated sequences were associated with age at diagnosis >60 years (P=0.022, Fisher's exact). In conclusion, our results indicate that analysis of IGHV gene usage might aid in predicting prognosis for FL patients.",['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Enhancement of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity by dissociating its endogenous inhibitor SET is an effective approach to combat TKI-based resistance. Here, we report the identification of a novel 2-phenyloxypyrimidine compound TGI1002 to specifically disrupt SET-PP2A interaction. By binding to SET, TGI1002 inhibits SET-PP2A interaction and increases PP2A activity. In addition, knocking-down SET expression decreases tumor cell sensitivity to TGI1002. TGI1002 treatments also markedly increase dephosphorylation of BCR-ABL. Moreover, TGI1002 significantly inhibits tumor growth and prolongs survival of xenografted mice implanted with BaF3-p210T315I cells.

Study centres appointed by scientific societies design treatment optimization study protocols (TOSPs) that address an investigator-initiated research question and detail treatment procedures according to these aims. Nearly all children with malignant diseases are treated within TOSPs, whereas children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and other common paediatric rheumatic diseases are mostly treated outside TOSPs and clinical trials. Despite the differences in natural course and prognosis between malignant and inflammatory diseases, aiming for the recruitment of all children with defined rheumatic diseases into TOSPs or similar protocols would enable the longitudinal collection of crucial clinical data and improve evidence-based approaches. Successful research networks already exist in paediatric rheumatology that could facilitate the implementation of this approach.

METHODS: During part 1 (dose-finding), CLL patients received rituximab i.v. followed by a single dose of rituximab s.c. at one of three fixed doses (1400, 1600 or 1870 mg) in cycle 6. The primary objective was to identify a fixed s.c. dose that would achieve comparable rituximab serum trough concentrations (Ctrough ) to those achieved with the standard 4 weekly 500 mg m(-2) rituximab i.v. dose. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients received a fixed dose of rituximab s.c., 16 received 1400 mg, 17 received 1600 mg and 22 received 1870 mg. The 1600 mg dose was predicted to achieve non-inferior Ctrough to standard rituximab i.v. TREATMENT: The rituximab s.c. safety profile was comparable with rituximab i.v., except that local administration-related reactions, mainly mild/moderate injection site reactions, occurred more frequently with rituximab s.c., which was not unexpected. Subcutaneous administration was preferred to i.v. administration by >90% of patients and nurses (n = 112). CONCLUSIONS: SAWYER part 1 data predict that rituximab s.c. 1600 mg will achieve non-inferior Ctrough concentrations to rituximab i.v. 500 mg m(-2) , administered 4 weekly. This fixed s.c. dose is currently undergoing formal non-inferiority assessment in SAWYER part 2.

Cytoplasm is filled with long strands of rough endoplasmic reticulum and one large Golgi apparatus (paranuclear hof), demonstrating that PC are dedicated mainly to protein synthesis and excretion (immunoglobulin). Deregulation of the genome may induce clonal expansion of one PC that will lead to immunoglobulin overproduction and eventually to one among the so-called PC neoplasms. In multiple myeloma (MM), the number of PC is over 10% in most patients studied. Changes in the morphology of myeloma PC may be inconspicuous as compared to normal PC (30-50% patients). In other instances PC show one or several morphological changes. One is related to low amount of cytoplasm, defining lymphoplasmacytoid myeloma (10-15% patients). In other cases (40-50% patients), named immature myeloma cases, nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony is observed: presence of one nucleolus, finely dispersed chromatin and/or irregular nuclear contour contrast with a still large and blue (mature) cytoplasm. A peculiar morphological change, corresponding to the presence of very immature PC named plasmablasts, is observed in 10-15% cases. Several prognostic morphological classifications have been published, as mature myeloma is related to favorable outcome and immature myeloma, peculiarly plasmablastic myeloma, is related to dismal prognosis. However, such classifications are no longer included in current prognostic schemes. Changes related to the nucleus are very rare in monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). In contrast, anomalies related to the cytoplasm of PC, including color (flaming cells), round inclusions (Mott cells, Russell bodies), Auer rod-like or crystalline inclusions, are reported in myeloma cases as well as in MGUS and at times in reactive disorders. They do not correspond to malignant changes of PC but are related to abnormal synthesis, trafficking, or excretion of the immunoglobulin that is stored in excess within the cytoplasm. Occurrence of crystalline inclusions within PC may be the first anomaly leading to the diagnosis of adult Fanconi syndrome. After a historical perspective, the authors report on the various morphological aspects of PC that may occur in multiple myeloma and related disorders, and discuss about their clinical and pathophysiological significance. Today, morphological identification and accurate determination of % PC within bone marrow remain ancillary criteria for the diagnosis of MM and help for the diagnosis of rare renal disorders.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the field is still in its infancy for treatment of childhood malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Nanotherapy offers multiple advantages over conventional therapy. It facilitates targeted delivery and enables controlled release of drugs to reduce treatment-related side effects. Here, we demonstrate that doxorubicin (DOX) encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) modified with targeting ligands against CD19 (CD19-DOX-NPs) can be delivered in a CD19-specific manner to leukemic cells. The CD19-DOX-NPs were internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and imparted cytotoxicity in a CD19-dependent manner in CD19-positive ALL cells. Leukemic mice treated with CD19-DOX-NPs survived significantly longer and manifested a higher degree of agility, indicating reduced apparent systemic toxicity during treatment compared to mice treated with free DOX.
