Mice were immunized with epsilon globin chains, and a murine hybridoma cell line was established that secreted monoclonal anti-epsilon globin antibody.

This has been examined as a possible pathway for carrying into leukaemic cells a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP), SO-6, derived from Saponaria officinalis. Purified human differic transferrin was conjugated with SO-6 and a pool of proteins was obtained, with variable numbers of SO-6 molecules linked to a single transferrin molecule. Human erythroleukaemic K562 cells were grown in the presence of human transferrin, SO-6 and human transferrin conjugated with SO-6. The conjugate was found to be internalized via binding with transferrin receptor. Whereas the presence of unconjugated human transferrin and SO-6 in the medium did not significantly influence K562 cell growth, the conjugated proteins displayed an inhibitory activity on cell proliferation. This was maximal after 72 h at a transferrin concentration of 10(-9) M, with about 50% of cells being killed. Bovine transferrin, present in fetal calf serum, did not appear to compete with human diferric transferrin in binding to K562 cells in suspension culture. In a clonogenic assay, colony formation by leukaemic cells was not influenced by free SO-6 or transferrin, whereas the conjugated proteins were markedly inhibitory (about 100% at 10(-9) M). Our findings indicate that SO-6 can be efficiently carried into mammalian cells via the transferrin-transferrin receptor cycle and exert its ribosome inactivating activity. This is in keeping with the existence of an alternative pathway of transferrin endocytosis in addition to the classic acidic endosome pathway. From a practical viewpoint, conjugates between transferrin and SO-6 can be useful tools for studying the expression of transferrin receptors, and deserve also to be investigated for a possible use in cancer therapy.","['Bergamaschi, G', 'Cazzola, M', 'Dezza, L', 'Savino, E', 'Consonni, L', 'Lappi, D']","['Bergamaschi G', 'Cazzola M', 'Dezza L', 'Savino E', 'Consonni L', 'Lappi D']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Interna e Terapia Medica, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Transferrin)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Plant Proteins/*toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Transferrin/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb04218.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Mar;68(3):379-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb04218.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this phenomenon we developed an HL-60 variant which does not differentiate when exposed to TPA. HL-60 cells were exposed to the mutagen ethyl methanesulphonate and were cloned in soft agar in the presence of a normally lethal concentration of TPA. One colony of cells that proliferated in TPA was obtained. The cells of this phorbol ester tolerant (PET) line have retained their resistance to TPA for several years without selective pressure. They are somewhat larger than their phorbol ester sensitive (S) parent, but they are otherwise morphologically similar. When PET-cells are exposed to TPA their growth is arrested for approximately 48 h. Thereafter, they resume their original rate of replication at all concentrations of TPA tested. S-cells undergo changes typical of HL-60 when exposed to TPA; they aggregate, stop growing, adhere to the flask and die. The PET-cells appeared to be as sensitive as S-cells to other agents which differentiate HL-60 such as retinoic acid, dimethysulphoxide, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, as determined by rate of proliferation in culture, Wright's stain, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, and induction of the ectoenzyme NAD-glycohydrolase. TPA-induced protein phosphorylation was studied using one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Several proteins increased their incorporation of 32P when S- and PET-cells were exposed to TPA, the most prominent of which were the two previously described nuclear matrix proteins of 80 kd and 33 kd. There was no difference in the protein phosphorylation pattern in S- and PET-cells, nor in how this pattern changed on TPA exposure. Fluorescent activated cell sorting and karyotypic analysis revealed PET-cells to be a hypotetraploid variant of S-cells, with approximately 80 chromosomes, including a marker chromosome iso(1p) not found in the S-cells. Identification of the biochemical lesion responsible for this TPA resistance in PET cells will provide clues concerning the mechanism of this important pathway for the induction of cell differentiation.","['Macfarlane, D E', 'Gailani, D', 'Vann, K']","['Macfarlane DE', 'Gailani D', 'Vann K']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Hospital, Iowa City, Iowa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Genetic Variation', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb04205.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Mar;68(3):291-302. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb04205.x.,['T32 HL07344/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The decrease in amino acid uptake and incorporation into proteins was dose-dependent and reached a maximum of 60% within 3 hours at the concentration of aclacinomycin A, 200 ng/ml. A comparison of the effect on protein incorporation of 3H-alanine and cell proliferation by various anthracycline antitumor antibiotics in a concentration range of 50-200 ng/ml revealed that two other N-alkylated anthracyclines, pyrromycin and marcellomycin, are also potent inhibitors of the incorporation of amino acids into proteins. Inhibition of amino acid incorporation into proteins correlated well with the reduction of cell number at a later time. In contrast, adriamycin and daunomycin inhibited the incorporation of 3H-alanine into proteins only weakly, although these substances were highly active at inhibiting cell proliferation. Studies with an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, actinomycin D, suggest that the concomitant inhibition of amino acid uptake and incorporation into proteins observed with aclacinomycin A is not due to a reduced RNA synthesis. In addition, aclacinomycin A, up to a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, did not inhibit protein synthesis in a cell-free translational system from rabbit reticulocytes. These results indicate that the reduction of amino acid incorporation into proteins after treatment of Friend erythroleukemia cells with aclacinomycin A may be due to a reduced uptake of amino acids. Inhibition of the transport of 14C-AIB may be indicative for an interaction of aclacinomycin A with the plasma membrane.","['Schaefer, A', 'Boldt, J', 'Westendorf, J', 'Steinheider, G', 'Marquardt, H']","['Schaefer A', 'Boldt J', 'Westendorf J', 'Steinheider G', 'Marquardt H']","['Department of Toxicology, Hamburg University Medical School, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Aminoisobutyric Acids)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '1E7ZW41IQU (2-aminoisobutyric acid)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin', 'Alanine/metabolism', 'Amino Acids/*metabolism', 'Aminoisobutyric Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacology', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Rabbits', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(88)90797-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(88)90797-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1988 Apr 1;37(7):1377-82. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(88)90797-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the sterols of TPA-sensitive cells radiolabelled with [3H]leucine, [14C]acetate or [14C]pyruvate showed a high incorporation into cholesterol and a low incorporation in lanosterol + dihydrolanosterol. The inverse relationship was observed in TPA-resistant cells. Experiments with other cellular variants representing TPA-sensitive and TPA-resistant classes gave similar results. Analysis of the cellular sterol composition by gas chromatography confirmed that TPA-resistant cells are particularly rich in lanosterol/dihydrolanosterol. TPA treatment enhanced the incorporation of [14C]pyruvate into the sterol fraction of both cell types. This was accompanied by an alteration of incorporation into several lipids, particularly phospholipids. Pulse-chase studies with [14C]acetate revealed that TPA induced the release of radioactive lipids into the medium from HL-60 and Blast II cells. However this treatment released phospholipids from the TPA-sensitive cells and sterols and fatty acids from the TPA-resistant cells. We conclude that the sterol composition can regulate specific biochemical processes in the membrane and can be considered as a factor that plays a role in the responsiveness of HL-60 cells to TPA.","['Malvoisin, E', 'Wild, F', 'Zwingelstein, G']","['Malvoisin E', 'Wild F', 'Zwingelstein G']","['Unite de Virologie fondamentale et appliquee, INSERM U.51, CNRS U.613, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Pyruvates)', '0 (Sterols)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '1J05Z83K3M (Lanosterol)', '8558G7RUTR (Pyruvic Acid)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acetates/metabolism', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Line', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lanosterol/metabolism', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Pyruvates/metabolism', 'Pyruvic Acid', 'Sterols/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2500349 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1988 Mar 1;250(2):349-53. doi: 10.1042/bj2500349.,,PMC1148862,,,,,,,,,,

On treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide, HL60 cells downmodulated their steady-state c-myc message levels, ceased to proliferate, and underwent terminal differentiation. In nuclear run-on assays in which distinct segments of the c-myc gene were used as probes, an increased blocking to elongation of nascent c-myc transcripts was shown during the early phase of differentiation. During a later phase, however, a loss of transcriptional initiation was observed. This loss of promoter activity correlated well with dramatic changes in the chromatin structure of the c-myc gene, as determined by DNase I-hypersensitive site analysis. In particular, two hypersensitive sites near the two major c-myc promoters disappeared at the time that promotion abated. The newly described, later-acting negative transcriptional control of c-myc also correlated temporally with the inability to reverse the downregulation of the c-myc message quickly on withdrawal of the differentiating agent.

Toxicity in the two treatment arms was comparable and consisted primarily of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, mild hepatic dysfunction, diarrhea, conjunctivitis and serositis, and hyperglycemia. There was only one case of transient cerebellar toxicity and no cutaneous toxicity. Median time to full hematologic recovery was 5 weeks. There was an overall survival benefit for patients treated with HiDAC/ASNase (19.6 weeks) compared with HiDAC (15.9 weeks), P = .046, primarily attributable to effects in refractory patients. Median time to failure for refractory patients who achieved CR was 38.5 weeks with HiDAC/ASNase, and 13.3 weeks for those treated with HiDAC. For relapsed patients in CR from HiDAC/ASNase the median time to failure was 17.7 weeks and 18.3 weeks for HiDAC. The overall 42% CR rate from HiDAC/ASNase v 12% from HiDAC in patients with refractory AML indicates that HiDAC/ASNase is not cross-resistant with standard-dose cytarabine (SDAC) and anthracyclines.

Recent data from two cancer surveys (1969-1971, 1973-1976) reveal that nonwhite children have a lower incidence of ALL than white children. Underreporting in the nonwhite children could partly account for the difference, but other contributing factors might include a genetic predisposition, undefined socioeconomic influences, and perhaps, a viral agent.

The expression of myeloid antigens was studied before and after freezing and thawing using three monoclonal antibodies (NHL30.5, against poorly differentiated granulocytic leukemias, VIMC6 against differentiated granulocytic leukemias and granulocytes; and UCHM1 or CRIS-6, against monocytic leukemias and monocytes). The percentage of cells stained by NHL30.5 and UCHM1 or CRIS-6 was very similar before and after cryopreservation. For VIMC6, the mean staining after cryopreservation was 60% of the initial one.

At an optimal dose of 5.7 mg/kg/injection given as a single dose on days 1, 5, and 9, tetraplatin increased the median life span over controls by more than 566% with 5 of 8 long-term (50-day) survivors. In contrast, cisplatin at the same optimal dose increased survival by 186% with 2 of 8 long-term survivors, and carboplatin at an optimal dose of 75.6 mg/kg/injection increased survival by only 120% with no long-term survivors. Tetraplatin also was more effective than cisplatin when treatment was delayed until days 3, 7, and 11 after i.p. implant. A combination of tetraplatin and Adriamycin in mice bearing i.p. implanted L1210 leukemia produced more long-term survivors over a wider range of doses than could be achieved with either drug alone. Tetraplatin at 5.7 mg/kg/injection and Adriamycin at 3 mg/kg/injection on days 1, 5, and 9 increased survival by more than 566% with 8 of 8 50-day survivors. Using the same treatment schedule, combinations of tetraplatin with either cisplatin, carboplatin, daunomycin, or 5-fluorouracil did not produce therapeutic efficacy greater than that seen with tetraplatin alone. The in vitro cellular uptake of platinum by L1210 cells at 37 degrees C was about 4-fold higher after exposure to tetraplatin compared to cisplatin following a 2-h incubation at the two concentrations examined (2.5 and 5 micrograms/ml). Comparative pharmacological studies were performed in rats at a single dose of 3 mg/kg i.v. The t1/2 beta for total platinum in plasma was 29.10 h (7.47 h for unbound platinum) after the administration of tetraplatin and 23.70 h (13.09 h for unbound platinum) after cisplatin. By 48 h the urinary excretion of platinum after tetraplatin and cisplatin was 30.1% and 41.4%, respectively. Tissue distribution of platinum was similar after either complex. Thus, tetraplatin has similar pharmacological properties to cisplatin and like cisplatin is a candidate for combination chemotherapy. However, tetraplatin may be superior to cisplatin in some therapeutic situations based on its greater efficacy against selected tumors.","['Rahman, A', 'Roh, J K', 'Wolpert-DeFilippes, M K', 'Goldin, A', 'Venditti, J M', 'Woolley, P V']","['Rahman A', 'Roh JK', 'Wolpert-DeFilippes MK', 'Goldin A', 'Venditti JM', 'Woolley PV']","['Division of Medical Oncology, School of Medicine, Lombardi Cancer Research Center, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. 20007.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', 'SFK1SGY8V1 (ormaplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Bile/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Naphthacenes/therapeutic use', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Tissue Distribution']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Apr 1;48(7):1745-52.,['PHSCA 5P30CA1-4626/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of N-acetyl-1,6-diaminohexane (NADAH), 1,6-diaminohexane (DAH), 6-acetamidohexanoic acid (AcHA), and 6-aminohexanoic acid (AmHA). Gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus selective detection was used to quantify cellular concentrations of each metabolite. Cellular concentrations of AmHA and DAH were greater than those of NADAH and AcHA but no concentration of a metabolite exceeded that of HMBA. Metabolites were not detected in media from cells incubated with HMBA. Friend murine erythroleukemia cells that were resistant to HMBA contained only HMBA and NADAH. Moreover, the concentrations of NADAH in Friend murine erythroleukemia cells that were resistant to HMBA were less than those in the other cell lines studied. HL60 cells accumulated HMBA rapidly. NADAH, DAH, AcHA, and AmHA appeared sequentially in HL60 cells that were incubated with HMBA. NADAH appeared very rapidly, but concentrations of DAH were greater than or equal to those of NADAH by 8 h. AcHA and AmHA were not detected in cells before 24-48 h of incubation with HMBA. HL60 cells incubated with individual HMBA metabolites were able to accumulate each compound and to interconvert some: cells incubated with NADAH also contained DAH, AcHA, and AmHA; cells incubated with AcHA also contained low concentrations of AmHA; cells incubated with DAH also contained AmHA; and cells incubated with AmHA contained no other HMBA metabolites. HMBA was not present in cells incubated with any of its known metabolites.

In MDS, the FAB subtype was also found to have prognostic value and this was enhanced when the chromosomal findings were taken into consideration. In AML, the age of the patient correlated more closely with the chromosomal changes in predicting prognosis in most patients than did the FAB classification. Previously we reported that refined chromosome analysis of bone marrow specimens from 161 adult patients with primary or non-therapy related MDS and AML identified three prognostic chromosomal categories in each disease, representing 40% of all patients (Yunis et al, 1984, 1986). By extending our study to 284 patients, as well as a longer follow-up, it was possible to determine the prognostic implications of two additional chromosomal categories in MDS and five in AML.

It could be clearly shown that in some leukaemic granulocytes primary and secondary eosinophilic as well as basophilic granules occur side by side.

Since normal mast cell granules as well as granules of normal eosinophilic promyelocytes are naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase-positive, it would appear possible that mastocytoid as well as primary eosinophilic granules within the leukaemic basophils are responsible for the atypical, granular naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase-positivity of these cells.

This study suggests that previous administration of DNR or adriamycin does not induce significant resistance to anthracycline: DNR appears to be almost as efficient in patients with relapsed and refractory ANLL previously treated with anthracycline as in first induction.","['Velu, T', 'Debusscher, L', 'Stryckmans, P']","['Velu T', 'Debusscher L', 'Stryckmans P']","['Institut Jules Bordet, Service de Medecine, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthacenes/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830270315 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1988 Mar;27(3):224-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830270315.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the role of 1,2-diacylglycerol, one of the products of receptor-linked phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, in mediating the migratory response of leukocytes. In an under-agarose migration system, we found 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol to be a strong chemoattractant for human PMN, 6C3HED (a mouse thymic lymphoma), and Jurkat (a human T-cell leukemia). By using a modified Boyden chamber assay, the migratory response of PMN to 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol was determined to be primarily chemotactic. Analysis of structural analogs indicated that both the position and number of acyl chains are important in determining chemoattractant activity. These studies demonstrate that exogenous 1,2-diacylglycerol can stimulate the directed migration of leukocytes. They further suggest that the formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol following receptor-mediated stimulation may represent a common step in the migratory responses of myeloid and lymphoid cells.","['Wright, T M', 'Hoffman, R D', 'Nishijima, J', 'Jakoi, L', 'Snyderman, R', 'Shin, H S']","['Wright TM', 'Hoffman RD', 'Nishijima J', 'Jakoi L', 'Snyderman R', 'Shin HS']","['Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (1,2-diacylglycerol)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Diffusion', 'Diglycerides/*pharmacology', 'Glycerides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.85.6.1869 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Mar;85(6):1869-73. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.6.1869.,"['AI 19826/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 01298/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 14113/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC279882,,,,,,,,,,

Initially only leukemic clusters grew from cells plated in semisolid medium, but after 1 or more weeks in LTMC, morphologically normal granulocyte-macrophage colonies were detected. Nonetheless, in one of the patients, more than 80% of these colonies expressed the G6PD type observed in the leukemic blast cells, indicating a probable neoplastic derivation for many of them.

Colonies derived from clonal or normal stem cells were not morphologically distinguishable.

Additional frequent findings in this group were an increased cellularity, nuclear-cytoplasmic dissociation of maturation, eosinophilia, and macrophages that contained ingested nuclei. Similar changes were found in far fewer patients without increased marrow mast cells. Only one patient with massive cutaneous mastocytosis had mast cells with relatively large nuclei and immature granules in the extensively involved marrow. Repeated biopsies in this and in six other patients over 3 years showed no worsening of the marrow findings, and the clinical course of all patients was stable over up to 10 years of follow-up. The variable findings in the patients suggest that mastocytosis with cutaneous involvement is a heterogeneous disease where diverse stimuli may cause an increase of mast cells. The clinical course is, however, relatively stable.","['Czarnetzki, B M', 'Kolde, G', 'Schoemann, A', 'Urbanitz, S', 'Urbanitz, D']","['Czarnetzki BM', 'Kolde G', 'Schoemann A', 'Urbanitz S', 'Urbanitz D']","['Department of Dermatology, University Clinics, Munster, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis/*complications/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Urticaria Pigmentosa/*complications/pathology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0190-9622(88)70007-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0190-9622(88)70007-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1988 Jan;18(1 Pt 1):45-51. doi: 10.1016/s0190-9622(88)70007-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell. Physiol., 131:50-57, 1987). In the present study we demonstrated the existence of an intracellular differentiation-inducing activity (int-DIA) in differentiation-committed phenotype-nonexpressing HL-60 cells by using cybrid formation between untreated HL-60 cells and cytoplasts from HL-60 cells treated in magnesium-deficient medium with 100 nM 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). Cell extracts from similarly treated HL-60 cells also showed int-DIA, which when added (10 mg total protein/ml) to culture of untreated HL-60 cells, could increase the percentages of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)- and nonspecific esterase (NSE)-positive cells from 1% to 53%, and from 0 to 32%, respectively. They also induced differentiation of human monoblastic leukemia U-937 cells and of human myeloblastic leukemia KG-1 cells but not of erythroleukemia K-562 cells. These results suggested that the int-DIA had a common effect on differentiation induction in several human myeloid cell lines and may be involved in inducing cells to proceed from a commitment to a phenotype-expression step during human myeloid cell differentiation.","['Okazaki, T', 'Kato, Y', 'Tashima, M', 'Sawada, H', 'Uchino, H']","['Okazaki T', 'Kato Y', 'Tashima M', 'Sawada H', 'Uchino H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Extracts/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/pathology', 'Intracellular Membranes/analysis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism/pathology']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041340212 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1988 Feb;134(2):261-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041340212.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most importantly, the clones express NaF-sensitive non-specific-esterase, produce reactive oxygen and stain with MAb My4. Mono Mac 6, in addition, constitutively exhibits phagocytosis of antibody-coated erythrocytes in 80% of the cells and reacts with a panel of MAbs that are specific for mature monocytes, i.e., M42, LeuM3, 63D3, Mo2 and UCHMI. By contrast, the monoblastic cell lines U937 and THP-I are negative for all these markers. Only expression of My4 could be detected after differentiation induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Similar treatment of Mono Mac I, however, resulted in staining with all the monocyte-specific MAbs mentioned above, while IFN-gamma treatment of Mono Mac 6 enhanced antigen expression.

We examined the protective role of the alkyltransferase in the nitrosourea resistance observed in this myeloid leukemia cell line to determine whether inactivation of the alkyltransferase with the modified base, O6-methylguanine (O6mGua), could sensitize these cells to nitrosoureas. The HL-60 cells were sensitized approximately 3.0-fold to five different nitrosoureas when the alkyltransferase was inactivated by 88% following a 24-h preincubation in 0.5 mM O6mGua. No effect of O6mGua preincubation was observed in the K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line which is sensitive to nitrosoureas and has low levels of alkyltransferase activity. When regeneration of HL-60 alkyltransferase activity after exposure to nitrosoureas was prevented by maintaining cells in O6mGua, HL-60 became even more sensitive (3.7- to 8.5-fold) to nitrosoureas but remained slightly more resistant than K562. Next, we compared the dose of methyl- and chloroethylnitrosoureas which were cytotoxic in HL-60 with the dose which caused repair-induced inactivation of the alkyltransferase. Both methyl- and chloroethyl-nitrosoureas caused the dose-dependent inactivation of the alkyltransferase and with both, cytotoxicity was increased with O6mGua exposure. However, chloroethylnitrosoureas, which form a variety of O6 alkylation adducts, some of which are poorly repaired, exhibited 7-12 times more cytotoxicity relative to repair-induced inactivation of the alkyltransferase whereas methylnitrosoureas became cytotoxic only when the alkyltransferase had been inactivated. These data suggest that leukemic cells are sensitized to both methyl- and chloroethylnitrosoureas when O6mGua is used to persistently inactivate the alkyltransferase. However, the alkyltransferase provides more efficient protection from methylnitrosoureas than chloroethylnitrosoureas most likely because the latter form adducts which are poorly repaired by the protein and which if unrepaired may become cytotoxic cross-links.","['Gerson, S L', 'Trey, J E', 'Miller, K']","['Gerson SL', 'Trey JE', 'Miller K']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '9B710FV2AE (O-(6)-methylguanine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Repair', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Methyltransferases/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/03/15 00:00,1988/03/15 00:01,['1988/03/15 00:00'],"['1988/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Mar 15;48(6):1521-7.,"['CA 07912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ESCA 00134/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Median survivals shorter than 18 months were associated with the appearance of any of the following: cytogenetic clonal evolution; extramedullary disease; peripheral blasts greater than or equal to 15%, peripheral blasts and promyelocytes greater than or equal to 30%, or peripheral basophils greater than or equal to 20%; platelet count less than 1.0 X 10(5)/microliters; marrow blasts greater than or equal to 15%, marrow blasts and promyelocytes greater than or equal to 30%, or marrow basophils greater than or equal to 20%. Relative hazard ratios, or risk of death per unit time, were calculated based on the relative survivals of patients who did or did not develop the particular feature of accelerated disease, after accounting for the time to development of the characteristic. Further analysis identified five features that have additive independent prognostic importance: cytogenetic clonal evolution; peripheral blasts greater than or equal to 15%; peripheral basophils greater than or equal to 20%; peripheral blasts and promyelocytes greater than or equal to 30%; and thrombocytopenia.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), retinoic acid (RA), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] increased the appearance of mature myelocytic (DMSO and RA) or monocytic [1,25(OH)2D3] cells. The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) increased the appearance of adherent macrophage-like cells. Coincident with the appearance of differentiated cells induced by DMSO, RA, and 1,25(OH)2D3 was an increase in PL-Ca-PK activity. In contrast, TPA treatment resulted in the rapid disappearance of PL-Ca-PK and the induction of phospholipid- and Ca2+- (PL-Ca-) independent protein kinase activity. The phosphorylation pattern resulting from endogenous PL-Ca-PK in extracts from cells treated with DMSO, RA, or 1,25(OH)2D3 showed a prominent phosphorylated protein of molecular weight 37,000 (pp37) and 38,000 (pp38) which was related to the appearance of the myelocyte/monocyte phenotype. pp37 and pp38 were also present in TPA-treated cells, but their phosphorylation was no longer dependent on the presence of phospholipid and calcium. Cells treated with DMSO and RA also exhibited a PL-Ca-dependent pp21 which was barely evident in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells and thus represented a myeloid cell marker. Also present was a prominent PL-Ca-dependent pp19 which remained unchanged following treatment with DMSO, RA, and 1,25(OH)2D3, but which diminished markedly in TPA-treated cells. On the other hand, TPA-treated cells exhibited a characteristic pp130 which was antigenically related to the actin binding protein, vinculin.

Morphological and functional features.,49-56,"The effect of phospholipid vesicles on chromatin structure, protein composition and globin RNA synthesis has been analysed in nuclei isolated from murine erythroleukemia cells. In terms of chromatin organisation, PC vesicles with neutral surface charge do not affect the structure of chromatin fibres, whereas negatively charged PS vesicles induce chromatin decondensation to a great extent. Indeed the fibres appear uniformly dispersed lacking also the perinucleolar heterochromatin. These morphological features are accompanied by depletion of lysine-rich histones H1 and H1(0) and of histone-like protein A5, due to PS liposomes. Functionally, PS vesicles induce enhancement both of total RNA and specific mRNA synthesis, as analysed by in vitro transcription of beta globin gene. On the contrary, PC vesicles do not seem to affect significantly total RNA and globin mRNA synthesis. These observations fit well with previous data obtained in other experimental systems, and support both the use of these molecules as probes for chromatin structure and function and their possible involvement in transcriptional events.","['Cocco, L', 'Gilmour, R S', 'Maraldi, N M', 'Martelli, A M', 'Papa, S', 'Manzoli, F A']","['Cocco L', 'Gilmour RS', 'Maraldi NM', 'Martelli AM', 'Papa S', 'Manzoli FA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (Amanitins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",IM,"['Amanitins/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Liposomes/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Phosphatidylserines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1768-322x.1985.tb00379.x [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Cell. 1985;54(1):49-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1768-322x.1985.tb00379.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, leukemic cells from the blood or bone marrow of eight untreated patients with common or pre-B ALL were analyzed using the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (reactive with the IL 2 receptor) in indirect immunofluorescence. The receptors for IL 2, which were initially absent from the cell surface, were induced on high percentages of the ALL cells after the in vitro exposure to the lectin phytohemagglutinin or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in six patients, suggesting that the cells had become sensitive to IL 2. In colony cultures to which feeder leukocytes and IL 2 had been added, colony growth was obtained in five of eight cases. Whereas the cells from one patient formed colonies in the absence of exogenous stimuli, the cells from others were dependent on the addition of feeder leukocytes plus IL 2. In the latter cases, feeder leukocytes alone, releasing some IL 2, stimulated growth suboptimally at different cell concentrations. Their stimulative effect was significantly enhanced when leukocyte-derived IL 2 or pure recombinant IL 2 was supplemented. Alone, IL 2 (up to 500 U/mL) did not support colony formation. Apparently, IL 2 and feeder leukocytes are both required for the induction of colonies in these cases of ALL. From cell sorting of fluorescent anti-common ALL antigen (CALLA) stained cells it appeared that colonies descended from cells with high as well as low or negative CALLA expression. Immunophenotyping demonstrated the presence of the original leukemia markers on colony cells, but was not indicative of maturation of ALL toward more differentiated B cells. We suggest that IL 2 can stimulate the in vitro proliferation of certain neoplastic B lymphocyte progenitors.","['Touw, I', 'Delwel, R', 'Bolhuis, R', 'van Zanen, G', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Touw I', 'Delwel R', 'Bolhuis R', 'van Zanen G', 'Lowenberg B']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/cytology/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85494-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Sep;66(3):556-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,

As compared with control subjects, decreased numbers of CFU-E and BFU-E were found in patient marrow depleted of neoplastic B cells in all Rai stages of the disease. As a group, Rai stage III through IV patients with or without aplasia (CLL-aplasia) had significantly fewer CFU-E and BFU-E than did Rai O through II stage patients. The numbers of T gamma cells infiltrating CLL marrows were increased 3, 9, and 20 times normal in Rai O through II, Rai III through IV, and CLL-aplasia groups, respectively. Removal of T cells from marrow increased growth of CFU-E and BFU-E in all Rai O through IV patients, but the increase was significant in the CLL-aplasia group only (P less than .05). However, autologous coculture of marrow T cells or T gamma cells but not B cells with marrow B + T-depleted null cells at ratios of 0.2:1 to 1:1 suppressed CFU-E and BFU-E growth in all three patient groups. We conclude that the hypoproliferative anemia occurring in the course of B cell CLL is due to gradual accumulation in the marrow of T gamma lymphocytes which suppress erythroid progenitor cell growth.

Isofocusing in granulated gels separated intact uridylic acid (U)-snRNPs from tRNA and La RNPs. The U-snRNPs remained immunoprecipitable by lupus antisera throughout fractionation. The final product obtained in 2% yield contained primarily U1 and U2 snRNAs and lesser amounts of U3, U4, U5, and U6, along with the core U-snRNP polypeptides A-G. The core polypeptides displayed apparent pI's which ranged from 4.5 to 9.5 when analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Upon stimulation by allogeneic lymphocytes or leukemic cell lines, a large proportion of T cells underwent blastogenesis and began expressing DR antigens. Analysis by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter revealed that both subpopulations of large activated T cell blasts and of small T lymphocytes became DR+ by synthesis and/or uptake. Depletion of DR+ responder cells from 6-day-old MLRs by treatment with anti-DR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) plus complement (C) reduced but did not completely abrogate the natural killer (NK)-like activity of the responder lymphocytes, suggesting that the MLR-induced cytotoxic cells include both DR+ and Dr- populations. The expression of NK-like activity by the responder cells was also greatly reduced upon addition of anti-DR mAbs (without C) at the start of the mixed cultures. This effect was observed regardless of the presence of DR antigens on the stimulator cells, indicating that the anti-DR mAbs can interact with the antigens present on both the stimulator and responder populations.

The thymus is extremely hypoplastic, with a greater than or equal to 80% reduction in the number of thymocytes. This cellular deficiency appears to be the result of a deficiency in the number of precursor cells in the early thymus, since the rate of proliferation of thymocytes in explanted day-14 thymuses was normal. However, the functional maturation of thymocytes was delayed in vitro in day-17 organ explants, although the maximal response to the mitogenic and interleukin 2-stimulating effects of concanavalin A are quantitatively normal. B cells and pre-B cells in the fetal liver were moderately decreased, but the ability of fetal liver cells to be transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus was nearly totally lost. There were also significant relative and absolute decreases in the number of spleen, culture, and erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-S, CFU-C, CFU-E) and of erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) in the trisomic liver, and the trisomic animals were anemic with small spleens and livers. However, unlike other genetically caused anemias, there was no reduction in the number of germ cells. The hematopoietic abnormalities in the trisomy 16 mouse, involving the lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid cell lineages, are much more generalized than the abnormalities in any of the other described genetically caused immunodeficiencies or anemias in the mouse. They are also more severe than those in human trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), for which mouse trisomy 16 is a genetic model, but there does exist an interesting parallel between the thymic abnormalities in the two species.","['Epstein, C J', 'Hofmeister, B G', 'Yee, D', 'Smith, S A', 'Philip, R', 'Cox, D R', 'Epstein, L B']","['Epstein CJ', 'Hofmeister BG', 'Yee D', 'Smith SA', 'Philip R', 'Cox DR', 'Epstein LB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down Syndrome/genetics', 'Female', 'Fetus/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Liver/pathology', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Thymus Gland/*abnormalities', '*Trisomy']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.162.2.695 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 Aug 1;162(2):695-712. doi: 10.1084/jem.162.2.695.,"['HD-00481/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-17001/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'N0I-HD-2858/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2187749,,,,,,,,,,

The binding of 35S-labelled recombinant DNA-derived leukocyte clone A IFN (35S-rIFN alpha A) to PBCs from 8 patients with CML was determined before and during IFN alpha treatment. The patients' mean pretherapy binding level (0.049 femtomoles of bound 35S-rIFN alpha A) was in the range of values obtained from 4 normal donors (mean of 0.054 femtomoles bound). Within 24 hr of the first IFN alpha dose, the mean femtomoles bound decreased 10-fold and remained low during the course of IFN alpha treatment. In I/I patient, we demonstrated that this decreased binding was due to a loss in number of IFN receptors. The apparent number of receptors after 5 doses of IFN alpha decreased from approximately 600 receptors per cell at pretherapy to approximately 75 receptors per cell, with no difference in the dissociation constants (1.13 X 10(-10)M, 0.968 X 10(-10)M, before and during treatment, respectively). In 4/4 patients, we demonstrated indirectly that the decreased binding was not due to receptor saturation as a result of residual circulating IFN alpha. In 3/3 patients, we demonstrated a gradual recovery of binding capacity after incubating the patients' PBCs at 37 degrees C. Within 2-7 days in vivo recovery of binding, comparable to pretherapy levels, was observed in 3/3 patients whose IFN alpha therapy was discontinued. Combining all these data, we conclude that in both responding and nonresponding patients with CML, IFN alpha exposure induces decreased binding of labelled IFN when a single recombinant DNA-derived IFN species is used. We feel the supporting data indicate that the decreased binding capacity may be due to receptor down-regulation. In the limited number of patients studied thus far, there was no correlation between clinical hematologic response and occurrence of down-regulation, however, down-regulation of cell surface receptors may be required to sustain a biological effect. Further studies of both the kinetics of down-regulation and activation of key enzyme systems are required to fully evaluate the relevance of these findings.","['Maxwell, B L', 'Talpaz, M', 'Gutterman, J U']","['Maxwell BL', 'Talpaz M', 'Gutterman JU']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/*analysis', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Type I/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/therapy', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interferon', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes']",1985/07/15 00:00,1985/07/15 00:01,['1985/07/15 00:00'],"['1985/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910360105 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1985 Jul 15;36(1):23-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910360105.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tritium from [5-3H]dCyd was released significantly faster than from [5-3H]dUrd under a variety of conditions. Both 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (1 microM) and methotrexate (10 microM), which effectively block intracellular dTMP synthesis, completely inhibited the release of tritium from either [5-3H]dCyd or [5-3H]dUrd demonstrating that the release of tritium is mediated exclusively by the dTMP synthase catalyzed reaction. In addition, there was a good correlation between tritium release, cellular uptake, and incorporation of [2-14C]dUrd into DNA. The inhibitory effects of antifolates such as methotrexate were independent of the type of labeled precursor used. In contrast, preferential interference with the release of tritium from [5-3H]-dCyd by dCyd derivatives and from [5-3H]dUrd by dUrd derivatives was observed, suggesting that competition for uptake and/or phosphorylation may contribute to the overall effects of certain nucleoside analogues on cellular dTMP synthase activity measured using the tritium release assay.","['Yalowich, J C', 'Kalman, T I']","['Yalowich JC', 'Kalman TI']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism', 'Deoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Floxuridine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tritium']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(85)90788-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(85)90788-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1985 Jul 1;34(13):2319-24. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(85)90788-9.,"['CA-13,604/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that these cells contain a membrane-associated Man-6-P receptor that is distinct from the previously described receptor. The new receptor binds lysosomal enzymes containing phosphomannosyl residues. This binding is inhibited by Man-6-P or by pretreatment of the lysosomal enzymes with alkaline phosphatase. Lysosomal enzyme binding occurs at neutral pH and dissociation of the bound ligand occurs at low pH values comparable to those found within endosomes or lysosomes. The new receptor differs from the 215-kDa Man-6-P receptor in two ways. It has an absolute requirement for divalent cations and is unable to bind Dictyostelium discoideum lysosomal enzymes, which contain methylphosphomannosyl residues rather than the usual phosphomannosyl monoesters. Based on the difference in cation requirement, we suggest that the 215-kDa receptor be referred to as Man-6-P receptor CI (cation independent) and the new receptor as Man-6-P receptor CD (cation dependent). We conclude that the Man-6-P receptor CD functions in the targeting of newly synthesized acid hydrolases to lysosomes in P388D1 macrophages.","['Hoflack, B', 'Kornfeld, S']","['Hoflack B', 'Kornfeld S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Manganese Compounds)', '0 (Receptor, IGF Type 2)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'QQE170PANO (manganese chloride)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', '*Chlorides', 'Dictyostelium/enzymology', 'Hexosaminidases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia P388/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Lysosomes/*enzymology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Manganese/pharmacology', '*Manganese Compounds', 'Membranes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptor, IGF Type 2', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.13.4428 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Jul;82(13):4428-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.13.4428.,['R01 CA08759/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC391114,,,,,,,,,,

These cells responded to the T cell mitogens PHA and Con A in a blast transformation assay but not the anti-T cell monoclonal antibody Leu 4 and the B cell mitogen, PWM. The concentration of PHA or Con A eliciting maximum blast transformation was less than that required by normal mononuclear cells. The leukemic cells recognised and responded to allogeneic pooled mononuclear cells in a mixed lymphocyte culture. In addition, although they did not express Ia antigens, they served as effective stimulators in the mixed lymphocyte reaction. Consistent with the helper phenotype, the leukemic cells did not produce suppressor factors, but provided help for normal B-enriched lymphocytes to respond to PWM as assessed by both blast transformation and IgG production. T lymphocyte colonies developed when the leukemic cells were treated with PHA during a 20 h liquid culture prior to being seeded into semisolid agar medium containing either PHA or an IL2-containing lymphokine. There was no growth when untreated cells were seeded directly into IL2-containing agar. Analysis of colony formation indicated that, as with normal resting T lymphocytes, proliferation occurred in two distinct steps; activation in response to PHA and replication in response to IL2-like growth factors.

A maximum of three hexosaminidase (Hex) isoenzymes (A = anodic, I = intermediate, B = basic) could be demonstrated. The immunological phenotyping of 74 leukemia-lymphoma derived cell lines had led to a categorization into four groups with a subclassification of the T- and B-cell lines into several stages of differentiation: 26 T-cell, 34 B-cell, 6 myelomonocytic and 8 Non-T, Non-B cell leukemia-lymphoma cell lines. Twelve so-called 'normal' B-lymphoblastoid cell lines were also available. Distinct isoenzyme profiles were seen in the different stages of differentiation in the T- and B-leukemia-lymphoma cell lines. Among the 12 normal B-lymphoblastoid cell lines heterogeneity in the isoenzymatic phenotypes was detected. Hex isoenzyme expression in normal and neoplastic lymphoid cell lines represents hypothetically sequential stages of T- and B-cell differentiation. Myelomonocytic cell lines displayed strongly stained bands of all three isoenzymes. Heterogeneity was seen in the group of Non-T, Non-B cell lines. Four out of 5 pre B-cell lines and 4 out of 4 Non-T, Non-B cell lines which are comparable to cases of pre B- and common ALL revealed a high Hex I/Hex A ratio in terms of intensity of the isoenzyme bands. The analysis of Hex isoenzymes is useful for characterizing lymphoid and myeloid populations (both normal and malignant, cultured or fresh), particularly with regard to their stage of differentiation.

Three patients received T cell-depleted, HLA-matched marrow, and one received untreated marrow from an identical twin. Blood lymphoid cells were labeled with 25 different pairs of monoclonal antibodies. In each sample, one antibody was conjugated to fluorescein and one to phycoerythrin, thus allowing simultaneous assessment of the expression of the two markers using the fluorescence activated cell sorter. A total of 14 antibodies were used, routinely including HLE, Leu-M3, Leu-4, Leu-1, Leu-5, Leu-9, Leu-6, Leu-2, Leu-3, HLA-DR, Leu-7, Leu-11, Leu-15, and Leu-12. Other antibodies were used to further define some populations. This study has allowed us to define six distinct cell types that have appeared in all four patients by day 90 posttransplantation, and which account for 90-100% of all circulating lymphoid cells. These cell types are (a) T helper cells expressing Leu-1, Leu-4, Leu-9, Leu-5, Leu-3, and variable amounts of HLA-DR; (b) T suppressor cells expressing Leu-1, Leu-4, Leu-9, Leu-5, Leu-2, and variable amounts of HLA-DR; (c) B cells expressing Leu-12, B1, HLA-DR, IgD, and IgM, but none of the T cell antigens; (d) an unusual B cell phenotype (Leu-1 B) expressing all of the B cell markers, and also having low amounts of Leu-1, but none of the other T cell antigens; (e) natural killer (NK) cells expressing Leu-11, Leu-15, Leu-5 but none of the other T cell or B cell markers; (f) NK cells expressing Leu-11, Leu-15, Leu-5, and low levels of Leu-2. Both NK types also express Leu-7 on some, but not all cells. The relative frequencies of these cell types varied among the patients and with time, but the striking findings were the presence of relatively few mature T cells, large numbers of NK cells, and the preponderance of the unusual Leu-1 B cell over conventional B cells in all three patients who developed B cells. Sorting experiments confirmed the NK activity of the major NK cell phenotypes, and DNA analysis confirmed that all of the cells studied were of donor origin.

Spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice bearing the syngeneic LSA ascites tumor failed to demonstrate significant tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity when stimulated in vitro with irradiated tumor cells. This lack of CTL activity correlated with the presence and high activity of two types of CTL-regulatory suppressor T cells (Ts), tumor-specific Thy-1+, Lyt-1-2+ and tumor-nonspecific Thy-1+, Lyt-1+2+ cells, as demonstrated by a double-positive selection technique. In contrast, spleen cells from BCNU-treated tumor-bearing mice generated high tumor-specific CTL activity when stimulated in vitro with irradiated tumor cells. This CTL activity correlated with the lack of demonstrable tumor-specific Ts and greatly diminished tumor-nonspecific Ts activity. The tumor-specific helper activity of Thy-1+, Lyt-1+,2- cells was found to be similar in both BCNU-treated and untreated tumor-bearing mice. BCNU-treated mice that survived a primary LSA tumor challenge (referred to as BCNU-cured mice) resisted subsequent challenge with the homologous (LSA) but not with a heterologous syngeneic tumor (EL-4). However, rejection of a secondary challenge with LSA tumor by BCNU-cured mice was inhibited by adoptive transfer of spleen cells from either normal mice or mice bearing LSA tumors. Furthermore, LSA tumor cells that failed to evoke tumor-specific CTL activity in normal mice could induce high CTL activity in BCNU-cured mice. The present study suggests that, in addition to its direct tumoricidal activity, BCNU inhibits the induction of tumor-specific Ts, thereby explaining why a high percentage of mice survive a primary syngeneic tumor challenge after treatment with BCNU, and also resist subsequent rechallenge with the homologous tumor.","['Nagarkatti, M', 'Kaplan, A M']","['Nagarkatti M', 'Kaplan AM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carmustine/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/*drug effects', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/*immunology/transplantation', 'Thymus Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/immunology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Aug;135(2):1510-7.,['CA 33629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of isolated sIg/IgE/Fc epsilon R complexes indicated that about 60% of the Fc epsilon molecules were becoming cross-linked to sIg. Thus, the data suggest that on the intact murine B cell the Fc epsilon R is frequently in close association with sIg. The murine B cell Fc epsilon R was also examined for the presence of receptor-associated proteins that are buried in the membrane. Advantage was taken of the membrane-impermeant nature of DTSSP and BS3. IgE was cross-linked to the Fc epsilon R on intact cells by using the disulfide-cleavable DTSSP and following solubilization with nonionic detergent; BS3 was used to cross-link possible internal membrane components to the Fc epsilon R. In these experiments, the high-affinity Fc epsilon R on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells could be cross-linked to a nonreducible high molecular weight complex of 100 kilodaltons. However, when intact murine B cells were treated with DTSSP, solubilized and treated with BS3 in the same manner as indicated above, no evidence was found for the presence of membrane-buried receptor-associated proteins with the B cell Fc epsilon R.

To further elucidate the mechanism of this phosphorylation event, we have examined the protein kinases which can reconstitute this event in a cell-free system. Activation of the endogenous Ca2+-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (Ca-PL-PK) as well as addition of purified Ca-PL-PK to the cytosol of HL-60 leukemic cells resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of phosphoprotein Mr 27,000 (PP27) but did not affect the phosphorylation of phosphoprotein Mr 17,000 to 20,000 (PP17-20). In contrast, PP17-20 was heavily phosphorylated under cell-free conditions by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK). Exposure of intact cells to dibutyryl-cAMP resulted in increased phosphorylation of PP17-20. These conditions also enhanced the phosphorylation of PP27, showing that PP27 can act as a substrate for both Ca-PL-PK and cAMP-PK under cell-free conditions. Tryptic digest analysis of PP17-20 showed that one of four phosphopeptides is preferentially phosphorylated in PMA-induced PP17-20. An additional phosphopeptide was phosphorylated in cAMP-PK-catalyzed PP17-20. Thus, cAMP-PK alone mimics the effect of PMA on phosphorylation of PP17-20, but it introduces additional modifications. The precise role of this kinase in PMA-induced phosphorylation of PP17-20 remains to be clarified. We found further that enhanced phosphorylation of PP17-20 is also associated with malignant transformation of NIH/3T3 cells transformed by V-rasKi oncogene of Kirsten sarcoma virus. The tryptic phosphopeptide map of PP17-20 (phosphorylated in vivo) in the transformed cells was similar to that of PP17-20 in PMA-treated HL-60 cells but not to that induced by cAMP-PK, suggesting that the process activated by PMA which leads to phosphorylation of PP17-20 resembles an intrinsic cellular process which is enhanced in certain malignant cells.","['Feuerstein, N', 'Nishikawa, M', 'Cooper, H L']","['Feuerstein N', 'Nishikawa M', 'Cooper HL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kirsten murine sarcoma virus', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phorbols/*toxicity', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Protein Kinases/analysis/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*toxicity', 'Trypsin/pharmacology']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Jul;45(7):3243-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this issue further, we have examined the state of immunoglobulin genes in tumor cells from two affected patients, immunophenotyped their leukemic cells using a number of monoclonal antibody reagents with specificities for lymphoid or myelomonocytic antigens, and examined the malignant cells by electron microscopy. DNA was extracted from leukemic bone marrow cells and hybridized with radiolabeled DNA fragment probes specific for the constant region of immunoglobulin heavy chain and kappa and lambda light chain genes. Autoradiographs revealed rearrangement of both allelic heavy chain genes, but a germline configuration of light chain genes in both cases. Surface marker analysis showed that blasts from both patients expressed HLA-DR and the myeloid antigens Leu-M1, 1C2, 2D1, and 4B3, but lacked common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen or T antigens. Furthermore, they did not have sheep erythrocyte receptors nor did they express surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulin or B cell precursor determinants. Electron microscopy analysis showed that blast cells from patient 1 exhibited numerous monoribosomes, polyribosomes, and isolated strands of rough endoplasmic reticulum in their cytoplasm.

Immunophenotypic analysis revealed a marked antigenic heterogeneity in AML, also evident within single FAB subclasses. However, leukaemic cells of FAB subclass M1 significantly more often expressed HLA class I antigen than those of FAB subclass M5a, whereas Fc gamma receptors which were expressed only on a few cells in M5a, were increasingly frequent on leukaemic cells of M1-M2, M4, and M5b leukaemias. The frequency of cells reacting with the monoclonal antibody T50/12,11,2 was related to the complete remission rate of the patients.

The five nucleotide differences in CDR-2 resulted in the variation of amino acid residues of positions 54, 56, 58, and 59.

Antibodies isolated from plasma and egg yolk were highly specific for desialylated L-LSGP (apparent molecular mass approximately 150 kDa). The antigenic sites recognized by the antibodies are probably located in the peptide moiety of the molecule since antibody binding to lymphocytes was not inhibited by a variety of different sugars or abrogated by absorption on various erythrocytes.

Risk assignment was based on an initial WBC count less than 100 X 10(9)/L, no thymic mass, no meningeal leukemia, and lymphoblasts lacking sheep erythrocyte receptors or surface immunoglobulin. A single aneuploid leukemic line was detected in 74 cases (36.1%): 70 hyperdiploid and four hypodiploid. For hyperdiploid cases, the DNA index (DI, or ratio of the DNA content of leukemic v normal G0/G1 cells) ranged from 1.06 to 2.0 (median, 1.20). A secondary leukemic line with hyperdiploid cellular DNA content was identified in 21 cases with diploid primary lines. Children whose primary leukemic line showed a DI greater than or equal to 1.16 (n = 57) had significantly better responses to treatment than did those with either a diploid DI (n = 130; P = .002) or values in the range of 1.01 to 1.15 (n = 14; P = .001). The relative risk of failure for hyperdiploid cases with DI greater than or equal to 1.16, corresponding to greater than or equal to 53 chromosomes, was one-third that of the other two groups. Treatment responses of patients with both diploid and hyperdiploid lines were identical to those associated with single diploid lines, but significantly worse than those associated with single hyperdiploid lines with DI greater than or equal to 1.16 (P = .016). The most favorable prognostic variables selected by a Cox proportional hazards model were: DI greater than or equal to 1.16 (P = .001), white race (P = .022), WBC less than or equal to 25 X 10(9)/L (P = .032), age between 2 and 9 years (P = .075), and hemoglobin less than 7.0 g/dL (P = .094). DNA index greater than or equal to 1.16 retained its significant prognostic impact even after adjustment for other variables (P = .001). With the combination of DI greater than or equal to 1.16 and WBC less than or equal to 25 X 10(9)/L, one can identify a group of children with ALL who have a low probability of relapse when treated with current therapy. If they remain disease-free after longer follow-up, it may be advisable to treat them with less intensive, hence less toxic, chemotherapy than patients with higher WBC counts or lower DI values.","['Look, A T', 'Roberson, P K', 'Williams, D L', 'Rivera, G', 'Bowman, W P', 'Pui, C H', 'Ochs, J', 'Abromowitch, M', 'Kalwinsky, D', 'Dahl, G V']","['Look AT', 'Roberson PK', 'Williams DL', 'Rivera G', 'Bowman WP', 'Pui CH', 'Ochs J', 'Abromowitch M', 'Kalwinsky D', 'Dahl GV', 'et al.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*analysis', 'Neprilysin', 'Phenotype', 'Ploidies', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cells/*analysis']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83537-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 May;65(5):1079-86.,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

All the AGr colonies that were isolated possessed phenotypes characteristic of HGPRT-deficient mutants, and the deoxyribonucleosides did not selectively affect the growth of the mutants, nor the selecting efficiency of AG, and did not significantly enhance background mutagenesis. These data show that both dThd and dCyd facilitated MNNG-induced mutagenesis. This facilitation was maximal when cells were exposed to the deoxyribonucleosides throughout the first doubling time (24 h) after treatment with MNNG and for 4 more doubling times prior to mutant selection with AG. This indicates that one round of DNA replication was sufficient for mispairing of methylated bases in the DNA with the C and T provided by the deoxyribonucleosides, and that 4-6 doublings prior to mutant selection with AG were necessary to deplete pre-existing hypoxanthine: guanine phosphoribosyl transferase in newly mutated cells. The dCyd facilitated mutagenesis by FdUrd, which was not mutagenic without dCyd, indicating that increased dCTP:dTTP ratios were mutagenic. Treatment with FdUrd plus dCyd also induced FdUrdr cells, suggesting that inhibition of dCyd utilization may prevent the development of FdUrd-resistance in cancer chemotherapy. Although dCyd and dThd facilitated mutagenesis in cells treated with monofunctional alkylating agents that methylate DNA oxygens, facilitation of mutagenesis did not occur in cells treated with BCNU, which cross links DNA, nor with benzo(a)pyrene and aflatoxin B1, which are frame shift mutagens, nor with MMS, which produces barely detectable levels of O-methylation in DNA. Virtually non toxic concentrations of dThd potentiated the cytotoxicity of MNNG more than 10-fold but that of MMS was potentiated only about 2-fold showing that O-alkylation of DNA was associated not only with the facilitation of mutagenesis but also with the potentiation of cytotoxicity. The potentiation of MNNG-induced cytotoxicity was maximal in V79 and L1210 cells after only 2 h treatment with dThd, showing that not even one round of DNA replication was necessary for this potentiation. Moreover, dCyd abolished the potentiation, and, at equitoxic concentrations, MNNG induced higher mutant frequencies than did MMS. These data show that the mechanisms by which methylating agents plus dThd induce mutagenesis are fundamentally different from their mechanisms of cytotoxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Peterson, A R', 'Danenberg, P V', 'Ibric, L L', 'Peterson, H']","['Peterson AR', 'Danenberg PV', 'Ibric LL', 'Peterson H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Basic Life Sci,Basic life sciences,0360077,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'Q150359I72 (Azaguanine)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)"", 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Azaguanine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Floxuridine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lung', 'Methylation', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/pharmacology', '*Mutation', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thymine Nucleotides/metabolism']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4613-2449-2_19 [doi]'],ppublish,Basic Life Sci. 1985;31:313-34. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4613-2449-2_19.,['CA09320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,42,,

We have, therefore, designed a clinical experiment to test the safety and feasibility of using marrow from partially matched, unrelated donors. This paper details our transplant experience in the first eight patients with leukemia. The first four patients had advanced leukemia at the time of transplantation. Each showed hematopoietic recovery, but all died from septic complications largely related to extended neutropenia encompassing both the pre-marrow-grafting and the post-marrow-grafting period. The next four patients were in remission at the time of transplantation. Each showed prompt and sustained hematopoiesis with variable graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). No acute or chronic GVHD was seen in two patients, grade II (skin only) was seen in one patient, and grade IV (skin, liver, and gut) was seen in one patient. One patient has died from sepsis five-and-one-half months following transplantation, and three are alive and well six-and-one-half to nine-and-one-half months postengraftment. This preliminary experience, together with several case reports in the literature, leads us to conclude that bone marrow transplantation with partially matched, unrelated marrow is a safe and feasible approach.

The results demonstrated that; Four SH-compounds, such as thiopronin, glutathione (reduced form), sodium thioglycolate and L-cysteine monohydrochloride monohydrate were effective to inactivate antibacterial activity of NCS against M. luteus ATCC 9341 in vitro. It was recognized that acute toxicity of NCS was reduced by pretreatment of these SH-compounds and its action was dose related. The LD50 values of NCS intravenous administration in mice increased 5.8- to 24-fold when 150, 300, 500 and 1,000 mg/kg of thiopronin were administered intravenously 2 minutes prior to NCS. And 2.3- to 4.2-fold by 500 and 1,000 mg/kg of glutathione (reduced form), 1.6- to 4.2-fold by 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of sodium thioglycolate, 1.9- to 4.2-fold by 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of L-cysteine monohydrochloride monohydrate respectively. On the other hand, pretreatment of NCS didn't affect the acute toxicity of thiopronin.","['Ito, A', 'Koide, Y', 'Haneda, I', 'Toriyama, K', 'Ouchi, M', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Baba, T']","['Ito A', 'Koide Y', 'Haneda I', 'Toriyama K', 'Ouchi M', 'Matsumoto T', 'Baba T']",,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Jpn J Antibiot,The Japanese journal of antibiotics,0154402,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Thioglycolates)', '7857H94KHM (2-mercaptoacetate)', '9014-02-2 (Zinostatin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Glutathione/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Thioglycolates/therapeutic use', 'Zinostatin/*antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Antibiot. 1985 Jan;38(1):137-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,

HeFi-1 selectively stained only the Reed-Sternberg or Hodgkin's cells in 18 of 18 cases of Hodgkin's disease, including the nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, and lymphocyte-depleted histologic subtypes. HeFi-1 did not stain any cells in normal lung, brain, salivary gland, thyroid, gall bladder, pancreas, liver, testis, breast, endometrium, or kidney. Rare large cells at the edge of the lymphoid follicles were stained in normal tonsil, colon, and hyperplastic thymus. There was no staining of any cells in 14 cases of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; however, the malignant cells in three of 11 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which appeared to express T cell markers were also stained with HeFi-1. Tissue culture cell lines including the T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia lines MOLT4 and CEM, the histiocytic cell line U-937, and the amniotic cell line WISH were not stained. Seven Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines were stained with HeFi-1, but there was no staining of three EBV+ African Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines or three EBV- American Burkitt's cell lines. HeFi-1 did not block the ability of the L428 cells to stimulate a mixed lymphocyte reaction or function as accessory cells for mitogen-induced human T cell proliferative responses.

HeFi-1 specifically immunoprecipitated a cell surface protein of approximately 120,000 daltons from both the L428 and EBV+ lymphoblastoid cell lines.

Induction and inhibition of mixed lymphocyte responses.,3722-30,"A series of macrophage (M phi) hybridomas were generated by fusion of drug-marked P388D1 (H-2d) tumor cells with CKB (H-2k) splenic adherent cells. The ability of this panel of cloned M phi hybridomas expressing various levels of surface Ia antigens to induce allogeneic mixed lymphocytes responses (MLR) was examined. All MLR stimulatory M phi hybridomas expressed surface Ia antigens. However, some Ia+ and all Ia- M phi hybridomas were unable to induce vigorous MLR responses. Furthermore, even after induction of surface Ia antigen expression with Con A supernatants (Con A Sn) or purified interferon-gamma, the nonstimulatory M phi hybridomas remained ineffective at inducing strong MLR proliferative responses. Furthermore, addition of the latter M phi hybridoma clones (both with and without Con A Sn treatment) to conventional MLR cultures resulted in inhibition of MLR responses. The series of inhibitory M phi hybridomas secreted normal levels of IL 1 upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. After surface Ia induction with Con A Sn, the inhibitory M phi hybridomas could stimulate secretion of IL 2 and expression of IL 2 receptors. Moreover, although they inhibited conventional MLR responses, IL 2 production and IL 2 receptor expression were not significantly inhibited. Addition of these M phi hybridomas 24 to 48 hr after initiation of MLR response also inhibited MLR proliferation. The results indicated that the group of inhibitory M phi hybridomas can inhibit MLR responses after IL 2 secretion and acquisition of IL 2 receptors. Finally, this inhibitory activity has been maintained during 1 yr of continuous in vitro culture, and the hybridomas represent a stable ""homogeneous"" subpopulation of inhibitory macrophages. Thus, the inhibitory phenotype appears to reflect arrest at a distinct differentiation stage.","['Ju, S T', 'Dorf, M E']","['Ju ST', 'Dorf ME']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interleukin-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Hybridomas/*immunology', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia P388/immunology/metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation', '*Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed/methods', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jun;134(6):3722-30.,['AI-14732/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Among the 10 MAAs tested, the HMW-MAA had the highest frequency and the Mr 87,000 MAA the lowest. Furthermore, the HMW-MAA displayed the lowest heterogeneity. These findings, in conjunction with the restricted tissue distribution of the HMW-MAA, its lack of susceptibility to antibody-mediated modulation, and the high affinity of the available anti-HMW-MAA monoclonal antibodies, indicate that this antigen may be a useful marker for radioimaging and immunotherapy in patients with melanoma. The common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen was detected only in five lesions. Class I HLA antigens were detected in a larger number of lesions than HLA-DR antigens, which had a significantly higher frequency than HLA-DQ antigens. The degree of antigenic heterogeneity did not appear to correlate with the histopathological features of the lesions and/or with the clinical course of the disease.

In vitro, the sensitivity of suppressor macrophages to 6-MP was not enhanced. This and the finding that 6-MP induced an increase rather than a decrease in the number of peritoneal macrophages indicated that, in vivo, 6-MP selectively inhibited suppressor macrophages. The inverse correlation of their suppressor activity and the therapeutic response in tumor-bearing mice administered with tumor vaccine and antineoplastic agents suggests that peritoneal suppressor macrophages were involved in modulating the efficacy of active immunotherapy.

Using these models, several antitumor agents have been tested and ACNU, CCNU and procarbazine were found to be highly effective when given intravenously or intraperitoneally, and the intralateral-ventricle administration of methotrexate was also found to show a moderate antitumor activity. Furthermore it was found that intraperitoneal administration of spirohydantoin mustard, and intralateral-ventricle administration of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine were highly effective against the AH130 model.","['Kobayashi, T']",['Kobayashi T'],,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Ontogeny of antigen expression.,2983-8,"T, B, and NK cells appear to represent separate lymphocyte lineages, but indirect evidence suggests that they may be related via a common lymphoid precursor cell. We have produced two monoclonal antibodies, HB-10 (IgM) and HB-11 (IgG1), by fusing spleen cells from mice immunized with the human B cell line SB, and have shown that both antibodies react with lymphocyte-specific cell surface antigens present on T, B, and NK cells, but not on other types of blood cells. The antibodies were reactive with most cell lines and malignancies of B cell origin and with some of T and NK cell lineage. Although the populations of cells expressing these two antigens were virtually identical, the HB-10 and HB-11 antibodies identified separate protease-sensitive determinants on the cell surface. The HB-11 antigenic determinant was also sensitive to neuraminidase and periodate treatments, but the HB-10 determinant was not. Antigen expression by lymphocytes from fetal, newborn, and adult tissues was examined. Within the B cell lineage, these antigens were expressed by most pre-B cells in bone marrow (88% +/- 5) and almost all B cells, but were not expressed by mature plasma cells. Virtually all of the granular lymphocytes in blood marked by the Leu-7 and Leu-11 (anti-Fc receptor) antibodies were HB-10+ and 11+. Among T lineage cells, the HB-10 and 11 antigens were expressed by a subset of relatively mature T3+ thymocytes and by greater than 90% of the T cells in newborn blood. In adults, however, only 65% of blood T cells and 24 to 30% of splenic or tonsillar T cells expressed the HB-10 and HB-11 antigens. The postnatal emergence of T cells which, like plasma cells, do not express these antigens suggests that post-thymic T lymphocyte maturation occurs and may be an activation-dependent process.","['Tedder, T F', 'Clement, L T', 'Cooper, M D']","['Tedder TF', 'Clement LT', 'Cooper MD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/metabolism', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/classification/cytology/*immunology']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 May;134(5):2983-8.,"['CA 13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

By light microscopy and ultrastructurally, LCA was localized predominantly to the cell membrane and was also present focally in the cytoplasm. Myeloid cells at all stages of maturation were non-reactive, as were erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and all non-hematopoietic tissues. Monocytes and mast cells, however, revealed membrane staining for LCA. In nearly all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of the B- and T-cell types (74 of 80; 93 per cent), the lymphoid infiltrate was immunoreactive for LCA. In specimens from patients with Hodgkin's disease (nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity type), rare Reed-Sternberg cells stained for LCA. Neoplastic cells were consistently immunoreactive for LCA in specimens from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia of the B- or T-cell type, prolymphocyte leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia. However, tissues from only three of eight cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were LCA-positive, with most non-reactive specimens exhibiting CALLA (J5) positivity. In cases of multiple myeloma, only minor populations of plasmacytic cells exhibited membrane staining for LCA. Nonhematopoietic neoplasms (102 evaluated), including small cell anaplastic carcinomas, amelanotic melanomas, alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma, and germ cell tumors, were uniformly non-reactive.

Protein kinase C is thought to be physiologically activated by diacylglycerol derived from receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. sn-1,2-diacylglycerols with short saturated acyl side chains (C4-C10) were synthesized and found to be potent activators of protein kinase C partially purified from HL-60 cells. These diacylglycerols were also competitive inhibitors of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding to the soluble phorbol diester receptor. The most potent diacylglycerol, sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, displaced greater than 90% of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate from the phorbol diester receptor of intact HL-60 cells. Because of probable cellular metabolism of sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, hourly doses were required to maintain persistent occupancy of the phorbol diester binding site. Treatment of HL-60 cells with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol produced identical phosphoprotein changes. Finally, sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol induced differentiation of the HL-60 cells into cells with morphologic characteristics of macrophages. Substitution of the hydroxyl group at position 3 with a hydrogen, chloro, or sulfhydryl moiety inactivated sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol. These data strengthen the hypothesis that protein kinase C activation plays a role in macrophage differentiation.","['Ebeling, J G', 'Vandenbark, G R', 'Kuhn, L J', 'Ganong, B R', 'Bell, R M', 'Niedel, J E']","['Ebeling JG', 'Vandenbark GR', 'Kuhn LJ', 'Ganong BR', 'Bell RM', 'Niedel JE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Diglycerides/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glycerides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.3.815 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Feb;82(3):815-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.3.815.,"['AM20205/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35680/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC397137,,,,,,,,,,

Functional association between the receptors for IgE.,1766-73,"Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) have receptors for immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G (IgG). These receptors for IgE mediate the endocytosis of chemically or immunochemically cross-linked IgE but not monomeric IgE. However, unoccupied receptors were endocytosed with cross-linked IgE. To further assess the degree and specificity of the observed coendocytosis, we exposed cells carrying monomeric rat IgE and monomeric mouse IgE anti-DNP to a DNP-protein conjugate. We found that up to 30% of the surface-bound monomeric rat IgE redistributed at 0 to 4 degrees C and was then internalized at 37 degrees C with the immunochemically cross-linked mouse IgE. To assess the specificity of the coendocytosis, we exposed cells carrying monomeric rat IgE to immunochemically cross-linked mouse IgG. We found that the binding, patching, and endocytosis of cross-linked mouse IgG had no effect on the monomerically bound rat IgE. The rate of coendocytosis was the same as the rate of endocytosis (t 1/2 3 to 5 min). The extent of coendocytosis depended on the extent of endocytosis but was relatively insensitive to changes in the ratio between mouse and rat IgE over a broad range. These results indicate that some of the receptors for IgE are associated in a specific fashion.","['Furuichi, K', 'Rivera, J', 'Triche, T', 'Isersky, C']","['Furuichi K', 'Rivera J', 'Triche T', 'Isersky C']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin conjugate)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Dinitrobenzenes/immunology', '*Dinitrophenols', 'Endocytosis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Mar;134(3):1766-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impairment of mitogen responses and suppressor phenomena.,1397-402,"In our laboratory, we have developed a murine model to examine GVHD across minor histocompatibility antigens. In our model, GVHD is induced by injecting B10.D2 spleen cells into irradiated BALB/c recipients. Seven to 10 days after irradiation and injection of cells, there are significant changes in cell function in the recipient spleens. In the B10.D2----BALB/c (600 rad) model, recipient spleen cells are profoundly unresponsive to Con A and LPS stimulation but show increased B cell activity measured by Staphylococcus aureus protein A plaque-forming activity. Spleen cells from such GVH mice profoundly suppress the mitogenic responses of normal BALB/c or B10.D2 spleen cells to Con A and LPS. The degree of impairment of the mitogenic response and the ability to suppress normal cells is proportional to the dose of cells used to induce GVH reactions. Both the inability to respond to mitogens and the capacity to suppress are also related to the dose of irradiation given to the recipients. In addition, immunosuppression across minor histocompatibility antigens shows an unevenhandedness. If we inject parental B10.D2 or BALB/c cells into F1 recipients (P----F1), there is greater inhibition of mitogenic responses when B10.D2 parental cells are given than when BALB/c cells are given to the irradiated F1 recipients. These experiments show that significant immunosuppression occurs during GVH reactions across minor histocompatibility barriers. The degree of suppression varies according to the dose of cells used to induce GVH, the dose of irradiation to the recipient and the ""strength"" of the GVH recognition system. Such experiments provide models for GVH disease seen in humans who receive treatment for leukemia or other diseases that involves recipient irradiation and infusion of HLA-identical bone marrow.","['Holda, J H', 'Maier, T', 'Claman, H N']","['Holda JH', 'Maier T', 'Claman HN']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['0 (Mitogens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Immune Tolerance/radiation effects', '*Lymphocyte Activation/radiation effects', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Minor Histocompatibility Loci', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Mar;134(3):1397-402.,"['AI-07035/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-31220/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Differential accessory cell requirement for T helper cell activation and for T-B cooperation.,1-6,"Several Ia+ tumor cell lines and peritoneal exudate macrophages were tested as accessory cells (AC) for the activation of antigen-specific T cells and for T-B cooperation. The macrophages and all the Ia+ tumor lines tested induced the release of lymphokines from T cells in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted fashion and reconstituted the antibody responses of AC-depleted spleen cells or of purified T and B cells. However, only the normal macrophages but none of the tumor lines induced carrier-specific T helper (Th) cells which help B cells for specific antihapten antibody responses by linked recognition. For T-B cooperation accessory cells were also required, but in contrast to Th cell activation any type of Ia+ AC (e.g. macrophage or tumor line) was effective. Strong MHC-restriction between the lymphocytes and the AC was seen if antigen-pulsed AC were added into the AC-depleted T-B cooperation cultures. If the AC and antigen were concomitantly added to the AC-depleted T-B cultures, MHC-restriction was less obvious. Concanavalin A supernatant reconstituted the response of AC-depleted T-B cultures provided antigen-specific Th cells and the hapten-carrier conjugate were present. If, however, tumor line-activated T cells were added instead of macrophage-induced Th cells, no cooperation with B cells took place even in the presence of Con A supernatant. The results obtained demonstrate a differential AC requirement for the induction of Th cells depending on the differentiation stage of the Th cells.","['Ramila, G', 'Studer, S', 'Kennedy, M', 'Sklenar, I', 'Erb, P']","['Ramila G', 'Studer S', 'Kennedy M', 'Sklenar I', 'Erb P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/classification/cytology/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics', 'Leukemia P388/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', '*Lymphocyte Cooperation', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology/metabolism']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830150102 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1985 Jan;15(1):1-6. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830150102.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cell preparation obtained from human peripheral blood was highly enriched for surface immunoglobulin-positive B cells. These cells were activated by brief culture with various B-cell mitogens and then compared to untreated B cells with regard to stimulatory activity in the AMLR. Mitogen-activated B cells were markedly augmented in their capacity to stimulate autologous T-cell proliferation when compared with untreated B cells. Fractionation of the B-cell preparation into high- and low-density subpopulations demonstrated that the high-density cells, enriched in resting B cells, had minimal stimulatory activity but could be activated to have increased AMLR-stimulatory capacity. Proliferation of the activated B lymphocytes was not required for the generation of the augmented AMLR. Response to both untreated and mitogen-activated B cells was a property of T4-positive T lymphocytes. The increase in stimulatory capacity was associated with a decrease in cell surface immunoglobulin, but no significant alteration in the percentage or fluorescence intensity of anti-Ia staining cells was detected. Activated B cells which are generated in vivo may acquire the capacity to generate T effector cells or factors important in the regulation of B-cell function.","['Crow, M K', 'Kunkel, H G']","['Crow MK', 'Kunkel HG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(85)90220-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(85)90220-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1985 Feb;90(2):555-68. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(85)90220-5.,"['AI-10811/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-19080/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In two FS sublines generated by soft agar cloning of FdUrd sensitive cells in the presence of 10 nM FdUrd, the level of drug resistance was maintained at 22- to 30-fold following 1 month growth in the absence of FdUrd. Characteristic of the FS sublines was a decreased accumulation and retention of free intracellular 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) averaging 3% of FdUrd sensitive cells, a more rapid rate of disappearance of free FdUMP and FdUMP-bound thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:dUMP C-methyltransferase), and enhanced alkaline and acid phosphatase activities. There was no significant difference in the number of nucleoside transport sites per cell among the FS sublines and FdUrd-sensitive cells, indicating that the decreased accumulation of FdUMP in the resistant sublines was not the result of impaired FdUrd transport across the plasma membrane. The more rapid turnover of FdUMP-bound TMP synthase observed in the FS sublines was neither accompanied by a decreased stability of the TMP synthase-FdUMP-5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate ternary complex, nor an enhanced rate of degradation of FdUrd to the less potent agent, 5-fluorouracil. In addition, the growth rates of the two FS sublines were similar to that of FdUrd sensitive cells in medium containing hypoxanthine, methotrexate, and thymidine, indicating that there was no depletion of thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21, ATP : thymidine-5'-phosphotransferase) in the FS sublines. Therefore, we propose that enhanced activities of acid and alkaline phosphatases, which influence the intracellular accumulation and retention of FdUMP, are important determinants of stable FdUrd resistance in CCRF-CEM cells.","['Fernandes, D J', 'Cranford, S K']","['Fernandes DJ', 'Cranford SK']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '365-07-1 (Thymidine Monophosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/*metabolism', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Resistance', 'Floxuridine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Thymidine Monophosphate/biosynthesis']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(85)90110-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(85)90110-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1985 Jan 1;34(1):125-32. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(85)90110-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine distinct antigens (groups I to IX) were defined by these monoclonal antibodies, some of which appear to be associated with specific stages of cellular differentiation. The number of molecules of each MAb reactive with the ALL cell line, measured in a quantitative cellular radioimmunoassay, varied from 0.6 X 10(5) to 11 X 10(5) molecules/cell, indicating that the antigens identified represent major constituents of the cell surface. The biochemical nature of the antigens was examined on the ALL cell line by antibody affinity chromatography and/or immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Groups I through III are composed of previously described antigens: HLA class I, HLA class II molecules, and CALLA, the common ALL antigen. The other MAb define antigens previously undescribed on non-T, non-B ALL cells. Group IV antigen is a polypeptide of apparent m.w. 95,000 distinct from CALLA. It is expressed on some ALL samples and on the vascular endothelial cells of several tissues. Group V antigen is a single polypeptide chain of m.w. 94,000, also distinct from CALLA and expressed by lymphocytes, thymocytes, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, and ALL cells. Group VI is a molecular complex composed of two noncovalently associated polypeptides of apparent m.w. 125,000 and 87,000 and appears to be restricted to ALL, AML, macrophages, and hematopoietic precursor cells. Group VII is a glycoprotein of apparent m.w. 85,000, which, within the thymus, is primarily restricted to the medullary area. It is also present on AML, bone marrow cells, and mature T and B lymphocytes. Group VIII is a disulfide-linked complex of apparent m.w. greater than 120,000 under nonreducing conditions. It is resolved into three major polypeptides of apparent m.w. 57,000, 47,000, and 41,000 under reducing conditions. This complex is found in greatest amounts on the non-T, non-B ALL cell line but is also present on AML, ALL, and on subpopulations of normal bone marrow and tonsil cells. Group IX antigen is a single polypeptide chain of apparent m.w. 51,000 on the ALL cell line. This antigen is expressed strongly on ALL and AML samples and on normal bone marrow; much lower antigenic density is found on thymus and tonsil cells.

In four of six cases of AMoL, high killer cell activity could be measured against this target.

The absolute number per microL of cells with T-helper phenotype was somewhat decreased in B-CLL patients compared with normal subjects (649 +/- 104 v 799 +/- 33, P less than .02), with a consequent decrease of the helper/suppressor ratio. Furthermore, co-expression of the Leu7 and, more strikingly, of the M1 markers was increased significantly on Leu3+ cells from B-CLL patients compared with normal controls (11 +/- 2% v 2 +/- 0.7%, P less than .002 for Leu7 and 40 +/- 5% v 4 +/- 1%, P less than .00001 for M1). Cytochemical studies showed that a large proportion of Leu3+ cells from B-CLL patients were granular lymphocytes, as suggested by the co-expression of natural killer (NK) cell markers. The emergence of a population of Leu3+ granular lymphocytes with NK markers, which is barely detectable in normal subjects, may provide an explanation for the impairment of T cell functions repeatedly described in B-CLL.","['Velardi, A', 'Prchal, J T', 'Prasthofer, E F', 'Grossi, C E']","['Velardi A', 'Prchal JT', 'Prasthofer EF', 'Grossi CE']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83735-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Jan;65(1):149-55.,"['CA 13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The rates of total cancer in children of low birth weight (9.3/100,000) and in twins (13.0/100,000) were close to expected.

The Leu-3+ lymphocytes binding to NK cell targets contained cytoplasmic granules similar in ultrastructure and cytochemistry to those previously defined in granular lymphocytes with NK function, except that the granules in Leu-3+ cells were smaller and fewer in number. Unlike classical NK cells, however, the granular Leu-3+ cells did not kill the target cells to which they bound, even after treatment with interferon. The proportion of granular Leu-3+ cells with the capacity to bind to NK cell targets was approximately 7% at birth and increased to approximately 21% of the Leu-3+ cells in adults.

The disulfide cleavable and noncleavable reagents 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl) propionate (DTSSP) and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) were used. With these reagents, efficient cross-linking of the alpha component of the high-affinity RBL Fc epsilon R to the membrane-buried beta and gamma components occurred only if the membrane was solubilized before the cross-linking reaction. In studies with purified murine B cells, IgE could be cross-linked to the Fc epsilon R on intact cells with either DTSSP or BS3. Under the same conditions, up to 10% of the B cell surface immunoglobulin (sIg) (both IgM and IgD) was also found to cross-link to a portion of the IgE/Fc epsilon R complex, suggesting that on the intact murine B cell the Fc epsilon R is frequently in close association with sIg. The B cell Fc epsilon R was also examined for the presence of receptor-associated proteins. Under conditions where the high-affinity RBL Fc epsilon R was substantially cross-linked to the alpha, beta, gamma complex, no evidence was seen for similar cross-linking of the B cell Fc epsilon R. Cross-linking experiments on affinity-purified Fc epsilon R preparations also gave no evidence for receptor-associated proteins with the B cell Fc epsilon R, although evidence for receptor-receptor association was seen. Thus, these data further support the concept that there may be little relationship between the high-affinity mast cell/basophil Fc epsilon R and the low-affinity lymphocyte Fc epsilon R.","['Lee, W T', 'Conrad, D H']","['Lee WT', 'Conrad DH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Succinimides)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', ""81069-02-5 (3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate))"", 'E647932J7Z (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Basophils/immunology', '*Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*analysis', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Succinimides']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jan;134(1):518-25.,"['AI 07247/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 18697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

This antiserum, which inhibited the binding of IgG ligand to the receptors on U937, precipitated from detergent lysates of surface-radioiodinated U937 cells a 72 Kd sialoglycoprotein (p72) identified as the FcR by several previously published criteria. Two other bands seen in autoradiograms of SDS gels were precipitated by this antiserum: a 40 to 43 Kd band that co-purified with p72 and a 170 Kd protein that was not present in the immunogen. Fractionation of the IgG of this antiserum into two subclasses yielded one subclass (IgG1) in which anti-p72 activity was considerably enriched relative to antibody activities against other molecules. This antiserum precipitated p72 not only from U937 but from HL60 cells and from human peripheral blood monocytes as well, indicating common antigens on the p72 molecules from these three cells. However, p72 was not recovered from lysates of surface-iodinated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes or murine macrophage lines. Anti-p72 activity was not completely removed by adsorption with intact U937, suggesting that the antiserum recognizes portions of p72 that are not exteriorly disposed, perhaps noncarbohydrate portions of the molecule.

Maximum suppression was obtained by using the cells from a 12-day MLC and resulted in a 47% inhibition in fresh NK activity as measured by 51Cr release. The inhibition was also apparent in the single-cell cytotoxicity assay, where suppression was manifested at the level of target recognition. This was reflected in the number of target-binding conjugates (TBC), with a decreased number of TBC consistently found when day 12 MLC cells were added to fresh NK cells or MLC-generated NK-like cells. A soluble suppressive factor generated in MLC did not appear to be the mechanism underlying the suppression, because the addition of the supernatant from a 12-day MLC had no effect on the target binding or cytotoxic activity of fresh NK cells. An adherent cell population was not involved, as the removal of G-10 adherent cells from the day 12 MLC did not alter suppression of NK cytotoxicity. The phenotype of the regulatory cell in the day 12 MLC was Fcmu+ and HNK-1+ (Leu-7). These suppressor cells do not bear antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies to T cells (Leu-4), suppressor T cells (Leu-2a), HLA-DR, or the Fc gamma receptor on NK cells (B73.1). The manner in which the HNK-1+, Fcmu+ suppressor cells exerted their inhibitory effect was by binding directly to Fc gamma +, HNK-1+ fresh NK cells. In turn, the Fc gamma +, HNK-1+ NK cells were rendered incapable of binding to target cells. These results suggest that NK cells themselves can function as immunoregulators, controlling their own cytotoxic activity.","[""D'Amore, P J"", 'Golub, S H']","[""D'Amore PJ"", 'Golub SH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jan;134(1):272-9.,"['CA00120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, in ALL the impaired production of EM biomolecules by a transient damaged population of stromal cells, may contribute to the development of a defective microenvironment for hemopoiesis.","['Minguell, J J', 'Fernandez, M', 'Tetas, M', 'Martinez, J', 'Bruzzone, M', 'Rodriguez, J P']","['Minguell JJ', 'Fernandez M', 'Tetas M', 'Martinez J', 'Bruzzone M', 'Rodriguez JP']","['Departamento de Ciencias Basicas, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Santiago.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Chile,Arch Biol Med Exp,Archivos de biologia y medicina experimentales,0321546,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Extracellular Matrix/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Stem Cells/*physiology']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Biol Med Exp. 1988 Jun;21(1):177-82.,,,Microambiente hematopoyetico: elementos celulares y de matriz extracelular.,,,,,,,35,,

LGL were used for 5-hr 51Cr release cytotoxic assay against autologous tumor cells in 20 patients with hematological malignancies (9AML, 4ALL and 7NHL). Mean % cytotoxicity (% CTX) was 6.0%, and the addition of IFN-beta and IL-2 in the medium induced the significant increase of % CTX to 15.0% and 26.1%, respectively. When LGL cultured in medium containing IFN-beta and IL-2 were assessed for cytotoxicity daily for 8 days, the enhancement of % CTX by IFN-beta was declined in a few days, while the enhancement by IL-2 was sustained for more than 8 days. The pretreatment of LGL with anti Leu-11 (CD16) plus complement abrogated the enhancing effect by IFN-beta or IL-2, but not with anti Leu-1 (CD5) plus complement. When this treatment was done on day 8 of IL-2 cocultivation, anti Leu-11 plus complement suppressed cytotoxicity significantly, and anti Leu-1 plus complement also induced mild suppression. The phenotypic characteristics of cells revealed the significant increase of anti Leu-19+ cells in IL-2 stimulated day 8 cells. High density fractions of Percoll gradient contained mostly T lymphocytes and showed no cytotoxicity against autologous tumor cells. However, cocultivation with IL-2 for 8 days induced the cytotoxicity, associated with increased number of anti Leu-19+ cells. These results suggested that IL-2 induced cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells might be related to the increase of anti Leu-19+ cells.","['Ezaki, K']",['Ezaki K'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Fujita-Gakuen Health University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hum Cell. 1988 Mar;1(1):60-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 53 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in maintenance treatment with MTX and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), 25 had received daily folic acid supplements in vitamin tablets containing 75-200 micrograms folic acid for at least the preceding 3-month period. Experimental data have shown that increased folate concentrations intracellularly inhibit MTX metabolism and toxicity. Therefore we found it relevant to investigate the extent to which folic acid supplements affect hematological tolerance to MTX and 6-MP in children during maintenance therapy for ALL. The erythrocyte folate (ery-folate) concentration was significantly higher in children who received extra folic acid than in those who did not (p less than 0.001). The ery-folate in MTX-treated children was only marginally reduced compared with the controls. The erythrocyte methotrexate (ery-MTX) concentration correlated with the weekly dose of MTX but not with any of the investigated hematological parameters. Children who received vitamin tablets containing folic acid had higher thrombocyte counts (p = 0.0056), higher leukocyte counts (p = 0.06), higher neutrophil counts (p = 0.05), and lower erythrocyte mean cell volumes (p = 0.05) than children who received no folic acid. We conclude that folic acid supplements of 75-200 micrograms/day affect the proliferative capacity of the bone marrow. Since none of the children was folate deficient as judged by the ery-folate, we recommend that vitamins given to children in maintenance treatment with MTX and 6-MP for ALL should not contain folic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Schroder, H', 'Clausen, N', 'Ostergard, E', 'Pressler, T']","['Schroder H', 'Clausen N', 'Ostergard E', 'Pressler T']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Contraindications', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Tolerance', '*Folic Acid/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Regression Analysis']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880018609031223 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1986;3(3):241-7. doi: 10.3109/08880018609031223.,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the staging system proposed by Wollner, 4 patients were in stage I, 8 in stage II, 11 in stage III, 8 in stage IVA (less than or equal to 25% blasts in the bone marrow), 15 in stage IVB (greater than 25% blasts in the bone marrow), and 2 in stage IV central nervous system disease. The complete remission rate was 95.8%. The relapse-free survival (RFS) rate of 46 complete responders was 76% after a median observation time of 47+ months. Only 1 of 35 high-risk responder patients developed CNS relapse after prophylactic treatment. Clinical stages were related to the RFS: 100% in stage I-II vs. 69% in stage III-IV. All 8 patients in stage IV were alive without evidence of disease with a median observation time of 59+ months. Fifteen patients in stage IVB who had leukemia-lymphoma syndrome attained 59% RFS with a median observation time of 39+ months. After a median observation time of 38+ months, 29 of 37 patients are off therapy. The results emphasize the value of both the histologic and immunologic features and the stage of disease in predicting the outcome of NHL in children. The LSA2-L2 regimen appears to be a very effective protocol for children with lymphoblastic lymphoma, although it may be less efficacious for patients with large bone marrow involvement.","['Vecchi, V', 'Serra, L', 'Pession, A', 'Rosito, P', 'Paolucci, P', 'Burnelli, R', 'Vivarelli, F', 'Mancini, A F', 'Paolucci, G']","['Vecchi V', 'Serra L', 'Pession A', 'Rosito P', 'Paolucci P', 'Burnelli R', 'Vivarelli F', 'Mancini AF', 'Paolucci G']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'LSA2-L2 protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Syndrome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880018609031221 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1986;3(3):217-28. doi: 10.3109/08880018609031221.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven children (9 with acute lymphatic leukemia) were studied after oral intake of 6-MP doses ranging between 31 and 128 mg/m2 body surface area. The concentrations of 6-MP in plasma were found to vary considerably between patients even after dose normalization to 75 mg/m2. After dose normalization the mean peak plasma concentration was 0.68 microM (range 0.12-1.38) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was 1.37 microM.h (range 0.12-3.04). The mean time taken to reach the peak concentration was 1.3 h (range 1-2), and the half-life of elimination was 1.8 h (range 0.6-2.5). No patient had detectable 6-MP concentrations 12 h after dose intake. The concentrations of 6-MP tended to be higher in erythrocytes than in plasma. The mean peak concentration in erythrocytes was 131% and the AUC 145% of that found in plasma. The mean half-life of elimination from erythrocytes was 2.0 h (range 0.7-2.8). These data indicate that 6-MP can pass through all membranes rapidly to reach intracellular concentrations equal to or even higher than in plasma. In summary, marked interindividual differences in pharmacokinetics were found, probably due to highly variable bioavailability of oral 6-MP. Further studies are needed to determine whether measurements of plasma concentrations of 6-MP can be used to optimize maintenance treatment of childhood leukemia.","['Lonnerholm, G', 'Kreuger, A', 'Lindstrom, B', 'Ludvigsson, J', 'Myrdal, U']","['Lonnerholm G', 'Kreuger A', 'Lindstrom B', 'Ludvigsson J', 'Myrdal U']","['Department of Pediatrics, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Autoimmune Diseases/blood/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Erythrocytes/chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880018609031198 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1986;3(1):27-35. doi: 10.3109/08880018609031198.,,,,,,,,,,,,

It appears to have some interesting implications when considering the infectious risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) children during immunosuppressive chemotherapy and the role of self-defense against minimal residual disease. We have studied natural killer (NK) activity and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity in children during and after treatment for ALL. We observed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 22 children undergoing maintenance chemotherapy displayed significantly depressed NK activity compared with normal controls even when the proportion of NK cells was normal. LAK activity was also considered in 43 ALL children during and after maintenance chemotherapy. We observed that LAK activity was persistently comparable with that of normal controls. It seems definite that NK activity impairment is transient and is completely restored in ALL children a few months after chemotherapy has been successfully completed. The evidence that LAK activity is not impaired in ALL children may have some implications in view of a possible immunomodulatory approach in the presence of refractory disease.,"['Arico, M', 'Lanfranchi, A', 'Molinari, E', 'Maccario, R', 'Nespoli, L', 'Burgio, G R']","['Arico M', 'Lanfranchi A', 'Molinari E', 'Maccario R', 'Nespoli L', 'Burgio GR']","[""Clinica Pediatrica dell'Universita di Pavia, IRCCS Policlinico S.

These results suggest that although the advantage of UKALL VIII over previous trials for poor prognosis patients may be attributed to the more sustained treatment, the improvement for good prognosis patients may be due to more rigorous compliance with protocol.","['Eden, O B', 'Stiller, C A', 'Gerrard, M P']","['Eden OB', 'Stiller CA', 'Gerrard MP']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Patient Compliance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Survival Rate']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880018809031258 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1988;5(2):83-91. doi: 10.3109/08880018809031258.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lumbar puncture was performed to apply methotrexate intrathecally. The moment of lumbar puncture during the infusion was chosen at different times. In 76 of the infusions the concentration of methotrexate in the cerebrospinal fluid and in plasma were determined just prior to the intrathecal administration. From the second to the eighth hour after the initiation of the infusion the concentration of methotrexate in the cerebrospinal fluid and in plasma were determined just prior to the intrathecal administration. From the second to the eighth hour after the initiation of the infusion the concentration of methotrexate in the cerebrospinal fluid appeared to be significantly lower than 16 or 24 h after the initiation of the infusion. Of all samples during the infusions, the plasma concentration varied a tenfold (2-20 X 10(-5) mol/L), but the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of methotrexate varied about a 300-fold (3.5-900 x 10(-8) mol/L). No correlation could be found between the plasma concentration of methotrexate and the cerebrospinal fluid concentration. It is concluded that the methotrexate concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid cannot be predicted by determining the plasma concentration. It takes at least 8 h of infusion before a steady-state concentration of methotrexate is reached in the cerebrospinal fluid. In high-dose methotrexate infusions without intrathecal therapy, the dose of 3 g/m2 is the minimum amount of methotrexate to reach the minimum therapeutic concentration 5 x 10(-7) mol/L) in the cerebrospinal fluid for the treatment of subclinical central nervous system invasion of malignant lymphoid cells. To maintain the minimum therapeutic concentration according to the CxT principle the duration of the infusion should be preferably longer than 24 h.","['Lippens, R J', 'Winograd, B']","['Lippens RJ', 'Winograd B']","['Department of Pediatrics, St. Radboud Academic Hospital University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880018809031261 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1988;5(2):115-24. doi: 10.3109/08880018809031261.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of leukemia-specific monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies reactive with early myeloid cells is reflected in poor correlation of morphologically and cytochemically defined FAB classes with the immunophenotype of the leukemic cells. Possible exceptions are the microgranular variant of FAB-M3, megakaryocytic leukemia (FAB-M7), and early erythroid leukemias (FAB-M6). The use of antibody panels can alleviate the differential diagnosis of acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemias, especially those occurring in infants, and the discrimination of FAB-L2 and FAB-M1. Also, the immunophenotyping of presumptive hybrid leukemias can help to resolve the many questions about these leukemias with a particularly poor prognosis.

To further assess birth weight and associated parameters as a risk factor for childhood leukemia, a case/control study was performed using children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) born in the state of Minnesota and diagnosed since 1969. Data obtained from birth registrations of 219 cases were compared with two control groups matched on date and county of birth (group I) or year of birth (group II). No significant differences were observed in mean birth weights of cases and controls. Statistically significant associations with birth weights greater than 3800 g were identified in cases diagnosed within the first 4 years of life. No associations were found between birth weight and ALL for case children diagnosed after 4 years of age. Factors that might be associated with increased birth weight, including maternal age, birth order, length of gestation, and socioeconomic status as measured by paternal education, were not found to be associated with an increased risk for ALL. The significance of the finding of high birth weight as a risk factor for childhood ALL remains unknown but suggests that pregnancy-related events may be of importance in the etiology of ALL in young children.","['Robison, L L', 'Codd, M', 'Gunderson, P', 'Neglia, J P', 'Smithson, W A', 'King, F L']","['Robison LL', 'Codd M', 'Gunderson P', 'Neglia JP', 'Smithson WA', 'King FL']","['University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['*Birth Weight', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880018709141250 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1987;4(1):63-72. doi: 10.3109/08880018709141250.,"['CA07306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Intravascular survival data and organ distribution of 111In-oxine-labeled leukemic cells in patients with acute leukemia are presented. No evidence of diminished cell viability or significant elution of the label could be found by the in vitro studies. Disappearance curves of 111In-labeled leukemic cell radioactivity in the circulation were a single exponential with average T1/2 value of 15.3 +/- 2.5 hr (mean +/- SEM), which was found to be prolonged when compared with the results of 4 hematologically normal subjects (7.0 +/- 0.8) and those of previously reported DF32P studies. Migratory patterns of the labeled leukemic cells, obtained by a scintillation camera, demonstrated sequestration in the lungs 5 min after the infusion, and thereafter, the uptake into the spleen and liver gradually increased.

The patients were divided into three groups. The first group consisted of 8 patients with active disease, all of whom showed a severe deficiency in IFN alpha production (no detectable titers in 6 and less than 40 units/ml in the other 2) compared to normal controls (range: 320-10,500 units/ml; median: 2,560 units/ml). The second group consisted of 6 patients who achieved a partial remission (PR) after IFN alpha treatment. These 6 patients had normal numbers of mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood, but still had deficient IFN alpha production (titers of IFN alpha were below 10 units/ml in 5 of the 6 patients). The third group consisted of 5 patients in complete remission (3 after IFN alpha treatment and 1 each after splenectomy and infection). This group had IFN alpha production that was not significantly different from that of controls 35 years or older (median: 640 units/ml; range 60-2,560 units/ml for patients vs. 1,513 units/ml; range 320-5,120 units/ml for controls; p greater than 0.05).

Thereby the detection of some glycoproteins (i.e. in primary sensory neurones, in parietal cells or in polymorphonuclear leukocytes), which were invisible by formerly used methods, was also possible. In malignant tissues lectin binding was either altered or the intracellular localization of the lectin binding sites was changed. These differences did not represent tumour specific markers, rather they were found to reflect glycoprotein structures characteristic for an activated functional state or for an earlier grade of differentiation. Some of such glycoproteins were isolated by lectin affinity chromatography and their structures were further analysed by means of biochemical methods. In malignancy a reduced molecular weight and changes in the monosaccharide composition of surface or intracellular glycoproteins were found to be the main differences. Antibodies produced against the lectin affinity isolated glycoproteins allowed the demonstration of structural relationship of glycoproteins with identical or diverse lectin binding pattern. They proved to be also useful for diagnostic purposes, especially for the differential diagnosis of anaplastic tumours.","['Fischer, J', 'Klein, P J', 'Uhlenbruck, G']","['Fischer J', 'Klein PJ', 'Uhlenbruck G']","['Department of Pathology, University Medical School of Pecs, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Acta Histochem Suppl,Acta histochemica.

Recombinant plasmids containing the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat directing transcription of the c-fos coding region and either the authentic c-fos 3' untranslated region (UTR) or the 3' UTR from human c-myc were inefficient at inducing transformation. In contrast, a recombinant that substituted most of the c-fos 3' UTR with the 3' portion of the simian virus 40 T-antigen gene transformed cells well. This difference in transformation efficiency appeared to be due to significantly higher levels of fos mRNA and protein expressed from the transforming recombinant. This, in turn, was due to the much greater stability of its mRNA compared with those from the poorly transforming recombinants containing the c-fos or c-myc 3' UTR. Thus, the 3' UTR of the human c-fos mRNA is responsible for its rapid degradation and limits the steady-state levels of transcript and protein. Cells transformed by the activated human c-fos plasmids contained increased amounts of partially modified c-fos protein (c-Fos). This form of c-Fos turned over much more rapidly than the highly modified form of c-Fos induced by serum stimulation.","['Lee, W M', 'Lin, C', 'Curran, T']","['Lee WM', 'Lin C', 'Curran T']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA, Recombinant/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Plasmids', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.8.12.5521-5527.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1988 Dec;8(12):5521-7. doi: 10.1128/mcb.8.12.5521-5527.1988.,['CA 38783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC365656,,,,,,,,,,

In this communication, we describe a new type of Abelson virus-transformed pre-B-cell line that is arrested at the DJH stage of the recombination process. These cells differ from other pre-B transformants with respect to two properties associated with the immunoglobulin rearrangement process. First, in contrast to cell lines undergoing VH-to-DJH joining in vitro, none of these cell lines contained detectable levels of RNAs transcribed from their unrearranged VH genes. Second, only some of the cell lines recombined exogenous heptamer-nonamer sequences, indicating that many of them have lost at least a portion of the enzymatic machinery that mediates recombination. The correlation between the absence of unrearranged VH RNAs and the inability to rearrange endogenous immunoglobulin gene segments suggests that VH gene transcription is required both to maintain an active recombination system and for the final step in variable-region formation.","['Ramakrishnan, L', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Ramakrishnan L', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Mice', 'Plasmids']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.8.12.5216-5223.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1988 Dec;8(12):5216-23. doi: 10.1128/mcb.8.12.5216-5223.1988.,,PMC365624,,,,,,,,,,

The origin of the D-activity in sera of patients with CML was studied by culturing fractions of peripheral blood cells of patients with D-activity for 3 days and then measuring the ability of the conditioned medium (CM) to induce differentiation of M1 cells. The cells in the myeloblast and promyelocyte fraction differentiated spontaneously into macrophage-like cells during culture for 3 days and the cells in the late granulopoietic cell fraction differentiated into neutrophil-like cells. Higher D-activity was present in CM of cells in the myeloblast and promyelocyte fraction than in CMs of late granulopoietic cell fractions.

We report here the drug-induced impairments of asparagine and glutamine metabolism in correlation to concentrations changes of plasma proteins, synthesized in the liver, in patients with acute lymphatic leukaemia. One hour after asparaginase application, plasma glutamine decreased to 5% (0-39%: median, range) of the initial values, with a subsequent rise to concentrations slightly lower than those prior to therapy. During the 14 days of drug application the fasting plasma concentrations of glutamine fell to a median of 63% of the pre-therapeutic levels, indicating a depletion of the glutamine pools. Two days after the end of asparaginase application, in one patient the glutamine concentrations increased to the pre-therapeutic range. Plasma concentrations of fibrinogen and antithrombin III decreased to 46% and 56%, respectively, of the initial values, with a slight increase 2 days after the end of therapy.

This library was screened with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the 3' end of a partial LIF cDNA clone, and an overlapping cDNA clone isolated. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this latter clone allowed the complete sequence of LIF to be derived. A cDNA molecule encoding the entire mature LIF protein was installed in a yeast expression vector, and LIF produced up to about 100 ng/ml in the growth medium. The LIF produced by yeast cells has the same biologic properties as native LIF and competes with native 125I-LIF for binding to specific cellular receptors. Two forms of native LIF, distinguishable by their chromatographic behavior on DEAE-Sepharose, were converted by neuraminidase treatment to a form with similar chromatographic behavior, suggesting that the major difference between these two species is the content of sialic acid on the carbohydrate portion. Moreover, yeast-derived recombinant LIF appears to display a different pattern of glycosylation to both forms of native LIF. From in vitro experiments, we conclude that the nature of the glycosylation is not crucial to biologic activity.","['Gough, N M', 'Hilton, D J', 'Gearing, D P', 'Willson, T A', 'King, J A', 'Nicola, N A', 'Metcalf, D']","['Gough NM', 'Hilton DJ', 'Gearing DP', 'Willson TA', 'King JA', 'Nicola NA', 'Metcalf D']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Post Office Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Krebs 2/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Glycosylation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Lymphokines', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1988;14(2-3):431-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the biological properties of bcr-abl and compare them with those of the Abelson virus (AMuLV) transforming gene (gag-v-abl), we have used either a synthetic bcr-v-abl gene that mimics the translocation product or, in some experiments, a bcr-c-abl cDNA. A new retroviral vector was used to introduce the genes into the factor-dependent myeloid line FDC-P1. Both bcr-abl and v-abl efficiently rendered the myeloid cells factor independent and tumorigenic. Their fully autonomous growth may be due to the myeloid growth factor interleukin-3 (IL-3) made in small amounts by the infected cells.

To examine if this loss in susceptibility was related to induced differentiation events, the presence of various antigens was determined after induction. There was a coincident expression of class I HLA common antigen, although it is not clear if this is a direct causal relationship. The level of the constitutively expressed myelomonocytic antigen, reactive with anti-Leu-M1, was not affected by IFN-gamma induction and three normally nonexpressed monocytic antigens, defined by monoclonal antibodies, remained unexpressed. IFN-gamma did induce an enhanced expression of IL-2 receptors on K-562 cells after 2 days of treatment but, thereafter, the expression appeared to be suppressed. Electron microscopy of IFN-gamma-treated cells revealed the development of increased surface blebbing and electron-dense cytoplasmic inclusions. These ultramicroscopic changes could not be correlated with definitive differentiation events. We suggest that IFN-gamma treatment of K-562 cells induces class I HLA expression and morphological changes that may be important to differentiation events that render the cells less susceptible ot NK-mediated cytolysis.","['Ichiki, A T', 'Sugantharaj, D G', 'Hudson, C S', 'Gerard, D A', 'Barnhill, M A', 'Bamberger, E G', 'Wust, C J', 'Fuhr, J E', 'Lozzio, C B']","['Ichiki AT', 'Sugantharaj DG', 'Hudson CS', 'Gerard DA', 'Barnhill MA', 'Bamberger EG', 'Wust CJ', 'Fuhr JE', 'Lozzio CB']","['Department of Medical Biology, University of Tennessee Medical Center, Knoxville.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul,Natural immunity and cell growth regulation,8407979,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology/pathology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul. 1988;7(5-6):297-304.,['CA31945/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Using a highly sensitive colorimetric assay, antibodies were selected as myeloid-associated based on their binding to RC-2A cells, but not to cells of the autologous EBV-transformed* B cell line Cess-B. Antibodies to five distinct cell surface antigens were extensively characterized for their binding to normal and leukemic hemopoietic cells, and to tissue sections. Three antibodies may identify antigens previously described in the International Leucocyte Typing Workshops (CD14, CD11b and CD31). The other two antigens appear to be expressed at low levels on the surface of RC-2A cells, and do not correspond to existing CD groups. One of these is also present on monocytes and neutrophils. Both were present on myeloid progenitor cells, as judged by depletion experiments with antibody and complement, although neither bound appreciably to myeloid leukemic cells as judged by indirect immunofluorescence. The other three antibodies bound preferentially to leukemic specimens displaying monocytic differentiation. Four of the antibodies could be demonstrated to bind to cells in frozen sections of tonsil and small intestine and all gave distinct patterns of reactivity. In particular, these antibodies differed markedly in their binding to endothelium, follicular dendritic cells and various types of tissue macrophages.

All rearrangement events were accompanied by deletions of varying sizes such that none of the rearrangements resulted in the production of functional immunoglobulins. The breakpoints of the rearrangement events did not correspond to the utilization of a novel heptamer-nonamer recombination signal but probably arose by nonspecific deletion from distal JH and D heptamer-nonamer signals in the process of recombination. scid pre-B cell lines were infected with a recombinant retrovirus (DGR) containing Ig joining signals.

The oncogenes derived from c-abl, e.g., gag/v-abl in Abelson murine leukemia virus or bcr/abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia, lack N-terminal coding sequences of the normal c-abl gene. In mouse and human cells, two sets of N-terminal amino acids encoded by 5'-variable exons are found in c-abl proteins. To assess the importance of N-terminal deletion in the activation of c-abl tyrosine kinase, a full length or an N-terminal deleted c-abl protein was expressed in bacteria and in monkey COS cells. Measurements of the autokinase activity of these two c-abl proteins showed that deletion of the N-terminal amino acids led to a three to five fold increase of the c-abl tyrosine kinase activity.

Although most B CLL cells express surface IgM, anti-mu antibodies are able to trigger only some of them to proliferate and/or respond to B cell growth factor (BCGF) or interleukin 2 (IL2), as normal B cells. In this report we extend these observations using three different monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to human mu chain (one mitogenic in soluble form for normal B cells, the two others mitogenic only when coupled on Sepharose 4B beads). Cells from only 3 out of 11 B CLL patients proliferated in the presence of either mitogenic anti-mu. When the early events following surface Ig cross-linking, such as calcium mobilization (by flow cytometry on indo-1-labeled cells), were studied all three mAb in soluble form were able to induce a similar increase in the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i); analogous to [Ca2+]i rise after the mitogenic F(ab')2 anti-mu stimulation. This response was seen only in 8 out of the 12 CLL B cells studied. All B CLL cells, however, proliferate in response to a combination of phorbol ester 12,13-dibutyrate (PBt2) and ionomycin. Therefore, three patterns of response to sIg cross-linking by anti-mu could be distinguished: cells from 4 out of 12 cases proliferate and mobilize Ca2+ upon anti-mu triggering (behaving like resting B lymphocytes); in 4 other cases anti-mu lead to Ca2+ mobilization without cell proliferation; in the last 4 cases neither Ca2+ mobilization, IP3 generation (in the one case studied) nor cell proliferation are observed although these cells do proliferate directly in response to growth factors. Moreover, anti-mu stimulation in this group leads to increased proliferation in response to BCGF and IL2 suggesting an anti-Ig signaling independent of inositol phosphate metabolism. These results are interpreted in terms of differential anti-mu signaling on B cells at different stages of activation.","['Hivroz, C', 'Grillot-Courvalin, C', 'Labaume, S', 'Miglierina, R', 'Brouet, J C']","['Hivroz C', 'Grillot-Courvalin C', 'Labaume S', 'Miglierina R', 'Brouet JC']","['Laboratory of Immunochemistry and Immunopathology, INSERM U 108, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Ethers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Calcium/*physiology', '*Cell Division', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Ethers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/physiology', 'Inositol Phosphates/physiology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Ionomycin', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830181124 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1988 Nov;18(11):1811-7. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830181124.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GH response to GHRH was not correlated with the GH response to arginine-insulin tolerance test (AITT). A decreased response to GHRH with values between 12.5 and 19.4 ng/ml was observed in four cases with normal growth rates and normal GH responses to AITT. These results suggest that an impaired GH response to GHRH is a frequent finding after cranial irradiation for ALL or LS and may be the only sign of GH secretory dysfunction.

The demonstration that the differentiation factor LIF will also serve as a growth factor for at least one myeloid leukaemic cell line provides further evidence that the distinction between growth-promoting and differentiation-inducing activities are largely determined by the target cell type.","['Moreau, J F', 'Donaldson, D D', 'Bennett, F', 'Witek-Giannotti, J', 'Clark, S C', 'Wong, G G']","['Moreau JF', 'Donaldson DD', 'Bennett F', 'Witek-Giannotti J', 'Clark SC', 'Wong GG']","['Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02140.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Growth Inhibitors/*analysis', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Interleukins/*analysis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Lymphokines', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/analysis']",1988/12/15 00:00,1988/12/15 00:01,['1988/12/15 00:00'],"['1988/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/336690a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1988 Dec 15;336(6200):690-2. doi: 10.1038/336690a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

They provide both a cellular vector for the generation of transgenic animals and a useful system for the identification of polypeptide factors controlling differentiation processes in early development. In particular, medium conditioned by Buffalo rat liver cells contains a polypeptide factor, ES cell differentiation inhibitory activity (DIA), which specifically suppresses the spontaneous differentiation of ES cells in vitro, thereby permitting their growth as homogeneous stem cell populations in the absence of heterologous feeder cells. ES cell pluripotentiality, including the ability to give rise to functional gametes, is preserved after prolonged culture in Buffalo rat liver media as a source of DIA. Here, we report that purified DIA is related in structure and function to the recently identified hematopoietic regulatory factors human interleukin for DA cells and leukaemia inhibitory factor. DIA and human interleukin DA/leukaemia inhibitory factor have thus been identified as related multifunctional regulatory factors with distinct biological activities in both early embryonic and hematopoietic stem cell systems.","['Smith, A G', 'Heath, J K', 'Donaldson, D D', 'Wong, G G', 'Moreau, J', 'Stahl, M', 'Rogers, D']","['Smith AG', 'Heath JK', 'Donaldson DD', 'Wong GG', 'Moreau J', 'Stahl M', 'Rogers D']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Lymphokines', 'Peptides/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/anatomy & histology/*drug effects']",1988/12/15 00:00,1988/12/15 00:01,['1988/12/15 00:00'],"['1988/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/336688a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1988 Dec 15;336(6200):688-90. doi: 10.1038/336688a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Requirement for an adequate level of already acquired host concomitant immunity.",2031-43,"Intraperitoneal injection of human rIL-1 in a dose of 0.5 microgram daily for 5 d, or 1 microgram daily for 3 d, was capable of causing complete regression of immunogenic SA1 sarcoma growing subcutaneously in syngeneic or semisyngeneic mice. Higher doses of IL-1 were not more therapeutic against the SA1 sarcoma, but needed to be given to cause complete regression of the immunogenic L5178Y lymphoma. On the other hand, the P815 mastocytoma was much less responsive to IL-1 therapy, in that it failed to undergo complete regression in response to doses of IL-1 capable of causing regression of the L5178Y lymphoma. IL-1 caused regression of the SA1 sarcoma when given on days 6-8 of tumor growth, but not when given on days 1-3. This refractoriness of a small tumor to IL-1 therapy suggests that the antitumor action of IL-1 is based on an underlying host-immune response that is not generated until after day 3 of tumor growth. Direct evidence for the participation of host immunity in IL-1-induced tumor regression was supplied by results showing that IL-1 was not therapeutic against the SA1 sarcoma growing in T cell-deficient (TXB) mice, unless these mice were first infused with Ly-2+ and L3T4+ T cells from donor mice bearing an established SA1 sarcoma. In contrast, normal T cells, or T cells from donor mice bearing a YAC-1 lymphoma, failed to provide TXB recipients with the ability to cause regression of their SA-1 sarcoma in response to IL-1 treatment. The results are in keeping with the interpretation that exogenous IL-1, by augmenting the production of tumor-sensitized T cells, converts a subtherapeutic level of host immunity to a therapeutic level. The results suggest, in addition, that IL-1 only stimulates the replication of T cells that are already engaged in the antitumor immune response.","['North, R J', 'Neubauer, R H', 'Huang, J J', 'Newton, R C', 'Loveless, S E']","['North RJ', 'Neubauer RH', 'Huang JJ', 'Newton RC', 'Loveless SE']","['Trudeau Institute, Inc., Saranac Lake, New York 12983.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,['0 (Interleukin-1)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/immunology', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/therapy', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.168.6.2031 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1988 Dec 1;168(6):2031-43. doi: 10.1084/jem.168.6.2031.,"['CA-16642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2189148,,,,,,,,,,

Major sialoglycoproteins carrying polylactosaminoglycan.",18911-9,"Two major lysosomal membrane glycoproteins with apparent Mr approximately 120,000 were purified from chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. These glycoproteins are major sialoglycoproteins containing polylactosaminoglycan and represent approximately 0.1-0.2% of total cell proteins. A monoclonal antibody specific to one of the glycoproteins and polyclonal antibodies specific to the other glycoprotein were obtained. Immunoelectron microscopic examination of HeLa cells revealed that these two glycoproteins mainly reside in lysosomes and multivesicular bodies. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that a number of different cell lines express these glycoproteins. However, the apparent molecular weights differed between cell lines; this probably represents differences in the amount of polylactosaminoglycan expressed by each cell line. As shown in the following paper (Fukuda, M., Viitala, J., Matteson, J., and Carlsson, S. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18920-18928) one of the glycoproteins is very homologous to that of a mouse counterpart, m-lamp-1. The human form of this glycoprotein is therefore named human lamp-1 (h-lamp-1), while the other glycoprotein, to which the monoclonal antibody was made, is called human lamp-2 (h-lamp-2). Pulse-chase labeling experiments detected that h-lamp-1 and h-lamp-2 are produced first as precursor forms of 87.5 and 84 kDa, and treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo-H) or endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F (endo-F) reduced their molecular masses to 39.5 and 41.5 kDa, respectively. It was estimated that h-lamp-1 has 18 N-linked saccharides and h-lamp-2 16, based on the results of partial digestions with endo-F. These results indicate that the two lysosomal membrane glycoproteins are extensively modified by N-glycans, and some of these were found to have polylactosaminyl repeats and sialic acid. Human lamp-1 and lamp-2, therefore, serve as good models for understanding polylactosaminoglycan formation and the biosynthesis and processing of polylactosaminoglycan-containing glycoprotein.","['Carlsson, S R', 'Roth, J', 'Piller, F', 'Fukuda, M']","['Carlsson SR', 'Roth J', 'Piller F', 'Fukuda M']","['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Amino Sugars)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (lactosaminoglycan)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.96 (Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'Amino Sugars/*analysis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, CD', 'Carbohydrates/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Lysosomes/*analysis', 'Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*isolation & purification', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides/*analysis', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*analysis']",1988/12/15 00:00,1988/12/15 00:01,['1988/12/15 00:00'],"['1988/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)37369-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Dec 15;263(35):18911-9.,['CA28896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition and mode of action on normal and chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells.,65-71,"Recombinant technology-produced tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF-alpha) inhibits clonogenic growth of normal granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFC) when it is continuously present in the culture medium. In our studies, day 7 and day 14 GM-CFC were inhibited and showed similar response. A decrease in the number of large colonies accounted for most of the inhibition, whereas growth of small clusters was inhibited to a lesser extent. Comparable inhibition was observed when bone marrow cells were cloned at low (2.5 x 10(4)/ml) or high (10 x 10(4)/ml) cell densities. A similar degree of inhibition by rTNF-alpha was found when conditioned medium from the human placenta or a bladder carcinoma cell line was used as the source of the colony-stimulating factors (CSF). The dose-response curve of GM-CFC to rTNF-alpha was sigmoidal, the maximum inhibition (90%) occurring at approximately 100 ng/ml of rTNF-alpha. Short-term treatment of bone marrow in suspension culture for 2 hr did not affect the subsequent colony formation, suggesting that TNF had an antiproliferative rather than a direct toxic effect on normal GM-CFC. GM-CFC derived from previously untreated patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) showed an in vitro dose response to rTNF-alpha similar to that of normal GM-CFC. Inhibition of colony formation by CML-derived GM-CFC was more pronounced than GM-CFC from normal marrows, especially at low concentrations of rTNF-alpha. An increase in the concentration of rTNF-alpha above 250 ng/ml had no further effect on colony formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Beran, M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Andersson, B', 'McCredie, K B', 'Gutterman, J U']","['Beran M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Andersson B', 'McCredie KB', 'Gutterman JU']","['University of Texas M.

(1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 2017]. The enzyme activation was accompanied by a time-dependent association of 5-lipoxygenase to the particular fraction. When cells were lysed in the presence of 0.05-10 microM CaCl2, the soluble 5-lipoxygenase became associated with the particulate fraction. This was demonstrated by a decrease in immunoreactivities and enzymatic activities in the soluble fraction and a parallel increase in particulate-associated immunoreactivities. The particulate-bound enzyme was not active. Ca2+ induced the membrane association of 5-lipoxygenase when added into the incubation mixtures containing the membrane fraction with either the cytosolic fraction or the purified enzyme. 5-Lipoxygenase also bound to the microsomal-enriched fraction in the presence of Ca2+. Maximal membrane binding was obtained after a 1-min incubation at 4 degrees C. When a fixed amount of isolated membranes (0.2 mg of protein) and increasing cytosolic protein (0.5-4 mg) were used, a linear increase in enzyme binding was observed. The binding became saturated at 3 mg of cytosolic protein/mg of membrane protein. 5-Lipoxygenase binding to the membrane fraction was unaffected by pretreatment of the membranes with trypsin but was inhibited by treating with phospholipase A2, suggesting that phospholipids are involved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Wong, A', 'Hwang, S M', 'Cook, M N', 'Hogaboom, G K', 'Crooke, S T']","['Wong A', 'Hwang SM', 'Cook MN', 'Hogaboom GK', 'Crooke ST']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Smith Kline & French Laboratories, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Arachidonate Lipoxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Arachidonate Lipoxygenases/*metabolism', 'Basophils/enzymology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', 'Membranes/enzymology', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Solubility', 'Submitochondrial Particles/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1988/09/06 00:00,1988/09/06 00:01,['1988/09/06 00:00'],"['1988/09/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/06 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00418a018 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1988 Sep 6;27(18):6763-9. doi: 10.1021/bi00418a018.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monoclonal B cells from these patients exhibited an opposite pattern of responsiveness upon in vitro culture with IL2 in the absence of other stimuli. In the first patient, IL2 alone was able to induce DNA synthesis and no Ig production. In the second patient, although no DNA synthesis was detected, B lymphocytes synthesized IgM upon stimulation with IL2 alone. Analysis of mRNA levels was performed on the cells of this latter patient after culture without or with IL2. In the presence of IL2 we observed a strong enhancement of C mu gene expression associated with an increase of the ratio between the secreted form and the membrane-bound form of mu mRNA. In contrast IL2 induced only a marginal enhancement of J chain mRNA. Thus, terminal B cell differentiation of selected monoclonal B cells can be obtained in the absence of DNA synthesis and IL2 alone can mediate this process. Moreover, IL2 can act at selective steps of the molecular events associated with IgM production. These results document the multiple effects of a given IL on the events leading to antibody production and strongly suggest that they can be conditioned by the maturation stage of a given responding cell.","['Emilie, D', 'Karray, S', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Debre, P', 'Galanaud, P']","['Emilie D', 'Karray S', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Debre P', 'Galanaud P']","[""Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*genetics', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830181002 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1988 Oct;18(10):1479-83. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830181002.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The succinyl-leucyl-leucyl-valyl-tyrosine-methylcoumarinamide hydrolytic activity in a K562 lysate at pH 9 rose more than 10-fold with the addition of 1 mM ATP. The effect of ATP on the protease activity was dose-dependent and inhibited by the addition of ADP. This activity was not inhibited by EDTA, L-3-carboxy-trans-2,3-epoxypropionyl-leucylamide-(4-guanidin o)butane or leupeptin, but was strongly inhibited by chymostatin and diisopropylfluorophosphate. The protease activity was eluted just after the void volume from a G3000SW HPLC column. The above results suggest that this protease is identical to the high-molecular-mass protease, ingensin, previously reported by us. The ATP-dependent increase in the protease activity was due to prevention of the inactivation of the protease by ATP, and not to activation of the protease itself in the reaction mixture at 37 degrees C. The depressed succinyl-leucyl-leucyl-valyl-tyrosine-methylcoumarinamide hydrolytic activity in the ATP-depleted lysate was restored to the same level by the detergent, SDS.

Of the 3115 who died, 865 (28%) died of cancer. Mortality was 23% lower than the national average for all causes of death and 18% lower for cancer. These low rates were consistent with the findings in other workforces in the nuclear industry and reflect, at least in part, the selection of healthy people to work in the industry and the disproportionate recruitment of people from the higher social classes. At some time during their employment 9389 (42%) of the workers were monitored for exposure to radiation, the average cumulative whole body exposure to external radiation being 7.8 mSv. Their mortality was generally similar to that of other employees, even when exposures were lagged by 10 years. The rate ratio after a 10 year lag in workers with a radiation record compared with other workers was 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.10) for all causes of death and 1.06 (0.89 to 1.27) for all malignant neoplasms. The only significant differences were for prostatic cancer (rate ratio 2.23; 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 4.40) and for cancers of ill defined and secondary sites (rate ratio 2.37; 1.23 to 4.56). Cancers of lymphatic and haemopoietic tissues were notable for their low occurrence in the study population, with only four deaths from leukaemia and two from multiple myeloma in workers with a radiation record, 9.16 and 3.55 deaths respectively being expected on the basis of national rates. Among workers who had a radiation record 3742 (40%) were also monitored for possible internal exposure to plutonium, 3044 (32%) to uranium, 1562 (17%) to tritium, 638 (7%) to polonium, and 281 (3%) to actinium. In these workers mortality from malignant neoplasms as a whole was not increased, but after a 10 year lag death rates from prostatic and renal cancers were generally more than twice the national average, these excesses arising in a small group of workers monitored for exposure to multiple radionuclides. Though mortality from lung cancer in workers monitored for exposure to plutonium was below the national average, it was some two thirds higher than in other radiation workers, the excess being of borderline statistical significance. Mortality from malignant neoplasms as a whole showed a weak and non-significant increasing trend with increasing level of cumulative whole body exposure to external radiation. When the exposures were lagged by 10 years the trend became stronger and significant, the estimated increase in relative risk per 10 mSv being 7.6% (95% confidence interval 0.4% to 15.3%). This trend was confined almost entirely to workers who were also monitored for exposure to radionuclides (p<0.001), the main contributions coming from lung cancer and prostatic cancer. Exposures of the lung and prostate from internal sources of radiation were not quantified, except for the contribution from tritium. It was therefore not possible to assess the extent to which the associations were due to internally deposited radionuclides rather than external exposure. The finding for prostatic cancer taken in conjunction with the results of other studies suggest a specific occupational hazard in a small group of workers in the nuclear industry who had comparatively high exposures to external radiation and who were also monitored for internal exposure to multiple radionuclides. Research is needed to discover whether any of the radionuclides and other substances concerned are concentrated in the prostate. The occurrence of lung cancer in this workforce requires further investigation taking into account smoking habits and tissue doses from inhaled radionuclides.","['Beral, V', 'Fraser, P', 'Carpenter, L', 'Booth, M', 'Brown, A', 'Rose, G']","['Beral V', 'Fraser P', 'Carpenter L', 'Booth M', 'Brown A', 'Rose G']","['Department of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,['0 (Radioactive Pollutants)'],IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'England', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radioactive Pollutants/adverse effects', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/mortality', 'Risk']",1988/09/24 00:00,1988/09/24 00:01,['1988/09/24 00:00'],"['1988/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.297.6651.757 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1988 Sep 24;297(6651):757-70. doi: 10.1136/bmj.297.6651.757.,,PMC1834407,,,,,,,,,,

The LK activity was not inhibited by an anti-interferon gamma (IFN gamma) antibody. IFN gamma and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) had no activity but acted in synergy to induce procoagulant expression; interferon alpha plus PMA were without effect. In contrast to the LK-induced response, procoagulant induced by IFN gamma/PMA was not detected for up to 8 h and steadily rose over 24-48 h culture and was dependent on new protein and RNA synthesis.

This study shows that RC2a cells are responsive to factors produced as the result of an activated cell-mediated immune response which may therefore contribute to the coagulopathies common to this form of malignancy.","['Geczy, C L', 'Jones, A']","['Geczy CL', 'Jones A']","['Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, N.S.W., Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (leukocyte procoagulant activity)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blood Coagulation Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Thromboplastin/metabolism']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02466.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Oct;70(2):211-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02466.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal human B-cell proliferation is controlled by different T-cell-derived lymphokines, including interleukin 2 (IL2) and gamma interferon (gamma-IFN), that account for the majority of the B-cell growth factor (BCGF) activity produced by mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We have previously shown an increased and dysregulated secretion of IL2 in peripheral blood from patients with B-CLL. BCGF, IL2, and gamma-IFN productions by phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated PBMCs were investigated in 13 patients with active untreated B-CLL and 11 healthy donors. B-CLL PBMCs produced a significant amount of BCGF (6 U/ml) despite the low percentage of T cells (10%) associated with this disease as compared with that found in healthy donors (61%). BCGF production in normal controls and B-CLL patients was tripled after irradiation of PBMCs or addition of indomethacin. gamma-IFN secretion in B-CLL patients was decreased when compared with normal controls. Therefore, when gamma-IFN was calculated per fixed number of T cells, production was significantly higher in B-CLL patients than in normal controls, showing a dilution of the productive cells. This study suggests that T cells from B-CLL patients are functional in terms of BCGF production despite their decreased percentage and abnormalities in surface markers.","['Rossi, J F', 'Commes, T', 'Grenier, J', 'Jourdan, M', 'Chichehian, B', 'Klein, B']","['Rossi JF', 'Commes T', 'Grenier J', 'Jourdan M', 'Chichehian B', 'Klein B']","['Institut du Cancer, Montpelier, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*metabolism']",1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830290402 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1988 Dec;29(4):183-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830290402.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow cells from three patients were also cultured and the blood and marrow CSIg results were compared. The CSIg of 1-day cultures was employed as a measure of shed surface membrane Ig (SmIg) for the 7- and 14-day cultures. Adjusting for shed SmIg, it was found that in resting unstimulated conditions, monotypic free light (L) chain was virtually the only identifiable secreted Ig product in 12 of 14 blood MNC cultures and in three of three marrow cell cultures. In pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-stimulated cultures, monotypic free L chain also dominated, except for significant polyclonal Ig secretion found in three cultures from residual normal blood MNCs. The secretion by CLL-B cells of significant amounts of free L chain with a virtual absence of whole Ig raises important questions about the presence and function of phenotypically equivalent normal B cells in blood and bone marrow, and also the immunological role of secreted free L chain. Noting recent evidence that PWM-stimulated normal blood MNCs secrete significant amounts of polyclonal free L chain, the argument is advanced that normal blood and bone marrow contain B cells of CLL-B phenotype and that secreted free L-chain-bearing clonal idiotypic markers interact with autologous cells of the idiotypic regulatory network and possess a key role in the regulation of clonal growth and Ig synthesis.","['Hopper, J E', ""O'Brien, J"", 'Papagiannes, E']","['Hopper JE', ""O'Brien J"", 'Papagiannes E']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago 60612.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell-Free System', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Middle Aged', 'Pokeweed Mitogens', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830290302 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1988 Nov;29(3):125-33. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830290302.,,,,,,,,,,,,

MCI-186 at 3 X 10(-5) M enhanced prostacyclin production in the intact endothelial cells without affecting phospholipase A2. When endothelial cell homogenates were used as an enzyme source, it was found that MCI-186 stimulated the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostacyclin like phenol, perhaps by trapping OH radicals produced in the process of the conversion of PGG2 to PGH2. On the other hand, MCI-186 was found to inhibit lipoxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid in cell free homogenates of rat basophilic leukemia cells.

Further, all retroviral nucleocapsid proteins contain either one or two copies of the sequence Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa4-His-Xaa4-Cys. The conservation of this sequence suggested that it is important for virus replication, and its resemblance to the ""zinc-finger"" sequences found in eukaryotic transcription factors raised the possibility that it recognizes specific sequences in viral RNA during retrovirus assembly. We used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to generate a series of mutations in the nucleocapsid protein-coding region of Moloney murine leukemia virus. These mutations changed single amino acids, including each of the cysteines, to serine. The mutant viral genomes direct the synthesis of virus particles; these particles lack detectable viral RNA but do contain significant levels of cellular RNAs. Thus it appears that the mutations have destroyed the ability of the viral proteins to specifically package viral RNA during virus assembly. We propose that the conserved sequence in retroviral nucleocapsid proteins functions in RNA sequence recognition and suggest that it is evolutionarily related to the zinc fingers that recognize specific sequences in double-stranded DNA.","['Gorelick, R J', 'Henderson, L E', 'Hanser, J P', 'Rein, A']","['Gorelick RJ', 'Henderson LE', 'Hanser JP', 'Rein A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research Facility 21701.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Genes, Viral', 'Immunoblotting', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', 'Transfection']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.85.22.8420 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Nov;85(22):8420-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.22.8420.,['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC282469,,,,,,,,,,

This insertion mutation resulted from the integration of an ecotropic murine leukemia virus into noncoding sequences of the dilute gene. Therefore, dsu may act like other allele-specific recessive suppressors identified in Drosophila melanogaster and yeast that suppress mutations induced by retrotransposon insertions. To investigate this possibility, we have examined whether dsu could suppress a spontaneously arising allele of d, dl20J, which is shown here to result from a 3.5-kilobase deletion.

Following exposure to PMF immediately after administration of methotrexate or mitomycin C, antitumor activity in both cells was increased. From these results it appears that the incorporation of antitumor agents into the cells increases by eddy current stimulation induced by PMF, and that the cell cycle shifts from the non-proliferative to proliferative phase, resulting in increased antitumor activity.","['Omote, Y']",['Omote Y'],"['First Department of Surgery, Asahikawa Medical College, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Geka Gakkai zasshi,0405405,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Electromagnetic Phenomena/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', '*Magnetic Field Therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 1988 Aug;89(8):1155-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of class II loci of the H-2 as immune response genes.,1587-605,"T cells primed specifically for the envelope glycoprotein of Friend murine leukemia helper virus (F-MuLV) were prepared by immunizing mice with a recombinant vaccinia virus that expressed the entire env gene of F-MuLV. Significant proliferative responses of F-MuLV envelope-specific, H-2a/b T cells were observed when the T cells were stimulated with antigen-pulsed peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) having the b allele at the K, A beta, A alpha, and E beta loci of the H-2. On the other hand, PEC having only the kappa allele at these loci did not induce the envelope-specific T cell proliferation, even when the PEC had the b allele at the E alpha, S, or D loci. F-MuLV envelope-specific proliferation of H-2a/b T cells under the stimulation of antigen-pulsed, H-2a/b PEC was specifically blocked with anti-I-Ab and anti-I-Ek mAbs but not with anti-Kb, anti-Kk, or anti-I-Ak mAbs. Moreover, (B10.MBR x A/WySn)F1 mice that have the b allele only at the K locus but not in I-A subregion were nonresponders to the envelope glycoprotein, and the bm12 mutation at the A beta locus completely abolished the T cell responsiveness to this antigen. These results indicate that proliferative T cells recognize a limited number of epitopes on F-MuLV envelope protein in the context of I-Ab, hybrid I-Ak/b, and/or hybrid I-Ek/b class II MHC molecules but fail to recognize the same envelope protein in the context of I-Ak or I-Ek molecules. This influence of the H-2I region on T cell recognition of the envelope glycoprotein appeared to control in vivo induction of protective immunity against Friend virus complex after immunization with the vaccinia-F-MuLV env vaccine. Thus, these results provide, for the first time, direct evidence for Ir gene-controlled responder/nonresponder phenotypes influencing the immune response to a pathogenic virus of mice.","['Miyazawa, M', 'Nishio, J', 'Chesebro, B']","['Miyazawa M', 'Nishio J', 'Chesebro B']","['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', '*Genes, MHC Class II', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology']",1988/11/01 00:00,1988/11/01 00:01,['1988/11/01 00:00'],"['1988/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.168.5.1587 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1988 Nov 1;168(5):1587-605. doi: 10.1084/jem.168.5.1587.,,PMC2189107,,,,,,,,,,

A total of three thioether-linked F(ab' gamma)2 heterodimers were prepared, each having dual specificities for saporin and the guinea pig lymphoblastic leukemia, L2C. In all three cases specificity for the L2C cells was provided by a high affinity mouse anti-idiotype (anti-Id) mAb, whereas the antisaporin activity came from either one of two mouse mAb or an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal Ab. In vitro studies, measuring protein synthesis, showed that all three derivatives were extremely efficient at delivering saporin to L2C cells, to the extent that addition of the rabbit Fab' gamma-containing bispecific Ab to cell culture at 1 microgram/ml increased the toxicity of saporin (50% inhibiting concentration) by close to 90,000-fold. Similarly, in leukemic guinea pigs, a small dose of saporin (10 micrograms) which by itself showed no therapeutic effect, was able to completely eradicate Id-positive tumor when given in combination with an excess of bispecific Ab. Although tumors did eventually emerge in most of these animals, immunofluorescence analysis showed that in almost all instances the escaping cells were Id- variants of the L2C. Experiments to define the optimal treatment regimen in this model showed that, although the administration of saporin and bispecific Ab at separate sites could be therapeutically effective, mixing the Ab and saporin to form immune complexes before injection did generally enhance their performance. A molar surplus of bispecific Ab in these mixtures both extended the metabolic survival of the saporin and enhanced the therapeutic performance, with molar ratios above 3:1 generally being required for optimum treatment when using saporin at 10 micrograms. Derivatives containing polyclonal antisaporin were more efficient than those containing mAb, yielding optimum therapeutic results with a molar ratio of 1.5:1 when combined with 10 micrograms saporin. These findings have shown that bispecific F(ab' gamma)2 Ab, as well as being straightforward to prepare, can also function as an extremely efficient vector for delivering cytotoxic agents such as ribosome-inactivating protein to unwanted cells in vivo.","['Glennie, M J', 'Brennand, D M', 'Bryden, F', 'McBride, H M', 'Stirpe, F', 'Worth, A T', 'Stevenson, G T']","['Glennie MJ', 'Brennand DM', 'Bryden F', 'McBride HM', 'Stirpe F', 'Worth AT', 'Stevenson GT']","['Lymphoma Research Unit, General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Guinea Pigs', '*Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments', '*Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', '*Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Proteins/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Saporins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/11/15 00:00,1988/11/15 00:01,['1988/11/15 00:00'],"['1988/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Nov 15;141(10):3662-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice sodium thiosulfate proved to be far more effective in preventing lethal toxicity and nephrotoxicity as measured by blood urea nitrogen increase. Fosfomycin and mesna were almost without influence on cisplatin treatment of L-1210 leukemia whereas their inhibition of the antitumor effect against S-180 ascites sarcoma (increase of in cisplatin dose to cure 50% of animals from 2.0 mg/kg to 3.5/4.7 mg/kg cisplatin) was similar to thiosulfate, which showed a strong inhibiting effect in the treatment of both tumors. In rats fosfomycin distinctively reduced the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin against Yoshida ascites sarcoma.

Due to the weak detoxifying efficacy of fosfomycin and mesna they cannot be used instead of sodium thiosulfate for renal protection against cisplatin toxicity in local i.p. treatment modalities.","['Wagner, T', 'Kreft, B', 'Bohlmann, G', 'Schwieder, G']","['Wagner T', 'Kreft B', 'Bohlmann G', 'Schwieder G']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin, Medizinischen Universitat, Lubeck, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Thiosulfates)', '2N81MY12TE (Fosfomycin)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', 'HX1032V43M (sodium thiosulfate)', 'NR7O1405Q9 (Mesna)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Fosfomycin/*pharmacology', 'Kidney/drug effects', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Mercaptoethanol/*analogs & derivatives', 'Mesna/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Thiosulfates/*pharmacology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00391499 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1988;114(5):497-501. doi: 10.1007/BF00391499.,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPA induced the cells to adhere to the culture flask or to clump in dense clusters; single cells became enlarged, often with cytoplasmic elongations. Cells treated with TPA plus A23187 acquired a plasmacytoid morphology and formed regular aggregates in culture. Only TPA alone induced the expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) as documented by isoelectric focusing on horizontal thin-layer gels. The TRAP isoenzyme was first detected after 24 h of TPA treatment; its intensity increased during further TPA exposure, being maximally expressed at 72/96 h.

This analysis is an extension of the concept of clonal excess, which is used to detect the presence of a tumor that is a clonal expansion of B cells expressing either kappa or lambda light chains. The technique also utilizes ""multiple listmode processing,"" which is defined in this context as the simultaneous analysis of two or more listmode files that share one or more common parameters. This type of data structure enables the segmentation of two parameter light scatter displays into regions from which numerous kappa and lambda histograms subsequently can be analyzed for their respective Komogorov-Smirnov D-values or R-values (reduced chi-square value). The final technique makes use of a calculated parameter display system. Superimposed on the light scatter dot density plot are D-value or R-value contours. The contours target the location of the population that is abnormal, thus providing information for setting optimal bitmap gates for clonal excess studies, other phenotypic analyses, or cell sorting. In experiments using model systems, the sensitivity of this assay is estimated to be between 0.25% and 2.5%. The technique's distribution information and sensitivity may prove useful for staging, treatment monitoring, and relapse detection of B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. This application illustrates the potential of combining multiple listmode processing and calculated parameter display to expand the effective dimensionality of listmode data.","['Bagwell, C B', 'Lovett, E J 3rd', 'Ault, K A']","['Bagwell CB', 'Lovett EJ 3rd', 'Ault KA']","['Maine Cytometry Research Institute, Portland 04102.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*analysis', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/*analysis', '*Mathematics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990090511 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1988 Sep;9(5):469-76. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990090511.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Putrescine levels increased in the mononuclear cells of all patients, cellular spermidine levels increased in 4 and cellular spermine levels increased in 5 patients. The cellular polyamine levels remained elevated above the pretreatment levels for up to 1 week in some patients. Subsequent treatment with MGBG, administered after 1-2 weeks of DFMO treatment, also promoted increases in mononuclear cell polyamine concentrations. Since enhanced tumor cell uptake of MGBG after DFMO priming is hypothesized to be dependent on a decrease in cellular polyamine levels, the increase in cellular polyamines after MGBG has important implications for the scheduling of this drug combination. From these observations, withholding MGBG until DFMO treatment has produced a decrease in tumor cell polyamine concentrations would be the schedule most likely to enhance the uptake of MGBG.","['Maddox, A M', 'Keating, M J', 'Freireich, E J', 'Haddox, M K']","['Maddox AM', 'Keating MJ', 'Freireich EJ', 'Haddox MK']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Texas Medical School, Houston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Biogenic Polyamines)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biogenic Polyamines/biosynthesis/blood/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Eflornithine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoguazone/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/drug therapy/metabolism']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000238602 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemotherapy. 1988;34(5):419-29. doi: 10.1159/000238602.,['32444/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemic cell population KON was notably quiescent when incubated in medium alone but was induced to significant in vitro DNA synthesis when cultured with any of four activators of human B cells: anti-IgM antibody, Staphylococcus aureus cells (SAC), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), or B-cell growth factor (BCGF). While both rIFN-gamma and rIFN-alpha A exhibited suppressive effects on these responses, their inhibitory patterns were distinct and reciprocal. Thus, rIFN-gamma exclusively suppressed anti-IgM-and SAC-induced leukemic DNA synthesis, and rIFN-alpha A significantly suppressed only PMA- and BCGF-induced DNA synthesis. The effects of the rIFN preparations were ablated in the presence of IFN type-specific monoclonal antibodies. Kinetic analyses and pulsing studies revealed that inhibition was most notable when cells were exposed concomitantly to IFN and the activating ligand. That the diverse effects of IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha A are manifested on a single B-cell clone was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of restriction enzyme-digested KON cell DNA with a JH-specific probe.

We have recently devised a more sensitive parameter for the kappa-lambda analysis than the D value called the delta-curve (delta c); the delta c applies the same principle as that of the D value. Mixing experiments with kappa-type and lambda-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells revealed that the delta c could not only detect a minor population of malignant kappa-B cells, but also that of malignant lambda-B cells using more sensitivity than the D value. A total of 49 blood samples obtained from 27 patients with various B-cell malignancies were investigated. D values were abnormal in 37% of all samples, while abnormal patterns of the delta c were recognized in 71%. On the other hand, 59% of samples obtained from the patients with B-cell lymphoma in aleukemic phase showed abnormal delta c, whereas D values exceeded the upper limit of the normal value in only 15% of the samples.

IL2 and alpha IFN also induce normal levels of LAK activity, measured against an NK resistant B lymphoblastoid cell line. In contrast, gamma IFN has no effect on patient effector function. However, promotion of cytotoxic effector activity is unlikely to produce therapeutic benefit since HCL cells themselves are entirely resistant to NK/LAK killing. Susceptibility of HCL cells can be induced by culturing the cells in the presence of both gamma IFN and TNF, but not by culture with either cytokine alone. This synergy is not mediated by a gamma IFN induced increase in TNF receptors on HCL lymphocytes, and therefore occurs at a post-receptor level.","['Cordingley, F T', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Brenner, M K']","['Cordingley FT', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Brenner MK']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Biological Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02431.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Sep;70(1):37-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb02431.x.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed at discriminating primary (essential) thrombocythaemia (PTH) from the various other subtypes of CMPDs presenting with thrombocytosis. Following the diagnostic requirements postulated by the Polycythemia-vera-Study-Group for PTH and polycythaemia vera rubra (P.vera) and the generally accepted criteria for the establishment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM), our cohort of 55 patients was divided into the following subgroups: CML (16 cases), P.vera (11 cases), AMM (13 cases) and finally PTH (15 cases). Histomorphometric measurements revealed that PTH was distinguishable from the other subtypes of CMPDs with respect to several histological variables: patients with PTH had a normal amount of neutrophilic granulo- and erythrocytopoiesis as well as a non-increased content of reticulin (argyrophilic) fibers in contrast to the findings in CML, P.vera and of course AMM. Moreover, sizes of megakaryocytes and their nuclei were significantly greater in PTH and internalization of haematopoietic cells (emperipolesis) was more frequently encountered in comparison with the other subtypes of CMPDs. Deviation of the circular perimeter of megakaryocyte shape was most prominently expressed in CML and AMM, and consequently generated an increased number of a-nuclear cytoplasmic fragments. In contrast to this feature aberration of the nuclei from a circular outline occurred in a less pronounced way in CML, but was excessive in P.vera, AMM and PTH. Our morphometric evaluation demonstrates that certain histological features may serve as a valuable aid in discriminating PTH from the other occasionally thrombocythaemic subtypes of CMPDs.","['Thiele, J', 'Schneider, G', 'Hoeppner, B', 'Wienhold, S', 'Zankovich, R', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Schneider G', 'Hoeppner B', 'Wienhold S', 'Zankovich R', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Virchows Arch A Pathol Anat Histopathol,"Virchows Archiv.

Sequence analysis identified only five different VH, and seven different VL genes, and indicated that these V genes are essentially unmutated. CH lymphomas which express the identical VH gene share at least one idiotope. Thus, the basis for shared idiotype and specificity is due in most cases to the use of the same V gene. This restriction in V gene expression is not due to the preferential use of V genes of any particular VH family or VL group, as the expressed V genes belong to four different VH families and four V kappa groups, and include V lambda 1 and V lambda 2.

Difluoromethylornithine from 5.5. to 64 gm/m2 per day was administered to nine patients with refractory acute leukemia or multiple myeloma. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine levels were determined on a daily basis in the circulating mononuclear cells and on a weekly basis in the mononuclear cells of the bone marrow. Tumor cell putrescine levels declined in 5 patients, spermidine levels declined in 4 patients, and spermine levels declined in 3 patients. Alterations in the polyamine levels of the bone marrow mononuclear cells paralleled those occurring in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the patients with leukemia. Seven to ten days of DFMO treatment were required for mononuclear cell polyamine levels to decrease. The higher drug doses were not significantly more effective than the lower doses in bringing about a decline in tumor cell polyamine levels, either with respect to treatment time required for onset of response or with respect to the ultimate extent of response.","['Maddox, A M', 'Freireich, E J', 'Keating, M J', 'Frasier-Scott, K F', 'Haddox, M K']","['Maddox AM', 'Freireich EJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Frasier-Scott KF', 'Haddox MK']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Texas Medical School, Houston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Biogenic Polyamines)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biogenic Polyamines/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/*analysis', 'Eflornithine/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00195371 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1988 Jun;6(2):125-34. doi: 10.1007/BF00195371.,"['AM07331/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Blast crisis (BC) cells from 14 patients were studied for immunoglobulin (Ig)- and T-cell-associated gene rearrangements. Five myeloid BC patients had no Ig- or T-cell-associated gene rearrangement. In contrast, all eight patients with pure lymphoid BC displayed C mu rearrangement and two also showed kappa-light chain rearrangement. One patient with mixed (lymphoid and erythroid) BC, however, showed neither Ig- nor T-cell-associated rearrangements.

In the presence of the tumor promoters, A65T cells proliferated rapidly in a concentration-dependent manner. When the cells were cultured with a synthetic diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) or 1,2-dicaprylin, cell proliferation was not stimulated. In addition, bihourly cumulative addition of OAG or 1,2-dicaprylin again failed to induce A65T cell proliferation. Phospholipase C (PLC) induced a concentration-dependent stimulation of A65T cell proliferation, though the effect was slight compared with that of the tumor promoters. Protein kinase C activity was detected both in cytosol and particulate fractions of A65T cells. When the cells were incubated in the TPA-free medium for 5 h, the protein kinase C activity in the cytosol fraction increased, whereas the activity in the particulate fraction decreased. Treatment of the cells with the tumor promoters mentioned above resulted in the increased phosphorylation of proteins with apparent mol. wts of 27,000 and 68,000. The effects were concentration-dependent and the half maximal phosphorylation was observed either with 3.6 nM TPA, 4.5 ng/ml teleocidin or 0.33 microM mezerein, respectively. On the other hand, a half maximal effect on cell proliferation was observed either with 0.14 nM TPA, 47 pg/ml teleocidin or 6.3 nM mezerein, respectively. At these concentrations, these tumor promoters never induced the detectable stimulations of the protein phosphorylation. A synthetic diacylglycerol 1,2-dicaprylin failed to stimulate the phosphorylation of 27- and 68-kd proteins, but stimulated the phosphorylation of proteins with apparent mol. wts of 100,000 and 54,000. The effect was concentration-dependent and a half maximal stimulation was observed with 35 micrograms/ml 1,2-dicaprylin. Neither TPA, teleocidin nor mezerein stimulated the phosphorylation of these 100- and 54-kd proteins. OAG and PLC failed to induce any detectable alterations in the protein phosphorylation in A65T cells. Both OAG and 1,2-dicaprylin, which we used, actually activated partially purified mouse brain protein kinase C in a concentration-dependent manner. These results clearly demonstrate that in A65T cells TPA and diacylglycerol mutually stimulate the phosphorylation of the completely different set of endogenous proteins, and also suggest that the cell-proliferating effects of the tumor promoters do not appear to be mediated through the phosphorylation of 27- and 68-kd proteins.","['Yamamoto, S', 'Gotoh, H', 'Aizu, E', 'Sasakawa, N', 'Hiai, H', 'Kato, R']","['Yamamoto S', 'Gotoh H', 'Aizu E', 'Sasakawa N', 'Hiai H', 'Kato R']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Caprylates)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Lyngbya Toxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Terpenes)', '27974YJ83L (teleocidins)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', '7384-98-7 (1,2-dicaprylin)', '86390-77-4 (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Caprylates/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Diglycerides/*pharmacology', '*Diterpenes', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glycerides/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Lyngbya Toxins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/9.10.1857 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1988 Oct;9(10):1857-62. doi: 10.1093/carcin/9.10.1857.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-one patients (36%) had elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in a pattern consistent with either drug-induced hepatocellular injury or non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis. These 21 patients (Group 1) were compared with the other 38 children (Group 2) with regard to a number of clinical and laboratory characteristics. Patients in Group 1 were older (P = 0.002) and had lower platelet counts (P less than 0.001) and hemoglobin values (P = 0.075) at diagnosis than Group 2 patients. The median number of units of blood products transfused was significantly greater in Group 1 patients (9.0 versus 1.0 units, P less than 0.001). The two groups were similar with regard to chemotherapy regimens. Children with ALL who present at an older age and who have more marked anemia and thrombocytopenia require more blood transfusions and are more likely to develop elevated ALT values in a pattern consistent with acute or chronic NANB hepatitis. These findings suggest a predominant role of NANB posttransfusion hepatitis--rather than or in addition to chemotherapy-induced hepatic injury--as a cause for elevated ALT values in children with ALL.

Due to their possible synergistic efficacy, a combination rIFN therapy in CML has been proposed. To establish a biologic basis for this, we have studied the suppressive effects of rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma on the in vitro growth of CML-derived progenitor cells (CFU-GEMM, CFU-Mk, BFU-E, CFU-GM), the optimal conditions for rIFN synergism, and the possible role of hematopoietic accessory cells (T-lymphocytes and monocytes-macrophages) in mediating rIFN-induced growth inhibition. When added to unseparated bone marrow cells, rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma significantly reduced colony formation, with 50% inhibition occurring at 71 and 186 U/mL for CFU-GEMM, 40 and 152 U/mL for CFU-Mk, 222 and 1,458 U/mL for BFU-E, and 119 and 442 U/mL for CFU-GM, respectively. A small amount of rIFN-gamma (5 U/mL) acted synergistically with increasing doses of rIFN-alpha, and the values of 50% inhibitory concentrations fell outside the lower limit (10 U/mL) used in our experiments. This synergy was evident even when rIFN-gamma was added 72 hours after the initiation of cultures; however, it was completely lost when the target cells were depleted of accessory cells. When a low dose of rIFN-alpha (5 U/mL) was added to rIFN-gamma, the 50% inhibitory concentration values were decreased up to tenfold. These studies (1) confirm that CML-derived hematopoietic progenitors are responsive to the suppressive activity of both rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma in vitro, (2) demonstrate that different mechanisms are responsible for the suppressive activity of the two rIFNs, and (3) characterize their synergistic interaction, providing a basis for future clinical trials aimed at investigating combination rIFN therapy in CML.","['Carlo-Stella, C', 'Cazzola, M', 'Ganser, A', 'Bergamaschi, G', 'Pedrazzoli, P', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Ascari, E']","['Carlo-Stella C', 'Cazzola M', 'Ganser A', 'Bergamaschi G', 'Pedrazzoli P', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ascari E']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1988/10/01 00:00,1988/10/01 00:01,['1988/10/01 00:00'],"['1988/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82902-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Oct;72(4):1293-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF alpha inhibited colony formation of all colony types representing different maturational stages of normal progenitor cells committed to the myeloid lineage with different orders of sensitivity. Blast-type colonies derived from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia were more sensitive to TNF alpha inhibition than progenitor cells purified from normal bone marrow or bone marrow from patients with stable-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. The response of most colony types to IFN gamma was poor. However, when IFN gamma was administered together with TNF alpha, synergistically enhanced antiproliferative effects were detected in all colony types tested. The antiproliferative action of IFN gamma on myelopoiesis was enhanced in culture by the presence of autologous monocytes, presumedly by inducing endogenous production of TNF alpha.

Direct antineoplastic and immunomodulating effects on both the host immune system and the hairy cells themselves have been implicated. To evaluate whether lymphokines have any regulatory effect on antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on hairy cells and whether this corresponds to prognostic clinical parameters, we studied splenic hairy cells from ten previously untreated patients. The samples were incubated with recombinant human alpha-IFN, gamma-IFN (gamma-IFN), and interleukin-2 (IL-2). In an indirect staining procedure, cells were labeled with monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to HLA ABC and HLA DR surface structures and subjected to cytofluorimetric analysis. Results concerning the expression of MHC class I and HLA DR antigens were mixed for incubation of hairy cells with gamma-IFN and IL-2, whereas alpha-IFN had a distinct effect on HLA DR antigen expression. alpha-IFN strongly enhanced the intensity of staining with HLA DR MoAb in six patients, and it increased the percentage of MoAb-positive cells in five of these samples. In contrast, the staining intensity in samples from four patients was reduced considerably on alpha-IFN treatment. In this group, two samples showed a sharp alpha-IFN-induced decrease in the number of HLA DR MoAb-positive cells from originally high values, and in one sample the very low percentage of positive cells was unaffected by alpha-IFN exposure. These two groups of patients whose hairy cells displayed contrasting HLA DR expression on incubation with alpha-IFN in vitro, were found to differ in their subsequent clinical course.","['Gressler, V H', 'Weinkauff, R E', 'Franklin, W A', 'Golomb, H M']","['Gressler VH', 'Weinkauff RE', 'Franklin WA', 'Golomb HM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis', 'HLA-A Antigens', 'HLA-B Antigens', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Spleen/immunology/*pathology']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77155-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Sep;72(3):1048-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In one case the overproduction of the enzyme was based on an enhanced transcription of the enzyme's message at normal gene copy number. The DFMO-resistant cells exhibited ODC activity that was 8 to 25 times higher than the enzyme activity in the parental cells. When plated into soft agar, the parental mouse myeloma cells failed to form any colonies, whereas the ODC overproducing variant cells grew soft agar at a plating efficiency of about 16%. The difference between parental and ODC overproducing cells was even more striking in case of mouse leukemia L1210 cells. The parental L1210 cell formed colonies in soft agar at an efficiency of 1.9% while two overproducer variant cell lines formed colonies at up to 60% plating efficiency.

An ""enhancer test plasmid"" harboring the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under the control of a truncated simian virus 40 enhancerless early promoter was employed. The DQB sequence inserted into this plasmid was active as an enhancer in Raji cells (human Burkitt lymphoma cells) but not active in Jurkat cells (human T-cell leukemia cells) or in HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma cells). This cell-type specificity suggests that this enhancer activity may be involved in the tissue specificity of the DQB gene that is normally expressed only in mature B cells, macrophages, and thymic epithelial cells. Deletion analysis showed that both X and Y box sequences are essential for the full activity of the enhancer sequence and that these two sequences may function in a cooperative manner as cis-acting elements. Further deletions were used to define the 5' border of the X element. These results suggest that previously characterized protein factors that bind to X and Y include transcription factors involved in the cell-type specificity of this enhancer activity.","['Sakurai, M', 'Strominger, J L']","['Sakurai M', 'Strominger JL']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genes, MHC Class II', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Transfection']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.85.18.6909 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1988 Sep;85(18):6909-13. doi: 10.1073/pnas.85.18.6909.,['DK-30241/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC282088,,,,,,,,,,

In this study clone 707 Friend leukaemia cells were compared with subclone 707BUF for sensitivity to the potentiating effect of caffeine on MMC-induced cytogenetic aberrations. The results indicate that although potentiation of mitomycin C-induced cytogenetic damage occurs in both clone 707 and in subclone 707BUF following caffeine treatment, the mutagen-sensitive thymidine kinase-deficient subclone 707BUF had enhanced potentiation by caffeine of MMC-induced cytogenetic damage relative to wild-type clone 707.

Clone 707 wild-type cells in the presence of caffeine could then continue to repair DNA damage through an intact though less effective excision repair system, whilst the thymidine kinase-deficient subclone 707BUF would, in the presence of caffeine, be rendered highly mutagen sensitive, being only able to repair DNA damage through an error-prone excision repair process.","['McKelvey, V J', 'McKenna, P G']","['McKelvey VJ', 'McKenna PG']","['Biomedical Sciences Research Centre, University of Ulster, Coleraine, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Mitomycins)', '0 (Mutagens)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caffeine/*adverse effects', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/*adverse effects', 'Mutagens/pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/*deficiency']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/1.3.173 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1986 May;1(3):173-8. doi: 10.1093/mutage/1.3.173.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of c-myc was completely abolished in U-937 and greatly reduced in HL-60 after a 3 day exposure to the drug, whereas specific c-fos transcripts were increased. In fresh myeloid leukaemia samples, growth and DNA synthesis were reduced as in the two cell lines. Conversely, changes compatible with the induction of differentiation along the myelomonocytic pathway were much less pronounced than in cell lines treated with the same dose of Ara-C. Cells from one patient did not show any appreciable morphological change. The same sample displayed a greatly reduced expression of c-myc accompanied by a concurrent 10-fold increased expression of c-fos. The data suggest that the action of low dose Ara-C on oncogene expression is comparable to that of other differentiation-inducing agents that display both cytostatic and maturation promoting effects.

Effects of caffeine on G2 progression could be distinguished from those of the other ADPRT inhibitors, and even from the effects of another methylxanthine, theophylline.

However, detailed information on the process and extent of adsorption of IgG and IgE in particular are still lacking. The adsorption isotherm of mouse monoclonal 125I-IgE antibovine milk beta-lactoglobulin was studied quantitatively with colloidal gold buffered at pH 6.1-8.8 (28 nm in particle diameter). At low coverage of the particles (less that or equal to 5 molecules per particle), the isotherm was independent of pH. In the presence of a large excess of IgE, the highest coverage was obtained at pH 6.1 near the pI of IgE (5.2-5.8). The binding constants were higher at low coverage (side-on adsorption) than at high coverage where desorption was observed. IgE-Au markers were unreactive towards the immobilized antigen and did not bind to receptors for IgE of rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-1).

We show that CR cross-linking of resting murine CD8+ T cells seeded at low cell densities is insufficient to induce responsiveness to the growth-promoting effect of interleukin-2 (IL-2), i.e. fails to induce expression of functional IL-2 receptors. The macrophage cell-line product, IL-2 receptor-inducing factor (RIF), but not IL-1, IL-3, IL-4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) functions efficiently as a co-stimulator. Once activated, growth of CD8+ T cells is driven entirely by IL-2. We conclude that two restriction points control the activation of resting CD8+ T cells. While cross-linking of TCR is essential as the first step, RIF is required as the competence factor to induce IL-2 responsiveness. We consider the possibility that the ability of APCs to produce RIF determines the immunogenicity of APCs towards antigen-reactive resting CD8+ T cells.","['Wagner, H', 'Heeg, K']","['Wagner H', 'Heeg K']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Ulm, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cell Division', '*Cytokines', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Proteins/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1988 Jul;64(3):433-8.,,PMC1385054,,,,,,,,,,

However, many technical difficulties exist in obtaining analyzable chromosomes from these tumors, including the inability to stimulate cell division. Phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) is a tumor promoter that activates a variety of cellular responses, including proliferation. Using flow cytometry, we have demonstrated that PDBu acts as a mitogen in primary cultures of colon tumor cells. Based on these results, we developed a short-term culture technique that greatly improves the yield of analyzable metaphases from colon tumors. Stimulated cultures consistently contained at least ten times more metaphases than unstimulated cultures, and chromosome morphology was improved. By modifying this technique with the addition of the calcium ionophore A23187, we have successfully obtained analyzable chromosomes from the peripheral blood of normal individuals, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, and a nodular small cell lymphoma patient. These results demonstrate that mitogenic stimulation by PDBu is a valuable technique in the cytogenetic analysis of colon tumors. By using PDBu alone or in combination with other agents, this technique may also be applicable to many other tumors that are difficult to karyotype because of an inability to obtain mitoses.","['Eiseman, E', 'Luck, J B', 'Mills, A S', 'Brown, J A', 'Westin, E H']","['Eiseman E', 'Luck JB', 'Mills AS', 'Brown JA', 'Westin EH']","['Department of Human Genetics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)']",IM,"['Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/pathology', '*Mitogens', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Mitotic Index/*drug effects', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(88)90256-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(88)90256-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1988 Sep;34(2):165-75. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(88)90256-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

More particularly, excessive bone resorption (a major feature of MM) associated with a normal to low bone formation (i.e., uncoupling bone disease) was the most frequent feature and in the same range of that observed in overt MM. However, as opposed to MM, this bone resorption was characteristically mediated by small mononucleated osteoclasts (i.e., microresorption). The same phenomena of abnormal bone remodeling, the uncoupling process, excessive bone resorption, and above all microresorption were confirmed by the detailed bone study of five cases of B-cell cancers other than MM presenting lytic bone lesions and hypercalcemia.

Human plasma pharmacokinetic studies revealed the presence of TEPA, a Thio-TEPA metabolite which after 4 h achieved plasma concentrations equal to those of the parent compound. We studied the activity of both Thio-TEPA and TEPA against murine leukemia P388 cells in culture. We found that Thio-TEPA is approximately two-fold more active than TEPA in arresting cell growth (IC50 = 2.8 microM for TEPA and 1.5 microM for Thio-TEPA). In inhibiting [3H]thymidine incorporation, Thio-TEPA and TEPA have the same activity (IC50 = 2 microM for both compounds). Experiments in which drug was removed from cell cultures which were further incubated in drug-free media, revealed that the bulk of the cell damage occurs during the first 4 h of incubation. Cell cultures exposed to 0.5 microM Thio-TEPA for 22 h fully recovered their [3H]thymidine incorporation ability after 24 h of drug-free incubation. Cells exposed to 2.5 microM Thio-TEPA for 22 h partially recovered their ability to incorporate [3H]thymidine. Cells exposed to 10 microM Thio-TEPA for 22 h did not recover their ability to incorporate [3H]thymidine. Gas liquid chromatographic analysis of the media from incubated cells showed that the concentration of Thio-TEPA remained unchanged during the incubations and that TEPA was not present. In Thio-TEPA doses ranging from 0.1 microM to 100 microM, [3H]uridine and [3H]-leucine incorporation were less affected than [3H]thymidine incorporation.

Exposure of cells to a range of rTNF-alpha doses including pharmacologically achievable plasma concentrations revealed a large heterogeneity in the response of leukemic clonogenic growth to rTNF-alpha. Only one of 13 specimens was highly resistant to rTNF-alpha. Eight of ten leukemic samples were significantly more sensitive than were normal GM-CFC, particularly within the in vivo achievable dose range (1 x 10(0) to 1 x 10(2) ng/mL). No significantly increased inhibition of either normal or leukemic clonogenic growth could be achieved by increasing the rTNF-alpha concentration above 250 ng/mL. Proliferation of leukemic clonogenic cells (L-CFC) was studied in suspension cultures. In five cases the clonogenic cells were significantly inhibited by rTNF-alpha while in one case no inhibition was observed. The inhibition of L-CFC growth by rTNF-alpha was dose dependent between 1 x 10(0) and 1 x 10(2) ng/mL. In suspension cultures, the TNF effect on L-CFC was a function of time of exposure, particularly with low concentrations of TNF. A remarkably higher inhibition of L-CFC as compared with the total leukemic population was observed in suspension cultures. Stimulation of L-CFC growth by rTNF-alpha was not observed. Normal GM-CFC were inhibited by alpha and gamma interferons (INF-alpha, -gamma) in a dose-related manner, with higher sensitivity of colonies than clusters. The response of GM-CFC to combination of recombinant IFNs and TNF was influenced by the size of clones scored and the source of colony-stimulating activity. The response of L-CFC to recombinant IFN-alpha and/or -gamma was highly variable, and sensitivity to one of the lymphokines did not predict for sensitivity to another. The response of L-CFC to combinations of rTNF-alpha and either IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma was complex, varying from synergistic to additive and indifferent. In three of six specimens, IFN-gamma acted antagonistically with rTNF-alpha, a phenomenon not observed with IFN-alpha. These observations suggest that the action of rTNF-alpha in acute myelogenous leukemia could be exploited therapeutically and the dose-time-response relationship should be considered in designing treatment schedules.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Beran, M', 'McCredie, K B', 'Keating, M J', 'Gutterman, J U']","['Beran M', 'McCredie KB', 'Keating MJ', 'Gutterman JU']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Department of Hematology, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81058-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Aug;72(2):728-38.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work has detected increased levels of circulating, TAC-soluble IL-2R (soluble TAC antigen) in the serum of most B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients. We detected soluble TAC antigen in B-CLL patients (mean of 3,332 U/mL v 410 for controls). Serum soluble TAC antigen levels increased with stage (mean value of 1,187 U/mL for stage 0 v 2,527 for stage 2 and 5,410 for stages 3 and 4). We next attempted to determine whether the elevated serum levels of soluble TAC antigen in B-CLL patients might result from shedding or secretion of the receptor from the circulating, malignant B cells. Purified, malignant B cells from B-CLL patients were capable of producing easily detectable soluble TAC antigen after 48 hours of in vitro culture (range of 60 to 1,563 U/mL). IL-2R production by CLL B cells was dose dependent in most patients over a concentration of 10 x 10(6) to 60 x 10(6)/mL. In contrast, there was little or no detectable soluble TAC antigen when highly purified T cells from the same patients were cultured. Finally, despite elaboration of soluble IL-2R by CLL B cells, membrane expression of B-cell IL-2R was detected in only six of 11 patients. Thus, the cellular source of the elevated serum IL-2R levels is the malignant CLL B cell. Taken together these data suggest that (a) the malignant CLL B cell is ""activated"" in terms of release of soluble IL-2R and may serve as a tumor marker in this disease and (b) the elevated levels of circulating IL-2R may be an associated factor in the cellular immunodeficiency noted in B-CLL patients.","['Kay, N E', 'Burton, J', 'Wagner, D', 'Nelson, D L']","['Kay NE', 'Burton J', 'Wagner D', 'Nelson DL']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Minneapolis Veterans Administration Medical Center, MN 55417.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Solubility']",1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81015-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Aug;72(2):447-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific monoclonal anti CBP antibodies have been obtained in mice and polyclonal anti-cromolyn antibodies in rabbits. These antibodies have been used for further purification and characterization of the CBP. Experiments on RBL cell lines have shown that CBP is essential for Ca++ influx and histamine liberation upon immunologic triggering by these cells.

Using the cells from 12 different patients we show that IL-4 does not synergize with anti-mu antibody for the enhancement of DNA synthesis. Moreover IL-4 profoundly (90%) suppresses the response to IL-2 in the 10 patient responders to this interleukin. This suppression occurs whether IL-2 is used alone, in costimulation with anti-mu antibody, or in synergy with IFN-gamma. In no instance did IL-4 induce terminal differentiation. This negative effect of IL-4 can take place in monoclonal B-CLL cells where IL-4 enhances the expression of CD23. IL-4 does not interfere with the upregulation of CD25 by IL-2. Thus, IL-4 may display inhibitory effects on the proliferative response of selected B cell populations.

We found 85% of the rearranged Igh alleles to contain abnormal Dh-Jh deletions of varying size. All of these deletions encompassed Jh elements and extended into the Igh enhancer region, occasionally involving the switch (S) region of the C mu gene. Some of these rearrangements removed most of the Dh elements, but none appeared to extend to the Vh genes. DNA sequence analysis of the two abnormally rearranged Igh alleles in one pre-B cell line showed that no Dh or Jh coding sequences were retained at the recombination sites though heptamer-like (CACTGTG) recognition signal sequences were present in the absence of nonamer (GGTTTTTGT) recognition signal sequences.

Studies in which ODC protein was labeled in the D-R cells by exposure to [35S]methionine indicated that the polyamine derivatives and their physiological counterparts led to an increased rate of degradation of ODC and to a rapid reduction in ODC synthesis without affecting the content of ODC mRNA. Direct evidence that the polyamine derivatives act by inhibiting the translation of the ODC mRNA was obtained by studying their effects on the translation of ODC mRNA in reticulocyte lysates. This translation was strongly inhibited by the addition of N1,N8-bis(ethyl)spermidine, spermidine, N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine, or spermine but was not affected much by putrescine. The inhibition of the translation of ODC mRNA by either of the bis(ethyl) polyamine derivatives occurred at concentrations which stimulated total protein synthesis showing the selectivity of the reduction in ODC. The effects of polyamine derivatives and polyamines on translation of the plasmid-derived ODC mRNA were identical with those found with the D-R L1210 cell mRNA. This synthetic ODC mRNA lacks 261 bases of the 5'-leader sequences and 200 bases plus the poly(A) section from the 3'-nontranslated sequence. Therefore, these regions appear not to influence sensitivity of the ODC mRNA to inhibition of translation by polyamine derivatives.","['Pegg, A E', 'Madhubala, R', 'Kameji, T', 'Bergeron, R J']","['Pegg AE', 'Madhubala R', 'Kameji T', 'Bergeron RJ']","['Department of Physiology, Milton S.

In addition, spectrophotometric measurement of total GAG in treated cells revealed a similar GAG increase. However, BCNU treatment did not alter compartmental GAG distribution or GAG species.

Previously we found that each purified isomer of teleocidins A and B had approximately the same activity as teleocidin in an irritant test on mouse ear, in inductions of ornithine decarboxylase in mouse skin and adhesion of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, and in inhibition of the specific binding of [3H]-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate to a mouse skin particulate fraction. This paper reports the strong activation of protein kinase C in vitro by each isomer of teleocidins A and B at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml. Detailed studies on the potent tumor promoting activities of the two teleocidin A isomers and four teleocidin B isomers in a two-stage carcinogenesis experiment on mouse skin are also reported, including histological findings on the tumors. Treatment of mice with 100 micrograms of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and then 2.5 micrograms of any one of the six isomers of teleocidins A and B twice a week induced tumors in 80.0 to 91.7% of the mice with 2.8 to 5.2 tumors/mouse in week 30.

It was found to be the most powerful inhibitor of yeast S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) so far studied (Ki approx. 9 nM). This property, together with the finding that the compound is a weaker inhibitor of intestinal diamine oxidase than are MGBG and its glyoxal, ethylglyoxal and ethylmethylglyoxal analogs, makes the compound a promising candidate as a polyamine antimetabolite for chemotherapy studies. DEGBG was also found to potentiate the antiproliferative effect of the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine against mouse L1210 leukemia cells in vitro. DEGBG increased several-fold the intracellular putrescine concentration of cultured L1210 cells, just as MGBG and its ethylglyoxal analog are known to do. The results strongly suggest that DEGBG is worth further studies.

Phorbol esters can act as differentiating agents in a number of cell systems including murine megakaryocytes. We report the effects of phorbol esters on the previously described long-term human megakaryocytic leukemia cell culture, EST-IU. While two nontransforming phorbols fail to affect these cells, the transforming phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces a phenotype with characteristics of more mature megakaryocytes in a dose-related manner. This phenotype includes an increased adherence to untreated plastic or glass, polyploidization, an increase in cell size, and increased expression of both platelet glycoproteins and factor VIII-related antigen. Two-color flow cytometric analysis allowed simultaneous determinations of DNA content and the expression of surface membrane antigens or alpha-granule constituents, providing evidence that nuclear, membrane, and cytoplasmic maturation occur in parallel in this cellular system. TPA-induced maturation of EST-IU cells provides an important new cellular model for the further study of human megakaryocyte development.","['Roth, B J', 'Sledge, G W Jr', 'Straneva, J E', 'Brandt, J', 'Goheen, M', 'Hoffman, R']","['Roth BJ', 'Sledge GW Jr', 'Straneva JE', 'Brandt J', 'Goheen M', 'Hoffman R']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana Elks Cancer Research Center, Indianapolis 46223.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '24928-17-4 (phorbol-12,13-didecanoate)', '67492-54-0 (croton factor F2)', '9001-24-5 (Factor V)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Factor V/metabolism', 'Factor VIII/immunology/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Ploidies', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'von Willebrand Factor']",1988/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80573-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Jul;72(1):202-7.,"['CA 34841/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 31710/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Using a one-step recalcificating clotting assay, PCA in cell lysates or whole cell preparations was measured by comparison to a rabbit brain thromboplastin standard. There was a dose- and time-dependent increase in PCA when U937 cells were cultured with rTNF. The effect of rTNF was not enhanced by recombinant human interferon-gamma (rIFN gamma). Cycloheximide inhibited the expression of PCA by U937 cells, showing that protein synthesis was necessary to mediate the effects of rTNF. Whole cell preparations demonstrated that greater than 80% of the PCA was expressed on the surface of the cells. The PCA functioned as a tissue factor-like substance, since it required coagulation factor VII and factor X. rTNF also increased PCA in human monocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This effect was abrogated by boiling the rTNF for ten minutes, and was not inhibited by adding polymyxin-B to the cultures, making it unlikely that endotoxin accounted for the observed effects. These results suggest that TNF-induced expression of tissue factor by mononuclear phagocytes may modulate immunologic, inflammatory, and hemostatic processes.","['Conkling, P R', 'Greenberg, C S', 'Weinberg, J B']","['Conkling PR', 'Greenberg CS', 'Weinberg JB']","['Department of Medicine, VA Medical Center, Durham, NC 27705.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (macrophage procoagulant activity)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Blood Coagulation Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/blood/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Thromboplastin/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80562-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Jul;72(1):128-33.,"['5T30-CA09307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-A123308/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Morphological examinations showed a plasmacytoid appearance of the neoplastic cells, while immunological studies failed to detect cytoplasmic immunoglobulin or secretory capacity. The surface phenotype of CD38+, PCA-1+, DR-, CD20-, CD24-, CD9-, CD10- and surface immunoglobulin- was compatible with mature plasma cells. Chromosomal analysis showed the 14q+ marker due to translocation (6;14) and deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1. Analysis of immunoglobulin genes revealed the presence of heavy chain gene rearrangement, but the light chain genes, both kappa and lambda, remained in germline configuration. Such defective immunoglobulin gene rearrangement may be responsible for the failure of immunoglobulin biosynthesis and secretion by the neoplastic plasma cells. Furthermore, it is suggested that the morphological and phenotypic development of B cells may not necessarily depend on immunoglobulin light chain gene rearrangement, and that the oncogenic event in myeloma may occur at an earlier stage of B cell differentiation.","['Tominaga, N', 'Katagiri, S', 'Hamaguchi, Y', 'Nishiura, T', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Kanayama, Y', 'Nagao, K', 'Kakiuchi, Y', 'Nishida, K', 'Abe, T']","['Tominaga N', 'Katagiri S', 'Hamaguchi Y', 'Nishiura T', 'Kanakura Y', 'Kanayama Y', 'Nagao K', 'Kakiuchi Y', 'Nishida K', 'Abe T', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Middle Aged']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb07624.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Jun;69(2):213-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb07624.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose-limiting factors were judged to be hypotension, leucopenia and CNS toxicity. Since the optimal dose for the phase II study was considered to be 5 X 10(6) U/m2 by daily chronic schedule, a further study was conducted using this dose. Response rates were as follows: 14.3% (renal cell cancer), 11.8% (multiple myeloma) 40.0% (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), 16.7% (non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and 67% (mycosis fungoides). Complete response was obtained in one case each of renal cell cancer, malignant lymphoma and mycosis fungoides. Moreover, intermittent high-dose gamma-interferon against renal cell cancer induced a response rate of 21.4%, significantly higher than the 8.6% obtained by continuous administration. Local injection against cutaneous malignancies resulted in a 55.3% response rate. Anti-viral effect against herpes zoster infection was also preliminarily evaluated.

LCA was found in four of nine (44%) patients with anti-D and in 12 of 40 (30%) patients without anti-D (p less than 0.50). Since both D and antigens HLA are considered highly immunogenic, it is of interest that the ability to form anti-D or LCA does not correlate. In fact, more patients (16/49; 32%) made LCA than anti-D (9/49; 18%). Of the 21 alloimmunized patients, 4 made both antibodies, while 17 had selective alloimmunization.

We have prepared two monoclonal anti-peptide antibodies, one from each gene product, and have affinity purified each. Incubation of anti-abl (c-abl 51-64) immunoprecipitates of K562 cells with [gamma-32P]ATP in protein kinase assays resulted in the labeling of P210bcr-abl and a 53 kDa (ph-P53) protein. Increasing concentrations of antibody detected similar ratios of P210bcr-abl: ph-P53, suggesting the presence of a complex between the proteins. Several different anti-abl and anti-bcr antibodies detected the ph-P53/P210 complex. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) treatment without 2-mercaptoethanol eluted P210bcr-abl and ph-P53 from the monoclonal antibody in the form of complexes which migrated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and had apparent molecular weights of 275,000 and more than 500,000. Both complexes yielded ph-P53 and P210bcr-abl upon treatment with SDS-mercaptoethanol. Studies involving glycerol gradient centrifugation also detected complexes of P210bcr-abl and ph-P53. Our results indicate that ph-P53 is not a degraded product of P210bcr-abl, does not share antigenic determinants with P210bcr-abl since it is not recognized by anti-abl and bcr antibodies in immunoblots, is not the phosphorylated heavy chain of immunoglobulin G, and is different from p53 (the nonviral T protein) complexed to the large T antigen of simian virus 40. Previous studies (Maxwell et al., 1987) have shown that ph-P53 has a different peptide map than P210bcr-abl. Therefore, we conclude that ph-P53 is a distinct cellular protein complexed to P210bcr-abl in K562 cells.","['Li, W J', 'Kloetzer, W S', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Li WJ', 'Kloetzer WS', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['University of Texas System Cancer Center, M.D. Anderson Hospital and Cancer Institute, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Fractionation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1988 Jun;2(6):559-66.,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45125/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Like retinoic acid, 14 retinobenzoic acids inhibited the induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) by teleocidin in mouse skin. The mechanism(s) of inhibition of ODC induction by 7 retinobenzoic acids, Am 80, Am 81, Am 580, Am 590, Am 68, Sa 80, and Ch 55 was compared with those by all-trans-retinoic acid and the arotinoid compound 19. Application of 114 nmol of Am 80, Am 81, Am 580, Am 590, Am 68, Sa 80, or Ch 55, 10 min before 11.4 nmol of teleocidin, resulted in 76.7%, 82.0%, 76.2%, 28.3%, 48.4%, 58.6%, and 85.1% inhibition of ODC induction, respectively. Since all-trans-retinoic acid and compound 19 were also inhibitory, we determined whether retinobenzoic acids bind to cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) isolated from bovine adrenal glands. Am 80 and Am 580 inhibited the specific binding of 3H-retinoic acid to CRABP, but also showed less affinity than authentic unlabeled retinoic acid and compound 19. Am 81, Am 590, Am 68, Sa 80, and Ch 55 at up to 10 microM were not effective competitors of the binding of either 3H-retinoic acid or 3H-retinol. These results suggest that the inhibition of ODC induction can be mediated by pathways that do not involve CRABP or the cellular retinol-binding protein.","['Takagi, K', 'Suganuma, M', 'Kagechika, H', 'Shudo, K', 'Ninomiya, M', 'Muto, Y', 'Fujiki, H']","['Takagi K', 'Suganuma M', 'Kagechika H', 'Shudo K', 'Ninomiya M', 'Muto Y', 'Fujiki H']","['Cancer Prevention Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Lyngbya Toxins)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '27974YJ83L (teleocidins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoates/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Female', 'Lyngbya Toxins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*biosynthesis', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular', 'Skin/drug effects/enzymology', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'Vitamin A/metabolism']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00405825 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1988;114(3):221-4. doi: 10.1007/BF00405825.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal, non-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts were used as control. SCE and chromatid break frequencies in untreated or MMC-treated ANN-1 and NIH3T3 cells were compared with those observed in the same cells after infection with the helper murine Moloney leukemia virus (M-MuLV), which rescues the ability of A-MuLV to replicate in ANN-1 cells. The frequency of spontaneous and MMC-induced SCE were not significantly different in both ANN-1 and NIH3T3 cells, independently of M-MuLV infection. After M-MuLV infection, however, increased 'spontaneous' frequency of SCE and altered susceptibility to the induction of SCE by MMC was observed in both cell lines compared to M-MuLV-uninfected cells. In the case of chromatid breaks, the baseline frequency was not significantly different between the two cell lines both in the presence or in the absence of M-MuLV infection, nor was it significantly increased by M-MuLV, with respect to the value observed in uninfected cells. These results indicate that, at variance with what occurs with SCE, viral replication is not needed to increase the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and that the portion of A-MuLV genome alone is sufficient to increase chromatid breaks but not SCE in ANN-1 cells. Thus, in mouse cells carrying retroviruses, SCE and chromosomal aberrations seem to be independently generated, and influenced by different viral genes.","['Majone, F', 'Montaldi, A', 'Saggioro, D', 'Bianchi, L C', 'Levis, A G']","['Majone F', 'Montaldi A', 'Saggioro D', 'Bianchi LC', 'Levis AG']","['Department of Biology, University of Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Mitomycins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/pharmacology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', '*Oncogenes', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange']",1988/07/01 00:00,1988/07/01 00:01,['1988/07/01 00:00'],"['1988/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/9.7.1229 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1988 Jul;9(7):1229-31. doi: 10.1093/carcin/9.7.1229.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular localization of protein B23 was detected using an immunofluorescence technique. Translocation of protein B23 from nucleoli to the nucleoplasm was observed with increasing dose of mitomycin C. To study the correlation of B23 translocation and drug resistance, three human colon carcinoma cell lines, HCT116, HCT116b (a line that is natively or intrinsically resistant to mitomycin C), and HCT116-44 (a line with an acquired resistance to mitomycin C), were employed. These cells were incubated with 1--150 micrograms/ml of mitomycin C. The drug concentration that caused 50% of the cells to have complete translocation (IC50) was determined for each cell line. The IC50 values of HCT116, HCT116b and HCT116-44 were 6, 10 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. These IC50 values correlate well with the mitomycin C resistant phenotype of these tumor cells as determined by other in vivo and in vitro assays (Willson, et al. (1985) Cancer Res., 45, 5281-5286).

The question is discussed, whether both defense systems are also of importance in immunosuppressed patients. Further, the behaviour of plasma fibronectin determined by laser nephelometry, and phagocytic activity determined by chemiluminescence is demonstrated in patients with leukaemia under the conditions of selective decontamination of the intestinal tract. The following results are shown: Plasma fibronectin concentration decreases 10 to 14 days before onset of the first clinical signs of an infection. Plasma fibronectin level changes appear earlier than that of C-reactive protein (Crp). Therefore, it is suitable as a parameter for assessment of the course of an infection. Decreased plasma fibronectin levels occurring over longer periods have to be regarded as unfavourable prognostic criterion. The phagocytic activity of immunosuppressed patients selectively decontaminated is significantly below that of healthy adults. A clear assignment of phagocytic activity to the clinical picture, the number of granulocytes and plasma fibronectin level is not possible at present. Additional studies are necessary.

The patient had a 5 year history of follicular lymphoma, which developed into acute pre-B-cell leukemia. The leukemic blasts revealed a karyotype with two translocations, t(8; 14) and t(14; 18), characteristic for Burkitt's lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. The cells are TdT positive, do not possess surface immunoglobulin, and they show immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. The mu heavy chain and kappa light chain constant (C mu and C kappa) loci are deleted, while the gamma and lambda light chain constant (C gamma and C lambda) region genes are rearranged. Both alleles of the heavy chain joining segment (JH) are rearranged on chromosome 14q+, one of them with the bcl-2 oncogene from chromosome 18. The breakpoint of the t(14; 18) translocation occurs in the major breakpoint cluster region in the 3' untranslated region of bcl-2. On chromosome 8 a c-myc rearrangement was mapped immediately 5' to the c-myc first exon in a region involved in sporadic Burkitt lymphoma. The data are consistent with our previous hypothesis on the evolution of B-cell malignancies: a rare pre-B cell develops a t(14; 18) translocation during immunoglobulin VDJ joining that results in an expansion of a follicular lymphoma clone carrying an activated bcl-2 gene. Within the clone of pre-B cells a second translocation, t(8; 14), occurs during heavy chain isotype switching that results in the deregulation of the c-myc involved in the translocation.","['Gauwerky, C E', 'Hoxie, J', 'Nowell, P C', 'Croce, C M']","['Gauwerky CE', 'Hoxie J', 'Nowell PC', 'Croce CM']","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1988 May;2(5):431-5.,"['CA 15822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Using fluorescence-activated cell sorter and electron microscopic analysis together with antibody specific for the known p55 chain of the murine IL-2R, no evidence has been obtained to suggest that these cells express detectable numbers of receptors with high affinity for IL-2. However, two different antibodies with specificity for the p55 chain of the IL-2R have been shown to inhibit 5C2 proliferation. An analysis of 125I-IL-2 binding has precluded a cell surface receptor density of greater than 80 molecules per cell. A temperature-dependent, nonspecific uptake of 125I-IL-2 has been described for 5C2. Uptake is saturated at 8.5 nM 125I-IL-2 with equilibrium being established within 60 min. When incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of 400 pM 125I-IL-2, a maximum of approximately 2,000 molecules are internalized within 40 min. Uptake of other iodinated proteins by 5C2 was not observed. This property is unique to 5C2 and not to the control C6VL/1 cell line. Intracellular vesicles have also been found in 5C2 cells by electron microscopy which stain positively with gold-conjugated antibody specific for the p55 chain of the IL-2R. 5C2 appears to exhibit unique IL-2 regulatory characteristics.","[""O'Neill, H C"", 'Jaworowski, A']","[""O'Neill HC"", 'Jaworowski A']","['Department of Experimental Pathology, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Surface Properties', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Jun;2(6):388-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon has been ascribed to their abnormal expression of HLA class II (mainly DR) determinants. Since interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is a potent inducer of the expression of HLA class II (DR and to a lesser extent DQ) antigens, we have sought to determine the extent to which this agent can modulate both the antigenic pattern of normal and leukemic progenitors and their sensitivity to PGE 1. 72-h preincubation of normal and CML bone marrow cells with or without IFN-gamma does not significantly change DR and DQ expression by CFU-GM. Pre-incubation for 72 h with and without IFN-gamma produces the following changes in PGE 1 sensitivity: (1) normal CFU-GM lose some sensitivity to PGE 1. This is only marginally counteracted by the presence of IFN-gamma. (2) CML CFU-GM, preincubated with IFN-gamma regain a significant sensitivity to high concentrations of PGE 1. Our data confirm the expression of DR molecules on normal and leukemic progenitors. They also show that, although incubation with IFN-gamma for 72 h in a liquid culture system does not significantly affect the expression of HLA class II molecules by progenitor cells, it may increase their sensitivity to PGE, particularly in the case of CML CFU-GM. Thus expression of HLA class II antigens and sensitivity to PGE may be dissociated.","['Aglietta, M', 'Piacibello, W', 'Stacchini, A', 'Sanavio, F', 'Infelise, V', 'Resegotti, L', 'Gavosto, F']","['Aglietta M', 'Piacibello W', 'Stacchini A', 'Sanavio F', 'Infelise V', 'Resegotti L', 'Gavosto F']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche ed Oncologia Umana dell'Universita' di Torino, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)']",IM,"['Alprostadil/*pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(88)90044-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(4):299-303. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(88)90044-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reduction of NK-susceptibility after IFN treatment was not due to a general effect of IFN on the stability of the cell membrane because the susceptibility of K562 cells to lysis by antibodies plus C, distilled water, or lysolecithin was unaffected. Binding studies with effector cell preparations enriched for NK cells with large granular lymphocyte morphology revealed no difference in binding to control and IFN-gamma-treated target cells. The sensitivity to soluble NK cytotoxic factors was not affected significantly by the IFN treatment. In contrast, the susceptibility of IFN-treated target cells to the cytotoxic activity of purified cytoplasmic granules from a rat large granular lymphocyte tumor was significantly reduced, indicating that the IFN-induced resistance acted at the level of susceptibility to the lytic mechanism of NK cells. However, IFN-alpha was more effective than IFN-gamma in inducing resistance to the cytoplasmic granules although resulting in only a weak resistance in the cell-mediated cytotoxic assay. IFN-gamma but not IFN-alpha caused a reduction in the frequency of effector cells that had reoriented their Golgi apparatus toward their bound target cell. In addition, IFN-gamma treated K562 cells failed to elicit an influx of Ca2+ into effector cells. Taken together, the results suggest that IFN-gamma in addition to an increased resistance to the lytic molecules released by NK cells can also induce changes in the target cells which prevent the triggering and activation of the effector cell.","['Gronberg, A', 'Ferm, M T', 'Ng, J', 'Reynolds, C W', 'Ortaldo, J R']","['Gronberg A', 'Ferm MT', 'Ng J', 'Reynolds CW', 'Ortaldo JR']","['Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Calcium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Killer Factors, Yeast)', '0 (Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Golgi Apparatus/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Killer Factors, Yeast', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Rats']",1988/06/15 00:00,1988/06/15 00:01,['1988/06/15 00:00'],"['1988/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Jun 15;140(12):4397-402.,,,,,,,,,,,,

None of the remaining eight patients exhibited LAK activity against autologous leukemia cells.

Adriamycin-resistant HL-60 (HL-60/ADR) cells similarly demonstrate this characteristic without prior treatment with TPA. Since protein kinase C (PK-C) is a cellular TPA receptor, we have examined the role of this enzyme in the inherent ability of HL-60/ADR cells to phosphorylate vinculin. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of cell extracts revealed that HL-60/ADR cells contained 2-fold more PK-C than did the parental cell line. All PK-C activity was found in the cytosol of wild type HL-60 cells, whereas 85% of PK-C activity was cytosolic and 15% was membrane-bound in HL-60/ADR cells. After a 2-day treatment with 10 nM TPA, PK-C activity was reduced 80-90% in both cell lines regardless of its intracellular distribution. Immunoblotting of cell extracts from HL-60/ADR cells or HL-60 cells following treatment with TPA revealed increased levels of a 52-kDa species of similar mass to M-kinase. Coincident with these changes after TPA treatment was a reduction in Ca2+ and phospholipid-independent phosphorylation of vinculin in vitro in extracts from HL-60/ADR cells, whereas HL-60 cells exhibited an elevation of this phosphoprotein. The phosphorylation of vinculin in TPA-treated HL-60 cells or untreated HL-60/ADR cells was blocked by antibodies to protein kinase C. These results suggest that it is not the absolute level of protein kinase C but rather the proteolytic activation of PK-C to a Ca2+ and phospholipid-independent form which is associated with the utilization of vinculin as an endogenous substrate.","['Aquino, A', 'Hartman, K D', 'Knode, M C', 'Grant, S', 'Huang, K P', 'Niu, C H', 'Glazer, R I']","['Aquino A', 'Hartman KD', 'Knode MC', 'Grant S', 'Huang KP', 'Niu CH', 'Glazer RI']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Muscle Proteins)', '125361-02-6 (Vinculin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Endopeptidases/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Muscle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neprilysin', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/immunology/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinculin']",1988/06/15 00:00,1988/06/15 00:01,['1988/06/15 00:00'],"['1988/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Jun 15;48(12):3324-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten cases (10%) had undetectable levels of MTAase activity. Of the 10, 5 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 3 had acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and 2 expressed mixed lineage markers as determined by immunophenotyping. A relatively high frequency (38%) of MTAase deficiency was seen in ALL of T-cell origin. Nonmalignant hematopoietic cells from three patients with MTAase-deficient leukemias had readily detectable enzyme activity. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in four of the seven MTAase-deficient cases in which karyotypic analysis was performed. No consistent karyotypic defect was apparent, and only one case displayed changes in chromosome 9, the putative location of the MTAase structural gene. The clinical findings among the enzyme-deficient cases were unremarkable except that all patients were male (P less than .01). Only one patient had ""lymphomatous"" features. We conclude that MTAase deficiency occurs in a wide variety of acute leukemias, that the lack of enzyme activity is specific to the malignant cells, and that an increased incidence occurs in ALL of T-cell origin. Furthermore, no specific gross chromosomal abnormality is associated with the enzyme deficiency. The marked male predominance in patients with MTAase-deficient acute leukemias suggests involvement of the X chromosome in the loss of enzyme activity. The absence of MTAase in some leukemias may be therapeutically exploitable.","['Traweek, S T', 'Riscoe, M K', 'Ferro, A J', 'Braziel, R M', 'Magenis, R E', 'Fitchen, J H']","['Traweek ST', 'Riscoe MK', 'Ferro AJ', 'Braziel RM', 'Magenis RE', 'Fitchen JH']","['Medical Research Service, Portland VA Medical Center, OR 97207.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)""]",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Cytogenetics', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Pentosyltransferases/*deficiency', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*deficiency', 'Sex Factors']",1988/06/01 00:00,1988/06/01 00:01,['1988/06/01 00:00'],"['1988/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77187-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Jun;71(6):1568-73.,['CA37881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to treatment, analysis of in vitro agar culture parameters indicated hyporesponsiveness of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) to inhibition by prostaglandin E and acidic isoferritins and diminished expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens (HLA-DR). Treatment was associated with no change in bone marrow cellularity or in the percentage of Ph cells. However, in vitro cultures of bone marrow cells showed a return to normal levels of both expression of CFU-GM class II antigen and of sensitivity to inhibition by prostaglandin E and acidic isoferritins which predicted and/or confirmed clinical response. Throughout the course of interferon therapy, white blood cell counts (WBC) and the percentage of bone marrow blast cells were maintained at normal levels. Onset of aggressive-phase disease was associated with increased WBC, an increase in bone marrow blast cells, a secondary chromosomal abnormality, loss of CFU-GM sensitivity to inhibition by putative negative growth regulators, and markedly diminished MHC class II antigen expression. Following a bone marrow transplant from a matched sibling, all hematologic parameters studied were found to be normal.

By 7 years after transplant the probabilities of having normal ovarian function were 0.92 after CY alone and 0.24 after CY plus TBI (P less than .0001). Multivariate analysis showed that TBI was the only factor significantly influencing ovarian failure and that both TBI and greater patient age at transplant were significantly associated with a decreased probability of recovering normal ovarian function.

Measured REE at day 0 (29.5 +/- 1.4 kcal/kg/d) was significantly higher (+34 +/- 6%) than theoretical REE. Chemotherapy induced a significant decrease in REE at day 3 (26.2 +/- 1.7 kcal/kg/d; P less than 0.05), but during the cytopenic phase REE was not different significantly from its initial values (D0). A positive energy balance was observed during the whole study after the beginning of PN. In contrast, mean nitrogen balance remained negative always, due to a sharp increase in urinary nitrogen loss during the cytopenic phase. The fact that nutritional support falls short of its goal may explain why no improvement in tumor response to therapy has been described in most studies.","['Lerebours, E', 'Tilly, H', 'Rimbert, A', 'Delarue, J', 'Piguet, H', 'Colin, R']","['Lerebours E', 'Tilly H', 'Rimbert A', 'Delarue J', 'Piguet H', 'Colin R']","['Groupe de Biochimie et de Physiopathologie Digestive et Nutritionnelle, Hopital Charles Nicolle, Rouen, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Dietary Proteins)', 'N762921K75 (Nitrogen)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Dietary Proteins/metabolism', 'Energy Intake', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diet therapy/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Nitrogen/metabolism', '*Nutritional Status', 'Parenteral Nutrition, Total', 'Remission Induction']",1988/06/15 00:00,1988/06/15 00:01,['1988/06/15 00:00'],"['1988/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19880615)61:12<2412::aid-cncr2820611203>3.0.co;2-r [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Jun 15;61(12):2412-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19880615)61:12<2412::aid-cncr2820611203>3.0.co;2-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A humane approach to the management of the critically ill as well as efficient use of limited resources requires careful selection of those patients who are most likely to benefit from intensive care. To delineate more accurately the factors influencing outcome in these patients the records of 60 consecutive admissions to the intensive care unit (37 male, 23 female) with haematological malignancy were reviewed retrospectively. Fifty patients were in acute respiratory failure, most commonly (34 patients) with a combination of pneumonia and septicaemic shock. The severity of the acute illness was assessed by the APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II) score and number of organ systems affected. Thirteen patients survived to leave hospital. The mortality of patients with haematological malignancy was consistently higher than predicted from a large validation study of APACHE II in a mixed population of critically ill patients. Moreover, no patient with an APACHE II score of greater than 26 survived. Mortality among the 22 patients with relapsed malignancy (21 deaths), was significantly higher than among the 35 patients at first presentation (26 deaths). On discharge from the intensive care unit all survivors had responded well to chemotherapy and had normal or raised peripheral white cell counts. They included seven patients who had recovered from leucopenia (white cell count less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l). In contrast, 36 of the 47 patients who died were leucopenic at the time of death. The overall mortality of critically ill patients with haematological malignancy is higher than equivalently ill patients without cancer. The dysfunction of an increasing number of organ systems, an APACHE II score of greater than 30, failure of the malignancy to respond to chemotherapy, and persistent leucopenia all point to a poor outcome.","['Lloyd-Thomas, A R', 'Wright, I', 'Lister, T A', 'Hinds, C J']","['Lloyd-Thomas AR', 'Wright I', 'Lister TA', 'Hinds CJ']","[""St Bartholomew's Hospital, London.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed),British medical journal (Clinical research ed.),8302911,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Critical Care', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality', 'Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",1988/04/09 00:00,1988/04/09 00:01,['1988/04/09 00:00'],"['1988/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.296.6628.1025 [doi]'],ppublish,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed). 1988 Apr 9;296(6628):1025-9. doi: 10.1136/bmj.296.6628.1025.,,PMC2545556,,,,,,,,,,

We have used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to examine binding of proteins to the upstream regulatory region, before and after activation with mitogens. We find two types of binding sites. One resembles an inducible enhancer element, but the protein that recognizes it is found in non-T cells and is unlikely to determine T-cell-specific expression of IL-2. A second site negatively regulates expression in resting T cells. A complex that binds to a DNA fragment containing this site is modified only when IL-2 is expressed, and it lies near a specific inducible DNase hypersensitive region.

The abl oncogene as first identified on the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV). Activation of the viral oncogene is associated, in part, with the truncation of the gene at its 5' end. As in studies with other retroviruses, results with A-MuLV presaged the mechanism of activation by abl in naturally occurring human malignancies. Thus, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is consistently associated with a translocation of a piece of chromosome 9 onto chromosome 22 creating what is known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1). The result of this translocation is the truncation of the 5' end of the cellular abl gene, which is located at the breakpoint of chromosome 9. The function of the abl gene product is poorly understood but is thought to participate in an, as yet, undefined pathway of growth control signals, which originate outside the cell, and traverse through the cell into its nucleus. The loss of the gene product's N-terminal amino acid sequences brought about by the truncation of the 5' portion of the gene is consistent with the hypothesis that the protein's growth-controlling activity is deregulated by the structural alterations which occur in the cancer cells. The abl gene and CML serve as a paradigm of the mechanism of activation of proto-oncogenes by chromosomal alterations. The case of CML and the Ph1 chromosome illustrates the findings we might expect as other chromosomal abnormalities are characterized at the molecular level.","['Rosson, D', 'Reddy, E P']","['Rosson D', 'Reddy EP']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Oncogenes', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl', 'Proto-Oncogenes', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1110(88)90002-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1110(88)90002-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1988 May;195(3):231-43. doi: 10.1016/0165-1110(88)90002-4.,,,,,,,,,,96,,

These data were compared with cell surface marker expression, notably of activation antigens such as 4F2 and interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor. Cells from all patients became 4F2 positive at the end of the 6-day culture period. Freshly drawn cells from 3 out of 5 patients expressed the IL-2 receptor (CD25; Tac antigen) or acquired this marker during culture in vitro and secreted relatively high levels of Id+ Ig in vitro. This correlated with elevated serum Id levels (greater than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml in vitro versus greater than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml in vivo). In the 2 CD25 (Tac)- B-NHL patients serum Id levels were below the detection limit and the amount of Id+ Ig secreted in vitro did not surpass 50 ng/ml. Only the B-NHL cells from a single patient were initially CD25 (Tac) positive and only these cells proliferated in serum-free culture. To test whether IL-2 receptor expression in the 3 CD25 (Tac)+ patients was functional, recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) either alone or in conjunction with BCDF and recombinant IL-4 (rIL-4) was added to the cultures. In 2 out of 3 CD25 (Tac)+ patients rIL-2 was capable of enhancing proliferation or Ig secretion. In addition rIL-2 was found to enhance BCDF-mediated but not rIL-4 mediated responses. The third CD25 (Tac)+ B-NHL population was resistant to any of these lymphokines. Thus, this serum-free culture system may accurately reflect patient serum Id levels.

The close relationship between NK cells and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells has prompted us to investigate whether IFN-gamma pre-treatment also affects the sensitivity of tumor cells to lysis by LAK. We have shown previously that IFN-gamma can induce a significant reduction in the sensitivity of both cultured and fresh (surgically obtained) human tumor cells to lysis by LAK. Herein we show that changes in the sensitivity to LAK lysis of cultured human tumor cells can be induced by as little as 1 to 10 U/ml of IFN-gamma; a dose well within the range that can be achieved in vivo. Protection is induced within hours after treatment with IFN-gamma and is dependent on the continued presence of IFN-gamma. Tumor cells cultured in IFN-gamma for several days remain less sensitive to lysis and do not become refractory to IFN-gamma-mediated protection. In the absence of IFN-gamma, treated tumor cells regain ""normal"" sensitivity to lysis within 48 to 72 h. We have also investigated the mechanisms by which IFN-gamma reduces tumor cell sensitivity to LAK lysis using cold target competition, monolayer depletion, direct binding, and kinetic assays. IFN-gamma pre-treatment does not alter the kinetics of tumor cell lysis by LAK. Our data are most compatible with a model in which IFN-gamma reduces the ability of a subpopulation of tumor cells to induce the LAK effector cell to initiate lysis. These results are closely parallel to observations made on the IFN-mediated protection of targets from NK lysis and support the notion that NK- and LAK-mediated lysis are closely related. These results may have significance in vivo because high levels of IFN-gamma may be present at the tumor site or may be induced after therapeutic immunomodulation.","['de Fries, R U', 'Golub, S H']","['de Fries RU', 'Golub SH']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lectins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*immunology']",1988/05/15 00:00,1988/05/15 00:01,['1988/05/15 00:00'],"['1988/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 May 15;140(10):3686-93.,"['CA09120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34442/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, other causes of hypoplastic anemia occur in children, and some of these are similar to what is seen in adult RBC aplasia. For example, it has been reported that a 5-year-old girl with an aregenerative anemia had a thymoma and later developed pancytopenia. RBC aplasia also has been seen in children receiving anticonvulsant drug therapy, children recovering from severe protein malnutrition, children with hepatitis, and in children with leukemia during maintenance therapy. In addition, it is not uncommon for pediatric hematologists to observe children with RBC aplasia where there is no obvious diagnosis, although many are considered to be variants of Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Several important questions about RBC hypoplastic anemias in children need to be resolved; it is hoped that this will be accomplished in the next decade. Do RBC hypoplastic crises associated with hemolytic anemia occur with viral infections other than HPV? What is the cellular pathophysiology in DBA and TEC? Does the apparent heterogeneity of these disorders reflect limitations of laboratory techniques or are we looking at several different diseases? Is acute leukemia a real complication of Diamond-Blackfan anemia? Is TEC a completely benign entity or will we see other long-term problems in these children? Is the incidence of TEC actually increasing? Will TEC-like problems be seen in other aged children? As a case in point, we recently observed a 16-year-old girl who presented with pure RBC aplasia that required RBC transfusion support for 5 months; she also received prednisone therapy. After 7 months, however, this young lady had a spontaneous remission, and now 4 years later she is normal and free of any hematologic abnormalities. This was a most unusual event in our experience and, in view of the apparent increasing incidence of TEC in young children, we queried whether we were observing an adolescent equivalent of this disorder. During the next several years the answer to this and the other questions posed herein should be available.","['Glader, B E']",['Glader BE'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Blood Transfusion', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Prognosis', '*Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/congenital/diagnosis/etiology/therapy']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1987 Sep;1(3):431-47.,,,,,,,,,,97,,

The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of calcium ions in the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cells. Incubation of the HL-60 cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-7) M) for 4 days caused a significant inhibition of 50% of cell growth. The number of differentiated cells increased simultaneously from 24 x 10(3) +/- 2 x 10(3) in the controls to 658 x 10(3) +/- 32 x 10(3) in the 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-7) M)-treated cells. The role of calcium ions in the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cells was first studied by changing the available calcium in the medium and by measuring the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on intracellular Ca2+ levels. Limitation of the available Ca2+ by means of ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) or verapamil enhanced the inhibitory effect on proliferation and decreased the number of differentiated cells obtained by 1,25(OH)2D3 alone. These effects could be abolished by restoring the Ca2+ levels. The role of the intracellular free Ca2+ ions in the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 was further illustrated by measuring the intracellular Ca2+ levels. The intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-7) M)-treated HL-60 cells rose significantly from 117.0 +/- 6.3 nM in the untreated HL-60 cells to 145.0 +/- 7.5 nM in the treated cells (p less than 0.02). Addition of verapamil moderated the increase in intracellular free Ca2+ (125.0 +/- 5.2 nM) obtained by 1,25(OH)2D3 alone. Thus the elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ caused by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment may be involved in the effect of the hormone on the HL-60 cells.","['Levy, R', 'Nathan, I', 'Barnea, E', 'Chaimovitz, C', 'Shany, S']","['Levy R', 'Nathan I', 'Barnea E', 'Chaimovitz C', 'Shany S']","['Clinical Biochemistry Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/analysis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosol/analysis/metabolism/physiology', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1988/05/01 00:00,1988/05/01 00:01,['1988/05/01 00:00'],"['1988/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1988 May;16(4):290-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of HYP and DOX on nucleoid sedimentation (increased sedimentation) were similar and correlated with cell viability. No correlation of PARP activity with cell toxicity was evident; the activity of PARP was inhibited by HYP (42 degrees C; 1-3 h) and stimulated by DOX (1-10 microM; 30 min). The HYP-induced inhibition of PARP was actually ameliorated by simultaneous exposure to DOX. Although separate studies have previously suggested that chromatin alterations or the inhibition of PARP might play a role in the effect of HYP, the correlation of nucleoid changes (rather than PARP activity) with cell viability emphasizes the contribution of the former. Furthermore, the results suggest that the nucleoid technique may prove useful in screening potential treatment modalities.","['Daugherty, J P', 'Simpson, T A Jr', 'Mullins, D W Jr']","['Daugherty JP', 'Simpson TA Jr', 'Mullins DW Jr']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1988/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00262775 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1988;21(3):229-32. doi: 10.1007/BF00262775.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preincubation of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester, inhibited the formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine-induced rise in intracellular calcium in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. 4 alpha-Phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, which does not activate protein kinase C, was inactive in this capacity. The use of calcium-free medium suggested that the elevation of intracellular calcium by formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine consisted of rapid intracellular release followed by calcium influx. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10(-7) M) inhibited both components of the elevation of intracellular calcium, whereas 10(-8) M phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibited only the calcium influx. The influx of calcium was not prevented by verapamil, which blocks the voltage-dependent calcium channels. These data suggest that, in differentiated HL-60 cells, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate rapidly inhibits both the intracellular release of calcium and calcium influx through non-voltage-dependent calcium channels in response to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine.","['Thompson, M', 'Hughes, L', 'Hickman, J']","['Thompson M', 'Hughes L', 'Hickman J']","['Cancer Research Campaign Experimental Chemotherapy Group, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1988/05/15 00:00,1988/05/15 00:01,['1988/05/15 00:00'],"['1988/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 May 15;48(10):2707-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,

When grown in the absence of the inhibitor, these cells possessed very high ornithine decarboxylase levels. These represented about 1 part in 300 of the soluble protein, which is several hundred times greater than the maximal value found in the original L1210 cells. The resistant cells contained at least 100-fold higher levels of ODC mRNA but the half-life of ODC (about 45 min) was not altered significantly. The resistant cells had much higher putrescine and cadaverine levels than control cells, but there was no significant difference in cellular spermidine or spermine content or in production of 5'-methylthioadenosine, which is a measure of polyamine synthesis. Addition of putrescine to the control or resistant cells had no effect on their content of spermidine and spermine but addition of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine increased the content of spermidine and spermine. These results indicate that ornithine decarboxylase is not the rate-limiting step in polyamine synthesis in these L1210 cells. The growth of the alpha-difluoromethylornithine-resistant L1210 cells was inhibited when their ability to synthesize spermidine and spermine was blocked by the addition of the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase inhibitor, 5'-deoxy-5'-[N-methyl-N-(3-hydrazinopropyl)]aminoadenosine. Treatment with this compound produced a reduction of more than 85% in the production of 5'-methylthioadenosine and led to a large increase in the content of putrescine and a substantial decline in the content of spermidine and spermine.

These cells have previously been shown to express an IL-2 receptor on the cell membrane. The sera of 26 patients with hairy cell leukemia were examined for the presence of a soluble IL-2 receptor before and during therapy with either recombinant interferon alpha-2a or 2'-deoxycoformycin. Before therapy, all patients had markedly elevated levels of this soluble IL-2 receptor ranging from five to 60 times the highest level observed in normal control sera. In individual patients changes in the level during therapy correlated well with clinical assessments of tumor response; levels fell to near the normal range in patients responding to therapy.

Lymph node biopsies were also performed and used as a source of neoplastic cells for two of these patients. Using sensitive ELISA systems to determine unstimulated immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion of these tissue-derived populations in culture, a discrepancy between the nature of the secreted Ig products was found. Peripheral blood and lymph node-derived populations from each patient secreted both whole molecules of Ig and a large molar excess of Ig light chains (free LC), whereas all bone marrow-derived population secreted only free LC. The isotypic expression of intrinsic, cell-surface immunoglobulin (sIg), determined using immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, was, however, indistinguishable between different tissue-derived populations for any one patient. The absolute amounts of LC secretion were not markedly different between the tissue-derived populations (blood = 5.3 +/- 1.7; marrow = 3.5 +/- 1.3; lymph node = 11.5 ng per 2 X 10(7) cells per h) and thus failure of detection could not account for this discrepancy. Furthermore, the presence of sIgM and sIgD on each tissue-derived population indicated that all were at least capable of synthesizing whole Ig for membrane insertion. These results suggest that the assessment of a B-cell function, Ig secretion, is a valuable technique for determining small differences within neoplastic populations from individual patients. These functional differences may be related to the maturity of different cells within clonal populations.","['Gregg, E', 'Hamblin, T', 'Smith, J', 'Stevenson, F']","['Gregg E', 'Hamblin T', 'Smith J', 'Stevenson F']","['Lymphoma Research Unit, Wessex Regional Immunology Service, Southampton, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/classification/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(88)90071-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1988;12(2):123-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(88)90071-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that rIL-2 had a stimulatory effect on growth of enriched progenitors from the three sources and surprisingly that addition of anti-Tac did not abolish this effect.

These transfectants have allowed differential analysis of the two DR2 beta products in a manner normally prohibited by the concomitant expression seen in B cells. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis of the transfectants defines the more acidic beta chain as the product of the DR2 beta a sequence, and the more basic chain as the product of the DR2 beta b sequence.

In comparison with treatment with either agent alone, the combination of 1.B6 and rIFN-gamma was associated with a dramatic increase in long term survival. No direct effects of rIFN-gamma on tumor cell proliferation, MHC Ag expression, or susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis could be demonstrated to explain the prolongation of survival. However, rIFN-gamma induced a distinct increase in broad-spectrum cytolytic capacity of peritoneal exudate cells and further increased class II MHC expression on peritoneal macrophages. The explanation for enhanced adoptive chemoimmunotherapy after combined short term administration of a CTL clone and rIFN-gamma is uncertain. Potential mechanisms include direct tumor lysis by activated cells, indirect tumor lysis via sensitization to other lymphokines or monokines, improved Ag-specific activation of transferred CTL clones, and/or more effective development of de novo host anti-tumor immunity.","['de Graaf, P W', 'Horak, E', 'Bookman, M A']","['de Graaf PW', 'Horak E', 'Bookman MA']","['Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells/immunology/transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Peritoneal Cavity/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*transplantation']",1988/04/15 00:00,1988/04/15 00:01,['1988/04/15 00:00'],"['1988/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Apr 15;140(8):2853-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that the beta 2 gene encodes the 35-kilodalton (kDa) component of the beta 35/beta 36 subunit of G proteins and that the beta 1 gene encodes the 36-kilodalton component. The in vitro translation product of the beta 2 cDNA co-migrates with the 35-kDa beta subunit (beta 35), while the in vitro product of the beta 1 cDNA co-migrates with the 36-kDa beta subunit (beta 36) on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. In addition, antisera generated against synthetic beta 2 peptides bind specifically to the beta 35 component of isolated G proteins and to a 35-kDa protein in myeloid cell membranes.

These reagents were used retrospectively to study tumor kinetics and to detect residual disease after chemotherapy. In both cases serum Id values were strikingly high at diagnosis (1.2 mg/mL and 10.8 mg/mL), suggesting that the tumor cells were relatively mature B cells capable of significant antibody production. In both patients the serum Id levels fell with the institution of therapy and confirmed that the patients were in remission. Increasing serum Id predicted relapse four months before conventional methods in patient 1, and Id proved to be a more sensitive measure of tumor burden than Southern blot analysis of rearranged Ig genes in bone marrow samples. Surprisingly, low levels of Id were redetected in the second patient just before completing therapy and have persisted for over a year despite the absence of clinical evidence of recurrent disease. Thus, serum Id levels reflect tumor burden during initial therapy but may not necessarily predict tumor progression after a complete clinical remission.","['Carroll, W L', 'Link, M P', 'Cleary, M L', 'Bologna, S', 'Carswell, C', 'Amylon, M D', 'Smith, S D', 'Levy, R']","['Carroll WL', 'Link MP', 'Cleary ML', 'Bologna S', 'Carswell C', 'Amylon MD', 'Smith SD', 'Levy R']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic', 'B-Lymphocytes/*analysis/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*analysis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/genetics/*immunology', 'Male']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77753-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1988 Apr;71(4):1068-73.,"['CA01059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Histologic variables were correlated with the initial clinical features registered when the biopsies were taken, to determine factors of value in predicting prognosis.

Patients classified according to these types had significantly different median survival times: 53, 26 and 28 months, respectively.

The results are discussed in relation to the various growth patterns and their significance previously reported in the literature. In addition, the quantity of lymphoid cell burden in the bone marrow served as a useful criterion for histologic staging of CLL, thus supplementing any clinical staging system in use.

To assess glucuronidation changes in vivo, male F344 rats, 2.5, 16, and 26 months of age, were administered 5 mg [14C]-TBBC/kg (10 microCi/kg) iv and urine and feces were collected for 3 days. Bile was also collected for 6 hr from animals of the same age groups after iv doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg [14C]TBBC. Total radioactivity was determined in all samples and the profile of metabolites in bile analyzed by HPLC. Along with a decrease in the older animal's ability to excrete TBBC-derived radioactivity in bile, feces, and urine, there was a decrease in the percentage of the dose eliminated in bile as glucuronide. In vitro, the microsomal glucuronyltransferase activity using TBBC as a substrate decreased in the senescent animals. The hepatic concentration of the cofactor UDPGA also decreased from 2.5 to 28 months of age. The apparent Vmax for the enzyme decreased as a function of age while the apparent Km decreased for the substrate (TBBC) but not for the cofactor (UDPGA) in the 26-month-old rats. These data suggest that with the decrease in the activity of the enzyme as well as a decrease in the available UDPGA, the ability of the senescent rats to conjugate and excrete TBBC may be altered. Thus, the in vitro decline in TBBC glucuronidation is compatible with the decreased excretion of TBBC-derived radioactivity observed in vivo in old rats. When toxicity was evaluated in 2.5-, 16-, and 26-month-old rats exposed to 0.25% TBBC in their diet for 14 days, no age-related change in the toxicity of TBBC was observed. However, there appeared to be an increase in leukemia in the treated senescent rats.","['Borghoff, S J', 'Stefanski, S A', 'Birnbaum, L S']","['Borghoff SJ', 'Stefanski SA', 'Birnbaum LS']","['National Toxicology Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cresols)', '0 (Glucuronates)', '2616-64-0 (Uridine Diphosphate Glucuronic Acid)', ""96-69-5 (4,4'-thiobis(6-tert-butyl-3-cresol))"", 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Bile/metabolism', 'Cresols/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Glucuronates/*metabolism', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Uridine Diphosphate Glucuronic Acid/analysis']",1988/03/15 00:00,1988/03/15 00:01,['1988/03/15 00:00'],"['1988/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0041-008x(88)90185-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1988 Mar 15;92(3):453-66. doi: 10.1016/0041-008x(88)90185-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the basis for this developmental shift away from dependence on enhancer function, we have investigated the relationship between transcriptional activity and methylation status of the immunoglobulin kappa light-chain genes (kappa genes) in mouse cell lines representing different stages of B-cell maturation. Using pre-B-cell lines in which the level of a critical kappa enhancer-binding factor, NF-kappa B, was controlled by the administration or withdrawal of lipopolysaccharide and plasmacytoma lines that either contain or lack this factor, we studied the properties of endogenous kappa genes and of transfected kappa genes which were stably integrated into the genomes of these cells. In the pre-B cells, the exogenous (originally unmethylated) kappa genes, as well as endogenous kappa genes, were fully methylated and persistently dependent on enhancer function, even after more than 30 generations in a transcriptionally active state. In plasmacytoma cells, the endogenous kappa genes were invariably hypomethylated, whereas exogenous kappa genes were hypomethylated only in cells that contain NF-kappa B and are thus permissive for kappa enhancer function. These results indicate that the linkage of hypomethylation to enhancer-dependent activation of kappa transcription occurs after the pre-B-cell stage of development. The change in methylation status, together with associated changes in chromatin structure, may suffice to eliminate or lessen the importance of the enhancer for the maintenance of the transcriptionally active state.","['Kelley, D E', 'Pollok, B A', 'Atchison, M L', 'Perry, R P']","['Kelley DE', 'Pollok BA', 'Atchison ML', 'Perry RP']","['Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Methylation', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.8.2.930-937.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1988 Feb;8(2):930-7. doi: 10.1128/mcb.8.2.930-937.1988.,"['AI-17330-07/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC363225,,,,,,,,,,

Implications for etiology and immunotherapy.,840-52,"Recently the minor B cell subpopulation that expresses the CD5 (Leu-1) antigen has been implicated as a source of IgM autoantibodies. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in humans, represents a malignancy of small B lymphocytes that also express the CD5 antigen. However, little is known concerning the antibody variable region genes (V genes) that are used by these malignant CD5 B cells. We have found that a relatively high frequency of CLL patients have leukemic B cells with surface immunoglobulin (sIg) recognized by 17.109, a murine mAb specific for a kappa light chain associated crossreactive idiotype (CRI) associated with rheumatoid factor and other IgM autoantibodies. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the relative expression of the 17.109-CRI by circulating leukemic B cells was directly proportional to the levels of sIg kappa light chain, indicating that there exists stable idiotype expression in the leukemic population. To examine this at the molecular level, the nucleic acid sequences encoding the Ig kappa light chains of two unrelated patients with CLL bearing sIg with the 17.109-CRI were determined. Analyses of multiple independent kappa light chain cDNA clones did not reveal any evidence for sequence heterogeneity in the CLL cell population. Furthermore, the nucleic acid sequences expressed by the leukemic cells of these two patients were identical or very homologous to a germline V kappa gene isolated from placental DNA, designated Humkv 325, or ""V kappa RF"" because of its association with IgM autoantibodies. This study suggests; (a) that the malignant CD5+ B lymphocytes in CLL use the same V kappa gene that has been highly associated with IgM autoantibodies and (b) that the expression of V genes is stable in CLL, in contrast to other B cell malignancies examined to date. We propose that many CLL cases represent malignancies of autoreactive CD5 B cells that use a restricted set of conserved V genes. This property may render CLL particularly amenable to immunotherapy with antiidiotypic antibodies.","['Kipps, T J', 'Tomhave, E', 'Chen, P P', 'Carson, D A']","['Kipps TJ', 'Tomhave E', 'Chen PP', 'Carson DA']","['Department of Basic and Clinical Research, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Autoantibodies/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.167.3.840 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1988 Mar 1;167(3):840-52. doi: 10.1084/jem.167.3.840.,"['AG-04100-05/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-38475-02/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2188892,,,,,,,,,,

We have now determined the broad impact of continuous, long-term use of oral norfloxacin on aerobic gram-negative bacterial infection and colonization, overall management of presumed and documented infections during marrow aplasia and emergence of clinically significant antibiotic resistant pathogens during intensive antileukemic chemotherapy. Oral norfloxacin prophylaxis administered throughout the course of induced granulocytopenia continues to afford effective protection by suppressing the development of aerobic gram-negative infections, particularly those arising from the gastrointestinal tract, and preventing the acquisition or emergence of multiply resistant pathogens. A long-range effect of norfloxacin on pathogens colonizing the respiratory tract is also detected, with inhibition of acquired drug resistance occurring at that site as well.

When this cDNA was coupled to a yeast expression vector (YEpsec1) and introduced into yeast cells, a molecule with the biological properties characteristic of native LIF was secreted into the growth medium. The amino acid sequence of LIF established it to be a unique molecular entity, distinct from the other known haemopoietic growth factors. Since LIF is encoded by a unique gene, two biochemically separable forms of LIF probably represent post-transcriptional or posttranslational variants of the same gene product. In contrast to several other haemopoietic regulators, the 0.8- to 1-kb LIF mRNA was expressed constitutively in two murine T lymphocyte cell lines examined, and its abundance was not enhanced by stimulation with concanavalin A.

Two L5178Y murine lymphoblastic cell lines resistant to the model quinone antitumor agent, hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard, and one partial-revertant cell line were isolated and characterized. The antitumor activity of hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard has been shown previously to be due to its ability to induce free radical mediated DNA strand breaks. Resistant cells were obtained by growing a cloned L5178Y parental cell line in media containing increasing concentrations of hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard. L5178Y/HBM2 cells were selected from L5178Y cells growing in media containing 0.2 mM drug, while L5178Y/HBM10 cells were selected from cells growing in media containing 1.0 mM drug. The L5178Y/HBMR cells were obtained by growing L5178Y/HBM10 cells in media without hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard. The resistant cell lines, L5178Y/HBM2 and L5178Y/HBM10, were 2.5- and 6-fold less sensitive, respectively, to hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard compared to parental cells, and this was accompanied by a decrease in the formation of DNA single and double strand breaks by this drug. The partial-revertant cell line, L5178Y/HBMR was 2.9-fold less sensitive to hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard compared to parental cells. Drug uptake appeared to be lower in the resistant cells compared to parental cells. The resistant cells had a slightly elevated level of superoxide dismutase activity compared to parental cells, but there was no increase in the mRNA for superoxide dismutase nor any amplification of the gene for this enzyme. Intracellular catalase activities of the L5178Y/HBM2 and L5178Y/HBM10 cells were elevated by 1.25- and 2.6-fold, respectively, and the increased enzyme activity in the L5178Y/HBM10 cells appeared to result from a 3.6-fold increase in mRNA for this enzyme. Glutathione peroxidase activity was slightly elevated in L5178Y/HBM2 cells, but was unchanged in the other resistant cells. The L5178Y/HBM2 and L5178Y/HBM10 cells showed increased concentrations of glutathione and elevated levels of glutathione transferase activity. The resistant cell lines also had DT-diaphorase activity that was 3- and 24-fold higher in L5178Y/HBM2 and L5178Y/HBM10 cells, respectively, compared to sensitive cells. However, cytochrome P-450 reductase activity and the ratio of reduced to oxidized pyridine nucleotides was unchanged in the resistant cell lines. The partial-revertant cell line, L5178Y/HBMR, showed approximately the same level of resistance to hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard as the L5178Y/HBM2 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Begleiter, A', 'Leith, M K', 'McClarty, G', 'Beenken, S', 'Goldenberg, G J', 'Wright, J A']","['Begleiter A', 'Leith MK', 'McClarty G', 'Beenken S', 'Goldenberg GJ', 'Wright JA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '2158-76-1 (2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-1,4-benzoquinone)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.6.2.- (Cytochrome Reductases)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.99.- (Quinone Reductases)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Benzoquinones', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochrome Reductases/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'NAD/metabolism', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Quinone Reductases/metabolism', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism']",1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1988 Apr 1;48(7):1727-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both cases a plasma inhibitor to von Willebrand factor (vWf) was suspected and characterized after plasma gel filtration. The inhibitor was shown to be entirely complexed with vWf and was only demonstrated after complex dissociation by heating. The inhibitor was able to inhibit the binding of 125I-vWf to platelets in the presence of ristocetin in both cases and to thrombin-stimulated platelets in one case. In the two patients, the highest molecular weight multimers (HMWM) of vWf were absent when assessed by sodium dodecyl-sulphate agarose plasma electrophoresis. Intravenous infusion of 1-deamino-(8-D-arginine) vasopressin (DDAVP) resulted in the appearance of the HMWM in both cases and of the satellite bands of each multimer subunit which were lacking prior to the infusion in one patient. After transfusion of a VIII/vWf concentrate containing a significant amount of HMWM, there was a rapid plasma clearance of the vWf-related activities and of the HMWM when compared to that seen in a patient with type III constitutional vWD. We conclude that in the two patients studied the coagulation defect was related to the presence of a circulating inhibitor to vWf which could be responsible for the disappearance of the HMWM from plasma.","['Goudemand, J', 'Samor, B', 'Caron, C', 'Jude, B', 'Gosset, D', 'Mazurier, C']","['Goudemand J', 'Samor B', 'Caron C', 'Jude B', 'Gosset D', 'Mazurier C']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)', 'ENR1LLB0FP (Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Deamino Arginine Vasopressin/pharmacology', 'Factor VIII/administration & dosage/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'von Willebrand Diseases/*blood/drug therapy', 'von Willebrand Factor/administration & dosage/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb06194.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1988 Feb;68(2):227-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1988.tb06194.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor necrosis factor rapidly and effectively reduced c-myc mRNA levels. In contrast, interferon gamma did not affect c-myc mRNA levels, nor did it show synergy with tumor necrosis factor in reducing c-myc. Transcription run-on studies confirmed that tumor necrosis factor caused interruption of c-myc transcription after exon 1. Phorbol diesters also caused interruption of transcription of c-myc.

This induction was strongly inhibited by pretreatment of the skin with 13-cis-retinoic acid.

In contrast, tumors were found in only one mouse each in the groups treated with DMBA alone or okadaic acid alone. An average of 2.6 tumors per mouse was found in week 30 in the group treated with DMBA and okadaic acid.

B-CLL cells could become responsive with the inclusion of the phorbol ester TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) as co-stimulant such that half of the populations were now activated by IL4, particularly when BCGF was also present. Populations refractory to IL4 were, nonetheless, still responsive to BCGF. In only three cases was a significant effect seen with IL2. gamma-interferon could be either inhibitory or stimulatory and, in a few cases, modulated specifically the effects of IL4.

BSF2 was stimulatory in the two cases examined while both IL1 and IL5 were ineffective where studied. No simple correlation was observed between the patterns of responsiveness and the expression of a panel of CD markers assayed on cells both freshly isolated and after TPA stimulation.

These observations suggest that the IL-2R on FDC-P1-IL3 cells plays an important role in modulating the growth of this leukemia in sites that contain high levels of IL-2.","['Ceredig, R', 'Robins, T', 'Campbell, H D', 'Young, I G', 'Hapel, A J']","['Ceredig R', 'Robins T', 'Campbell HD', 'Young IG', 'Hapel AJ']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genes', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Transfection']",1988/04/06 00:00,1988/04/06 00:01,['1988/04/06 00:00'],"['1988/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/80.3.165 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1988 Apr 6;80(3):165-70. doi: 10.1093/jnci/80.3.165.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The estimated number of radioiodinated rIL-2 molecules bound per blast ranged from undetectable to 1948. In colony assays, 72% of 32 cases analyzed showed a significant proliferative response to rIL-2, which depended on PHA-stimulated lymphocyte conditioned medium activation. Colony stimulation indices correlated with the number of radioiodinated rIL-2 molecules bound per blast but not with expression of CD25/Tac Ag on fresh marrow blasts or primary colony blasts. These findings provide evidence that in T-lineage ALL functional IL-2R proteins are expressed on leukemic progenitor blasts which may be distinct from Tac Ag. We used the mAb 35.1, T101, and G3.7 to test for expression of CD2, CD5, and CD7 on fresh marrow blasts from 126 T-lineage ALL patients. CD2, CD5, and CD7 were expressed in 84%, 93%, and 99% of cases, respectively. Furthermore, colony blasts that represent the early progeny of leukemic progenitor blasts were also CD2+CD5+CD7+. Ricin conjugates of 35.1, T101, and G3.7 mAb were used as Ag-specific cytotoxic probes to test for expression of CD2, CD5, and CD7 at the level of T-lineage leukemic progenitor blasts. Each immunotoxin was able to selectively eliminate greater than 99% of leukemic progenitor blasts, providing unique and direct evidence that these cells co-express CD2, CD5, and CD7. Neither mixtures of anti-CD5 and anti-CD7 nor anti-CD2, anti-CD5, and anti-CD7 immunotoxins were more effective against blast progenitor cells than the individual immunotoxins alone, confirming that CD2, CD5, and CD7 are not expressed on non-overlapping progenitor cell subpopulations.","['Uckun, F M', 'Myers, D E', 'Ledbetter, J A', 'Swaim, S E', 'Gajl-Peczalska, K J', 'Vallera, D A']","['Uckun FM', 'Myers DE', 'Ledbetter JA', 'Swaim SE', 'Gajl-Peczalska KJ', 'Vallera DA']","['Section of Radiobiology, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, MN 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Ricin/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1988/03/15 00:00,1988/03/15 00:01,['1988/03/15 00:00'],"['1988/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Mar 15;140(6):2103-11.,"['P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA-42111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The results demonstrate that both TNF were capable of enhancing the cytostatic and cytolytic activity of murine peritoneal macrophages against Eb lymphoma cells. The potentiation of tumor cytotoxicity became apparent when macrophages from DBA/2 mice were suboptimally activated by either a T cell clone-derived macrophage-activating factor or by IFN-gamma plus LPS. Neither TNF-alpha nor TNF-beta could induce tumor cytotoxicity in IFN-gamma-primed macrophages, indicating that TNF cannot replace LPS as a triggering signal of activation. In LPS-resistant C3H/HeJ macrophages, which were unresponsive to IFN-gamma plus LPS, a supplementation with TNF fully restored activation to tumor cytotoxicity. Furthermore, TNF-alpha potentiated a variety of other functions in low-level activated macrophages such as a lactate production and release of cytotoxic factors. At the same time, TNF-alpha produced a further down-regulation of pinocytosis, tumor cell binding and RNA synthesis observed in activated macrophages. These data demonstrate new activities for both TNF-alpha and TNF-beta as helper factors that facilitate macrophage activation. In particular, the macrophage product TNF-alpha may serve as an autocrine signal to potentiate those macrophage functions that were insufficiently activated by lymphokines.","['Heidenreich, S', 'Weyers, M', 'Gong, J H', 'Sprenger, H', 'Nain, M', 'Gemsa, D']","['Heidenreich S', 'Weyers M', 'Gong JH', 'Sprenger H', 'Nain M', 'Gemsa D']","['Institute of Immunology, University of Marburg, West Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Lactates)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macrophage-Activating Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Cytotoxins/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Lactates/biosynthesis', 'Lactic Acid', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Macrophage-Activating Factors', 'Macrophages/metabolism/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Pinocytosis/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1988/03/01 00:00,1988/03/01 00:01,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1988 Mar 1;140(5):1511-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their mortality and incidence of cancer were compared with those in 22,326 matched controls selected from the same archives. The risk of mortality in the participants relative to that in the controls was 1.01 for all causes and 0.96 for all neoplasms. Thirty eight causes of death were examined separately. Significant differences in mortality were found for leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and other injury and poisoning, with higher rates in the participants, and for cancers of the prostate and kidney and chronic bronchitis, with higher rates in the controls. The mortality from leukaemia and multiple myeloma in the participants was slightly greater than would have been expected from national values (standardised mortality ratios of 113 and 111, respectively), but in the controls it was substantially lower (standardised mortality ratios of 32 and 0, respectively). Examination of the rates of leukaemia and multiple myeloma in groups of participants showed very little difference between groups characterised by recorded doses of external radiation or type of test participation and failed to indicate any specific hazard. Evidence obtained from participants who reported themselves voluntarily (or were reported by relatives or friends) suggested that 17% of participants may have been omitted from the main study group but that any resulting bias was small. Most of the differences observed between the participants and controls were interpreted as due to chance, but some may be due to differences in smoking habits. Participation in the test programme did not seem, in itself, to have caused any detectable effect on the participants' expectation of life, apart from possibly causing small risks of developing leukaemia and multiple myeloma.","['Darby, S C', 'Kendall, G M', 'Fell, T P', ""O'Hagan, J A"", 'Muirhead, C R', 'Ennis, J R', 'Ball, A M', 'Dennis, J A', 'Doll, R']","['Darby SC', 'Kendall GM', 'Fell TP', ""O'Hagan JA"", 'Muirhead CR', 'Ennis JR', 'Ball AM', 'Dennis JA', 'Doll R']","['University of Oxford, Gibson Laboratories, Radcliffe Infirmary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed),British medical journal (Clinical research ed.),8302911,,IM,"['Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'United Kingdom']",1988/01/30 00:00,1988/01/30 00:01,['1988/01/30 00:00'],"['1988/01/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/30 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.296.6618.332 [doi]'],ppublish,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed). 1988 Jan 30;296(6618):332-8. doi: 10.1136/bmj.296.6618.332.,,PMC2544834,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro treatment of lymphocytes with cordycepin (10 micrograms/ml), an antiviral substance, lowers the level of SCE in BALB/Mo cells to the same value of BALB/c cells. The drug also reduces the higher sensitivity of BALB/Mo compared to BALB/c lymphocytes to the induction of SCE by mitomycin C (MMC) administered either in vitro (3 x 10(-8), 10(-7) M) or in vivo (0.3, 3 mg/kg). BALB/Mo lymphocytes treated in vivo with a high dose of MMC (10 mg/kg) show reduced susceptibility to the induction of SCE but increased frequencies of chromatid breaks and micronuclei. In this situation, cordycepin increases the level of SCE in BALB/Mo lymphocytes to exactly the level seen in BALB/c cells, but it does not affect the frequency of chromosomal aberrations. Since cordycepin is known to inhibit poly(A) synthesis, thus blocking RNA maturation, it is suggested that M-MuLV proviral integration is not the sole factor responsible for the altered susceptibility of BALB/Mo lymphocytes to SCE induction, but that it is most likely viral gene expression that is needed for this effect to occur. On the contrary, the high susceptibility of BALB/Mo lymphocytes to the induction of chromatid aberrations by a high dose of MMC administered in vivo seems to be independent of viral maturation.","['Majone, F', 'Montaldi, A', 'Saggioro, D', 'Brunetti, R', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L', 'Levis, A G']","['Majone F', 'Montaldi A', 'Saggioro D', 'Brunetti R', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Levis AG']","['Department of Biology, University of Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatids/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Deoxyadenosines/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/*pharmacology', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/*drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/2.4.259 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1987 Jul;2(4):259-62. doi: 10.1093/mutage/2.4.259.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both lines, responses to rat recombinant IL3 are enhanced or induced by growth in rat spleen lymphocyte conditioned medium. Growth stimulation by murine and rat IL3, by rat lymphokine(s), and by ATP in ATP-responsive cells is closely associated with the rapid (2-4 min) phosphorylation of a 33-kDa protein (p33) in all the cells examined. p33 phosphorylation is not stimulated by another lymphokine, IL4, nor by TPA or calcium ionophore alone, which are unable to stimulate growth by themselves, and is independent of serum. p33 phosphorylation is inhibited by trifluoperazine, an inhibitor of calcium-calmodulin, but is less sensitive to inhibition by H7, an inhibitor of protein kinase c, in AC2 cells. A spontaneous IL3-independent clone of AC2 (AC-) has been isolated. AC- cells are aggressively leukemic, do not produce detectable IL3, but phosphorylate p33 constitutively where it is associated with a particulate cell fraction. It is suggested that p33 is a common intermediate molecule involved in signal transduction by the various ligands which result in growth stimulation and that its constitutive phosphorylation may play a key role in the maintenance of the leukemic state.","['Garland, J M']",['Garland JM'],"['Department of Cell and Structural Biology, Manchester Medical School, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Concanavalin A', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1988 Feb;2(2):94-102.,,,,,,,,['Leukemia 1988 Aug;2(8):557'],,,,

The ladder of reagents from the solid phase up consisted of: (1) recombinant DNA-derived, purified IL-2R, (2) sample-containing soluble IL-2R and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated monoclonal antibody, 7G7/B6, directed against the IL-2R, (3) alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-FITC, and (4) substrate. This ELISA was compared with a 'sandwich' ELISA for soluble IL-2R. The competitive ELISA was less sensitive than the 'sandwich' assay, being capable of measuring 5000 versus 31 U/ml, respectively. While both anti-Tac and 7G7/B6 in the IL-2R-containing sample inhibited the 'sandwich' assay, only 7G7/B6 inhibited the competition assay. Anti-mouse immunoglobulin enhanced the 'sandwich' assay and inhibited the competitive assay; both effects could be overcome by the addition of normal mouse immunoglobulin in the sample buffer. Studies of a patient's serum receiving anti-Tac as therapy for the adult T cell leukemia demonstrated that rises in the level of IL-2R occurring with anti-Tac therapy, as measured with the competition assay, were masked in the 'sandwich' assay. This competition ELISA will be useful for measuring soluble IL-2R levels in patients receiving anti-Tac as therapy for various immunologic disorders.","['Goldstein, A M', 'Marcon, L', 'Cullen, B R', 'Nelson, D L']","['Goldstein AM', 'Marcon L', 'Cullen BR', 'Nelson DL']","['Immunophysiology Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Solubility']",1988/02/24 00:00,1988/02/24 00:01,['1988/02/24 00:00'],"['1988/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(88)90015-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(88)90015-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1988 Feb 24;107(1):103-9. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(88)90015-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies using a cell-free system and a cell line with an amplified ornithine decarboxylase gene.,3528-33,"The translational control of ornithine decarboxylase (ODCase) by polyamines has been studied using a cellular as well as a cell-free system. A mutant L1210 cell line, in which ODCase represents 4-5% of all soluble protein synthesized, was isolated by stepwise selection for resistance to the ODCase inhibitor 2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). The exceptionally high expression of ODCase in these cells was due to amplification of the ODCase gene. When the cells were grown in the absence of DFMO, dramatic increases in cellular putrescine and spermidine levels occurred. These increases were accompanied by a rapid decrease in ODCase synthesis. The change in ODCase synthesis was not associated with an alteration in the amount of ODCase mRNA, demonstrating a translational control in these cells. The effects of polyamines on ODCase mRNA translation were also studied in rabbit reticulocyte lysates using mRNA isolated from the DFMO-resistant cells. Low concentrations of spermidine stimulated synthesis of ODCase and that of total protein, when added to gel-filtered lysates. Notably, optimal stimulation of ODCase synthesis was achieved at a spermidine concentration lower than that required for an optimal rate of total protein synthesis. Higher concentrations of spermidine were inhibitory, and their effects of ODCase synthesis were stronger than on protein synthesis in general, resulting in a decrease in the fraction of protein synthesis accounted for by ODCase. The present results demonstrate that at least part of the feedback regulation of ODCase exerted by the polyamines is due to direct inhibition of ODCase mRNA translation.","['Persson, L', 'Holm, I', 'Heby, O']","['Persson L', 'Holm I', 'Heby O']","['Department of Physiology, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Polyamines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell-Free System', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Gene Amplification', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*genetics', 'Polyamines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism', 'Spermidine/metabolism/pharmacology']",1988/03/05 00:00,1988/03/05 00:01,['1988/03/05 00:00'],"['1988/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1988/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)69102-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1988 Mar 5;263(7):3528-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although they are not among the most common cancers, the lymphomas have engendered a great deal of interest among researchers because of their interesting biology and responsiveness to therapy. The non-Hodgkin's lymphomas include at least ten major subtypes of diseases with different morphologic characteristics and clinical behavior. Based upon survival characteristics, it is convenient to divide the lymphomas into three broad categories, low grade, intermediate grade, and high grade. The low grade lymphomas usually arise in middle age or older individuals (median age, 55 years). They are derived from B cells and often have a follicular architectural pattern. They usually present with advanced stages of disease, often by virtue of bone marrow involvement. Nevertheless, patients are usually asymptomatic and may even have spontaneous regressions of disease. These lymphomas are responsive to a broad range of therapies including irradiation, single agent or multi-agent chemotherapy, or combined modality therapy. They are also affected by treatment with biologicals such as alpha interferon and monoclonal antibodies. Unfortunately, response to any of these therapies is often transient and relapse is common. The intermediate grade lymphomas include the common large cell lymphomas (follicular or diffuse) and diffuse mixed cell lymphoma. The lymphomas, together with the high grade immunoblastic lymphoma, are often grouped together for the development of management strategies. These lymphomas may be derived from B cells or T cells. They occur over a broader age range than the low grade lymphomas and they are much more aggressive in their natural behavior. Effective treatment programs have been developed for both limited and advanced clinical stages of disease. In limited disease, moderately intensive chemotherapy is often combined with involved field irradiation. In advanced stage disease, more aggressive combination chemotherapy programs are usually employed. From 40% to 80% of patients may be cured with these approaches, depending upon the initial extent of disease. Two types of high grade lymphoma-lymphoblastic and small noncleaved cell are particularly aggressive in their behavior. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a T cell lymphoma that often arises in adolescent males and presents with a large mediastinal mass, marrow, and CNS involvement. It closely resembles acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and similarly intensive chemotherapy programs as are utilized in ALL may be successful in its management.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hoppe, R T']",['Hoppe RT'],"['Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Stanford University, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Probl Cancer,Current problems in cancer,7702986,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mycosis Fungoides/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy, High-Energy', 'Skin Neoplasms/therapy']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0147-0272(87)90012-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0147-0272(87)80006-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Probl Cancer. 1987 Nov-Dec;11(6):363-447. doi: 10.1016/s0147-0272(87)80006-5.,['CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,191,,

Some of them precede or predispose to the subsequent development of an acute myeloid leukemia. A correct analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears permits to classify MDS and to establish some prognostic features. Some syndromes are easily recognizable such as acquired idiopathic sideroblastic anemia, refractory anemia with excess of blasts, pure refractory cytopenia and acute myelodysplasia with myelofibrosis. Nevertheless this classification does not cover all these syndromes. Some of them with borderline features will be discussed separately.

In a phase III study in which MTZ was given in a similar schedule combined with a 7-day infusion of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C; 100 mg/m2/day), 68% of patients were rendered leukaemia-free. In studies from other centres, similar very encouraging results have been obtained where MTZ has been combined with high-dose Ara-C or VP16/213.","['Prentice, H G']",['Prentice HG'],"['Academic Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, and School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000205918 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1987;78 Suppl 1:136-8. doi: 10.1159/000205918.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have analyzed the composition of that pool in the sensitive erythroleukemia mitochondria (EM) and compared it with that of the resistant chloroma mitochondria (CM). We have also tested the effect of every major component in each pool on the sensitivity to CAP. The study of endogenous amino acid composition of EM and CM was performed with a JEOL 5AH amino acid analyzer, and the sensitivity to the drug was assayed by determining its interaction with the mitochondrial protein synthesis activity. Analysis of the total endogenous pool showed about 20% more amino acids in CM compared to EM. However, some amino acids were present in significantly higher (e.g. glycine, serine and histidine) or lower (e.g. proline, leucine, arginine, glutamic acid and threonine) quantity within EM. When compensating for each low amino acid in either CM or EM by addition of that particular acid to the incubation medium, only glycine and serine had a significant effect. Thus, the addition of glycine or serine enhanced the sensitivity to CAP from 14 to 49-52% in CM, but were without effect in EM. Addition of the other acids to either mitochondria gave little or no effect. Since serine could be interconvertible intramitochondrially to glycine, and because the latter with succinate are the first reactants in heme biosynthesis which is initiated inside the mitochondria, it would appear that erythroid cell sensitivity to CAP is predetermined by the mitochondrial glycine-serine pool and might be somehow related to the pathway of heme biosynthesis in these cells.","['Abou-Khalil, S', 'Abou-Khalil, W H', 'Whitney, P L', 'Yunis, A A']","['Abou-Khalil S', 'Abou-Khalil WH', 'Whitney PL', 'Yunis AA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Miami School of Medicine, Fla.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Pharmacology,Pharmacology,0152016,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '66974FR9Q1 (Chloramphenicol)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloramphenicol/*pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Glycine/*physiology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Serine/*physiology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000138355 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacology. 1987;35(6):308-16. doi: 10.1159/000138355.,['AM 26218/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

This region is protected against protease digestion in the rat IgE complex with the receptor of rat basophilic leukaemia cells. Here we report the mapping of the mast cell receptor binding site on human IgE to a sequence of 76 amino acids at the C epsilon 2/C epsilon 3 junction. Recombinant peptides containing this sequence inhibit passive sensitization of skin mast cells in vivo and sensitize mast cells to degranulation by anti-IgE in vitro almost as efficiently as a myeloma IgE. Fragments containing the separate domains are inactive. Additional sequences are required for rapid assembly of fragments into disulphide-linked dimers, suggesting that a single chain can form the active site. In a three-dimensional model of the human Fc epsilon, the two identical segments are far apart. Each folds to generate a cleft between the C epsilon 2 and C epsilon 3 domains on the surface of the Fc epsilon. The docking of IgE on to mast cells could take place within this cleft.","['Helm, B', 'Marsh, P', 'Vercelli, D', 'Padlan, E', 'Gould, H', 'Geha, R']","['Helm B', 'Marsh P', 'Vercelli D', 'Padlan E', 'Gould H', 'Geha R']","[""Department of Biophysics, King's College, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin epsilon-Chains)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anaphylaxis/prevention & control', 'Binding Sites', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin epsilon-Chains/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Skin Diseases/prevention & control']",1988/01/14 00:00,1988/01/14 00:01,['1988/01/14 00:00'],"['1988/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/331180a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1988 Jan 14;331(6152):180-3. doi: 10.1038/331180a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blast cells were cultured in suspension in the presence or absence of rIFN-gamma (10-10(3) U/ml). While 6 out of 14 cases were unresponsive to rIFN-gamma in vitro, the remaining 8 patients showed a significant increase (0.05 greater than p greater than 0.001) in the percentage of cells expressing C3bi receptors, detected by OKM1 (median value in control cell, 9.5; median value in rIFN-gamma-treated cells, 31) and Mo1 (8.5 vs. 36), and in the percentage of cells expressing the monocytic antigens detected by Mo2 (8 vs. 28) and MY4 (6.5 vs. 32.5). In the responsive patients morphologic changes consistent with monocytic maturation, as well as a strong increase of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase activity and of nitroblue tetrazolium reducing capability were observed upon culture with rIFN-gamma.

There was heterogeneity with respect to utilization of the two T gamma constant region genes, T gamma C1 and T gamma C2. In 31 cases (80%) T gamma C1 was deleted and T gamma C2 was rearranged, while in the remaining 8 cases (20%) T gamma C1 was rearranged. T gamma gene rearrangements were found in non-T cells, but were restricted to 6/17 (35%) immature B cell neoplasms. All 24 mature B cell and 14 myeloid neoplasms retained the T gamma germ line pattern. T gamma mRNA was found in all T cells tested. However, the majority (16/17) of T cells most likely do not express a T gamma protein since a T alpha/beta heterodimer detected by reactivity with the MoAb WT31 is present on the cell surface together with T3. These data suggest that T gamma gene rearrangements are universal in T cells and frequent in immature B cell neoplastic populations.

In our experiments, we investigated the influence of bryostatin 1 on the synthesis of interleukin 2 (IL2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by ionophore A23187 or mitogen-induced human blood lymphocytes. These results were then compared with those achieved using the two tumor promotors PMA and teleocidin. Our data indicate that bryostatin 1 is comparable to these two other drugs in increasing production of the two lymphokines 10-100-fold. The IL2 and IFN-gamma production kinetics of cultures induced with either A23187/bryostatin 1 or A23187/PMA were practically identical.

This study focused on the clinical, morphologic, ultrastructural, and immunologic characteristics as well as the DNA in three cases of acute leukemia with the 11;19 translocation. All three patients were infants and showed hyperleukocytosis. The morphologic feature was French-American-British (FAB)-L2 in two patients, in one of which a few monocytoid blasts were also seen by electron microscopy. Cells from the third patient underwent morphologic changes from FAB-L2 at the time of diagnosis to M5b at relapse. Immunologic marker studies revealed that the blast cells from all three patients expressed Ia and B4, but none expressed B1, CALLA(J5), T antigens, or SIg. Cells from one patient simultaneously expressed myeloid antigen (MCS-II) both at diagnosis and relapse. Cells from two patients expressed myeloid antigen after being cultured for a short time in vitro. An analysis of immunoglobulin genes and T-cell receptor genes revealed rearrangements of the heavy chain genes and germ line configurations of the kappa and lambda light chain genes, and of the T-cell receptor beta chain genes. These findings suggest that acute leukemia with the 11;19 translocation has mixed lineage characteristics as a result of leukemogenesis in a stem cell with the potential for both lymphoid and myeloid, especially monocytic, differentiation.","['Hayashi, Y', 'Kobayashi, Y', 'Hirai, H', 'Hanada, R', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Abe, T', 'Sugita, K', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Suetake, N', 'Hoshino, H']","['Hayashi Y', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Hirai H', 'Hanada R', 'Yamamoto K', 'Abe T', 'Sugita K', 'Nakazawa S', 'Suetake N', 'Hoshino H', 'et al.']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/ultrastructure', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1988/02/15 00:00,1988/02/15 00:01,['1988/02/15 00:00'],"['1988/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19880215)61:4<712::aid-cncr2820610414>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1988 Feb 15;61(4):712-20. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19880215)61:4<712::aid-cncr2820610414>3.0.co;2-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty four (group II) had had one or more relapses, some of whom, who had isolated extramedullary relapses, also have a good chance of cure.

Eight had additional prophylactic cranial radiotherapy after bone marrow relapse, and six had total body irradiation before bone marrow transplantation. The incidence of clinically important growth and endocrine morbidity was 20% in group I and 68% in group II. The morbidity in patients in group I was mainly attributable to early pubertal maturation. In group II 30 patients had growth failure, of whom 19 had gonadal failure from testicular or total body irradiation, 14 had growth hormone deficiency after doses of cranial irradiation of over 2400 cGy, and 10 had spinal growth impairment after craniospinal irradiation. Two also had early pubertal maturation. Five out of six patients who received total body irradiation had multiple endocrine deficiency.

However, analysis of the genomic DNA with the isoschizomeric restriction enzymes HpaII and MspI revealed that the ODC sequences in the overproducer cells were hypomethylated in comparison with the parental cells. The natural polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) were almost totally replaced by cadaverine and aminopropylcadaverine. Omission of cadaverine from the culture medium, but leaving 10 mM-DFMO, resulted in an about 10-fold ODC gene amplification within a few weeks. The accumulation of ODC mRNA was enhanced by the same factor. Concomitantly, the content of the natural polyamines was almost normalized, representing about 65% of that found in the parental cells. The present results suggest that, under a given selection pressure, an overproduction of the target gene product may be primarily based on an enhanced transcriptional activity, possibly associated with hypomethylation and, if not sufficient, a secondary amplification of the active gene occurs.","['Alhonen-Hongisto, L', 'Hirvonen, A', 'Sinervirta, R', 'Janne, J']","['Alhonen-Hongisto L', 'Hirvonen A', 'Sinervirta R', 'Janne J']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'L90BEN6OLL (Cadaverine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cadaverine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Diamines/*pharmacology', 'Eflornithine/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Gene Amplification/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*genetics', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2470651 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1987 Nov 1;247(3):651-5. doi: 10.1042/bj2470651.,['CA37695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1148461,,,,,,,,,,

The analogous H-2Kb.t-PA construct was not inducible under the same conditions. Interestingly, uninduced MEL cells increased beta.t-PA expression to the same extent as induced MEL cells. Chemiosmotic permeabilization of the beta-globin tester cell line and exposure to nuclear extracts were used to assay for trans-acting factors capable of stimulating beta.t-PA expression. Such factors were shown to be present in the nuclei of uninduced MEL cells.","['Wrighton, N', 'Grosveld, F']","['Wrighton N', 'Grosveld F']","['Laboratory of Gene Structure and Expression, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.8.1.130-137.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1988 Jan;8(1):130-7. doi: 10.1128/mcb.8.1.130-137.1988.,,PMC363092,,,,,,,,,,

With the exception of a heat shock protein (IEF14 or hs x 70) and two tropomyosins (IEFs 52x and 55), none of these proteins corresponded to polypeptides (proliferation-sensitive or others) previously identified and catalogued by us. IFN-alpha induced the highest number of polypeptides in lymphoid cells, while the response to IFN-gamma was more pronounced in cultured epithelial and fibroblast cells. Several of the polypeptides induced by IFNs alpha and gamma were synthesized (albeit at different rates) by the control untreated cells, and in some cell types such as normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells many were expressed at high levels. Only IFN-alpha-induced a unique set of proteins (alpha 1, 51 kDa; alpha 2, 15 kDa; alpha 19, 78 kDa; and gamma 10, 83 kDa) in all cultured cell types studied, implying that response to this IFN involves a shared biochemical pathway(s). Both IFN-alpha (also IFN-alpha 2b) and beta induced an identical group of proteins in AMA cells in agreement with the fact that type I IFNs share common receptors. IFNs alpha and gamma induced a few common polypeptides, but only gamma 10 (83 kDa) showed increased synthesis in all cell types exposed to either of these IFNs. A total of 28 major cellular polypeptides were down-regulated by IFNs in the various cell type studied. Different sets of proteins were affected, however, in each system, emphasizing the complexity of the mechanisms underlying the action of these factors. Treatment of synchronized G1 AMA cells with IFNs alpha, beta, or gamma (500 IU/ml, final concentration) did not inhibit their progression from G1 to S-phase as determined by indirect immunofluorescence using PCNA autoantibodies specific for cyclin. These observations were in line with the fact that IFNs did not affect dividin or cyclin(PCNA) synthesis (S-phase specific proteins) at least within the first 17 hr after their addition.","['Celis, J E', 'Justesen, J', 'Madsen, P S', 'Lovmand, J', 'Pedersen Ratz, G', 'Celis, A']","['Celis JE', 'Justesen J', 'Madsen PS', 'Lovmand J', 'Pedersen Ratz G', 'Celis A']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, Aarhus University, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Amnion/analysis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Epithelium/analysis', 'Fibroblasts/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/analysis', 'Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Dec;1(12):800-13.,,,,,,,,['Leukemia 1988 Mar;2(3):180'],,,,

However, small concentrations of MuIFN-gamma when combined with small concentrations of either HuIL-1 or MuTNF activated these macrophages to produce cytotoxic effects against L5178Y cells; small concentrations of HuIL-1 and MuTNF in combination had no macrophage activating activity. Specific antibody to MuTNF blocked the macrophage-activating synergistic effects of MuIFN-gamma + HuIL-1, and specific antibody to HuIL-1 blocked the macrophage-activating activity of MuIFN-gamma + MuTNF, indicating that MuTNF was induced in macrophage cultures treated with MuIFN-gamma + HuIL-1, and that murine IL-1 was induced in macrophage cultures treated with MuIFN-gamma + MuTNF. These results indicate that all three cytokines are required for induction of antitumor cytotoxic activation of macrophages. Experiments with a concentration of MuIFN-gamma which alone could activate macrophages revealed that both MuTNF and murine IL-1 were required for this activation.

The stimulation of CTL by subcytotoxic doses of PA may be relevant to its modulatory effect on the immunocellular system.","['Zehavi-Willner, T']",['Zehavi-Willner T'],"['Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', '39424-53-8 (enterotoxin B, staphylococcal)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,"['*ADP Ribose Transferases', 'Animals', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Enterotoxins/pharmacology', 'Exotoxins/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*immunology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', '*Virulence Factors']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/iai.56.1.213-218.1988 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 1988 Jan;56(1):213-8. doi: 10.1128/iai.56.1.213-218.1988.,,PMC259258,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, a peculiar, vaguely nodular pattern of growth called ""pseudonodules"" or ""pseudofollicular proliferation centers,"" which is morphologically distinguishable from ""true"" follicles, is seen in malignant lymphoma, well-differentiated (small) lymphocytic type (WDL). To characterize the cellular components of ""pseudofollicles,"" we undertook a detailed, comparative immunohistologic study of the architectural relationship and distribution of T cells, B cells, and follicular dendritic reticulum cells (DRCs) in reactive follicles, neoplastic follicles, and pseudofollicles. We report several observations on the presence of DRCs and T-cell subset topography in pseudofollicles. Immunohistologic staining for the C3d complement receptor on DRCs revealed that DRC networks associated with ""true"" follicles were present in all cases of reactive follicular hyperplasia (RFH) and malignant lymphoma, nodular, poorly differentiated lymphocytic type (PDL) studied. Surprisingly, DRC networks were also identified in 8 of 23 cases of WDL. Although the size distribution of DRC network diameters was nearly identical in RFH and PDL, the sizes were markedly diminished in WDL. Immunohistologic staining for Leu 3+ and Leu 2+ T-cell subsets confirmed cellular arrangements in RFH and PDL reported by others. In only 2 of 23 cases of WDL could T cells localized to ""pseudofollicles"" in frozen tissue sections be identified in a nonrandom arrangement.","['Ratech, H', 'Sheibani, K', 'Nathwani, B N', 'Rappaport, H']","['Ratech H', 'Sheibani K', 'Nathwani BN', 'Rappaport H']","['James Irvine Center for the Study of Leukemias and Lymphomas, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/pathology', 'Child', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/pathology']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(88)80322-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(88)80322-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1988 Jan;19(1):89-94. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(88)80322-8.,"['CA-09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16434/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['Hum Pathol 1988 Apr;19(4):495'],,,,

Several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of complement in this process: (1) The activity can be abrogated by heat treatment (56 degrees C for 45 min). (2) Using monoclonal antibodies directed against C3a and C3b, the deposition of C3b fragments on the surface of mycoplasma-positive cells can be demonstrated after 1 h incubation with human serum. (3) Ca2+ depletion ablates the ability of serum to remove the activity. (4) C2def' sera are inactive while addition of purified C2 reconstitutes the activity. The latter two findings implicate that activation of the classical pathway of complement is responsible for the effect. Antibody, however, is not required as demonstrated by the uncompromised activity of Ig-deficient sera from bursectomized chicken. Treatment with human serum or rabbit serum was used successfully to permanently cleanse 10/10 tumor cell lines of human and of murine origin. The complete removal of mycoplasma was monitored over at least 8 weeks by direct DNA staining and confirmed by agar culture and transfer of supernatants to mycoplasma-free Vero cells followed by DNA staining.

The prior oral administration of Sudan III [1(p-phenylazo-phenylazo)-2-naphthol] protects animals from the leukaemogenic effects of this compound. Sudan-III-treatment resulted in an increased rate of removal of DMBA from the livers and blood of treated animals and resulted in a reduced level of accumulation of the hydrocarbon in its presumed target tissue, the bone marrow. The regio-selective hepatic metabolism of DMBA was altered in Sudan-III-treated animals, thus only trans-3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxy-DMBA was recovered from the livers of control animals whereas only trans-8,9-dihydro-8,9-dihydroxy-DMBA was recovered from the livers of Sudan-III-treated animals. The distribution of DMBA dihydrodiols in the blood and in the bone marrow was found to reflect the findings in the liver. DMBA, when incubated with rat bone marrow cells in vitro, was metabolized to probable phenolic compounds but no evidence whatsoever was found for dihydrodiol formation in these cells. Taken together these results are consistent with a model in which Sudan-III-induced alterations in the regio-selective hepatic metabolism of DMBA are responsible for the protection against leukaemogenesis afforded by the administration of that compound.

The first ten patients (5 AML, 5 BT CML) received i.v. or p.o. eflornithine 6 g m-2 day-1 and i.v. MGBG 500 mg/m2 once a week. The duration of treatment was 5-37 days (median 15) with one to five MGBG infusions (median 2). The results were complete response (CR) in one patient, partial response (PR) in four, minimal response (MR) in one and failure (F) in four. Pronounced side effects, including severe mucositis, gastrointestinal disturbances and skin infiltration, were observed in eight patients. As the four PRs were achieved in patients with BT CML, it was decided also to study ten patients with this indication. In attempts to decrease the incidence and severity of unwanted effects, lower doses of eflornithine-MGBG were used, i.e., eflornithine 4 g m-2 day-1 and MGBG 200 mg m-2 once a week. The duration of treatment was 9-110 days (median 46), with 2-14 MGBG infusions (median 6). Responses observed were CR in two patients (in one of whom it was only transient), transient PR in two, transient MR in four, and F in two.

Tumor cells grown in vivo coated with this specific Ig no longer bind significant amounts of antibodies against H-2D and H-2K antigens. The membrane-bound Ig reacts with a rabbit antimouse Fab and a rabbit antimouse IgM reagent, but it does not react with a rabbit antimouse IgG or IgA reagent. It binds specifically to tumor cell lines that are sensitive to the ascitic cytotoxic cells but not to resistant tumor cell lines. The membrane-bound Ig can be eluted from tumor cells with 3 M NaSCN or 0.2 M acetic acid. Binding studies indicate that this eluted Ig is not an anti-H-2D/K antibody, yet it immunoprecipitates H-2D/K antigens from NP40 lysates of P815Y cells.

Two pertussis toxin substrates with similar apparent molecular masses of 40 and 41 kDa, respectively, are contained in these preparations, with both proteins being ADP-ribosylated to a similar extent. Partial chymotryptic proteolysis of fractions containing the [32P]ADP-ribosylated 40-kDa GTP-binding protein alpha subunit demonstrated production of 32P-labeled peptides of 28 and 16 kDa which were not observed after partial proteolysis of fractions containing solely the 41-kDa protein. Similarly, mild acid hydrolysis produced an additional 28-kDa fragment only from fractions containing the 40-kDa protein. The results presented here indicate the presence of two distinct pertussis toxin substrates in myeloid cells. The 41-kDa pertussis toxin substrate is likely to represent the alpha subunit of the inhibitory GTP-binding regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase, whereas the 40-kDa substrate may represent the alpha subunit of the GTP-binding protein which is coupled to chemoattractant receptors. In addition to the pertussis toxin substrates, an additional major peak of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate-binding activity closely corresponded to the appearance of a 23-kDa protein.","['Uhing, R J', 'Polakis, P G', 'Snyderman, R']","['Uhing RJ', 'Polakis PG', 'Snyderman R']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['*Adenylate Cyclase Toxin', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*isolation & purification/metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*metabolism']",1987/11/15 00:00,1987/11/15 00:01,['1987/11/15 00:00'],"['1987/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)47765-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Nov 15;262(32):15575-9.,"['P01-CA29589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DE03738/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if LPS also activates these mononuclear phagocytes for tumor cell killing, we compared the cytotoxic activity of macrophages from livers of rats treated with LPS (5 mg/kg, i.v.) with resident Kupffer cells. We found that both macrophage cell types displayed cytotoxicity towards rat N1S1 hepatoma and RBL-1 basophilic leukemia cells. Cytotoxicity of resident and LPS-activated liver macrophages towards these targets increased with cocultivation time, was dependent on the effector:target cell ratio, and appeared to involve extracellular lysis. No direct correlation between macrophage activation and cytotoxicity was observed towards these targets. While liver macrophages from LPS treated rats were more cytotoxic towards N1S1 cells, resident Kupffer cells were more cytotoxic towards RBL-1 cells. In further studies, resident Kupffer cells were also found to display extracellular cytolytic activity towards mouse P815 mastocytoma cells. In contrast, LPS-activated liver macrophage-mediated killing of these targets involved phagocytosis of intact tumor cells, as evidenced by light and electron microscopy and by uptake of 51Cr-labeled cells. These results suggest that cytotoxicity mediated by liver macrophages depends on the type of macrophage and the nature of the tumor cell target. In addition, cytotoxicity towards tumor targets appears to involve at least two different mechanisms including extracellular cytolysis and phagocytosis.","['Gardner, C R', 'Wasserman, A J', 'Laskin, D L']","['Gardner CR', 'Wasserman AJ', 'Laskin DL']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Kupffer Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Liver/*cytology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/immunology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Phagocytosis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology']",1987/12/15 00:00,1987/12/15 00:01,['1987/12/15 00:00'],"['1987/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Dec 15;47(24 Pt 1):6686-91.,"['AI20183/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM34310/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

These children lived in or near Seascale for a period of time while they were attending one or more of three local schools and are an additional group to the 1068 children who were identified as born to mothers resident in Seascale in an accompanying study. Even though some of the schoolchildren apparently remained in the village for a short period only all but 7% were followed up through the National Health Service Central Register. Mortality among these children to 30 June 1986 is comparable to that expected at national rates. From all causes there were 10 observed deaths compared with 12.69 expected--a ratio of 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.45)--and from cancer one observed death compared with 2.04 expected--a ratio of 0.49 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.73). No deaths from leukaemia or lymphoma were reported, but only 0.83 was expected. Since 1971 (the year when cases of cancer were first notified to the NHS Central Register) three non-fatal cases of cancer were reported, including two lymphomas, compared with 2.04 expected and two cases of carcinoma in situ of the cervix compared with 1.79 expected. In addition, there was a case of leukaemia among the schoolchildren which was known previously and had been diagnosed in 1968. There is an interesting difference between the results of this study and the results of the study of children born to mothers who were resident in Seascale. In the latter study there was an excess of leukaemia and of other cancers, but a similar finding is not apparent among children who spent some time at schools in Seascale but were born elsewhere. This raises the question of whether one or more aetiological factors in childhood cancer were acting on a locality specific basis before birth or early in life. This cannot be answered from these cohort studies, but it is hoped that the case-control study that is under way in West Cumbria will provide relevant information.","['Gardner, M J', 'Hall, A J', 'Downes, S', 'Terrell, J D']","['Gardner MJ', 'Hall AJ', 'Downes S', 'Terrell JD']","['MRC Environmental Epidemiology Unit (University of Southampton), Southampton General Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed),British medical journal (Clinical research ed.),8302911,['0 (Radioactive Pollutants)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Radioactive Pollutants/*adverse effects']",1987/10/03 00:00,1987/10/03 00:01,['1987/10/03 00:00'],"['1987/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.295.6602.819 [doi]'],ppublish,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed). 1987 Oct 3;295(6602):819-22. doi: 10.1136/bmj.295.6602.819.,,PMC1247862,,,,,,,,,,

The reconstitution of cells with this potential is of particular importance in recipients of bone marrow that has been depleted of mature T lymphocytes to prevent graft v host disease (GVHD). We examined the recovery of natural killer (NK) cells and interleukin 2 (IL 2)-augmented lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK) in 48 patients at various intervals following transplantation of bone marrow depleted of mature cellular elements by treatment with soybean agglutinin and sheep RBCs (SBA-E- BMT). We found normal levels of both NK and LAK activity as early as 3 weeks following SBA-E- BMT. When compared with cells from controls, NK and LAK precursors from transplant recipients appeared to be activated in vivo in that freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients had an elevated cytolytic activity toward NK-insensitive targets and a more rapid response to activation by IL 2. In patients as well as controls, both LAK precursors and LAK effectors lacked antigens present on mature T lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, or CD8) but expressed antigens present on NK cells (CD2, CD16, and NKH1A). The LAK cells did not lyse either donor or host peripheral blood T cell targets. The activity of NK effectors but not LAK precursors survived the in vivo total body irradiation used for pretransplant conditioning in three patients studied. LAK precursors could be demonstrated as early as 18 days following transplant at a time when the bone marrow contained primarily donor-derived cells. Little or no LAK activity could be generated from cells of the SBA-E- BM graft itself, suggesting that LAK precursors differentiate rapidly from more primitive progenitors in the marrow graft. Thus, our data indicate that the NK and LAK lytic systems are among the earliest activities to recover during immune reconstitution following T cell-depleted BMTs.","['Keever, C A', 'Welte, K', 'Small, T', 'Levick, J', 'Sullivan, M', 'Hauch, M', 'Evans, R L', ""O'Reilly, R J""]","['Keever CA', 'Welte K', 'Small T', 'Levick J', 'Sullivan M', 'Hauch M', 'Evans RL', ""O'Reilly RJ""]","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Soybean Proteins)', '0 (soybean lectin)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Separation', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', '*Plant Lectins', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Rosette Formation', '*Soybean Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84905-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Dec;70(6):1893-903.,"['CA 09149 09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloid-associated MoAbs (particularly MoAbs against the LFA-1 family (CD11, CDw18), MoAbs directed against lactosylceramide (CDw17), anti-glycoprotein (gp) 150 MoAbs MCS 2 and MY 7 (CDw13), anti-gp 67 MoAb MY 9, anti Fc gamma-receptor (mol wt 40 kd) MoAb CIKM5, anti-CR 1 MoAb E 11, and the antiglycolipid MoAb VIM-2) were reactive with basophils, indicating a close relationship to other mature myeloid cells. Under normal conditions, basophils surprisingly express at least three activation-linked structures not detectable on mature neutrophils, ie, the p45 structure defined by MoAbs OKT-10 and VIP-2b, the p24 structure identified by the CD9 MoAb BA-2, and the receptor for interleukin 2 (IL 2) recognized by three different MoAbs (anti-TAC, IL2RI, anti-IL 2). Moreover, under short-term culture conditions basophils both in mononuclear cell (MNC) suspension and as purified fractions display the HLA-DR and T4 antigens. The neutrophilic/eosinophilic structure 3-fucosyl-N-acetyllactosamine is expressed on basophils only after neuraminidase treatment. Basophils were not stained at all by CD 16 MoAbs directed against the Fc gamma-receptor (mol wt 50 to 70 kd) of neutrophils, by the MoAb 63D3 (CDw12) recognizing the monocyte/granulocyte-associated p 200 antigen, and by the CDw 14 antibodies (VIM-13, Mo 2) defining the monocyte-specific structure p 55.

However, spermidine levels of rapidly growing tissues, such as tumors, may under the same conditions be decreased by as much as 60%. Inactivation of polyamine oxidase prevents oxidative splitting of N1-acetylspermidine and N1-acetylspermine and therefore the reutilization of putrescine for de novo polyamine biosynthesis. Prolonged inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase and polyamine oxidase activities leads in all normal tissues studied so far to a decrease of the spermidine concentration by 50% or more, demonstrating the general physiological significance of polyamine reutilization. In this work the role of polyamine reutilization in tumors was studied. Combined treatment with the inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase, alpha-difluoromethylornithine or (2R, 5R)-6-heptyne-2,5-diamine, and N1, N4-bis-allenylputrescine, an inhibitor of polyamine oxidase, produced a more marked depletion of the polyamine contents of L1210 ascitic cells and of Lewis lung carcinoma, than treatment with either compound alone. Concomitantly, the proliferative activity of these tumors decreased significantly below the value that was observed after treatment with an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor alone.

One of the loci corresponds to the complete BCR gene, whereas the others contain a 3' segment of the gene. After HindIII cleavage of human DNA, these four loci are detected as 23-, 19-, 13-, and 9-kilobase-pair fragments, designated BCR4, BCR3, BCR2, and BCR1, respectively, with BCR1 deriving from the original complete BCR gene.

Similarly, in mouse-human hybrids retaining a Ph1 chromosome derived from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia-in the absence of the 9q+ and 22, only BCR2 and BCR4 loci are retained, indicating that the breakpoint in this acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as in chronic myelogenous leukemia, is proximal to the BCR1 3' region, but distal to the IGLC locus and the BCR2 and BCR4 3' loci. Thus, the order of loci on chromosome 22 is centromere----BCR2, BCR4, and IGL----BCR1----BCR3----SIS, possibly eliminating BCR2 and BCR4 loci as candidate targets for juxtaposition to the ABL gene in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia Ph1 chromosome.","['Croce, C M', 'Huebner, K', 'Isobe, M', 'Fainstain, E', 'Lifshitz, B', 'Shtivelman, E', 'Canaani, E']","['Croce CM', 'Huebner K', 'Isobe M', 'Fainstain E', 'Lifshitz B', 'Shtivelman E', 'Canaani E']","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.84.20.7174 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Oct;84(20):7174-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.20.7174.,"['CA-10805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC299252,,,,,,,,,,

After incubation of B cell precursor ALL in vitro for 24 hr, 11 out of 17 leukemic bone marrow aspirates expressed the Tac/CD25 protein (greater than 10% positive blasts). Expression of Tac/CD25 on the leukemic cells was confirmed by two color flow cytometric analysis using anti-Tac/CD25 and anti-CALLA/CD10 monoclonal antibodies. The molecular mass of the B cell precursor ALL Tac/CD25 protein was 55 kilodaltons (kD), identical to that on activated T cells. Binding of radiolabeled IL-2 in two leukemic bone marrow aspirates demonstrated the presence of high affinity IL-2 receptors. Cross-linking of 125I-labeled IL-2 to TPA activated B cell precursor ALL revealed the 55 kD Tac/CD25 protein and an additional protein of 75 kD. Recombinant IL-2 in concentrations of 10-1,000 U/ml had essentially no proliferative effect in 10 patients tested, whereas low molecular weight B cell growth factor (L-BCGF) induced proliferation in 8 of 10 patients. L-BCGF also induced expression of CD20 in 3 of 7 CD20 negative B cell precursor ALL. IL-2 did not induce CD20, but enhanced its expression in the 3 patients who responded to L-BCGF. We conclude that IL-2 has essentially no proliferative effect on B cell precursor ALL, despite the presence of high affinity IL-2 receptors and the presence of the IL-2 binding cell surface molecules similar to those on activated T cells.

The most immature B lineage ALL ('null' ALL) has a much lower frequency of TCR gene rearrangement than the common variant of B cell precursor ALL and also has a high frequency of oligoclonal rearrangements of IgH genes. Non-T leukemic cells with inappropriately rearranged TCR beta gene did not necessarily have a rearranged TCR gamma gene. Inappropriately rearranged IgH or TCR genes are usually not expressed at the mRNA level, and the gene for the TCR associated protein T3 delta is not detectably expressed at the mRNA or protein level in leukemias classified unambiguously as non-T.

These five had diverse patterns of IgH, TCR beta, and TCR gamma rearrangement, and all expressed terminal transferase concomitantly with MY9 (CD33).

These immature blasts were labeled by the FA6-152 monoclonal antibody when studied with the immunogold technique. The blasts exhibited large nucleoli, and their cytoplasm contained numerous ribosomes and large mitochondria. In the Golgi apparatus several granules resembled the theta granules as previously described and contained ferritin molecules in the absence of rhopheocytosis. A large proportion of these blasts exhibited a platelet peroxidase (PPO)-like activity. As the blasts from the two other patients with a more mature phenotype and glycophorin A reactivity lacked this PPO, this enzyme seems to be restricted to the more immature cells. Since in these leukemic samples immature erythroid blasts were admixed to promegakaryoblasts, immunogold labeling was also performed with antiplatelet antibodies. This latter population which was labeled with C17, a monoclonal antibody to platelet glycoprotein IIIa, showed strong PPO activity but lacked theta granules and ferritin. In the normal bone marrow enriched by panning for CFU-E (8%) and depleted in progenitors of other lineages, blast cells showing characteristics similar to leukemic erythroid blasts were seen. They exhibited theta granules and ferritin and a proportion of them also had a PPO-like activity. Thus, a PPO reaction is not restricted to the platelet-megakaryocyte line.

We studied malignant CLL B cells for the presence of IL-2 receptors and responsiveness to IL-2 with respect to proliferation and B cell colony formation. Seven of 25 B-cLL patients studied had reactivity for anti-Tac (mean, 11.8%; range 4-31%). Purified control T cells expressed less than 2% reactivity to anti-Tac. CLL B cell colony forming cells were reactive with anti-Tac in all five patients studied (mean, 24.8%; range, 17-31%). The proliferative response of control and CLL B cells to both a partially purified preparation of IL-2 and recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) was also examined. Control B cells demonstrated a dose-dependent, enhanced proliferative response to IL-2. At lower IL-2 concentrations (2-200 units/ml), rIL-2 appeared to have a more significant proliferative enhancing effect on control B cells than did the partially purified IL-2 preparation. In contrast, no concentration of the IL-2 preparations enhanced CLL B cells' proliferative response. The monoclonal antibody anti-Tac was capable of inhibiting control B cell responsiveness to IL-2, rIL-2 did not support CLL B cell colony formation. Thus, malignant B cell populations may spontaneously express the Tac antigen in the absence of a functional response to IL-2. The significance of this in the treatment of lymphomas is underscored by the development of new therapeutic strategies which would seek to incorporate the use of immunoregulatory lymphokines such as IL-2.","['Perri, R T', 'Kay, N E']","['Perri RT', 'Kay NE']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Feb;1(2):127-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detailed studies of fibrinolysis in DIC are lacking, however. We measured tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and activity levels in 74 patients with DIC, 53 hospitalized patients with similar illnesses without DIC, and 36 healthy normal subjects, using sensitive, specific assays. Mean t-PA antigen levels were significantly higher in patients with DIC than in either hospitalized control subjects or normal individuals in most disease categories studied. Highest t-PA antigen levels were seen in patients with liver disease, but patients with DIC without liver disease also had significantly elevated t-PA antigen. Detectable free t-PA activity was infrequently seen in patients with DIC, however. No correlation was found with either thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications and levels of t-PA antigen or activity in DIC, with the possible exception of increased t-PA activity in two patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Bleeding complications were seen almost exclusively in patients with underlying anatomic lesions, and thrombotic complications were usually associated with other known predisposing factors. We conclude that t-PA antigen is usually elevated in DIC, but free t-PA activity is infrequently seen, most likely because of increased levels of t-PA inhibitor. The presence or absence of free t-PA activity does not appear to predict which patients with DIC will develop hemorrhage or thrombosis.","['Francis, R B Jr', 'Seyfert, U']","['Francis RB Jr', 'Seyfert U']","['Department of Medicine, Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,['EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)'],IM,"['Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*blood/etiology', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Liver Diseases/complications', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Sepsis/complications', 'Thrombosis/etiology', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/*blood']",1987/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0022-2143(87)90443-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1987 Nov;110(5):541-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of PC cultures from tumor-dormant mice, in which tumor cells grew progressively (""in vitro tumor-progressor""), but not PC cultures from normal mice, with exogenous MuIFN-gamma resulted in a marked inhibition of tumor cell growth. The MuIFN-gamma-induced cytotoxic activity was cell-mediated since no soluble tumor-cytotoxic factors could be detected in the cultures. MuIFN-gamma induced cytotoxic activity in plastic-adherent peritoneal cell (AD-PC) cultures, but induced no cytotoxic activity in nonadherent-PC cultures unless small numbers (2%) of AD-PC were present, and inclusion of antibody to MuTNF in these mixed PC cultures blocked the development of cytotoxic activity. Antibody to MuTNF also blocked the development of cytotoxic activity in cultures of MuIFN-gamma-treated whole PC and AD-PC from tumor-dormant mice. These results indicate that MuIFN-gamma and MuTNF are both important in restraining tumor cell growth in PC cultures from tumor-dormant mice, and that MuIFN-gamma requires the presence of MuTNF to induce cytotoxic activity in these cultures.","['Suzuki, Y', 'Liu, C M', 'Chen, L P', 'Ben-Nathan, D', 'Wheelock, E F']","['Suzuki Y', 'Liu CM', 'Chen LP', 'Ben-Nathan D', 'Wheelock EF']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, PA 19102.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Leukemia L5178/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Peritoneal Cavity/pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology/pharmacology']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Nov 1;139(9):3146-52.,['CA32577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The R-1 cells were cultured with or without 2% calf serum for 2 days, and the CM was fractionated with 50% ammonium sulfate and used as the GI factor preparation (termed R1CM). When Mm-A cells were cultured with 5% (v/v) R1CM for 3 days, their growth was inhibited about 80%. This inhibition of Mm-A cell growth by R1CM was irreversible. This GI factor also inhibited the growth of M1 cells that had been pretreated with inducer and had expressed some differentiation-associated properties but still retained a proliferative capacity. In contrast, it scarcely inhibited the growth of untreated M1 cells. The GI factor inhibited the growth of other mouse monomyeloblastic leukemic WEHI-3B D+ cells pretreated with a differentiation inducer, retinoic acid, and mouse monocytic leukemia J774.1 cells. However, it did not affect the growth of human monocytic (U937 and THP-1) or myeloid (KG-1, ML-1, and HL-60) cell lines.

We noticed that IL-2-dependent mouse cells (CTLL-2) are killed within 30 min in the presence of a 1/10 dilution of human serum. However, CTLL-2 cells totally deprived of IL-2 did not begin to die until at least 6 h in culture. Thus, even complete inhibition of IL-2 by human serum could not account for the rapid cytotoxicity caused by human serum. Since humans have 'natural' antibodies which react with mouse cells, it seemed possible that the cytotoxicity was due to antibody/complement-mediated cell lysis. This was supported by the observation that EDTA (at a concentration sufficient to inhibit complement) protected CTLL-2 cells from the cytotoxic effects of human sera from four normal donors. In addition, preincubation of CTLL-2 cells with heat-inactivated human sera at 4 degrees C rendered them much more susceptible to lysis with rabbit complement than cells which were preincubated with complete culture medium. The cytotoxicity of human serum is not limited to IL-2-dependent mouse cells but was also observed with EL4 and Ag8.653 cells as well as normal splenocytes. The cytotoxic effect of human serum was lost upon removal of IgM, but not upon removal of IgG. These results strongly suggest that the inhibition of proliferation of IL-2-dependent mouse cells by human serum is due to antibody/complement-mediated lysis of those cells. In addition, non-heat-inactivated human serum did not inhibit the IL-2-mediated proliferation of human PHA blasts, indicating that there is no inherent inhibitory activity in human serum apart from the cytotoxic effect on xenogeneic cells. Thus the reported IL-2 inhibitory activity of whole human serum is probably not biologically relevant.","['Pruett, S B', 'Lackey, A']","['Pruett SB', 'Lackey A']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Mississippi State University 39762.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (interleukin 2 inhibitor)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphokines/*analysis', 'Mice']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1987 Sep;69(3):624-31.,,PMC1542375,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of the chemically induced DBA/2-derived lymphoma Eb and its highly metastatic variant ESb the immunogenicity of these antigens is not sufficient to prevent tumor growth. Therefore we tested in two systems the influence of additional antigens as possible helper determinants for the generation of tumor-specific immune responses. In the Eb tumor system additional antigens were induced by mutagenization. The frequency of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in response to mutagenized Eb cells was higher than that in response to untreated Eb cells. Fine specificity analysis revealed there there was no increase in the CTL response against the original TATA, but an activation of additional CTL clones responding to mutagen-induced antigens. In the ESb tumor system we tested the effect of additional recognition of minor histocompatibility antigens on the frequency of TATA-specific CTL. Transplantation of ESb tumor cells into B10.D2 mice, which are H-2-identical but differ in minor antigens, results in strong tumor rejection responses. In a limiting dilution mixed-leukocyte-tumor microculture system it was found that the minor antigens are recognized at the clonal level as independent antigens. The overall frequency of anti-tumor CTL in ESb-immunized B10.D2 mice was about 1/3000. Among these, the frequency of TATA-specific CTL was 1/16,709 and thus not significantly different from that of syngeneic DBA/2 mice.

A synergy between these inducers was found with respect to morphological changes and B cell proliferation and differentiation. A23187 used alone did not activate the cells. B-CLL cells treated with the double stimulus acquired a plasmacytoid morphology, showed significantly higher incorporation of 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine, and produced significantly higher amounts of monoclonal immunoglobulin compared with the same cells exposed to either of the inducers alone. These results indicate that phorbol ester and calcium ionophore act synergistically on B-CLL cells to induce proliferation and differentiation. B-PLL cells responded more vigorously to the signals provided by TPA and A23187. Previous studies showed that TPA and A23187 can mimic the two physiological second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate in the transduction of signals leading to cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation in normal B cells.

MMC concentrations were increased in a stepwise fashion beginning at 0.033 microM and ending at 0.34 microM. This produced a 10-fold resistant cell line over the parental line. Resistance simultaneously developed to anthracene and anthracycline DNA intercalators, to vinca alkaloids and epipodophyllotoxins but not to cisplatin, bleomycin, fluorouracil or ionizing X-rays. MMC resistance was reversed using the membrane-active agent verapamil. The level of non-protein sulfhydryls was increased 2-fold in the MMCR cells. Intracellular uptake of unchanged MMC was reduced by 40% in the MMCR cells. Cytogenetic analyses demonstrated no recognizable clonal chromosomal alterations unique to the resistant subline and no evidence of double minutes or homogeneously staining regions in the DNA. Gel renaturation analysis failed to document the presence of an amplified DNA domain. Southern blotting of parental and MMCR DNA using a cDNA probe (CHP1) for the P-glycoprotein gene also failed to demonstrate amplification or rearrangement of P-glycoprotein-related homologous sequences. However, an Mr 180,000 glycoprotein was detected in the plasma membranes from MMCR cells. This protein also specifically reacted with a monoclonal antibody (C219) to the P-glycoprotein of Ling and co-workers [Kartner et al., Nature, Lond. 316, 820 (1985)]. These results suggest a pleiotropic drug resistance pattern in the MMCR cells, associated with membrane glycoprotein alterations, enhanced non-protein sulfhydryl levels, and reduced MMC accumulation. This is a novel observation for a resistant cell line selected with an alkylating agent.","['Dorr, R T', 'Liddil, J D', 'Trent, J M', 'Dalton, W S']","['Dorr RT', 'Liddil JD', 'Trent JM', 'Dalton WS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(87)90620-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(87)90620-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1987 Oct 1;36(19):3115-20. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(87)90620-4.,['CA17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The last episode was treated with cyclosporin-A (CyA) and prednisone. After the patient was on the therapy for 2 weeks, erythropoietic recovery was observed and with continued therapy the hematocrit (Hct) became normal. The PRCA remission was associated with a fall in the blood lymphocyte count, and a reduction in the spleen and lymph node size and bone marrow lymphocyte density. At diagnosis of PRCA the blood T-cells bearing IgG Fc receptors (T gamma cells) were increased, and the marrow contained very few or no late-stage erythroid progenitors. After remission of PRCA the T gamma cell fraction decreased, and the marrow erythroid progenitor's number became normal. We speculate that therapy with CyA and prednisone inhibited the production of interleukins-1 and -2 from monocytes and T-cells, respectively, and was responsible for the reduction of the T gamma cell fraction and B-cell leukemic mass in this patient.

The aim of the present study was to clarify the effect of leukaemia treatment on neuroendocrine control of PRL secretion in long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Pituitary LH, FSH and PRL responses to GnRH and to the dopamine receptor antagonist metoclopramide were evaluated in 18 boys 1.6-9 years after discontinuation of medication for ALL. All the boys had been subjected to prophylactic cranial irradiation and 8 to testicular irradiation. Eight of the boys had supranormal gonadotropin levels either basally or after GnRH. All had normal basal PRL levels, but in 14 of the 18 boys the metoclopramide-releasable PRL levels were subnormal. The decreased PRL responses cannot be explained by the hypergonadotropism, since exaggerated rather than decreased responses are frequently found in patients with primary gonadal failure. We conclude that abnormal regulation of PRL secretion is a frequent consequence of treatment of ALL, probably being due to decreased pituitary lactotrop mass.","['Dunkel, L', 'Hovi, L', 'Siimes, M A']","['Dunkel L', 'Hovi L', 'Siimes MA']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Acta Endocrinol (Copenh),Acta endocrinologica,0370312,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pituitary Hormone-Releasing Hormones)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)', 'L4YEB44I46 (Metoclopramide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/*therapy', 'Luteinizing Hormone/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metoclopramide/*pharmacology', 'Pituitary Hormone-Releasing Hormones/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Prolactin/*metabolism', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1530/acta.0.1160085 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Endocrinol (Copenh). 1987 Sep;116(1):85-9. doi: 10.1530/acta.0.1160085.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary plasma cell leukemia should also be considered when fewer plasma cells are present provided that a clonal proliferation is documented. Most clinical characteristics are similar in both types of plasma cell leukemia. Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are more common in the primary form, and lytic bone lesions are more frequent in the secondary form. Patients with primary plasma cell leukemia may initially respond better to chemotherapy, including single agent drugs commonly used in multiple myeloma. However, resistant disease is expected, and most data suggest a median survival of less than 6 months in both types of leukemia.

To adapt this marker for gene expression studies, a sequence encoding a modified beta-galactosidase and including the simian virus 40 large tumor nuclear location signal (nls-beta-Gal) has been introduced into vectors. In differentiated cells, multipotential cells, and embryos, the constructs led to the expression of an enzymatically active protein. Its location was examined by its beta-galactosidase activity or by using antibodies and electron microscopy. The results show that the nls-beta-Gal protein remains mainly located at the nuclear periphery (probably at the nuclear pores) but does not reach the nucleoplasm. It suggests that an interaction with the nuclear membrane is necessary but not sufficient for protein uptake into the nucleus. In multipotential cells, the expression of nuclear location signal LacZ (nls-LacZ) interferes neither with cell growth nor with differentiation. Using various lacZ constructs, the transcriptional activity of embryos was studied. At the two-cell stage, the promoters of the Rous sarcoma virus, simian virus 40, and the beta-actin gene are functional but the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat is not.

Blood cell suspensions (20 ml) with a hematocrit level of 10% were pumped through Nuclepore filters with a nominal pore diameter of 5 micron at constant flow rates (0.82-6.1 ml/min), and the pressure-time curves were recorded. An initial fast rise (K1) and a later slow rise (K2) of the pressure-time curve were observed; according to earlier studies (Skalak, R., Impelluso, T., Schmalzer, E.A., and Chien, S. (1983), Biorheology 20, 41), K1 reflects the dynamic plugging-unplugging process and K2 the permanent plugging of pores by rigid cells. Changes of the flow rate had no influence on K1 (greater than or equal to 1.6 ml/min) or K2. The addition of small concentrations of mononuclear leukocytes to the red cell suspensions resulted in a dose-dependent increase in K1, but did not affect K2. Admixture of partially hardened red cells (0.03% glutaraldehyde for 30 min) with normal red cells at a constant total hematocrit caused increases of both K1 and K2. From these results we conclude that both white cells and hardened red cells tend to plug narrow channels. White cells, however, may cause less permanent plugging than rigidfied red cells. These results may help to understand microcirculatory disorders seen in sickle cell crisis or leukocytosis and leukemia.","['Reinhart, W H', 'Chien, S']","['Reinhart WH', 'Chien S']","['Department of Physiology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Microvasc Res,Microvascular research,0165035,['T3C89M417N (Glutaral)'],IM,"['Blood Flow Velocity', 'Cell Aggregation', '*Erythrocyte Deformability', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/*physiology', '*Filtration/methods', 'Glutaral/pharmacology', 'Hematocrit', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Microcirculation/*physiology', 'Models, Cardiovascular', 'Pressure', 'Time Factors']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0026-2862(87)90075-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0026-2862(87)90075-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Microvasc Res. 1987 Jul;34(1):1-12. doi: 10.1016/0026-2862(87)90075-6.,"['HL-16851/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-28381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Further evidence of the B-cell origin of cALL was obtained by molecular analyses at the DNA level which demonstrated the presence of an Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement in all 37 cases assessed, while 37.8% showed a light chain gene reorganization. A genomic subclassification of cALL demonstrated that the majority of cases showed an immature molecular configuration with one (8.1%) or both (54.1%) Ig heavy chain alleles rearranged and a germ-line configuration of the light chain genes; 27% revealed a heavy chain gene involvement and one k allele rearranged. Only four cases (10.8%) showed a more mature configuration with both k alleles rearranged or a gamma chain gene involvement.

PMA induced a program of coordinated transcription of all four genes involved in the biosynthesis of Ia molecules. A spontaneous Ia-positive variant pre-B cell line was derived from an Ia-negative parental cell line. This variant was highly sensitive to the toxic effects of PMA, and highly responsive to the Ia-inductive effects of phorbol ester.

Histamine inhibits the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by purified human peripheral T cells activated in the presence of either intact monocytes or metabolically inactive fixed Raji and U698 cells as accessory cells. Purified T cells do not respond more than marginally to staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in the absence of accessory cells. However, activation by the phorbol ester PMA in conjunction with either PHA or the calcium ionophore A23187 induces large amounts of IFN-gamma and IL-2. Histamine suppresses the lymphokine production in these pure T-cell cultures to a similar extent as in monocyte-containing cultures. Histamine is also shown to suppress DNA synthesis by purified T cells cultivated at a low cell density, eliminating any possible involvement of small numbers of contaminating accessory cells.

Therefore, we initiated a study of rIFN-gamma at doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/m2/d intramuscularly in patients with Ph-positive benign-phase CML. Twenty-six of 30 patients entered in the study were evaluable. Six patients have achieved a complete hematologic response; four, a partial hematologic response. The median follow-up period of patients who are in complete remission is 7.5 months (range, 5 to 12 months). No relapses have occurred among the complete responders. So far, five patients have had cytogenetic improvement with emergence of 5% to 45% diploid cells in the bone marrow. Fever and flulike symptoms were the most common side effects, with partial tolerance often developing after about 1 week. The majority of patients tolerated therapy with minimal change in performance status. In conclusion, rIFN-gamma has demonstrated clinical activity in CML.

Our phenotypic studies suggest a novel hybrid expression of pre-B and plasma cell antigens with coexpression of cytoplasmic mu, common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and plasma cell antigens (PCA-1 and PC-1). This suggests that myeloma pre-B-like cells are aberrant malignant cells and not normal pre-B lymphocytic counterparts. With the advantage of a pure and stable source of these cells from M3 culture to allow molecular characterization, we performed one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. We found that the cytoplasmic mu in myeloma pre-B-like cells has a molecular weight of 74,000 daltons and an isoelectric point of 6.3 and that it is strikingly homogeneous and discrete in size and charge compared with standard secretory mu, which suggests an aberrant, mutant, or monoclonal form of mu. Monoclonality was further evidenced by heavy- and light-chain immunoglobulin gene rearrangements demonstrated with JH and C kappa probes. We also established that this novel myeloma pre-B component is a major proliferative element as determined by double-labeling experiments with phenotype coupled to labeling/proliferative indexes. Our stimulatory studies indicate some capacity of these cells to mature on exposure to phorbol esters. These myeloma pre-B cells may represent the stem cell or self-renewal component in myeloma. Our establishment of these cells in long-term culture offers a considerable asset in studying the immature cells, which may be critical to the immortalization of myeloma.","['Grogan, T M', 'Durie, B G', 'Lomen, C', 'Spier, C', 'Wirt, D P', 'Nagle, R', 'Wilson, G S', 'Richter, L', 'Vela, E', 'Maxey, V']","['Grogan TM', 'Durie BG', 'Lomen C', 'Spier C', 'Wirt DP', 'Nagle R', 'Wilson GS', 'Richter L', 'Vela E', 'Maxey V', 'et al.']","['Department of Pathology, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81895-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Oct;70(4):932-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL2 was the more active factor (in six of 11 patients). The effect of IL2 was dependent on a costimulation with anti-mu Ab or occurred independently of anti-mu Ab, according to the patients. This pattern of reactivity did not correlate with the presence or absence of the IL2 receptor (IL2-R) molecule on fresh B-CLL lymphocytes. Five patients responded to the 20 kD BCGF. Although four of them were also strong responders to IL2, one strongly responded to the 20 kD BCGF and did not respond to IL2. Only one patient responded to the 50 kD BCGF. When an anti-IL2-R Ab was introduced into the culture, only the responsiveness to IL2 was abolished: thus both 20 kD and 50 kD BCGFs activate B-CLL lymphocytes independently of the IL2-R.

The expression of c-myc depends on the activation of the cells, but not on subsequent growth. C-fos gene expression appears to be induced by the manipulation involved in preparation of single cell suspensions from spleens. In that respect, c-fos gene expression does not qualify as being significantly involved in transition from G O to S phase while expression of c-myc seems to be correlated with some early events of cell activation leading to growth competence. The kinetics and extent of c-myc gene expression vary with the mitogen used and the type of lymphocyte investigated as examplified by T cells and subpopulations thereof. The expression of both proto-oncogenes in normal mouse spleen cells is finely regulated by an interplay of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms. These mechanisms operate differently for the two genes and independently from one another. They also change in predominance at various times, again independently from one another. While we have no evidence that c-fos has significance for the activation of lymphocytes, c-myc is a good candidate for being involved. Thus studies by Susan Corey and collaborators on transgenic mice which constitutively express c-myc in cells of the lymphocyte lineage, indicate that this lineage is profoundly affected. Among others, the effects concern the balance between proliferation and maturation and a constitutive high level of Ia expression, normally only observed in activated cells. Constitutive high expression of c-myc in B cells of these transgenic mice also makes them prone to leukemia possibly due to a series of subsequent events. These last findings also provide an explanation for the need for a very finely tuned regulation of c-myc gene expression as it is here described.","['Schneider-Schaulies, J', 'Knauer, R', 'Schimpl, A', 'Wecker, E']","['Schneider-Schaulies J', 'Knauer R', 'Schimpl A', 'Wecker E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Behring Inst Mitt,Behring Institute Mitteilungen,0367532,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Ly/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Behring Inst Mitt. 1987 Jun;(81):110-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene rearrangements had already occurred in LC4-1 in the D-J region of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, but not in T-cell receptor (beta-chain) genes, suggesting that LC4-1 is a progenitor cell line of B-cell lineage earlier than pre-B-cells. The expression of cell surface antigens of LC4-1 was changed by treatment with 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (0.1 ng/ml) for 2 days. Before treatment with PMA, about 98% of LC4-1 cells were positive for B4, CALLA, and Ia. However, following treatment they lost CALLA expression without any change in expression of Ia and B4. There was no change in B1-positive population. The change in surface antigens on LC4-1 cells seems to be due to differentiation induced in the cells by PMA. These results support the hypothesis that CALLA is a differentiation antigen and suggest one possible differentiation pathway for pre-B-cells.","['Yoshimura, T', 'Mayumi, M', 'Yorifuji, T', 'Kim, K M', 'Heike, T', 'Miyanomae, T', 'Shinomiya, K', 'Mikawa, H']","['Yoshimura T', 'Mayumi M', 'Yorifuji T', 'Kim KM', 'Heike T', 'Miyanomae T', 'Shinomiya K', 'Mikawa H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830260106 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1987 Sep;26(1):47-54. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830260106.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven cases of primary acute erythremia were diagnosed between 1981 and 1984 at the Institute of Pathology, University of Kiel. Erythremia represented 0.5% of all hematological diagnoses and 1.0% of the myeloproliferative disorders. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1. Incidence peaked in the 7th decade. Evaluation of clinical data, of cytological and histological findings in blood and bone marrow, and of occasional immunophenotyping of blast cells (anti-glycophorin A+) revealed two variants of acute erythremia: a first, blastic one and a second, more differentiated form. Acute erythremia must be strictly distinguished from mixed erythroid/myeloid erythroleukemia and from secondary erythroid neoplasias, especially the erythremic 'blast crisis' of chronic myeloid leukemia or polycythemia vera rubra. Distinguishing the myelodysplastic variant of sideroblastic anemia from anerythremic acute erythremia can be extremely difficult. We discuss the differential diagnosis and classification of erythroid neoplasias based upon reproducible hematological criteria to facilitate the gathering and comparison of epidemiological and clinical data on these rare malignancies.","['Griesser, G H', 'Horny, H P']","['Griesser GH', 'Horny HP']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/classification/diagnosis', 'Phenotype']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000205994 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1987;77(4):193-7. doi: 10.1159/000205994.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparing immunization strategies demonstrated the number of hybrids producing cross reactive antibodies can be increased by hyperimmunization of mice with lymphoid cells from multiple species. Comparing various methods of assay (antibody-complement mediated cytotoxicity [CT], enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and flow microfluorimetry [FMF]), revealed FMF is the most useful technique for the primary assay of hybridomas producing MoAbs of potential interest. By using dual parameter and dual fluorescence analysis, we could determine whether a given MoAb reacted with mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and monocytes) and/or granulocytes, and also whether any two MoAbs of different isotype and specificity recognized antigens present on identical or separate populations of leukocytes. Comparing the patterns of MoAb reactivity with leukocytes obtained from cows, goats, sheep, pigs, horses and humans, as well as comparing the patterns of reactivity with a panel of lymphoid cell lines derived from cattle (with enzootic bovine leukemia) and humans (with various forms of leukemia), revealed sets of MoAbs reactive with unique antigenic determinants present on BoLA class I (15 MoAbs) and class II (9 MoAbs) antigens, and also MoAbs reactive with determinants present on leukocyte differentiation antigens (36 MoAbs). Dual fluorescence analysis demonstrated the antigens detected by some MoAbs are predominantly expressed on one lineage of leukocytes while others are expressed on two or more lineages of leukocytes. Dual and single fluorescence analysis also demonstrated the PNA receptor(s) is: expressed on T cells, granulocytes and class II antigen monocytes and absent or expressed in low amount on sIgM+ B cells and a newly defined Non T/Non B population of cells. The strategies described for identifying and analyzing the specificity of MoAbs demonstrate the feasibility of developing a set of cross reactive MoAbs for identifying homologous molecules in multiple species and delineating their functional and phylogenetic relation.","['Davis, W C', 'Marusic, S', 'Lewin, H A', 'Splitter, G A', 'Perryman, L E', 'McGuire, T C', 'Gorham, J R']","['Davis WC', 'Marusic S', 'Lewin HA', 'Splitter GA', 'Perryman LE', 'McGuire TC', 'Gorham JR']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Cattle/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cross Reactions', 'Goats/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Horses/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Rosette Formation', 'Sheep/immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'Swine/immunology']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(87)90005-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(87)90005-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1987 Jul;15(4):337-76. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(87)90005-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Medium was pH-adjusted with HCl, NaOH or with organic buffers (Good's zwitterions). In the absence of S9 mix, no changes in mutant frequency were observed over a pH range of 6.4-9.2; a small, 1.9-fold increase was observed for a moderately toxic treatment (24% relative growth) at pH 6.3. However, in the presence of S9 mix, the mutant frequency increased sharply for pH values below 6.8. At pH 6.4, a 4-fold increase was induced, and pH 6.0 resulted in a 10-fold increase in mutant frequency. Basic pH shifts in the presence of S9 mix caused no changes in mutant frequency up to pH 8.0; treatment with pH 8.8 was highly toxic (5.3% relative growth) and caused a 3-fold increase in mutant frequency. Thirteen mutant clones induced at pH 6.0 with S9 mix were challenged with trifluorothymidine after their expansion in nonselective medium and all retained their resistance; another 14 clones were tested for thymidine utilization and all incorporated only 0.1-5.5% of the 14C-labeled thymidine used by the parental line. The induced mutants were primarily of the small-colony phenotype, which indicated clastogenic activity. This was confirmed with chromosome studies which showed a large increase in cells with aberrations consisting of chromatid breaks and complex rearrangements. The results show that the combination of weak acidity (pH 6-6.8) and S9 mix is mutagenic and clastogenic to L5178Y TK+/- cells.","['Cifone, M A', 'Myhr, B', 'Eiche, A', 'Bolcsfoldi, G']","['Cifone MA', 'Myhr B', 'Eiche A', 'Bolcsfoldi G']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Buffers)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'RMW9V5RW38 (Trifluridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Buffers', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Drug Resistance', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Trifluridine']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0165-1218(87)90031-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutat Res. 1987 Sep;189(1):39-46. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(87)90031-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

B., and Morin, M. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5979-5984), we demonstrated that the activation of the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C by phorbol esters was dissociable from the induction of monocytic differentiation by these agents in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. We have now compared the effects of two related diterpenes (mezerein and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) and two cell-permeable diacylglycerols (1-oleoyl-2-acetoylglycerol and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol) on the induction of differentiation in HL-60 cells. Each of these agents activated protein kinase C in vitro and stimulated the phosphorylation of a number of identical proteins in intact HL-60 cells. Exposure to either of the diterpenes at nanomolar concentrations resulted in an inhibition of cell growth and the induction of qualitatively distinct types of monocytic maturation in HL-60 cells. Conversely, neither of the two diacylglycerols was found to be a potent or efficacious inducer of differentiation, as measured by increases in cell adhesion, nonspecific esterase activity, or phagocytosis, even at growth-inhibitory concentrations. However, concurrent exposure of HL-60 cells to both 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol and the calcium ionophore A23187, at concentrations which were without maturational activity when used separately, resulted in measurable increases in both protein phosphorylation and in the fraction of cells expressing a differentiated phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that specific biochemical effects associated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, in addition to the activation of protein kinase C, may be important determinants for the induction of leukemia cell differentiation.","['Morin, M J', 'Kreutter, D', 'Rasmussen, H', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Morin MJ', 'Kreutter D', 'Rasmussen H', 'Sartorelli AC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Terpenes)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '86390-77-4 (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Diglycerides/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Diterpenes', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1987/08/25 00:00,1987/08/25 00:01,['1987/08/25 00:00'],"['1987/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)60876-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Aug 25;262(24):11758-63.,"['AM-19813/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-44589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Some mice were cured by treatment with the three agents, and resisted a later challenge by L1210 but not P388 leukemia cells. This immunity was blocked by administration of antimacrophage agents or CY. The effects of OK-432 were also studied with mice sensitized by L1210 cells attenuated with mitomycin C. OK-432 potentiated syngeneic and semi-syngeneic transplantation resistance in vivo and augmented primary and secondary cytotoxicity mediated by spleen cells in vitro. In vivo administration of ADR and CY together enhanced in vivo tumor transplantation resistance and in vitro cytotoxicity was blocked, but this inhibition was reversed by injection of OK-432. The results suggested that OK-432 acted by increasing the activity of cytotoxic spleen cells against L1210 cells, which are fast-growing and poorly immunogenic, and that this cytotoxicity killed tumor cells that survived the chemotherapy.","['Ujiie, T']",['Ujiie T'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Biological Products)', '39325-01-4 (Picibanil)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9000-07-1 (Carrageenan)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Products/*therapeutic use', 'Carrageenan/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Immune Tolerance/*drug effects', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Picibanil/*therapeutic use', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Trypan Blue/pharmacology']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1987 Jul;78(7):737-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, we observed that two other commonly used inhibitors, i.e., 3-aminobenzamide and 3-methoxybenzamide, not merely failed to induce differentiation but actually inhibited it. Furthermore, we observed that benzamide at high concentrations induced differentiation, whereas at low concentrations, it inhibited differentiation. We propose that the induction occurring at high concentrations is due to the polar-planar properties of the molecule, while the inhibition at low concentrations might be due to the inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Cells that were first exposed to an inducer (hexamethylene bisacetamide) and an inhibitor (3-aminobenzamide) and were subsequently incubated in medium lacking these substances did not differentiate. However, re-exposure to the inducer resulted in a very rapid increase in commitment to terminal differentiation. Therefore, 3-aminobenzamide appears to block differentiation prior to the commitment stage. We infer from these findings that polyADP-ribosylation is required for the terminal differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells.","['Brac, T', 'Ebisuzaki, K']","['Brac T', 'Ebisuzaki K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '6X80438640 (benzamide)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars/*metabolism', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*metabolism', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(11)60352-6 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.1987.tb00060.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1987;34(2):139-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.1987.tb00060.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In K562 human erythroleukemic cells, heme oxygenase activity was not increased by exposure to potent inducers, such as cobalt chloride, bromobenzene, and heme. Indeed heme treatment severely suppressed the enzyme activity, and at 18 h the activity measured less than 5% of the control. Heme and cobalt chloride did not inhibit activities of NADPH-cytochrome c (P-450) reductase and biliverdin reductase to a marked degree. In contrast, treatment of cells with thymidine/hypoxanthine alone, or in combination with cobalt chloride, caused an increase in the activity of three enzymes of heme degradation. It is suggested that with thymidine, which is a committing inducer of hemoglobin synthesis, the induction of activity of the three enzymes of the heme degradation pathway is coupled with cell differentiation. On the other hand, in the case of heme, a noncommitting inducer of hemoglobin synthesis, induction of hemoglobin synthesis and increase in heme degradation activity may be independent.","['Trakshel, G M', 'Rowley, P T', 'Maines, M D']","['Trakshel GM', 'Rowley PT', 'Maines MD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Bromobenzenes)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'CO4D5J547L (bromobenzene)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))', 'EC 1.3.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.3.1.24 (biliverdin reductase)', 'EC 1.6.2.4 (NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase)', 'EVS87XF13W (cobaltous chloride)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Bromobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cobalt/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases/metabolism', '*Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors', 'Thymidine/*pharmacology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1987 Sep;15(8):859-63.,['ES03968/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Negative results were obtained in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome assay using five bacterial strains in a preincubation protocol. The Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal test also gave negative results in studies that involved three routes of administration: inhalation, feeding, and injection. Positive results were obtained for three endpoints in cultured mammalian cells. Reproducible, dose-related increases in trifluorothymidine-resistant clones were induced in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, and the frequencies of both SCE and chromosomal aberrations increased in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These effects were independent of exogenous metabolism. In mice exposed to methyl isocyanate by inhalation, cytogenetic analyses were carried out on bone marrow, blood, and lung cells. A single, 2-hr exposure to concentrations of 0, 3, 10, and 30 ppm MIC produced no evidence of chromosomal effects in the bone marrow, although significant cell cycle delay was observed. In four experiments involving exposures on 4 consecutive days to 0, 1, 3, or 6 ppm, delays in bone marrow cell cycle were again observed. Increases in SCE and chromosomal aberrations were observed in bone marrow cells, and a dose-related increase in SCE occurred in lung cells but not in peripheral blood lymphocytes. A significant increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the peripheral blood was observed in male mice in one experiment.

This spontaneous proliferation was significantly inhibited by moderate concentrations of anti-mu (10-50 micrograms/ml). In contrast, lower concentrations of anti-mu (0.6-1.2 micrograms/ml) induced proliferation of leukemic B cells. Conditioned media (CM), derived by stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes with phytohemagglutinin, induced significant proliferation of these leukemic B cells. This induced proliferation at optimal CM concentrations was inhibited by anti-mu. However, at high CM concentrations, which did not cause significant proliferation, synergism between CM and anti-mu in inducing proliferation was observed. Stimulation of spontaneously proliferating leukemic B cells with CM resulted in differentiation into cells synthesizing and secreting immunoglobulin M (IgM) but not IgG.

The normal counterpart to this B-cell clone corresponds to a small subpopulation of lymphocytes, present at the edge of the germinal center in human lymph nodes. Interestingly, this subpopulation appears to constitute a substantial part of the B-cell population in 20-week-old fetal lymph nodes and spleen. These results have induced most authors to assume that the CLL B lymphocyte corresponds to proliferation of an immature B-cell clone, arrested at an intermediate stage between pre-B cells and mature B cells. However, this hypothesis does not explain the high frequency with which hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia are found in B CLL. In this work, we discuss the possibility that the CLL B lymphocyte corresponds to proliferation of a B-cell line, whose counterpart in the mouse is the Ly1 B, Lyb5+ subpopulation.","['Dighiero, G', 'Binet, J L']","['Dighiero G', 'Binet JL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Autoantibodies/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1987;12(2):385-97.,,,,,,,,,,71,,

Mitogen-free T cell-derived conditioned medium acts synergistically with PMA in inducing proliferation of B-PLL cells but does not enhance the PMA-stimulated outgrowth of nonmalignant B cells. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) has no effect on the outgrowth of B-PLL cells, and monoclonal antibodies against the IL-2 receptor do not influence the response to PMA and conditioned medium. Recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), in contrast, is a potent enhancer of PMA-induced proliferation of B-PLL cells. With gel filtration techniques and with the use of anti-IFN-gamma antibodies, it is shown that IFN-gamma in the conditioned medium is responsible for the observed increase in B-PLL cell proliferation. Preincubation of B-PLL cells with IFN-gamma induces responsiveness to PMA, whereas IFN-gamma alone had no effect on these cells when pretreated with PMA. The combined data show that, in the presence of PMA, native and recombinant IFN-gamma are growth factors for B cells from a B-PLL patient and that IL-2 is not involved in this process.","['Sauerwein, R W', 'van der Meer, W G', 'Aarden, L A']","['Sauerwein RW', 'van der Meer WG', 'Aarden LA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78651-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Sep;70(3):670-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basal superoxide (O2-) formation was enhanced several-fold by addition of the stable GTP-analogue, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), prior to AA and was completely prevented by that of GDP. Basal and GTP gamma S-stimulated O2- formation was terminated by GDP. In the presence of Mg2+ or EDTA, basal O2- formation ceased after 25 or 10 min, respectively, and was reinitiated by GTP gamma S or GTP gamma S plus Mg2+. Albumin terminated O2- formation, which was reactivated by AA in the presence of GTP gamma S. Our results show that (1) activation of NADPH oxidase in HL-60 membranes is dependent on endogenous GTP, Mg2+, AA and CF, which is induced during myeloid differentiation, and that (2) NADPH oxidase activation is a reversible process modulated by exogenous guanine nucleotides at various stages of activity of NADPH oxidase.

Our data demonstrate illegitimate clonal rearrangements at Ig heavy and/or TCR beta chain genes in 5 of 17 AML patients. In four of these five patients, rearrangements at the TCR beta chain gene locus were also observed. Seven patients displayed clonal TCR gamma chain gene rearrangements as the only abnormality. Rearrangements at Ig light chain and TCR alpha chain gene loci were not detected. Illegitimate TCR gamma chain gene rearrangements in AML involve recombinations of only a subset of V gamma genes, predominantly with the J gamma 1 region. Rearrangements at the TCR beta chain gene locus are characterized by both D-J and V-D-J recombinations, with predominant use of the J beta 1 region. The absence or presence of illegitimate antigen receptor gene rearrangements in AML may constitute a prognostic marker. In addition, these alterations can be used to establish clonality in AML with direct applications in the monitoring of disease.

Haloacetylation was accomplished in 30-40% yield by reaction of the preformed L-lysine and L-ornithine analogues of MTX with p-nitrophenyl bromoacetate or chloroacetate in aqueous sodium bicarbonate at room temperature. All four haloacetamides were potent inhibitors in spectrophotometric assays measuring noncovalent binding to purified dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from L1210 cells. In experiments designed to measure time-dependent inactivation of DHFR from L1210 cells and Candida albicans, the N epsilon-(bromoacetyl)-L-lysine and N delta-(bromoacetyl)-L-ornithine analogues gave results consistent with covalent binding, whereas N epsilon- and N delta-chloroacetyl analogues did not. The N delta-(bromoacetyl)-L-ornithine analogue appeared to be the more reactive one toward both enzymes. Amino acid analysis of acid hydrolysates of the L1210 enzyme following incubation with the bromoacetamides failed to demonstrate the presence of a carboxymethylated residue, suggesting that alkylation had perhaps formed an acid-labile bond.

The greater than 40,000-fold MTX-resistant mutant cell line L1210/R81 was only partly cross-resistant to the haloacetamides. An analogue of MTX with acivicin replacing glutamate was a potent inhibitor of DHFR from chicken liver and L1210 cells but was 200 times less potent than MTX against L1210 cells in culture.","['Rosowsky, A', 'Solan, V C', 'Forsch, R A', 'Delcamp, T J', 'Baccanari, D P', 'Freisheim, J H']","['Rosowsky A', 'Solan VC', 'Forsch RA', 'Delcamp TJ', 'Baccanari DP', 'Freisheim JH']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '108743-20-0', '((N-(4-amino-4-deoxy-N(10)-methylpteroyl)amino)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazolea', 'cetic acid)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acetates/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Candida albicans/enzymology', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Isoxazoles/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Lysine/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'NADP/pharmacology', 'Ornithine/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Conformation/drug effects', 'Spectrophotometry']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00391a031 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1987 Aug;30(8):1463-9. doi: 10.1021/jm00391a031.,"['CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Upon exposure to recombinant human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) both bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) produced a polar 25-(OH)D3 metabolite which was purified from conditioned media and unequivocally identified as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) by UV-absorbance spectrophotometry and mass spectrometry. The BMM and PAM also synthesized a second 25-(OH)D3 metabolite which was structurally identified as 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25-(OH)2D3). The time course of 25-(OH)D3 metabolism by macrophages suggested that the production of 24,25-(OH)2D3 was stimulated by high intracellular levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and not by IFN-gamma.

However, only low cell concentrations and a high dose of IFN-gamma allowed the induction of HLA-DR antigens. Furthermore, the recombinant glycosylated IFN-gamma is 100-fold more efficient than the unglycosylated form. This induction of HLA-DR antigens on K562 was not related to a stage of differentiation or to the presence of cells subsets specifically sensitive to IFN-gamma, since repeated sorting of K562 HLA-DR-positive and negative cells did not lead to the selection of a cell subset with a different potential of induction for HLA-DR. The difficulty in obtaining induction is due to the production of a soluble endogenous inhibitor of proteic nature, whose action is not restricted to the K562 cell line since it operates also on both epithelial and fibroblastic cells. Treatment of normal human epithelial and fibroblastic cells with conditioned medium from K562 cultures caused a marked decrease in the expression of HLA class II antigens (DR and DP) induced by IFN-gamma (10,000 U/ml), but had no effect on cell growth; however, it also affected expression of HLA class I antigens. This inhibition is not mediated by prostaglandin or an IFN-alpha or IFN-beta-dependent mechanism.

Serum levels of sIL-2R were correlated with clinical features, relevant hematologic and immunological data, and in some cases, with in vitro functional studies. In 51 patients (94.4%), the levels of sIL-2R were increased as compared with normal age-matched controls (1,781 U/mL +/- 231 v 276 U/mL +/- 26, respectively; P less than .001). Although this increase was observed in all stages of the disease and independently of several hematologic and immunologic parameters, a trend toward lower levels of sIL-2R was documented in patients with a less-invasive disease. When the values were correlated with the functional status of the residual T cell population, it was found that patients with the lowest levels of sIL-2R showed the best mitogenic response and helper capacity. It is suggested that in B-CLL patients the high levels of serum sIL-2R, capable of binding to its ligand, may block the T cell-produced IL-2, thus contributing toward a defective physiological action by this lymphokine. In turn, this defective availability of IL-2 may play a part in the abnormal immunoregulation that is implicated in the hypogammaglobulinemia, susceptibility to infections, and incidence of second neoplasias often observed in this disease.","['Semenzato, G', 'Foa, R', 'Agostini, C', 'Zambello, R', 'Trentin, L', 'Vinante, F', 'Benedetti, F', 'Chilosi, M', 'Pizzolo, G']","['Semenzato G', 'Foa R', 'Agostini C', 'Zambello R', 'Trentin L', 'Vinante F', 'Benedetti F', 'Chilosi M', 'Pizzolo G']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*blood', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78428-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Aug;70(2):396-400.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effectiveness of MMC against human stomach cancers xenografted to nude mice clearly correlated to the clinical effect of MMC against gastric cancer. The covalent cross-link adducts between MMC and DNA were isolated in the bioreductive system of NADPH-cytochrome C reductase and NADPH, and the major monoadduct was determined as N2-(2'' beta 7'-diaminomitosen-1''-alpha yl)-2'-deoxyguanine. Importantly, bisadduct was isolated, and the structure was determined by spectroscopic method. DNA-DNA cross-link formation was shown by alkaline elution in cells treated with MMC. The activation of MMC has been characterized by the two electron transfer process, however, the one electron transfer process was proposed by electrochemical analysis.

The other two patients who were studied at presentation subsequently showed a decrease in plasma large vWF multimers, especially remarkable in the patient having the sharpest decrease in platelet count. No appreciable difference in vWF multimer pattern, when compared to normal pooled plasma, was found in the remaining two patients who were only studied at presentation, or in the seven controls who received the same treatment but did not develop thrombosis.

Highly purified E-rosette negative (E-) B cells from 5 out of 15 patients with CLL exhibited moderate proliferative responses to 10 or 50 micrograms/ml of F(ab)'2 fragments of rabbit anti-human mu-chain specific antibody. Conditioned medium (CM), derived by stimulating human peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes with PHA, induced significant proliferative responses of purified E- cells in 13 out of 14 patients examined. The extent of these proliferative responses varied substantially, and was in the range of 2.6- to 91-fold. Stimulation of purified E- cells from patients with CLL with both anti-mu and CM resulted in significant proliferation in all 15 patients examined. These responses were significantly higher than those induced by CM alone (P less than 0.02). Synergism between CM and anti-mu in inducing proliferative responses was observed in 11 out of 15 patients. Largely leukaemic B cell populations expressing on the cell surface more than one immunoglobulin heavy-chain isotype, exhibited significantly higher (P less than 0.009) proliferative response to CM and anti-mu than those expressing IgM only. Highly purified E-peripheral blood or tonsil lymphocytes from all normal donors examined responded by proliferation to anti-mu alone or to CM alone. Synergism in inducing proliferative responses was also observed when the cells were stimulated with both CM and anti-mu. In addition to inducing proliferative responses, culture with CM of purified E-rosette negative, largely leukaemic, B cells from patients with CLL for 6 days at 37 degrees C resulted in differentiation into immunoglobulin synthesizing and secreting cells. Synthesis and secretion of IgM were observed in 7 out of 10 patients examined. A switch to IgG production was observed in three patients. Morphological examination of E- cells from patients with CLL after treatment with CM demonstrated that these cells were differentiated into plasma-like cells. These results suggest that leukaemic B cells from patients with CLL can be induced to proliferate and differentiate in response to growth and differentiation factors derived by mononuclear leucocytes, in a manner similar to that of normal B cells.","['Steinberg, J', 'Moore, M A', 'Bernhardt, B', 'Bona, C A', 'Platsoucas, C D']","['Steinberg J', 'Moore MA', 'Bernhardt B', 'Bona CA', 'Platsoucas CD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Rosette Formation']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1987.tb01086.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1987 Jun;25(6):599-611. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1987.tb01086.x.,['CA 41699/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Independently existing Tac or p75 peptides represent low-affinity IL-2 receptors, whereas high-affinity IL-2 receptors are expressed when both peptides are present and associated in a receptor complex. It has long been known that normal large granular lymphocytes (LGL) or leukemic cells from the patients with abnormal expansions of LGL can be activated by IL-2 not only to more-potent natural killer cells but also to effectors of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity, although they do not express the Tac peptide. In the present study, using cross-linking methodology, we found that normal LGL and leukemic LGL from all individuals tested expressed the p75 IL-2 binding peptide but did not express the Tac peptide. These LGL leukemia cells made proliferative responses to IL-2 but required a much higher concentration than that required for the proliferation of normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T lymphoblasts that express high-affinity receptors. Furthermore, the addition of IL-2 to Tac-negative LGL leukemic cells augmented transcription of the Tac gene and induced the Tac peptide. Neither the IL-2-induced proliferation nor the up-regulation of Tac gene expression was inhibited by the addition of anti-Tac. These results strongly suggest that the p75 peptide is responsible for IL-2-induced activation of LGL and that the p75 peptide alone can mediate an IL-2 signal. Thus, the p75 peptide may play an important role in the IL-2-mediated immune response not only by participating with the Tac peptide in the formation of the high-affinity receptor complex on T cells but also by contributing to the initial triggering of LGL activation so that these cells become efficient natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cells.","['Tsudo, M', 'Goldman, C K', 'Bongiovanni, K F', 'Chan, W C', 'Winton, E F', 'Yagita, M', 'Grimm, E A', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Tsudo M', 'Goldman CK', 'Bongiovanni KF', 'Chan WC', 'Winton EF', 'Yagita M', 'Grimm EA', 'Waldmann TA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.84.15.5394 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Aug;84(15):5394-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.15.5394.,,PMC298862,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated the induction of synthesis of specific proteins by alpha-IFN, both in vitro and in vivo. We have now shown that gamma-IFN induces synthesis of specific proteins, but the pattern differs from that seen after alpha-IFN exposure. The prominent 80,000-dalton protein induced by alpha-IFN was not induced by gamma-IFN, and the prominent 62,000-dalton protein induced by gamma-IFN was only rarely induced by alpha-IFN. Two other proteins were induced by both alpha-IFN and gamma-IFN. The other proteins induced by alpha-IFN were not induced by gamma-IFN. These differences may be related to the different biological response of hairy cells to the two types of IFN. We also showed for both alpha-IFN and gamma-IFN that some IFN-induced proteins are probably transported to the nucleus of the hairy cell, although the majority of proteins induced by both alpha-IFN and gamma-IFN were in the cytosol/membrane fraction of the cell. We have therefore demonstrated that gamma-IFN does have a biochemical effect on hairy cells in terms of induction of specific protein synthesis, leading to the inference that hairy cells must possess another receptor at least functionally analogous to the type II IFN receptors on fibroblasts, with which gamma-IFN interacts.","['Samuels, B L', 'Golomb, H M', 'Brownstein, B H']","['Samuels BL', 'Golomb HM', 'Brownstein BH']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Response Mod,Journal of biological response modifiers,8219656,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Response Mod. 1987 Jun;6(3):268-74.,"['2-S07-RR05893/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 19266-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The immunotoxins were therapeutically much more effective than their parent antibodies. Their specificity reflected that of their antiidiotype component. Although the leukemia emerged eventually in most animals treated with these conjugates, most of the cells showed altered Ig expression, which rendered them resistant to the therapy. Commonly, the emerging cells had lost mu heavy chain production, leaving them negative for intracellular, surface, and secreted IgM, but still positive for lambda light chain production. In addition, a minor group of L2C variants was identified in a protocol designed to detect mutants at very low frequency: here the cells were exposed in vitro to immunotoxin and, while still viable as judged by dye-exclusion, inoculated in large numbers into animals. In tumor that emerged under these circumstances, the majority of cells were again immunoglobulin-negative; however a minority exhibited IgM with an altered idiotype (Idiotope-loss variants), rendering them unreactive with immunotoxin.

After 19 hr of incubation with [35S]sulfate, however, an 85,000 m.w. species predominated. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the larger macromolecules were proteoglycans that with time were processed to glycosaminoglycan-sized macromolecules. As assessed by their susceptibility to chemical and enzymatic degradation and by high pressure liquid chromatography of the chondroitinase ABC-generated unsaturated disaccharides, the cell-associated rat LGL tumor cell proteoglycans bore almost exclusively chondroitin sulfate A glycosaminoglycans. Northern blot analysis using a gene-specific probe revealed that both normal peripheral blood and transformed rat LGL expressed the same approximately 1.3-kb mRNA that encodes the peptide core of the proteoglycans in the secretory granules of rat and mouse mast cells. In vivo radiolabeling of rat LGL tumor cells and isolation of their intact granules after nitrogen cavitation and density sedimentation established that glycosaminoglycans compartmentalized with cytolytic activity.

Methyl glyoxal bis(guanyl hydrazone) (inhibitor or S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase) inhibited this differentiation process. By using a novel experiment protocol the inhibitory effect of this drug on the induced differentiation was dissociated from pleiotropic effects on cell growth. Methyl glyoxal bis(guanyl hydrazone) only inhibited the induced differentiation if present during the first 6 h of culture of the cells with the inducer. No effect on the induced differentiation was observed if the drug was added to the culture medium 6 h after the inducer. alpha-Difluoro methylornithine (inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase) stimulated the differentiation of these cells. Polyamine analysis demonstrated that alpha-difluoro methylornithine increased the rapidity and the amplitude of the changes in intracellular polyamines associated with this induced differentiation. The presence of methyl glyoxal bis(guanyl hydrazone) during the first 3 h with the inducer was sufficient to produce opposing changes in the intracellular polyamines. These results suggest that changes in either intracellular polyamines or the activities of polyamine biosynthetic enzymes play a regulatory role in the differentiation process induced in murine erythroleukemic cells by hexamethylene bisacetamide.,"['Meilhoc, E', 'Moutin, M J', 'Osborne, H B']","['Meilhoc E', 'Moutin MJ', 'Osborne HB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Polyamines)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Acetamides/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Eflornithine/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/analysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitoguazone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Polyamines/*biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041310320 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1987 Jun;131(3):465-71. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041310320.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 36,000- and 35,000-dalton polypeptides were cross-reacted with the affinity-purified antibody raised against the beta of brain Gi and Go. Limited proteolysis with trypsin and immunoblot analyses with the use of the affinity-purified antibodies raised against the alpha of brain Gi or Go indicated that the alpha of GHL was different from the alpha of Gi or Go. Kinetics of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding to GHL was also quite different from that to brain Gi or Go. Incubation of GHL with GTP gamma S resulted in a resolution into GTP gamma S-bound alpha and beta(gamma) thus purified had abilities to inhibit a membrane-bound adenylate cyclase activity and to associate with the alpha of brain IAP substrate in a fashion similar to the beta gamma of brain IAP substrates, suggesting that there were no significant differences in the biological activities between the beta(gamma) of GHL and those of Gi or Go.

This response is not modified by inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and is specifically inhibited by a monoclonal antibody interfering with the binding of IL2 to its receptor. This enhancing effect of DM is not observed in the absence of monocytes even if IL1 is added to the cultures. Moreover, monocytes pretreated with DM stimulate the response of B cells cultures in the absence of DM. Enhancement of Ig production by DM and monocytes could be demonstrated with B cells obtained from a patient suffering from a hyperlymphocytic form of B cell type chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and in this case only IgM was produced. Importantly, DM fully inhibited the IL2-dependent proliferation of these monoclonal B cells. Thus, physiological concentrations of DM can modulate monocytic function to enhance the differentiative effect of IL2.","['Emilie, D', 'Karray, S', 'Crevon, M C', 'Vazquez, A', 'Galanaud, P']","['Emilie D', 'Karray S', 'Crevon MC', 'Vazquez A', 'Galanaud P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (dexamethasone receptor)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*pharmacology', 'Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Monocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830170609 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1987 Jun;17(6):791-5. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830170609.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both dioxetanes, which are efficient sources of triplet-excited ketones on thermal decomposition, induced morphological transformation in Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) fibroblasts. Unscheduled DNA synthesis in SHE and in HeLa cells could not be detected with these dioxetanes, but the number of micronuclei scored after the first mitosis was dose-dependently increased. Single-strand breaks but not Micrococcus luteus u.v.-endonuclease sensitive sites were observed by alkaline elution in HL-60 cells when treated with sub-lethal doses of HTMD and APD.

Surface marker studies of the ML cells showed that they had both myeloid (MCS-1, MCS-2, and OKM-1) and some T-lymphocyte (3A1/Leu-9 and OKT-4/Leu-3a) characteristics. Molecular studies on these lines were performed in order to determine the possible involvement of the Hu-ets-1 gene, since it is located at band 11q23----q24. All ML cell lines showed half the intensity of the Hu-ets-1 DNA bands as compared to those of controls (karyotypically normal B-cell lines). In contrast, DNAs from leukemia cells with t(4;11)(q21;q23) or t(1;11)(q21;q23 or q24) showed no rearrangement, deletion, or amplification of the ets-1 gene. These findings indicate that a chromosome region (11q24----qter), including the Hu-ets-1 gene, of the ML cells is deleted as a result of the primary cytogenetic change and that heterogeneity is present in the mechanism of human leukemia involving the 11q23----q24 region.","['Ohyashiki, K', 'Ohyashiki, J H', 'Sandberg, A A', 'Minowada, J', 'Kinniburgh, A J']","['Ohyashiki K', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Sandberg AA', 'Minowada J', 'Kinniburgh AJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Alleles', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1987/07/15 00:00,1987/07/15 00:01,['1987/07/15 00:00'],"['1987/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jul 15;47(14):3842-6.,"['AM-31675/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-412858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,
