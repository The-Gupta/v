The effects of dGuo on ara-C incorporation into DNA were compared to those of thymidine (dThd), a pyrimidine deoxynucleoside known to augment ara-C effects both in vitro and in vivo. Both deoxynucleosides doubled the cells in the S phase of the cell cycle within the exposure periods (up to 48 hr) and concentrations (10 to 1000 microM) tested. Both deoxynucleosides enhanced ara-C incorporation into DNA equally. However, dThd and dGuo differed in the schedule required to achieve this effect. Simultaneous exposure of cells to ara-C and dThd increased ara-C incorporation into DNA approximately 3.5-fold. Preincubation of cells with dThd for 16 hr prior to the addition of ara-C further enhanced ara-C incorporation into DNA (to approximately 5-fold) in direct proportion to the dThd-induced increase in cells in S phase. Preincubation was essential for dGuo, since 16-hr preincubation of cells with concentrations as low as 30 microM caused augmentation of ara-C incorporation into DNA; but simultaneous exposure of cells to dGuo and ara-C caused no augmentation of ara-C incorporation into DNA. The augmentation of ara-C incorporation into DNA caused by preincubation of the cells with dGuo results from a number of factors, including the cytokinetic effect of increasing the percentage of cells in S phase and the reduction of intracellular dCTP pools. Maximal dGuo enhancement of ara-C incorporation into DNA (approximately 5-fold) required greater than 100 microM dGuo, 16-hr preincubation with dGuo, and final incubation of cells with ara-C after removal of dGuo. We explain this further augmentation of ara-C incorporation into DNA caused by the removal of dGuo prior to adding ara-C by our observed inhibition of ara-C phosphorylation by dGuo concentrations greater than 100 microM.","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,

CBH was equally cytotoxic toward stationary and exponentially growing CHO cells. Cell viability was diminished by 50% following 24 hr exposure to approximately 50 micrograms CBH per ml. Treatment of quiescent human lymphocytes for 24 hr with up to 100 micrograms CBH per ml did not appreciably diminish cell viability though the subsequent stimulation of such lymphocytes with PHA was inhibited in a dose dependent fashion. L1210, FL cells, and PHA stimulated human lymphocytes were equally sensitive to CBH, 50% inhibition of growth was obtained following 24 hr treatment with 25 micrograms CBH per ml. Incubation for up to 48 hr with CBH did not result in differentiation of FL cells to mature hemoglobin containing cells. Constant exposure of L1210 cells and PHA-stimulated human lymphocytes to 10-50 micrograms CBH per ml resulted in accumulation of cells in G2 + M phase; higher drug concentrations resulted in cell arrest in mid to late S phase and G2 phase. A short 1-hr pulse of the drug resulted in a transient accumulation of L1210 cells in S and G2 phases. However, cells recovered from a short pulse of drug and by 48 hr, both cell proliferation and the cell cycle distribution appeared normal. A detailed analysis of cell cycle progression of L1210 cells in the presence of the drug indicated that the duration of G2 phase was extended at low concentrations (10 micrograms/ml) while the transit of cells through S was retarded with subsequent accumulation in late S and G2 phase at higher (50 micrograms/ml) concentrations. Concomitant with cell arrest in S and G2 phase an increase in cellular RNA content indicating unbalanced growth was observed.

The survival pattern for this population was typical of ""good-risk"" patients, and median survival was 47 mo. There were multiple interrelationships among different disease features, which led to highly significant correlations with survival for some that had no primary prognostic significance, such as hematocrit. Multivariable regression analysis indicated that spleen size and the percentage of circulating blasts were the most important prognostic indicators. These features, and age, behaved as continuous variables with progressively unfavorable import at higher values. The platelet count did not influence survival significantly at values below 700 X 10(9)/liter but was increasingly unfavorable above this level. Basophils plus eosinophils over 15%, more than 5% marrow blasts, and karyotypic abnormalities in addition to the Ph1 were also significant unfavorable signs. The Cox model, generated with four variables representing percent blasts, spleen size, platelet count, and age, provided a useful representation of risk status in this population, with good fit between predicted and observed survival over more than a twofold survival range. A hazard function derived from half of the patient population successfully segregated the remainder into three groups with significantly different survival patterns. We conclude that it should be possible to identify a lower risk group of patients with a 2-yr survival of 90%, subsequent risk averaging somewhat less than 20%/yr and median survival of 5 yr, an intermediate group, and a high-risk group with a 2-yr survival of 65%, followed by a death rate of about 35%/yr and median survival of 2.5 yr.",,['S0006-4971(20)85541-4 [pii]'],"['CA-14236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

We have shown that this process is associated with expression of motility functions and induction of specific changes in the synthesis of discrete proteins. In the present study we show that a methylation inhibitor, 3-deazaadenosine, inhibits the phorbol ester induction of the differentiation functions, adherence and motility. These effects were associated with interference in the expression of membrane proteins indicative of the acquisition of macrophage-like characteristics by HL-60 cells. Of particular importance was the observation that the methylation inhibitor preferentially arrested the induction of one differentiation, protein m10 (pI approximately equal to 7, 28 kDa). The selective effect of 3-deazaadenosine is further supported by observations in this study which show that the methylation inhibitor did not affect other cellular and biochemical effects of phorbol ester in these cells. Most significantly, 3-deazaadenosine did not inhibit the induction of phosphorylation in pp17 and pp27, which was previously shown to be a rapid event associated with initiation of differentiation in HL-60 cells by phorbol ester (Feuerstein, N. and Cooper, H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10786-10793). Furthermore, later elevated phosphorylation of other proteins as well as the arrest of cell growth induced by phorbol ester were also unimpeded by the methylation inhibitor. These results indicate that the methylation inhibitor did not interfere with the transduction of the phorbol ester signal at an early step so as to block all the subsequent events in this sequence, but rather its effect was selectively associated with interference in later events in the sequence of differentiation. It is proposed that transmethylation events might be specifically involved in the induction and expression of discrete proteins during the differentiation of these leukemic cells but not in the initial propagation of the signal produced by phorbol ester binding.","['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '037V4520IY (3-deazaadenosine)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['0167-4781(84)90090-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4781(84)90090-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

We report that this effect is associated with induction of spontaneous motility and a modest expression of chemotactic responsiveness to a formylated peptide. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis we demonstrate that the differentiation of HL-60 cells is associated with a differential effect on membrane vs. cytosol proteins. Changes in the cytosol characteristically involved reduction of synthesis of specific proteins. Changes in the membrane were mainly associated with either enhancement or de novo synthesis of discrete proteins. The hallmark of HL-60 cell differentiation appeared to be distinctive induction of a membrane-bound group of six proteins (pI approximately equal to 5, 45-70 kDa) and the de novo induction of a membrane protein indicated as m10 (pI approximately equal to 7, 28 kDa). These discrete membrane proteins were found to be very prominently synthesized by human cultured monocytes, but virtually absent in lymphocytes. It is proposed that our ability to detect synthesis of proteins characteristic of different states of cellular differentiation will permit detailed studies of the biochemical changes which constitute this process.

Ion-exchange chromatography and gel chromatography indicated that the proliferation-stimulating activity in HP-CM was colony-stimulating activity (CSA). In unstimulated cultures (without HP-CM), normal cells produced very few neutrophils; macrophage production dominated. CML cells, on the other hand, gave rise to neutrophils even in the absence of stimulatory factor(s). The effect of HP-CM was dependent on the initial concentration: at a 'low' (1 X 10(5)/ml) concentration, the addition of HP-CM resulted in a great increase in neutrophils, but at a 'high' (5-8 X 10(5)/ml) initial cell concentration, HP-CM gave only minimal increase in neutrophil numbers in both normal and CML cultures.

Dimethyl sulfoxide-induced granulocyte differentiation in HL-60 cells is associated with a decrease in cellular 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase activity and with a decrease in the incorporation of [14C]acetate and mevalonate into products of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. PMA-induced monocyte-macrophage differentiation in HL-60 cells is associated with a rapid and profound fall in cell proliferation but nonetheless is accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in cellular HMG-CoA reductase activity and [14C]acetate incorporation into the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. In addition, PMA induces an increase in [14C]mevalonate incorporation into cholesterol and its precursors, suggesting that post-HMG-CoA reductase events in cholesterol biosynthesis are also enhanced. Mature peripheral blood human monocytes possess an active cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, whereas mature human granulocytes are almost entirely lacking in the ability to synthesize post-squalene products.

Resistant variants could not be obtained in a single step using BrdU concentrations higher than 100 micrograms/ml. Three clones isolated through multiple step selection were resistant to 640 micrograms/ml of BrdU and deficient in thymidine kinase, although their ability to transport radiolabeled thymidine was unimpaired relative to wild type. All three clones had low reversion frequencies, as judged by plating efficiencies in couterselective HAT medium. Two such revertant clones were isolated and tested for their forward mutation frequency in BrdU. No resistant clones were obtained when as many as 5 X 10(7) cells were tested. This observation argues against the hypothesis that the Friend cells possess two functional thymidine kinase loci and that the revertants represent a heterozygous condition. We conclude that the hypothesis of null mutations within a hemizygous or heterozygous thymidine kinase locus is sufficient to account for high-level BrdU resistance in Friend leukemia cells.","['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']","['0027-5107(84)90169-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(84)90169-6 [doi]']",['GM27268/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Exponentially growing cells were fractionated into cell cycle-specific stages by centrifugal elutriation, a method for purifying cells at each stage of the cycle without the use of treatments that arrest growth. Measurements of H3 histone mRNA content throughout the cell cycle show that the mRNA accumulates gradually during S phase, achieving its highest value in mid-S phase when DNA synthesis is maximal. The mRNA content then decreases as cells approach G2. These results demonstrate that the periodic synthesis of histones during S phase is due to changes in the steady-state level of histone mRNA. They are consistent with the conventional view in which histone synthesis is regulated coordinately with DNA synthesis in the cell cycle. The periodic accumulation and decay of H3 histone mRNA appear to be controlled primarily by changes in the rate of appearance of newly synthesized mRNA in the cytoplasm, determined by pulse-labeling whole cells with [3H]uridine. Measurements of H3 mRNA turnover by pulse-chase experiments with cells in S and G2 did not provide evidence for changes in the cytoplasmic stability of the mRNA during the period of its decay in late S and G2. Furthermore, transcription measurements carried out by brief pulse-labeling in vivo and by in vitro transcription in isolated nuclei indicate that the rate of H3 gene transcription changes to a much smaller extent than the steady-state levels of the mRNA or the appearance of newly synthesized mRNA in the cytoplasm. The results suggest that post-transcriptional processes make an important contribution to the periodic accumulation and decay of histone mRNA and that these processes may operate within the nucleus.","['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",['10.1128/mcb.4.1.123-132.1984 [doi]'],"['CA 13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM22332/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC368666,,,,,,,

The patient presented with chronic myeloid leukemia which rapidly evolved into blast crisis; 90% of peripheral white cells were lymphoblasts. Treatment included intrathecal and intravenous MTX; the lymphoblasts were reduced to undetectable levels.

Quantification of DHFR gene copy number in DNA from lymphoblasts before and after MTX treatment was done: a radiolabeled cloned cDNA constituting the mouse DHFR coding sequence was used to probe high molecular weight pretreatment and posttreatment DNA bound to nitrocellulose filters. Posttreatment DNA contained two- to three-fold more DHFR gene sequences than pretreatment DNA.

The requirements for PHA-LCM and EPO varied for patients with CML when compared to normal individuals; i.e., cells from some patients gave rise to mixed colonies with substantial erythroid components in the absence of PHA-LCM or without addition of the usually required EPO concentrations. The proliferative activity of CFU-GEMM was assessed using a short-term exposure to tritiated thymidine (3HTdR) prior to plating.

HL-60 myeloid differentiation was a continuously driven process; significant terminal cell differentiation occurred only after a minimum exposure to inducer of two division cycles. Cells so committed to differentiation retained a heritable, finite memory of differentiation commitment over a further division cycle. Prior to becoming committed, cells acquired precommitment memory of exposure to inducer. Precommitment memory abbreviated the subsequent exposure to inducer needed for commitment to differentiation. Precommitment memory was semistable. It was heritable, but was lost after four division cycles. The acquisition and loss of precommitment memory correlated with alterations in nuclear architecture detected by narrow angle light scatter using flow cytometry. The altered nuclear architecture first occurred before any overt cell differentiation or growth arrest. It was thus an early event in the induced program of terminal cell differentiation. Alterations in relative abundances of cytoplasmic proteins also occurred prior to overt cell differentiation or growth arrest. One of these was a 17 kdalton, anionic, probably Ca2+ binding, protein.

We have reported that within minutes following exposure of these cells to PMA there is an increase of severalfold in phosphorylation of two cytosol proteins: 17-20 kDa (pp17, pI approximately 5.5) and 27 kDa (pp27, pI approximately 5.5) as detected in the intact cells by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In this report, by analyzing the chase kinetics of 32Pi in cellular proteins, we show that PMA treatment induces a rapid and specific loss of 32Pi from pp17 and pp27. Comparison with kinetics of [3H]leucine loss from these proteins indicates that this effect is due to induction by PMA of rapid turnover of phosphate in pp17 and pp27. This activity persisted in HL-60 for at least 24 h and was also seen in two other cell types studied (U937 leukemia and normal monocytes). The Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine, had no effect on PMA-induced 32Pi turnover in pp17, while trifluoroperazine, which is known to inhibit protein kinase C, blocked these events and also inhibited other cellular effects of PMA (adherence and growth arrest). Thus, induction of rapid 32Pi turnover in pp17 and pp27 may be an essential early signal in initiating and maintaining cellular effects of PMA.

The results suggest that RA enhances neutrophil production by stimulating the proliferation and maturation of a cluster-forming cell within the myeloblast-promyelocyte compartment.

There were different elution peaks of the MGI-2 bound to DNA suggesting a heterogeneity of MGI-2 molecules, and the last peak eluted from the DNA cellulose column was enriched for one of the molecular forms of MGI-2. After one further step of purification by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, this molecular form of MGI-2 was active at a concentration of 6.5 X 10(-11) M. In normal development MGI-1 induces MGI-2. This induction of a DNA-binding differentiation-inducing protein by a growth-inducing protein is an efficient mechanism for the normal coupling of growth and differentiation. It is suggested that this may also be a mechanism for the normal coupling of growth and differentiation in other types of cells.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-cellulose)', '9004-34-6 (Cellulose)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,PMC555420,,,,,,,

A leukocyte count of less than 50 X 10(9)/1 in the peripheral blood was also associated with a higher CR rate. No significant difference was found between the various French-American-British (FAB) subtypes, in spite of a trend towards a lower CR rate in patients with an M1, myeloblastic, poorly differentiated, subtype. The leukocyte count and the percentage of Auer rod positive cells were the only significant parameters for duration of survival from the beginning of maintenance treatment. However these features had no prognostic value for the duration of remission. It seems therefore that patients with a higher percentage of Auer-rod-positive cells and lower peripheral leukocyte counts can enter remission more easily, and can also more readily achieve subsequent remissions following relapse. The prognostic value of these routine cytologic features is probably related to their relationship with proliferative activity and tumor burden: the percentage of Auer-rod-positive cells correlates inversely with the leukocyte count, whereas leukocyte count, BM cellularity, and percentage of BM blasts are linked together.",,['10.1002/1097-0142(19840401)53:7<1526::aid-cncr2820530718>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Large colonies, small colonies, macroclusters, and microclusters were recloned separately to assess the replicative capacities as a function of clone size. Large colonies showed higher proliferative capacities than did small ones, etc. Anti-Ia and an antigranulocyte (B4.3) monoclonal antibody (MoAb) were then employed to evaluate the stage of differentiation of AML cells in two patients before and following colony culture. Alterations of the immunologic phenotypes appeared during colony formation. This suggested differentiation of cells to more mature B4.3 granulocyte antigen-positive stages. MoAb-dependent cell lysis with the two antibodies was subsequently performed to assess the phenotypes of the precursors of the colonies and clusters. Leukemic colony-forming cells were Ia-positive and B4.3-negative and different from cluster-forming cells, which were largely Ia-negative and B4.3-negative.

The plasma membrane of intact Friend cells appeared to be permeable to fluorescamine in a concentration-dependent way. (2). Three pools of phosphatidylethanolamine could be detected as the fluorescamine concentration was raised. The two first pools were ascribed to the outer monolayer (16-17% of the total cellular phosphatidylethanolamine) and inner (17-18%) monolayer of the plasma membrane, respectively, indicating an essentially symmetrical distribution of this phospholipid. The third pool of phosphatidylethanolamine (66%) corresponds to the contribution of intracellular membranes. (3).

Evidence supporting that conclusion has been obtained from experiments with a radiosensitive, proliferating cell, the S/S variant of the L5178Y murine leukaemic lymphoblast, and a radioresistant, nondividing cell, the retinal photoreceptor (rod) of the rabbit. When S/S cells (mid-) G1 + 8 h in the cycle, at the peak of radioresistance, were X-irradiated at 37 degrees C and then treated hyperthermically (12 h, 38.7-40.3 degrees C), the survival curve, which has a shoulder at 37 degrees C, changed progressively to the simple exponential obtained for G1 cells. Under conditions where Ne ions (LET = 35 keV microns-1) have a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of approximately 2 for normally radioresistant cells in vitro and in situ, the RBE for G1 S/S cells was approximately 1. Neon ions (1-50 Gy) caused similar amounts of DNA damage in S/S cells and photoreceptors, but the cellular responses were very different. After 5 Gy, the surviving fraction of asynchronous S/S cells was 10(-5), DNA structures were not restored and by 8 h post-irradiation extensive DNA degradation was evident; in the retina, however, the photoreceptor complement was unchanged for greater than 1 year, DNA structures appeared to be restored and remained so (many months) until late DNA degradation began.

At these concentrations the hormones have no effect on cell growth or viability. In this study it has been shown that there is a group of proteins, including the alpha- and beta-globins, whose regulation is associated with the induction of Friend erythroleukemia cell differentiation, and that the expression of some of these, in addition to alpha- and beta-globin, is affected by glucocorticoids. The levels of alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs are very close to fully induced levels and preclude transcription as a major site for glucocorticoid control. In addition, it has been shown that glucocorticoids inhibit the translation of alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs, that the level of this inhibition is concentration dependent, and that the translation of beta-globin mRNA is slightly more sensitive to inhibition than the translation of alpha-globin mRNA. It is concluded that, although the translation of alpha- and beta-globin mRNA is a major site of inhibition by glucocorticoids, there is a detectable amount of alpha- and beta-globin synthesized. Thus, part of this mechanism may involve a differential sensitivity of alpha- and beta-globin mRNA translation which results in unequal amounts of globin synthesis and an overall more potent inhibition of hemoglobin formation.","['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']","['0003-9861(83)90483-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(83)90483-6 [doi]']",['GM1974/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Abe et al., (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 4990-4994). At 0.12-120 nM, 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 suppressed cell growth in a dose-dependent manner and markedly induced phagocytic activity, lysozyme activity, and C3-receptor formation. The potency of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3, at 0.12-120 nM, in inducing differentiation was nearly equivalent to that of 10-10,000 nM of dexamethasone, one of the most potent stimulators of Ml cells. Simultaneous treatment with low physiological plasma concentrations of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 (0.12 nM) and dexamethasone (10 nM) induced differentiation of Ml cells equivalent to the responses obtained only by using much higher concentrations of the respective steroids when used separately. In addition, two variant clones of Ml cells resistant to either 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 or dexamethasone were isolated. One was resistant to 120 nM of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 but sensitive to 10-1000 nM of dexamethasone. The other was resistant to 1000 nM of dexamethasone but sensitive to 12 nM of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. This suggests that the mechanism of action of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 in inducing differentiation of Ml cells is different at least in part from that of dexamethasone, and that combination therapy by both steroids may be useful in reducing leukemogenicity of Ml cells in vivo.","['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']","['0003-9861(83)90467-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(83)90467-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

A group of 16 patients in relapse received idarubicin at a dosage of 5-6 mg/m2/day for 3 consecutive days; a second group of 6 relapsing and 4 previously untreated cases was treated with a sequential combination of idarubicin and arabinosyl cytosine.

These preliminary results suggest that idarubicin has a therapeutic activity against human acute leukemias usually responsive to DNR or DX. The duration of myelosuppression varied from 7 to 50 days, leading in some cases to a high risk of infections.

The enzymatic activity decreased to zero after only 20 min dialysis with 8-hydroxyquinoleine-5-sulfonic acid (8HC5S) as compared with the 60-80 min in the controls.

The studies indicate that a factor(s) present in MEL cells can cause activation of both beta- and gamma-globin genes that can be further stimulated by treatment with DMSO, an inducer of MEL cell differentiation. MEL-lymphoblast and MEL-fibroblast hybrids express an adult-like program in which much larger amounts of beta-globin mRNA than gamma-globin mRNA are produced; human beta-globin is at least as efficient as mouse beta-globin gene expression. The expression of both beta- and gamma-globin genes appears to be normal, as their mRNAs were found in polyribosomes and human beta-globin chains were readily detected. These results suggest that the MEL cells may be exploited as recipients of human globin genes for studies of molecular mechanisms controlling their expression. Comparison of intergenic DNA transcription patterns in hybrids and other cells not expressing human beta-globin has led to the identification of two regions flanking the delta-beta-globin locus whose transcription is correlated with beta-globin. One region 3' to the beta gene may define the site where its transcription terminates.

In each affected individual a single abnormal clone becomes dominant, occupying all hematologic spaces. An understanding of the cellular basis of normal hemopoiesis and these diseases requires consideration of stem cell properties, clonal expansion, and the differentiation programs of various myelopoietic lineages. The blast cells of AML provide a test of hypotheses about normal and leukemic hemopoiesis. The suggestion is advanced that these blasts do not develop because normal programs are blocked or aborted, but rather follow novel programs, assembled abnormally from normal components.

It is suggested that these transformed CFU-E-like erythroid precursor cells exhibit in their uninduced state a DNA methylation pattern and globin gene chromatin configuration (DNase I sensitivity) that is compatible with actual or potential gene transcription. Such features may reflect alterations in chromatin configuration that occurred earlier, during the differentiation of erythroid precursor cells, which is associated with the restriction in developmental potential that is characteristic of progression to the CFU-E (or MELC) stage of erythropoiesis. Uninduced MELC display a low level of globin gene transcription, producing globin mRNA or mRNA precursors whose processing or stabilization is the site of action of hemin. The major increase in MELC globin gene transcription that is initiated by HMBA or butyric acid is accompanied by an increase in DNase I hypersensitivity in the regions 5' to the active globin genes. This suggests that reorganization of chromatin structure in the globin gene domains is associated with accelerated globin gene transcription and may be characteristic of a developmental stage transition during terminal differentiation in the erythroid cell lineage.","['0 (Chromatin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)']",,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0 1 CA-31768-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Blotting analysis indicated that viral RNA molecules transcribed from these variant genomes could not be encapsidated into virions. The nonrescuable genomes were molecularly cloned and all were found to have suffered deletions or deletions/inversions involving the 5' long terminal repeat as well as some adjacent sequences. Nucleotide sequence analysis suggested that the long terminal repeat or the tetranucleotides G-G-T-C and G-A-C-C (or both) were involved in the generation of these mutants. Transfection studies showed that the cloned DNAs of the 5 mutants transformed NIH/3T3 monolayers.

A single open reading frame was predicted to encode a fusion polyprotein of 160,000 daltons (P160gag-fms). Fourteen potential sites for glycosylation were predicted within the v-fms-encoded portion of the protein, consistent with previous observations that the primary translation product is rapidly glycosylated. The presence of hydrophobic signal peptides within the amino-terminal leader sequence and in the middle of the v-fms-encoded moiety suggests that the transforming glycoprotein becomes oriented with its amino terminus within the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and its carboxyl terminus protruding across the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm.

GR levels ranged widely, from 1800 to 47,800 sites/cell (median 16,000), and did not differ significantly from levels measured in newly diagnosed patients (p = 0.50). Nineteen of the 48 children studied had GR levels measured both at diagnosis and relapse, and in 14 the values at relapse were either decreased or increased by more than 25%. For nine children, the sensitivity to a three-day oral course of dexamethasone alone (6 mg/m2 per day) was estimated from daily leukocyte counts and serial bone marrow cytokinetic studies. A clinical oncolytic effect of dexamethasone was associated with a reduction in the marrow cell proliferating compartment, as judged from labeling indices, mitotic indices and percent S + G2 + M in five patients. We found, however, that GR levels either alone or combined with clinical or cytokinetic responses to dexamethasone as a single agent did not reliably identify patients who were likely to respond favorably to reinduction with steroid-containing combination chemotherapy. The 35 children who successfully attained subsequent remissions had GR levels similar to those who failed (p = 0.35). While not statistically significant, two observations suggest an association between lower receptor content and drug resistance. Receptor levels from patients with ALL who relapsed while on chemotherapy were appreciably lower (median 15,700, n = 31) than GR levels from patients who relapsed off therapy (median 20,300, n = 17) (p = 0.08). Moreover, three of seven patients with serial studies, whose GR levels at relapse were lower than at diagnosis, failed reinduction--compared to only one of twelve whose levels were either increased or remained unchanged (p = 0.11). Although not having any obvious clinical utility, studies of GR at diagnosis and at relapse may aid in clarifying mechanisms of drug resistance in leukemic blasts.","['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",['10.1016/0145-2126(83)90068-1 [doi]'],"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Nine fusions were done with lymphocytes from seven AML patients, and all with the human RH-L4 B lymphoma line as malignant fusion partner. A total of 305 Ig-producing hybrids were obtained. 26 reacted with cell surface components on AML cells, but 21 were found not to be specific for leukemia cells, when screened for reactivity against a panel of normal and malignant cells of both human and murine origin. Five hybridomas secreted Ig with high specificity for human leukemia cells, but only one hybridoma culture, aml-18, was stable in respect to Ig-production and growth upon repeated clonings and expansion in liquid cultures. A method was developed to grow human hybridomas as ascites tumors in nude mice, but the ascites fluid did not contain increased amount of antibody. The reactivity of the aml-18 antibody (gamma, kappa) was analyzed against samples of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood of 63 patients with leukemia and with cytologically verified leukemia cells in the blood. 22 of 54 AML samples reacted with aml-18. The reactivity pattern was not correlated to any categories of the French-American-British (FAB) classification; two of four ALL were positive. Moreover, a pronounced intratumoral antigenic heterogeneity in regard to aml-18 reactivity was seen and indicates a high degree of diversity in the immunological phenotype within individual AML cell populations. The study demonstrates that some patients with AML generate an immune response against their autologous malignant cells, and that the antigenic determinant in the case of aml-18 is also expressed specifically on leukemic cells from other patients.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",['10.1084/jem.159.2.537 [doi]'],"['CA-135227/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2187227,,,,,,,

In the present experiment, variant cell lines with a high (Mm-A), moderate (Mm-P), and little or no (Mm-S1 and Mm-S2) leukemogenic potential were obtained from the Mm-1 cells. The mean survival times of syngeneic SL mice inoculated i.p. with 5 X 10(6) Mm-A and Mm-P cells were 17 and 33 days, respectively, whereas almost all the mice inoculated with Mm-S1 or Mm-S2 cells survived for more than 90 days.

These variant cell lines phagocytized latex beads and sensitized sheep erythrocytes, produced lysozyme, and adhered to culture dishes. The four variant cell lines showed no significant difference in proliferation rates in vitro in liquid medium containing 10% calf serum, but Mm-A cells could grow both in soft agar medium in the absence of ascitic fluid containing colony-stimulating factor (CSF) and in liquid medium containing 1% serum, whereas Mm-P cells could grow in the liquid medium but not in soft agar medium without ascitic fluid, and Mm-S1 and Mm-S2 cells could not grow in either medium. The ratio of the nuclear area to the cell area (NCR) of Mm-A cells was a high (51%) but those of Mm-S1 and Mm-S2 cells were low (40-41%), and that of Mm-P cells was intermediate (44%). The leukemogenicity of Mm-1 cell lines was roughly correlated with their NCR. The possibility that interactions between Mm-1 variant cells and host immune cells might be involved in the mechanisms of their different leukemogenicities was not supported by results on the in vitro susceptibilities of Mm-1 variant cells to the cytostatic actions by normal macrophages and spleen cells and on leukemogenicities of the Mm-1 variant cells in athymic nude mice.

In contrast to these results with MGI-2, the same schedule of injections of the myeloid growth-inducing protein MGI-I did not affect the in vivo development of leukemia in mice with MGI+D+ myeloid leukemic cells, but stimulated normal myelopoiesis in the bone marrow. Different forms of MGI-I including MGI-IM and MGI-IG had different serum half-lives, and the form of MGI-I with the shortest serum half-life showed the smallest in vivo effect on normal myelopoiesis.

However, in supernatants from different sources and in the 15 000-20 000-Mr semipurified fractions, we observed that the NK-like cytotoxicity inducer effect did not correlate with either the mitogenicity or the IL2 activity. The presence in the supernatants of interleukin 1 (IL 1), interferon (IFN) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) does not seem to be a prerequisite for the induction of NK-like cytotoxicity, since this activity was (a) fully present in supernatants devoid of IL 1, IFN and PHA, (b) absent in preparations of IL 1 and (c) not augmented after supplementation of the supernatants with IFN-gamma. We also investigated the cellular characteristics of the precursor thymocytes responsive to IL 2 supernatants. Removal of the T3+ cells at the initiation of the culture abrogated the proliferative response and eliminated the generation of NK-like cytotoxicity. Under the same conditions, removal of the HTA1+ population increased the proliferation and did not affect the NK-like activity. Our results suggest that: (a) either IL 2 is not responsible for the induction of NK-like cytotoxicity or its action is modulated by other molecules, and (b) the precursor-responder population is preferentially included in the mature T3+ subset.",,['10.1002/eji.1830131203 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Twelve of these remissions were in patients resistant to corticosteroids or in patients who had relapsed while taking them. Thirteen of the 23 patients in whom remissions were induced and one-fifth of the patients with spontaneous remissions have relapsed to date. However, with additional treatment, a second remission was induced in 10/13. Fifty-four percent of the patients with induced remissions remained transfusion-free during most of the follow-up period. Median survival in patients with primary PRCA was greater than 10 yr, whereas in patients with secondary PRCA, it was 4 yr. Infection was a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This study demonstrates the value of a variety of immunosuppressive treatments of patients with PRCA.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",['S0006-4971(20)85402-0 [pii]'],"['AM-15555/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-95/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AM-07186/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

All had skin, orifices and gut decontamination. Fever occurred in 78% of the 216 neutropenic episodes. Overall, the incidence of septicemia during febrile episodes was 10% and the mortality from infection 7%; both figures were identical in the patients with AML and are lower than those normally found in this type of patients. Various factors that might be responsible for this low incidence of severe infections in neutropenic patients have been examined. The microbiological methods used to document infection were identical to those currently used. The severity of the underlying diseases and of neutropenia in the patients with AML was similar to that reported in other series. The measures taken for infection prevention, i.e. reverse-barrier isolation plus skin, orifices and gut decontamination, were not different than those used in many other centers, although their strict application in a small specialized unit might partially explain these favourable results. In addition the outcome of infection was analysed in relation to the response to treatment of the underlying disease. The mortality due to infection in patients with a tumor responding to chemotherapy was only 4% but was 45% in patients with end-stage malignant diseases. These results suggest therefore that infection in patients whose malignancy respond to treatment can be efficiently controlled by prompt empiric broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, and failures of antiinfectious treatment are mostly observed in patients with advanced cancer.",['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,

The native molecular weight of the enzyme is 108 000 and subunit molecular weight 50 500, suggesting that the native enzyme exists as a dimer. The enzyme exhibits a sigmoidal initial velocity vs substrate concentration curve and is regulated by allosteric effectors, dCTP and TTP. The curve relating substrate concentration to initial velocity was changed from a sigmoidal shape to a hyperbolic one by the activator dCTP, while the inhibitor TTP increased the sigmoidicity of the curve. The molecular weight of deoxycytidylate deaminase was unchanged in the presence of allosteric effectors, indicating that aggregation-disaggregation is not the basis of regulation. Deoxycytidylate deaminase exhibited the greatest affinity for the substrate dCMP, with lesser affinity for ara-CMP, and least affinity for CMP. Ara-CMP was an effective substrate in the presence of dCTP concentrations exceeding 4 microM. These data indicate that human neoplastic cell deoxycytidylate deaminase is a highly regulated allosteric enzyme, which is likely to have a significant influence on cellular dUMP, dCTP and TTP pools. These findings further suggest, that the enzyme through its influence on dUMP levels is likely to modulate the biochemical effects of pyrimidine antimetabolites active against the thymidylate synthetase reaction and in the presence of elevated dCTP pools will promote deamination of ara-CMP to the inactive ara-UMP.","['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleotide Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.12 (DCMP Deaminase)']",['10.1007/BF00849195 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

To verify the hypothesis of DTIC-induced somatic mutation(s) as the major mechanism underlying CX, studies were performed to dissociate CX from the onset of drug resistance, which was invoked in the past as an event leading to selection of preexisting immunogenic clones. Therefore, experiments were done with a DTIC-susceptible tumor line treated with DTIC and quinacrine dihydrochloride (Q), an antimutagenic compound, according to selected experimental schedules. At different transplant generations, the CX and the onset of drug resistance were evaluated. The results show that a) Q does not prevent the onset of DTIC resistance, b) DTIC-resistant clones arising after treatment with DTIC plus Q are not immunogenic, and c) CX is selectively antagonized by Q. The present data confirm that DTIC-induced immunogenicity is not the result of a selection mechanism mediated by the drug and give further support to the hypothesis that the molecular mechanism of CX may be related to somatic mutation(s).","['7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)']",,,,,,,,,,

The spleen cells from these mice (DBA/2 or BALB/c X DBA/2) were found to contain a high level of progenitor cells capable of forming granulocytic and macrophage colonies (CFU-GM). These CFU-GM, however, were different from those in the spleens of uninfected mice, as they were either very sensitive to or independent of conditioned medium. No erythroid progenitor bursts (BFU-E) or precursor (CFU-E) cells were detected in the spleens of these diseased animals. If these mice with myelomonocytic leukemia were kept alive by transfusion of red blood cells from uninfected mice, tumorigenic cell lines, capable of being transplanted, into adult mice can be isolated. Three such cell lines TTA-1, TTA-3, and TTA-9 have been established, and they retain their morphology of monocytes and macrophages as well as being positive for the monocyte-specific stain alpha-naphthyl-acetate esterase. These myelomonocytic leukemia cell lines can also be induced in culture by spleen cell-conditioned medium to differentiate into macrophages. Other conditioned media such as L-cell-conditioned medium, phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte-conditioned medium, and WEHI-3 conditioned medium were less effective in their abilities to stimulate differentiation in these myelomonocytic leukemia cell lines.","['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",['10.1002/jcp.1041170302 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

In addition, we report on chromosomal findings in 4 cases of Ph1-negative disease, one presenting with an iso17q chromosome in the positive CML.

For CML . BC, however, remission rates for VDS regimen (42.1%; 5 CRs and 3 PRs in 19 patients) and for VCR regimen (40.0%; 2 CRs and 4 PRs in 15 patients) were equivalent. Overall remission rates of VDS regimen for both diseases, twice weekly regimen (65.5%; 11 CRs and 8 PRs in 29 patients) and once weekly regimen (60.0%; 6 CRs and 3 PRs in 15 patients) were similar. Patients treated with either regimen experienced high incidence of neurotoxicity. Neurotoxic disturbance appeared severer in patients treated with VCR regimen. Incidence of leukopenia and alopecia was high in patients treated with VDS regimen. These data suggest that VDS in combination with Pred is comparable-rather superior-to VCR in combination with Pred for adult ALL and CML . BC. Less neurotoxic and sufficiently effective dosage of VDS is considered to be 2 mg/m2, once weekly.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)']",,,,,,,,,,

In view of the inavailability of recent census figures, the current population sizes of various 5-year age groups were projected from those of the last reliable census held in 1963, using various recommendations from national and international bodies on population changes in the area. On comparing the IR for the leukaemia subtypes in Ibadan subjects with those of Black and White Americans, we found no striking difference in chronic myeloid leukaemia for the 3 population groups. Leukaemia IR in Ibadan was low for all subtypes after 70 years, probably because of the thinness of the population after that age. IR of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in the first two quiquennia was low while that of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) in the second quinquennium was high in Ibadan compared with Black and White US subjects. IR of AML in Ibadan as well as in Black and White US subjects showed a stepwise increase in the 5-year age groups between 15 and 69 years, but unlike the observation in Americans, ALL was not observed after 40 years of age in Ibadan. Though the method used to estimate the leukaemia incidence rate in Ibadan was crude, it did reveal remarkable differences from those of inhibitants of a developed country like the US. These differences are believed to be related to environmental influences.",,['10.1159/000225769 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

These structures include elongated homogeneously staining regions (HSRs), small extrachromosomal paired chromatin bodies (double minutes, DMs) and abnormally banded regions (ABRs) with strong but anomalous band patterns. There is evidence that these are alternative forms of gene amplification, with HSRs breaking down to form DMs, and DMs integrating into the chromosome to generate HSRs and ABRs. Recently, it was demonstrated that, compared with several normal and leukaemia human cells, DNA sequences representing the human homologue of the onc gene of the avian myelocytomatosis virus (MC29), the so-called c-myc gene, were amplified in HL-60 cells. This is a human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line established in the laboratory of one of us (R.C.G.) at the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, Maryland) in 1977, and widely used for studies on myeloid and monocytic differentiation. Amplification of the gene was present in primary leukaemic cells of the patient, and DMs were noted in some of these cells as well as in early passages of the HL-60 line. No structure resembling HSRs or ABRs were noted in karyotypic studies at this early stage and there were no alterations involving the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q), to which the c-myc gene has recently been mapped. We have now re-examined the karyotype of the HL-60 line, using cells frozen at various times during its continuous passage at the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) to look for chromosomal abnormalities that might be associated with the amplification of c-myc. We find that, beginning in 1979, HL-60 cells at the Wistar Institute no longer had DMs, but did show an abnormal 8q+ chromosome, replacing a normal chromosome 8, and representing an ABR reflecting the site of myc gene amplification.",,['10.1038/306494a0 [doi]'],"['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-12779/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20034/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

In an attempt to investigate the significance of this translocation in the pathogenesis of CML, we have now studied two CML patients with complex translocations, t(9; 11; 22) and t(1; 9; 22), and two CML Ph1-negative patients with apparently normal karyotypes. In addition to using blot hybridization with human c-ab1 probes and DNA from rodent: CML cell hybrids as before, we have used in situ hybridization of these probes directly to metaphase chromosomes of CML patients. These studies show that the c-ab1 gene is translocated in Ph1-positive but not in Ph1-negative CML patients. CML without the Ph1 chromosome seems to be a distinct entity with a different origin, and this view is supported by clinical observations including correlations which reveal a poorer prognosis.",,['10.1038/306277a0 [doi]'],['CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

In terms of equivalents of heat-aggregated gamma globulin (eq.HAGG mg/ml serum), the mean levels of CIC were: 5.69 mg/ml (SD 4.78) in 81 normal human subjects; 22.63 mg/ml (SD 9.86) in 52 untreated CML patients; 7.61 mg/ml (SD 5.74) in 54 CML patients in remission; and 21.70 mg/ml (SD 8.15) in 18 CML patients in relapse. High CIC levels, thus, showed a significant association with the pretreatment -- and relapse -- status of the disease (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.001, respectively). Though the levels decreased during remission, they were still significantly above the mean level in the controls (p less than 0.05). The CIC level-disease status relationship was clearly evident in the serial studies on 19 CML patients who donated serum samples prior to treatment as well as during remission. Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of the CIC samples revealed the presence of a polypeptide (mol. wt approx. 37,000 and pI approx. 5.8) in 10 out of 18 CIC samples from the untreated CML patients. Such a moiety was not detected in six CIC samples from normal subjects. The association of this polypeptide with CML gains support from the observation that in 5 CML patients, this moiety was present in the CIC samples obtained prior to treatment but absent in the samples subsequently obtained during remission.",['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)'],['10.1016/0145-2126(83)90127-3 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Time to SC ranged from 2 to 16 years after initial treatment. The relative risk (RR) of acute leukemia for the patients with Hodgkin's disease as compared to the general population was 40 (P less than .001).

Although all chromosomes underwent numerical and structural rearrangements, a 14q+ marker chromosome (14q32 translocation), which was found in 31 patients, was the single most common abnormality. In terms of survival, no significant difference was noted between the 14q+ positive and negative patients. Donor chromosomes of a 14q32 translocation, which were identified in 27 patients, were quite variable. However, certain chromosomes were predisposed to act as donor chromosomes in the 14q32 translocation. An 8;14 translocation [t(8;14) (q24;q32)] was found in six patients with diffuse non-Burkitt's lymphoma and in four patients with Burkitt's lymphoma-leukemia; in all these patients a stem line or the subline with a t(8;14) had partial trisomy for 1q. An 11;14 translocation [t(11;14) (q13;q32)] was observed in one patient each with diffuse or follicular lymphoma and in two with myeloma; three of the four patients had also structural rearrangements of chromosome 1 in the same cells. A 14;18 translocation [t(14;18) (q32;q21)] was found in six patients with follicular lymphoma and in one with diffuse lymphoma; however, no common involvement of other chromosomes was detected among clones of these abnormal cells with a t(14;18). The median survival was 8 months for patients with a t(8;14) and 39 months for patients with a t(11;14). The difference between the two survival curves was of borderline significance [p = 0.06]. In contrast, patients with a t(14;18) survived significantly longer than those with a t(8;14) [p less than 0.001] or those with a t(11;14) [p = 0.03]. These findings revealed that in non-T-cell malignancies, the clinicopathologic features of the patients with a 14q+ marker depend upon the precise 14q32 translocation and the subsequent karyotypic evolution, although the translocation was not always correlated with a particular type of lymphoid malignancy.",,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, other properties of interferons were recognized, including inhibition of cell proliferation, and effects on the immune response and on expression of surface antigens. In this paper we present evidence that interferons, even the highly purified cloned IFNs, can stimulate clonogenic tumor growth in vitro. Of 225 human tumor (HT) samples tested with IFN in a clonogenic assay (HTCA), 30 (13.3%) showed growth stimulation (greater than 2 S.E. above control). The phenomenon was observed most frequently with acute myeloid leukemia (6/22 samples, 27.3%), and renal (2/10, 20%) and breast cancer (4/21, 19%), but significantly less frequent in melanomas (2/34, 5.9%). As an independent assessment of proliferation, tritiated thymidine uptake by tumor cells was measured autoradiographically in 21 patients with multiple myeloma. A significant increase of the thymidine labeling index was seen in 4 (19%) of the samples. Since this growth stimulatory effect was also observed with cell lines which lack any contaminating immunoreactive cells, there is strong evidence that interferons can directly stimulate the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells in vitro. Growth stimulation by interferons occurred preferentially with lower dosages. It is important to be cognizant of potential clinical implications of tumor growth stimulation by interferons.",['0 (Interferon Type I)'],['10.1016/0277-5379(83)90095-0 [doi]'],"['CA-17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

These mutants can be induced to differentiate by MGI-2 in medium with mouse serum. The mechanism of this induction of differentiation has been analysed by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to study changes in the synthesis of cytoplasmic proteins. In calf serum, 46 of the protein changes that were induced by MGI-2 in normally differentiating cells were constitutive in the differentiation-defective mutant cells. Treatment with mouse serum reverted 13 of these proteins from the constitutive to the non-constitutive state. This reversion was associated with a gain of inducibility for various differentiation-associated properties, so that 23 proteins were induced by MGI-2 for the same type of change as in normal differentiation. A normal developmental program requires synchrony of gene expression. The existence of constitutive instead of inducible gene expression can produce asynchrony in this program and thus produce blocks in differentiation. The results indicate that it is possible to treat these mutant cells so as to induce the reversion of specific proteins from the constitutive to the non-constitutive state, and that this can then restore the synchrony required for induction of differentiation. It is suggested that this mechanism may also allow induction of differentiation in other types of differentiation-defective cells.","['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,PMC555166,,,,,,,

We studied the effect of allopurinol on the kinetics of oral and intravenous 6-MP. Studies conducted initially in rhesus monkeys and subsequently in man with 6-MP doses of 100 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2, demonstrated that allopurinol pretreatment resulted in a nearly 400% increase in peak plasma concentration of oral 6-MP in monkeys (from a mean of 0.54 microM to a mean of 2.1 microM) and a 500% increase in man (0.74 microM to 3.7 microM). Allopurinol pretreatment also led to a 300% increase in plasma AUC in monkeys after oral 6-MP (from a mean of 121 microM/min to a mean of 391 microM/min) and a 500% increase in AUC in man (from a mean of 142 microM/min to a mean of 716 microM/min). In contrast, allopurinol pretreatment had no effect on the kinetics of intravenous 6-MP. This difference was found to be due to inhibition of first-pass metabolism of oral 6-MP as the result of the action of allopurinol on liver or intestinal xanthine oxidase. Our results indicate that, although dose reduction of oral 6-MP given in conjunction with allopurinol is appropriate, it is not necessary when 6-MP is injected intravenously.","['63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']","['0009-9236(83)90502-7 [pii]', '10.1038/clpt.1983.254 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

We conducted a phase I clinical trial of 13-cRA in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), using a single daily oral dose schedule. Seventeen patients with MDS and one each with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis were treated with 13-cRA at doses ranging from 20 to 125 mg/m2/day. Hepatotoxicity was dose-limiting and was manifested by hyperbilirubinemia and increased SGOT levels. This effect was seen only at the highest dose level of 125 mg/m2/day and was completely reversible upon cessation of the drug. Other toxic effects were mild, and included cheilosis, hyperkeratosis, stomatitis, and elevation of serum triglyceride levels. Fifteen patients with MDS were evaluable for therapeutic response. Five patients showed improvement in hematologic parameters. These responses included normalization of bone marrow blast count and increases in leukocyte count, platelet count, and/or hemoglobin concentration. Responses were generally not seen until at least 3 weeks of therapy were completed.

Bone marrow promyelocytes from the patient, prior to RA, matured morphologically in liquid culture with RA (97% maturing myeloid cells compared with 26% in control cultures at 7 days). RA-cultured cells displayed leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity and cytoplasmic maturation (by electron microscopy). Retinoic-acid-treated cells, compared to controls, demonstrated increased functional maturation, with phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan (90% versus 10%) and production of superoxide (measured by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction) in response to phorbol ester, opsonized zymosan, or the chemotaxin F-met-leu-phe. There was no evidence of active proliferation in the cultures. RA-treated cells continued to show 15;17 chromosomal translocation after 7 days in culture. The patient was treated with oral 13-cis-retinoic acid (100 mg/sq m/day) for 13 days. During that time, the peripheral white blood count rose from 300 cu mm to 6,700 cu mm, and the maturing myeloid cell count rose from 54 cu mm to 3,800 cu mm. Bone marrow maturing cells increased from 1.8% to 8.0%. Despite the increasing number of maturing myeloid cells, the patient died on day 13 from disseminated candidiasis.

These cells, in which the staining patterns were characterized by atypical granular ANAE positivity and double ANAE-chloroacetate reactions, were shown immunologically to lack the receptor and antigenic characteristics of monocytes and morphologically to be granulocytes. Isoelectric focusing, however, indicated that the atypical esterase cytochemistry of these granulocytes was due to the presence of markedly increased concentrations of ANAE isoenzymes usually found in monocytes. Atypical ANAE-staining granulocytes were particularly evident in MDS marrows showing sideroblastic erythroid changes, whilst in MA they were mainly seen in cases of intermediate severity.

The urine excreted coproporhyrin was increased, to various degrees, in the patients with CML and CLL and at the initial stage, recurrence and recidivation of AL, whereas uroporhyrin was within the norm. Coproporphyrin, excreted in the feces, was increased in all three groups of patients with leukosis and in the three stages of AL, whereas the other fractions showed no significant difference as compared with the controls. It could be concluded, from the results obtained, that porphyrins metabolism is disturbed in the patients with leukosis.","['0 (Coproporphyrins)', '0 (Levulinic Acids)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (Uroporphyrins)', '74KHC72QXK (Porphobilinogen)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,

So far, there is no indication that this phenomenon is due to an intracellular mechanism of action common to the two groups of drugs. In nearly all reported studies, acquired experimental resistance and cross-resistance are related to a decreased cellular accumulation of both types of drugs, although other factors also are involved. In Ehrlich ascites tumors, a number of findings at steady-state conditions indicate that the decreased accumulation is dependent on a cellular mechanism for active outward drug transport, which is common to anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids, but changes in inward transport and intracellular binding capacity also contribute. Similar findings have been reported for resistance and cross-resistance in P388 leukemia. Recent results with counteraction of acquired experimental resistance in animal tumors by inhibition of outward drug transport and studies on the effect of different anthracycline derivatives on accumulation of daunomycin in resistant cells are discussed.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)']",,,,,,,,,,

Baking was not required to fix NaI-immobilized mRNA to nitrocellulose. When cells dissolved in 12.2 molal NaI were filtered through nitrocellulose, mRNA became selectively bound (quickblot). The quick-blot system utilizing protease and detergents to prepare cells for NaI solubilization was especially suitable in quantitative, rapid screening of cells for expression of specific genes.

Thirty-five children with newly diagnosed ALL and 10 children receiving antileukemic chemotherapy developed 13 episodes of verified septicemia. Newly diagnosed ALL alone influenced the CRP level moderately; half of the children with no concomitant bacterial infection had measurable CRP values. However, the CRP values in this group were significantly lower than those in children with proved septicemia in whom the CRP level ranged from 15 to 340 mg/liter (median, 125 mg/liter). We conclude that CRP levels exceeding 100 mg/liter indicate bacterial septicemia with a high specificity regardless of the stage of ALL. Moreover, a negative CRP value virtually excludes septicemia. Patients ith moderately elevated CRP values, i.e. under 100 mg/liter, should be closely observed.

However, the phenomena of liver toxicity which are encountered at diagnosis and during treatment of pediatric neoplasias, are numerous and of complex nature, quite often of difficult explanation. The authors have distinguished: - primitive benign and malign tumors of the liver; - toxic effects dependent from the neoplastic infiltration of tumors arising in extrahepatic sites; - toxicity not related to neoplastic infiltration. Several cases of different solid neoplasias are described, which exemplify the several modes by which the liver can be affected by tumors, and the possible etiopathogenetic mechanisms are searched for. In addition, the authors refer on the aspects of liver toxicity observed in a series of 44 children affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia. They distinguish a toxicity which precedes treatment; - a toxicity which arises during the induction-consolidation phase of therapy; - a toxicity which comes out during maintenance with Methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine, this latter strictly correlated to the continuous administration of these two drugs. Finally, the complicated correlation between acute hepatitis and leukemia is discussed, and the attention is focused particularly on the possible antileukemic affect of the acute liver infection, which is capable to determine, in few well described cases, a complete, although transient disease remission.",,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reports an analysis of the incidence and survival of all cases of childhood cancer registered in New Zealand from 1961 to 1976. The overall incidence was very similar to that reported by American registries, but higher than in Britain. Survival rates in New Zealand for children with lymphoma and leukaemia were rather poorer than in Britain as a whole, and appreciably worse than in Manchester and in selected regions of the USA. For most other malignancies, survival rates were similar to those in Britain. Survival rates in New Zealand were improving during the period of this study. The possible advantage of centralising treatment was examined by comparing the survival of children treated in the largest centre (Auckland--with 32% of all cases) and in other parts of the country. Children treated in Auckland generally had a longer remission, but experienced no significant advantage in five-year survival. This lack of advantage was not due to referrals from outside the region or to differences in racial composition.",,,,,,,,,,,

Neither cell line metabolized VLB, nor selectively retained any radioactive impurities. There was an apparent ""instantaneous"" accumulation of VLB by cells of both lines, resulting in cell to medium ratios greater than 1.0 within 1 sec after drug addition. Experiments between 0 and 60 sec revealed that the presumed undirectional initial rate of VLB accumulation by resistant cells, termed CEM/VLB100, was about one-half that of sensitive CEM cells. In experiments carried out over 60 min, the VLB-resistant cells accumulated considerably less [3H]VLB than did the sensitive cells. Drug accumulation by both cell lines was temperature-sensitive, since incubation of cells at 4 degrees resulted in only minimal uptake beyond that observed at zero time. CEM/VLB100 cells retained less drug than did CEM cells, apparently because of a larger fraction of readily releasable VLB compared with CEM cells. The accumulation of VLB by either cell line was related in part to cellular levels of ATP. Although depletion of ATP was associated with decreased accumulation of VLB by CEM cells, it was related to enhanced drug accumulation by CEM/VLB100 cells. Restoration of ATP levels to near control values by addition of glucose also had opposite effects on the two cell lines, causing further accumulation of VLB by the sensitive line but leading to apparent drug efflux from the resistant line. Potentially competing substrates (VM-26, colchicine, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin) failed to block this glucose-mediated release of VLB from the CEM/VLB100 cells. In experiments with energy-depleted CEM/VLB100 cells preloaded with VLB and then incubated in drug-free medium, initial drug loss was shown to be independent of cellular metabolism, being roughly the same for both metabolically intact and metabolically depleted cells. Glucose (energy) was required only for subsequent release of what appeared to be a more tightly bound cell-associated fraction of VLB. Results of zero-time binding studies tended to confirm that VLB binding by resistant cells has two components, one requiring and the other not requiring metabolic energy. Differences in the proportions of these two components between the sensitive and resistant cells suggest a mechanism for resistance to VLB and similar compounds.","['0 (Azides)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

A third analogue has an extra quinone function at C-8 of the oxazole analogue. In all the analogues the chemical integrity of the peptide lactones of the parent antibiotic is kept intact, but their sterochemistry is altered. The analogues are designed as transport-modified prodrug forms of either the tricyclic active analogues of actinomycin D or actinomycin D itself. All analogues exhibit cytotoxicity that is several-fold less potent than AMD; they also have no binding affinity toward extracellular DNA. Nonetheless, the analogues of the first and the third series show improved antitumor activities (P388 leukemia, CDF1 mice). In fact, two of these analogues having a phenyl substituent at the C-3 site of the oxazinone ring or the C-2 position of the 8-oxo-8H-oxazole ring exhibit the highest antitumor effects. Most of the analogues are active over a broader dose range than actinomycin D and are 6- to 16-fold less cytotoxic to human lymphoblastic leukemia (CCFR-CEM) cells in vitro. The analogues with the most pronounced antitumor activity are those that retain most elements in the peptide stereochemistry of actinomycin D and have a quinone function or demonstrate susceptibility of their chromophores to biotransformation.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",['10.1021/jm00365a015 [doi]'],['CA26281/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

This strain distribution pattern is different from that for H-2, Gpd-1 (linked to Fv-1), Fv-2, Rfv-3, and Cv (linked to Rmcf) but the same as that for Bv, the endogenous ecotropic virus of C57BL/6.

We conclude: (a) the major C57BL/6 gene for resistance to F-MuLV erythroblastosis is different from previously identified Friend virus restriction loci; (b) latency for F-MuLV leukemias is controlled by more than one gene; and (c) latency and susceptibility to F-MuLV erythroblastosis are not inherited concordantly in the CXB-RI strains.",['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],['10.1084/jem.158.5.1693 [doi]'],,PMC2187123,,,,,,,

Listed in order of decreasing PN production, PN was detected in media conditioned by the following cell types: human foreskin fibroblasts (0.18 micrograms/10(6) cells), rat embryo heart muscle cells (0.13 micrograms/10(6) cells), mouse myotubes (0.1 micrograms/10(6) cells), monkey kidney epithelial cells, human fibrosarcoma cells, human lung fibroblasts, simian virus 40 (SV-40)-transformed human fibroblasts, human epidermoid carcinoma cells, bovine aortic endothelial cells (only after phorbol ester treatment), and mouse myoblasts. No PN was found in medium conditioned by mouse 3T3 cells, SV40 virus-transformed 3T3 cells, human lymphoblasts, or mouse leukemia cells. Eleven of the cell types examined for secretion of PN were also examined for the presence of cytoplasmic thrombin-binding factors. Lysates from all of these cell types contained a factor that formed approximately 60-65 K Da sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-stable complexes with [125I] thrombin. This MW is significantly lower than that of [125I] thrombin-PN complexes, indicating that the factor is distinct from PN. Nevertheless, PN and the cytoplasmic factor share similarities. Production of both PN (by HF cells and WI-26 cells) and the cytoplasmic factor (by HF cells and 3T3 cells) are stimulated by epidermal growth factor and phorbol myristate acetate.

The increase in splenic CFU-e and BFU-e was related to development of splenomegaly, the latter being a characteristic feature of murine oncornavirus infection. Both splenic and marrow RLV-derived CFU-e were erythropoietin (Ep) dependent. However, splenic and marrow RLV-derived BFU-e proliferation occurred at Ep levels considered suboptimal for normal colony formation. This increased erythroid stem cell proliferation may be due in part to the increased demand on erythropoiesis as a result of the profound fatal anemia which occurs in RLV-induced erythroleukemia.

These results suggest that GTP depletion represents a common target of purine antimetabolites in mammalian cells.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",['10.1007/BF00254259 [doi]'],['CA 27866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Human peripheral and rat peritoneal macrophages were employed as controls for the TPA-induced counterpart. Labeling of the carbonyl carbon (C-1) was determined by Schmidt degradation and used to distinguish between chain elongation of pre-existing cellular fatty acids and de novo synthesis. Cultured leukemia cells and the TPA-derived macrophage only incorporated from 16% to 23% of the total radioactivity into the C-1 position, indicating an operable de novo pathway. Cells differentiated by exposure to DMSO displayed a preference for the chain elongation mechanism (89% 14C in C-1 position) of fatty acid synthesis. Both rat peritoneal and human peripheral macrophages likewise incorporated greater than 80% of the radioactivity in the C-1 position of the fatty acyl chains.

The response to remission maintenance therapy varies widely. We investigated the relationship between red blood cell 6-thioguanine nucleotide, a metabolite of 6-mercaptopurine, and myelosuppression in 22 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in remission. The peripheral neutrophil count was used as an index of myelosuppression. 6-Mercaptopurine dose was related to 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentration (r = 0.4; P less than 0.001; n = 90; y = 18.51 + 0.36 x). Large individual variations around the regression line are observed. Neither 6-mercaptopurine dose nor 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentration was related to the neutrophil count at the time of sampling (day 0) or 7 days later. Both 6-mercaptopurine dose and 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentration correlated with the neutrophil count at day 14 (r = -0.33; P less than 0.01; n = 90 and r = -0.3; P less than 0.01; n = 90 respectively). This delay is compatible with a cytotoxic action on bone marrow stem cells. Excluding children with other, uncontrolled, potentially myelosuppressive influences the correlation between 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentration and neutropenia improved (r = -0.6; P less than 0.001; n = 37). A significant degree of neutropenia was observed by day 14 if the 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentration (day 0) was greater than 210 pmol/8 X 10(8) RBCs. The assay of 6-thioguanine nucleotide may highlight those individuals with pharmacokinetic resistance. Two children on continuous high dose 6-mercaptopurine, had low red blood cell 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations and neutropenia was not observed.","['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",['10.1111/j.1365-2125.1983.tb02178.x [doi]'],,PMC1428034,,,,,,,

Hence, benzene has been included in the list of human carcinogens. Acute myeloblastic leukemia and erythroleukemia are typical examples of benzene leukemia. Most cases show some features in common: 1) development after many years of exposure and, in some cases many months after leaving the toxic atmosphere; 2) leucopenia or moderate degree of leucocytosis; and 3) splenohepatomegaly discrete or absent. Finding of an antecedent of pancytopenia reinforces the suspicion of benzene as the causative agent. There is still no agreement about the role played by benzene in chronic types of leukemia. In assessing diagnosis of benzene leukemia much importance has been attached by French authors and by myself to the demonstration of benzene in blood or in bone marrow aspirates or biopsies. Treatment of benzene hemopathy based on the oral administration of ""anti-benzene compounds"" such as methyl-donors and thiol-aminoacids is proposed here based on personal research in rabbits, in leukemic patients treated by benzene in the past and on myself as a volunteer. In pre-leukemic states, lowering the benzene burden of the bone marrow might prevent the further development of acute leukemia. Recently, I found out that: 1) benzene can be converted to phenol in the bone marrow independently of liver oxidizing enzymes; 2) benzene injected in the femoral artery of the rabbit can provoke histological changes at the isolated tibial marrow.",['J64922108F (Benzene)'],['10.1007/978-3-642-69083-9_6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

However, a hitherto unappreciated complication consisting of a secondary malignancy, in particular acute leukemia, has emerged. Prolonged therapy with alkylating agents and chemotherapy plus radiotherapy are associated with an increased risk of this complication. The disease evolves through a preleukemic phase of pancytopenia and sideroblastic refractory anemia. The median onset from the initiation of chemotherapy is about 5 years with an increasing incidence with time. Myelomonocytic, monocytic and erythroleukemia with atypical features and resistance to conventional therapy predominate. Hyploidy and aberrations involving chromosomes 5 and 7 are frequent. Alkylating agents are carcinogenic in laboratory animals. Although the pathway to leukemogenesis in humans is unknown, a multistep evolution is envisaged. This involves: 1) initiation through induction of errors in DNA, 2) promotion related to stem cell replication following chemotherapy-induced aplasia and 3) propagation related to immunosuppression. It is possible that, as in myeloproliferative disorders, an underlying tendency for leukemia is present in patients with cancer. This may be accentuated by chemotherapy, and more frequently observed due to the longer survival of such patients. The crucial role of chemotherapy in leukemogenesis is evident from data accumulated in non-malignant conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.","['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",['10.1007/978-3-642-69083-9_2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Thirty-eight percent of the males and 32% of the females fulfilled criteria for assignment to the group with an increased risk. A linear multiple regression analysis on the material showed that WBC was the most important prognostic criterion, followed by sex, age, and mediastinal mass. The prognosis was significantly poorer for males in the standard risk (p less than 0.03) and in the increased risk group (p less than 0.0001).

The therapeutic implications of this observation are worth investigating. A few case-reports have shown that low dose ARA-C can be useful for treatment of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, no information is available yet on the proportion of patients who can be expected to respond. We treated by low dose ARA-C (20-30 mg/sqm/day i.v. or i.m. for 7-10 days) 20 consecutive patients. A complete remission of 5 months was obtained in one of nine cases of subacute myeloid leukemia (SAML). A partial remission (complete normalization of blood counts with a slight excess of marrow blast cells) was obtained twice in one of 11 cases of MDS. An increase of Hb level (more than 11.5 g/dl) was obtained and maintained for 12 months in a case of MDS. A short-lasting increase of granulocyte count was obtained in another two cases of MDS and SAML respectively. It is suggested that low dose ARA-C can advantageously modify the proliferation to maturation imbalance of leukemic cells by slowing down cell proliferation rate.

Median survival time was 8 months for the Ph1 +/- 7 group, 5.5 months for the Ph1 +/other group and 9.0 months for the Ph1 +/alone group. These patients with Ph1 + AL had higher white blood cell counts, increased extramedullary disease and poorer responses to therapy than usual for patients with AL. The deletion of chromosome 7 and the acquisition of the Ph1 chromosome identifies a group of patients with characteristics similar to all the patients with Ph1 + AL but a poor response to therapy and short remission duration.",,"['0145-2126(83)90046-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(83)90046-2 [doi]']","['CA137117/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28153-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

P24 release by C-ALL cells was detected using a solid phase indirect radioimmunometric assay (IRA) which combines the specificity of lectins and monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and using immunoadsorption of labeled P24 in spent medium from cells incubated with 35S-methionine (met). No P24 was present in the medium of cells pulse labeled at 37 degrees C when they were placed at 4 degrees C, thus this is an active process. P24 release by NB cells could not be detected by IRA, but could be detected by immunoadsorption of spent medium of metabolically-labeled cells. The absence of IRA activity of P24 from NB spent medium was due to decreased glycosylation and thus no binding to the lectins employed in the IRA was observed. This was confirmed by lectin affinity chromatography which showed that P24 in the spent medium from C-ALL cells bound Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA1), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), concanavalin A (Con A), and lentil lectin (LcH), but not peanut agglutinin (PNA). P24 from NB cell spent medium did not bind to any of these lectins. The lectin affinity of P24 derived from lymphoblasts is consistent with the presence of N-linked oligosaccharide chains having N-acetyl glucosamine residues, a mannose core, and a terminal D-galactose. P24 from C-ALL cell spent medium was present in the 35-45% fraction of a saturated ammonium sulfate (SAS) partition of spent medium. The P24 antigen was detected in the fractionated plasma of five patients with C-ALL at the time of diagnosis and was undetectable when the patients had achieved a complete remission. Plasma from 2 patients with P24 negative ALL, normal human plasma, and normal human serum had no detectable activity.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']","['0145-2126(83)90045-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(83)90045-0 [doi]']","['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 05584/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

SJ-9A4 reacted with C-ALL, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), platelets and C-ALL neuroblastoma (NB) and the K562 cell lines. It had no significant reactivity with erythrocytes, granulocytes, circulating T or B lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytic cell lines or a Ewing's sarcoma cell line. SJ-9A4 was shown to recognize the same region as two other MoAb to the p24 antigen, BA-2 and DU-ALL-1, as demonstrated by their ability to inhibit the binding of labeled SJ-9A4 to NALM-1 and NB cells. Other MoAb: J5, PI 153/3 and monoclonal anti-HLA-DR antibodies gave no inhibition. A solid phase indirect radioimmunometric assay (IRA) was developed which enabled the detection of P24 from C-ALL cells, utilizing its ability to bind the Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA1) or wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and SJ-9A4 simultaneously. When BA-2 and DU-ALL-1 were used in place of SJ-9A4, similar IRA results were obtained. Using the RCA1/SJ-9A4-IRA, P24 from as few as 1.6 X 10(4) cells of a C-ALL cell line could be detected; however, similar extracts of NB cell lines were negative despite high levels of SJ-9A4 binding to intact cells. The presence of P24 in NB extracts was demonstrated by (1) preincubation of NB extracts with SJ-9A4 which blocked MoAb binding to P24 and (2) immunoadsorption of P24 from solubilized membranes of 35S-methionine (met) labeled NB cells. Treatment of NB cells with neuraminidase did not result in IRA binding when either RCA1 or WGA were used as the solid phase lectin indicating that the differences in lectin affinity are not due to over sialation of NB membrane glycoproteins. These findings demonstrate a difference in the glycosylation of P24 from C-ALL and NB cells.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)']","['0145-2126(83)90044-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(83)90044-9 [doi]']","['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05584/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

An antigenic pattern analogous to that of the native HL60 cell line was found in C12 and C13 populations using three monoclonal antibodies differently reactive to myeloid cells. Both clones can be induced to differentiate by retinoic acid (RA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The pattern of differentiation was assessed by morphological, cytochemical, phenotypical and functional markers. Differentiation of C12 cells by RA and TPA was similar to that observed with native HL60 cells, whereas C13 cells showed lower degrees of sensitivity to RA and TPA. The data presented suggest the existence of different mechanisms for induction of differentiation by Me2SO, RA and TPA.

LS-2 cells exposed to maximum inhibitor concentrations largely maintained the initial thymidine incorporation rate for about 40 hr but failed to enter logarithmic growth. Isoxanthopterin inhibition was found only in serum-free medium, since it is trapped by the alpha-acid glycoprotein present in the serum.

The covalently labeled glucocorticoid receptors were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). In cytosolic fractions prepared from rat thymic lymphocytes, [3H]-dexamethasone-21-mesylate labels a protein (Mr approximately equal to 95,000) which was identified as the glucocorticoid receptor by the following criteria: (a) labeling of this moiety is inhibited by treatment with a 100-fold molar excess of glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide; and (b) the covalently labeled Mr approximately equal to 95,000 protein is activated (by heating at 20 degrees for 30 min) to a form that binds to DNA-cellulose. When intact thymocytes are treated with [3H]dexamethasone-21-mesylate, an Mr approximately equal to 95,000 moiety is also labeled covalently. Approximately 35% of the glucocorticoid receptors can be labeled covalently when intact thymocytes are treated with 100 nM [3H]dexamethasone-21-mesylate for 30 min at 4 degrees. Neoplastic cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant lymphoma were treated with [3H]dexamethasone-21-mesylate.

Cytostatic concentrations of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine induced an S-phase block, while 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) and tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) induced a cycle-nonspecific block.

At concentrations of 0.3 to 20 microM, all of these nucleosides were toxic to nondividing peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting that in these cells their mechanism of action does not involve reactions associated with DNA replication. Inhibition of polyadenylated RNA metabolism by triphosphate derivatives of adenosine analogues may account for lymphocytotoxicity in nondividing cells, but the demonstrated diverse effects of these nucleosides on nucleic acid metabolism in dividing cells preclude elucidation of the mechanism of the unique induction of G1-phase arrest by 2'-deoxyadenosine.","['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,,,,,,

The hemoglobin was 11.8 g/dL and the platelet count was 427.5 X 10(9)/L. With minimal and unsustained treatment, abrupt resolution of the lymphocytosis occurred with reciprocal emergence of a classic picture of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). During the hematologic evolution, blood lymphoid cells were isolated for surface marker, cytogenetic, and functional studies. E-rosette receptors, Fc-receptors, and membrane immunoglobulins were found on only 7.5%, 7.4%, and 10.0% of these cells. These cells also failed to express a CLL-associated antigen we have detected on approximately equal to 95% of the cells of all CLL patients studied, regardless of cell phenotype. In addition, the patient's lymphoid cells responded poorly to leucoagglutinin (LPHA) stimulation, showed increased spontaneous metabolic activity and exhibited the Philadelphia chromosome.

Twenty-two of 25 patients (88%) achieved complete remission (CR) (median duration 16 months), and six of them were alive, relapse-free, and off therapy after 36-81 months, with a 26% projected 6-year relapse-free survival. In 97 patients with E-SmIg- ALL, who were treated at the same Institutions, over the same period of time, and by the same modalities, the outcome of therapy was almost identical: CR 80%, median duration of first CR 15 months, projected 6-year relapse-free survival 15%. The white blood cell (WBC) count at presentation influenced significantly and to the same degree first CR length in both E+ and E- cases. In this adult series, WBC count was not as high as in children. Moreover, a high Hb concentration, a very high WBC count, lymphadenomegaly, and mediastinal involvement, were found more frequently in adolescents and young adults than in adults. Based on these data, it is suggested that in adults E-rosetting as such is not a marker of a poorer prognosis, that some of the typical features of children E+ ALL weaken with age, and that in adults the disease can have a less aggressive character.",,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1983.tb01250.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

The glycoproteins of detergent-solubilized whole cells were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and their lectin-binding properties determined by incubation of the fixed gels with radioiodinated lectins. Normal granulocytes and leukaemic myeloid cells in different stages of maturation possess a cell-surface sialic acid-rich glycoprotein of apparent mol.wt. 115 000 (GP115), that can be labelled by both the lactoperoxidase and periodate/NaB3H4 cell-surface labelling techniques. The sialoglycoprotein of leukaemic myeloblasts has a slightly lower apparent mol.wt., 112000 (GP112). After neuraminidase treatment before cell solubilization, both GP115 and GP112 bind the lectins from Arachis hypogaea (peanut) and Helix pomatia (snail) and have an increased apparent molecular weight of 125000. Two concanavalin A-binding glycoproteins of apparent mol.wts. 98000 and 90000 are present in leukaemic myeloblasts. Concanavalin A binding to these glycoproteins is decreased in more mature leukaemic cells and absent in granulocytes. As concanavalin A binding decreases in the maturer forms, there is a concomitant increase in the binding of Ricinus communis (castor bean) and Maclura aurantiaca (osage orange) lectins to these glycoproteins. Whole granulocytes, but not leukaemic myeloblasts, contain a major cell-surface concanavalin A binding glycoprotein of apparent mol.wt. 130000, which is labelled by the periodate/NaB3H4 technique. Concanavalin A binding to this glycoprotein increases as the morphology of leukaemic cells approaches that of mature granulocytes.","['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",['10.1042/bj2130661 [doi]'],,PMC1152181,,,,,,,

Numerous facts have been described in relation to cancer biology with PGs. The purpose of our study lies in the creation of anti-tumor PGs. We have described that PGD2 has strong cell growth inhibitory activity; furthermore, we discovered that PGJ2, 9-deoxy-delta 9-PGD2, has 3 times stronger activity than the mother compound, PGD2. In vivo experiments showed that only PGA2 and PGJ2 exert antitumor activity. Thus, cyclopentenone ring structure in PG seems to be an essential moiety for cytotoxicity of PG. On the basis of the above facts, we propose tha name of antineoplastic PGs for PGA and PGJ derivatives which have cyclopentenone ring. Recently, we developed several antineoplastic PGs which showed IC50 value less than 0.3 microgram/ml against L1210 leukemia cells, and these compounds also showed antitumor activity against Ehrlich ascites tumor in vivo comparable to that of cyclophosphamide. The action mechanism seems to be in its alkylation activity of the cyclopentenone structure and not in receptor-cAMP route. Spectrum of anti-tumor activity and its toxicity in vivo are now under investigation.

In the E+ group, CNS relapse was more frequent, and relapse occurred at, or sooner after, diagnosis and was more frequently followed shortly thereafter by bone marrow relapse. In addition, the E+ group was more likely to present with focal neurologic syndromes with or without blasts in the cerebrospinal fluid, in contrast to the more common features of diffuse meningeal leukemia with increase in intracranial pressure. These observations suggest that the E-rosette-positive lymphoblasts are more likely to infiltrate into nerve and brain tissue rather than invade the meninges diffusely.

Folate polyglutamates were poor substrates for the efflux mechanism for monoglutamates in L1210 mouse leukemia cells, with negligible loss of preformed folate polyglutamates to the medium over four hours. Disruption of folate metabolism with methotrexate did not augment efflux of folate polyglutamates. Folylpolyglutamate synthetase, partially purified from mouse liver, was found to accept a variety of folate derivatives as substrates, including pteroic acid and methotrexate; however, the concentration of these substrates that saturated the reaction varied considerably. The enzyme that catalyzed the addition of glutamic acid to methotrexate and to the naturally-occurring folate monoglutamates appeared to be the same. The cytotoxicity of folylpolyglutamate synthetase inhibitors was predicted to require continued cell division since their effects would be based upon a decreased rate of synthesis of folate cofactors capable of retention by the cell membrane.

(1983) Nature (London) 303, 528-530]. Although the histamine content and the number of IgE receptors in these variants are similar to those of the parental cells, they cannot be stimulated immunologically to allow Ca(2+) influx and to degranulate. In contrast, the Ca(2+) ionophore A23187 causes these variants to degranulate, indicating that the mechanism distal to the Ca(2+) gating is intact in the variants. The cromolyn binding protein (CBP), present in the membranes of RBL-2H3 cells, has recently been isolated by affinity chromatography under nondenaturing conditions. In the current study we have used Sendaivirus envelopes as fusogenic carriers to implant the purified CBP into the membrane of variant basophils that were defective in it. This fusion leads to the restoration of Ca(2+) uptake and degranulation capacity of the variants after IgE-mediated stimulation. These restored activities seem to show a sigmoidal dependence on the amount of incorporated CBP. Saturation values comparable to those of the parental line are reached when the level of implanted CBP approaches its density on the latter line. The restored capacity is due to the implanted CBP, because the reinstated immunological response can be blocked by the inhibitory drug cromolyn and by monoclonal antibodies specific to CBP, both shown to prevent Ca(2+) uptake and degranulation in mast cells and parental RBL-2H3 cells. These results point out that CBP plays an important role in the Ca(2+) gating process resulting in degranulation.","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (cromolyn binding protein, rat)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",['10.1073/pnas.80.19.6014 [doi]'],,PMC534350,,,,,,,

Because osteoclasts are very likely derived from a member(s) of the mononuclear phagocyte family, we determined if 1,25(OH)2D3 promotes maturation of these cells by studying its effects on the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. Of the vitamin D3 metabolites tested, only 1,25(OH)2D3, at 10(-10) to 10(-7) M, induces the differentiation of HL60 into mono- and multinucleated macrophage-like cells. Phenotypic change is evident within 24 hr and reaches a plateau between 72 and 96 hr of incubation. The changes are metabolite-specific and include (i) adherence to substrate, (ii) acquisition of the morphological features of mature monocytes, (iii) a 4- to 6-fold enhancement in lysozyme synthesis and secretion, (iv) increase in the fraction of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase-positive cells from approximately 2% to 100% of the population, and (v) the acquisition of several monocyte-associated cell surface antigens.

Each species has been highly purified; the activities in the first and second peaks were associated with polypeptides of Mr 150,000 and 175,000, respectively. Analysis of substrate specificity with synthetic DNAs and restriction fragments of phi X174 replicative form DNA and pBR322 DNA showed that neither enzyme had dependence on the sequence context of CpG dinucleotides; poly(dG-dC) had the greatest methyl-accepting activity of any unmethylated DNA substrate tested. De novo methylation by both enzymes was inefficient relative to methylation of hemimethylated sites. Methyl-accepting activity was strongly dependent on DNA chain length. This observation suggests that binding to DNA, followed by one-dimensional diffusion of enzyme along the DNA molecule, is important in the mechanism by which DNA methyltransferase locates its recognition sites.","['0 (Isoenzymes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']",['10.1073/pnas.80.18.5559 [doi]'],['AM13945/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC384297,,,,,,,

For two of these species, which code for polypeptides P40 and P21, the proportion of molecules engaged in translation decreases rapidly after exposure of the cells to dimethyl sulfoxide. The extent of utilization of a third species, the P36 mRNA, is not altered. The rate of production of the P40 mRNA does not appear to be affected in the dimethyl sulfoxide-treated cells. The P21 mRNA appears to be produced in increasing amounts, leading to a large accumulation of untranslated molecules in the cytoplasm. The mRNA for actin remains nearly fully utilized during this process, but its intracellular concentration decreases, thus resulting in a reduction in the amounts present in polysomes. The results indicate that some mRNA species in mouse tumor cells are subject to a translational repression process that can serve to regulate selectively the extent of expression of the corresponding genes.","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",['10.1128/mcb.3.7.1197-1203.1983 [doi]'],['GM17973/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC370110,,,,,,,

In the patients, colony formation of bone marrow cells after 7 days of incubation was significantly increased compared to a representative control group. The proliferation of microclusters after 3 incubation days was also markedly enhanced, and accelerated proliferation of all aggregates (microclusters, macroclusters and colonies) could be demonstrated in culture with the patients' bone marrow cells. The use of autologous feeder layers and autologous serum showed no inhibitory effect on colony formation. The proportion of eosinophil colonies formed with the patients' bone marrow cells was in the normal range. In contrast to the high proliferation capacity of bone marrow precursor cells the CFU-c number of peripheral blood was significantly decreased in the patients' group. No significant correlation between CFU-c number of bone marrow and blood cells could be found.

A comparison is made here between the MI and the results of surface marker analysis with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (McAb) in the immunofluorescence technique. The McAb applied in 46 AML patients (greater than or equal to 15 years) were granulocyte specific (MI/N1, UJ 308, B4-3, B13-9), granulocyte-monocyte specific (OKM-1, B2-12) or had specificity for the Ia-like antigen (OKI-1), 'T-cells' (3A1), immature cells (OKT-10) or platelets (C17-28). In 32 of these patients more McAb could be investigated with specificities for granulocytes (VIM-D5), granulocytes-monocytes (RUPI-5), monocytes (MONO BRL, RUPI-4), erythrocytes (VIE-G4) and AML cells (VIM-S8). An increase in surface marker expression evident from the reaction with a number of McAb (UJ 308, B2-12, OKM-1 and OKI-1) paralleled the rise of the MI in FAB M5. A decrease of the expression of antigen detected by OKI-1 paralleled the rise of the MI in FAB M1-3. The granulocyte or monocyte specific McAb, as they are determined on normal human peripheral blood cells, did not distinguish between FAB M1-3 and M5.

These populations include the thymocyte precursor cells, i.e. prothymocytes, and immunoactivated T lymphocytes. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and malignant cells from part of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were also found to be highly sensitive to the in vitro cortisol induced lysis. The leukemic cells from all acute and chronic myeloid leukemias and from some acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were found to be completely resistant to cortisol-induced lysis, even at the super pharmacological levels of the hormone. The lysis of the sensitive cell populations was specifically induced by glucocorticoids but not by other steroid hormones. Studies of the cytolic process showed high-affinity binding of the cortisol molecule to specific cytoplasmic receptor, and implied induction of ""autolytic protein"" synthesis. It is suggested that the observed in vitro cortisol-induced lysis accounts for part of the clinical effects of glucocorticoids.

We found that this effect involves a rapid increase in phosphorylation of a 17-kDa protein (pp17, pI approximately 5.5) and a 27-kDa protein (pp27, pI approximately 5.5) as detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Within 15 min there was 5- to 7-fold and 3- to 4-fold increase in the phosphorylation of pp17 and pp27, respectively. The rate of phosphorylation remained accelerated over a period of 60-min incubation with PMA. In contrast to these specific changes, there was no effect of PMA on total 32Pi incorporation into HL-60 cells during the same period. The phosphoester bond of the pp17, but not of pp27, revealed a remarkable stability to alkali treatment of the electrophoretic gels. However, phosphoamino acid analysis showed that both pp17 and pp27 proteins are phosphorylated only at serine residues. These two phosphoproteins were located exclusively in the cytosol and were absent from the crude membrane fraction. We further demonstrated that several inactive derivatives of phorbol ester failed to cause an increase in phosphorylation of pp17 and pp27, suggesting that these specific phosphorylation events are intimately related to the induction of differentiation in HL-60 cells by PMA.","['0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['S0021-9258(17)44526-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,

Differentiation was determined by an increase in the percentage of morphologically mature cells, in lysozyme and nonspecific esterase activities, and in reactivity with the murine OKM1 monoclonal antibody. Two HL-60 cell variants, designated as R-80 and B-II, were also examined. R-80 cells, which are resistant to induction of cell differentiation by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, also exhibited resistance, although to a lesser degree, to induction of cell differentiation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The resistance to the action of the two compounds is presumably not due to similar binding sites for the two inducers, since 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was unable to compete for the phorbol diester binding sites as measured by [3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate binding.

AML in such patients is usually considered untreatable with standard aggressive chemotherapy in part because these patients are often elderly, but primarily because of the concern that the bone marrow of these patients no longer has a residual stem cell to repopulate the bone marrow following chemotherapy-induced aplasia. The authors treated three patients (ages 72, 69, and 62 years, respectively) with intensive chemotherapy after RDA evolved into AML. Each patient had been pancytopenic for 3 to 15 months prior to their transition to AML. At the onset of therapy for AML, all were severely pancytopenic with greater than 50% myeloblasts in the bone marrow.

The cytotoxic effect was related to the ease with which ACM and its metabolites accumulate in the nucleus. Cellular uptake and nuclear incorporation are influenced by the hexopyranoses linked to aklavinone (AKV) and by the two methyls linked to the L-rhodosamine amino groups. The effect of ACM and its metabolites on macromolecular synthesis depended on the drug concentrations and the exposure time. ACM was the most active in the inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis whereas it had no direct effect on protein synthesis even at high drug concentrations. When cells were treated for a short time with low drug concentrations (1 microM), RNA synthesis was inhibited to a greater extent than DNA synthesis. But when incubated for longer periods, inhibition of DNA synthesis increased further. RNA and DNA syntheses were both inhibited to about the same extent only when cells were exposed to the higher drug concentrations (10 microM). We conclude therefore that at low drug concentrations the effect on DNA synthesis is probably a consequence of RNA synthesis inhibition. The early DNA synthesis inhibition which occurs at higher drug concentrations may result from the direct action on the cellular genome.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)']","['0006-2952(83)90044-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(83)90044-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

Faster recovery of granulopoiesis was observed by pretreating recipients with RBC hypertransfusion and/or OK-432 (Picibanil, biological products of beta-streptococci.) In experimental mice, higher granulocyte counts could be maintained with hypertransfusion in the peripheral blood, and the recovery of granulopoietic series and CFU-S of bone marrow cells were found to be more rapid after cyclophosphamide administration. OK-432 also resulted in higher peripheral granulocyte, whereas the total nucleated cell counts and CFU-S were decreased in the bone marrow, suggesting sparing bone marrow granulocyte reserve and its migration to the peripheral blood. The mechanism of higher granulocyte count after hypertransfusion was not clearly explained but it was considered that erythroid suppression caused colateral flow of multipotential stem cells to granulopoiesis. The effect of both combinations was unexpectedly less significant in the recovery of granulopoiesis, but it was thought that the optimal time interval should be sought between pretreatment and the administration of anti-neoplastic agents. The clinical use of hyper transfusion and OK-432 also proved the alleviation of granulocytopenia, and rapid granulocyte recovery at the time of consolidation therapy among children with AML.","['0 (Biological Products)', '39325-01-4 (Picibanil)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,

Twelve compounds of diverse modes of action were examined using standard protocols of the National Cancer Institute. Median survival time and median tumor diameter were the parameters used for determining any synergistic effects of DMSO when it was ingested in the drinking water and the drug administered parenterally. The continuous ingestion of DMSO alone mixed in drinking water at concentrations between 0.25-32% was not toxic and had no effect on the tumor. Although the intraperitoneal inoculation of drugs into animals ingesting DMSO did not enhance drug effectiveness, when both DMSO and drug were added to the drinking water, it did increase antineoplastic potency. DMSO ingestion also inhibited the tumor growth rate of several parenterally administered drugs even though these same compounds failed to prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing rats. The toxicity of 12 compounds when combined with DMSO was only moderately increased in four instances. Orally ingested DMSO was found to cause a twofold increase in the concentration of labeled CPA in plasma, brain, and liver tissues. This elevation persisted for approximately two to three hours but subsequently returned to the same level as that observed in water-fed rodents.

High leukocyte yields were obtained using a variety of differential centrifugation techniques with a mean WBC yield/transfusion of 95 X 10(9) (range 19-275). A mean of 2.5 transfusions (range 1-11) were administered/recipient with a mean total dose of 235 X 10(9) WBC/transfusion episode (range 50-590). Seven patients had granulocyte counts greater than 500/microliters for four or more days (range 4-11 days) following the last transfusion. Ph1 chromosomes were documented in 2 of 4 patients tested 2-8 days following transfusion. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase scores were increased (greater than 150) in 5/5 recipients tested post-transfusion demonstrating that production of this enzyme can be induced in CML granulocytes. Except for one severe transfusion reaction, there were no significant side effects and no recipient developed signs of graft versus host disease. All patients with sustained increments demonstrated rapid clinical improvement including 3 severely infected, poor risk patients undergoing initial induction therapy. These 3 patients all achieved complete remission with no evidence of the Ph1 chromosome. Because of the high dose of WBC which can be collected and the salutary effect of continued leukocyte production, CML WBC may be the preparation of choice for selected, non-alloimmunized, severely infected patients.",['EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)'],['10.1002/ajh.2830150108 [doi]'],['1P50CA32107-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Some interesting regularity was noted in the appearance of cytochemical abnormalities of the PMNs. When peroxidase (PO) activity was low, both alkaline phosphatase (AP) and chloroacetate esterase (CAE) activities were also low (group A). When PO activity was normal, if AP activity was low, CAE activity tended to be high (group B) and if AP activity was high, CAE activity tended to be low (group C). Complete remission rate of group B (65%) seemed to be better than that of group C (20%) and group A (25%) although the differences was not statistically significant. In these patients, the number of peripheral leukemic blasts and PMNs showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.69, p less than 0.005). Furthermore, patients with higher circulating PMN counts (more than 2 X 10(9)/L) had a significantly worse prognosis than patients with lower counts (p less than 0.05). These rather unexpected findings strongly suggest that cytochemically abnormal PMNs are progeny of AML blasts. The change in the proportion of abnormal PMNs associated with chemotherapy were studied in 21 patients during the remission induction period. Abnormal PMNs disappeared from the circulation in patients who achieved complete remission. In contrast, abnormal PMNs persisted throughout the remission induction period in patients who failed to achieve complete remission.","['EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (chloroacetate esterase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",['10.1002/ajh.2830150106 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

A total of 301 patients were registered during the study period. There were 153 evaluable patients. Of these 73 patients received induction therapy with vincristine and prednisolone (VP) followed by cranial prophylaxis (cranial radiotherapy, 2,400 rads, and 10 weekly intrathecal injections of methotrexate 7.5 mg/m20 and continuous oral maintenance with daily 6-mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate (group A).

Finally 41 patients (group C) received L-asparaginase during induction and pulse therapy in addition to drugs as in group A. Of the 153 patients, 88 (58%) achieved complete response after induction treatment. Induction remission was 53% with vincristine and prednisolone (group A and group B), whereas it was 70% in group C. The difference in complete response rate in group C was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). The 3-year survival in our series was 22%, with median survival of 11 months. Group C patients receiving L-asparaginase along with vincristine and prednisolone showed 41% 3-year survival compared to 16% for group B. The 3-year survival in group A patients was only 7%, probably owing to lack of pulse therapy during maintenance treatment.

The activity increased further during a combined anaesthesia (thiopentone + N2O + O2 + buprenorphene + pancuronium) and remained increased during surgery. Postoperatively, NK cell activity fell and remained depressed for a period of at least 5 days. The findings of this study indicate that premedication, anaesthesia and surgery cause a rapid and transient increase in NK cell activity, followed by a decline in activity postoperatively. The transient increase in activity may be explained by mobilization of natural killer cells from extravasal space, spleen or lymph nodes into the circulation.

A 16-bp palindrome is found in the region thought to be involved in packaging and dimerization of the RNA genome. Premature termination of translation of the gag polyprotein is attributed to a 13-bp deletion in the p12 region. A substitution of xenotropic env sequences was identified in the 5' region of the env gene; 150 nucleotides 3' to this substitution, a deletion of 585 bp removes the site where the normal env precursor protein is cleaved to form gp70 and p15(E), resulting in a fusion protein of Mr 44,725. Due to these changes, the env product gp55 is expected to have a substantially different conformation on the cell surface compared to either a xenotropic or ecotropic gp70 protein, and may be responsible for the rapid erythroleukemic potential of spleen focus-forming virus.","['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",['10.1073/pnas.80.16.5037 [doi]'],,PMC384183,,['GENBANK/K00021'],,,,,

Eighteen out of 275 children experienced isolated CNS relapses within 2 years after diagnosis. The present analysis should clarify the following questions: 1. Could the risk for CNS relapse be assessed by initial diagnostic findings? 2. Is the CNS relapse rate influenced by more intensive systemic chemotherapy? 3. Is the CNS relapse rate altered by different doses of radiation therapy? The risk for relapse was assessed using a risk index (RI) based on findings at diagnosis. All patients were treated with an 8 weeks induction and consolidation chemotherapy protocol. In part, children with increased risk for relapse (RI greater than = 3) received an additional 6 weeks reinduction protocol within the first six months after diagnosis. Preventive treatment to the CNS consisted of radiotherapy at doses of less than = 18 Gy or 24 Gy and intrathecal methotrexate given during the consolidation phase. The results are as follows: 1. The RI proved to be predictive also for the risk of CNS relapse. However, CNS relapse rates were not substantially higher in children with RI greater than = 3 when they had been exposed to radiation doses of 24 Gy instead of less than = 18 Gy. 2. Intensive systemic reinduction therapy did not influence the CNS relapse rate in children with RI greater than = 3. 3. Three percent of children with RI less than = 2 experienced CNS relapses, irrespectively of lower or higher radiation doses. In patients with RI greater than = 3, however, irradiation at doses of less than = 18 Gy instead of 24 Gy led to a 3-4 fold higher incidence of CNS relapses, irrespectively of chemotherapy. We conclude that radiation doses of less than = 18 Gy are capable of preventing CNS relapses effectively in children with RI less than = 2. The exposure of patients with RI greater tha = 3 to doses of 24 Gy is justified.","['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['10.1055/s-2008-1034064 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

The treatment consisted of a 10-week intensive induction therapy and a subsequent maintenance therapy, which is terminated for children in complete continuous remission after 2 years. The induction treatment during the first 4 weeks consisted of a combination of prednisone, 6-thioguanine (TG), vincristine, adriamycin (ADR) and cytosine-arabinoside (ARA-C). In the following 4 weeks i.v. cyclophosphamide, i.th. methotrexate and prophylactic cranial irradiation were administered in addition to TG, ARA-C and ADR. 119 of the 151 patients (79%) achieved complete remission. 13 children (9%) died of early hemorrhages, 2 of them before onset of therapy. 5 patients died initially of other complications, another 6 after remission has been achieved. 13 children did not respond or responded poorly to the induction therapy. So far, 40 relapses occurred, mainly in the bone marrow. In 6 relapses the central nervous system was involved. The probability for a continuous complete remission for the total group is 0.41 +/- 0.05 (life table analysis) and for the total group 0.56 +/- 0.06 after 45 months. The corresponding probability for survival after 46 months are 0.43 +/- 0.06 for the remission group. The risk for occurrence of early fatal hemorrhages was higher in children with acute monocytic leukemia than in the other morphological subtypes. An initial leukocyte count of more than 100,000/microliters was found significantly more often in patients who did not achieve remission (early deaths and nonresponders) than in children of the remission group. So far, no factors could be identified which influence the risk for relapse. The present results of the study allow the conclusion, that with the applied treatment strategy it is possible to achieve not only in a high portion of children with AML remission but also to improve the chances for long-time remission and perhaps cure.","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['10.1055/s-2008-1034062 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxic activity of spleen natural killer (NK) cells against YAC-1 target cells was studied in a 51Cr release assay at 2, 5, 10, or 15 days after the MCA injection. A dose of 20 micrograms MCA to neonatally olive oil-injected females did not influence the NK activity, whereas an injection of 100 micrograms MCA significantly depressed the NK activity to about half the value seen in controls. This suppression was transient, and the normal level was reached again 15 days after the injection. The depressed NK activity could not be related to humoral or cellular suppressor mechanisms. A study at the single-cell level revealed that the inhibition was due to interference with the lytic step of the NK cell without affecting target-binding capacity. In vitro exposure of spleen cells from MCA-treated animals to interferon fully restored the NK activity. Neonatal DES treatment resulted in a depressed NK activity in adult females to a level about half of that seen in olive oil-injected controls. The NK activity in DES-treated females was not influenced by either 20 or 100 micrograms MCA. The MCA-induced suppression of NK activity was discussed in relation to the earlier reported difference in incidence of MCA-induced sarcomas between DES-treated and control females after they were given 20 micrograms MCA in adult life, as well as in relation to the same incidence in the 2 groups treated with 100 micrograms MCA. The results are compatible with a significant role for NK cells during MCA carcinogenesis and indicate that a possible part of the tumorigenic effect of MCA is its early suppressive effect on NK cell activity.","['56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)', '731DCA35BT (Diethylstilbestrol)']",,,,,,,,,,

Butyrate greatly increased the activity of acetylcholinesterase, slightly enhanced the production of hemoglobin, but did not modify the expression of glycophorin and spectrin. 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced an almost complete disappearance of glycophorin, reduced the synthesis of Hb by K562 cells and also abolished the action of hemin on Hb accumulation. Therefore, all the different K562 cell lines exhibit clear erythroid features including acetylcholinesterase. Butyrate or hemin did not induce terminal differentiation of K562 cells, whereas TPA significantly diminished the erythroid phenotype.","['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['10.1016/0014-4827(83)90145-3 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

However, increased evidence of CNS delayed toxicity started to be recognized as CT scan abnormalities and neuropsychologic alterations, mainly in children. Two questions were analyzed in the present report: (1) Will further doses of i.t. methotrexate and dexamethasone (i.t. MTX-DMT) decrease the incidence of CNS relapse in patients treated early in remission with cranium irradiation plus i.t. MTX-DMT even more? (2) Is i.t. MTX-DMT given during induction and maintenance equally as effective as cranium irradiation plus i.t. MTX-DMT? A randomized study was designed to answer the first question. Incidence of primary CNS relapse in i.t. MTX-DMT-treated patients with a WBC count less than 50,000 was 11% (15 of 135 patients) and was 11% (17 of 150) in the untreated group. In patients with a WBC count greater than 50,000, it was 16% (6/37) in the treated group and 19% (6/31) in the control group. No difference was observed according to treatment in both prognostic groups. Patients in this study were retrospectively compared with a consecutive protocol in which patients received 3 doses of i.t. MTX-DMT alone during induction plus 3 doses weekly during the first month of remission and every 3 mo thereafter. The incidence of primary CNS leukemia at 60 mo in patients with a WBC count less than 50,000 was 20% in the irradiated group and 32% in the group with i.t. MTX-DMT alone. This difference was not significant. However, the relapse-free survival at 60 mo was 26% and 41%, respectively, (p less than 0.0005). The incidence of primary CNS relapse in patients with a WBC count more than 50,000 at 48 mo was 28% in the irradiated group and 42% in the nonirradiated group. The difference was not significant. The duration of complete remission was similar, remaining at 15% and 16% of patients disease-free at 48 mo, respectively. We conclude that (A) after cranial irradiation plus i.t. MTX-DMT X 5, the use of additional doses of i.t. MTX-DMT is not of further benefit in preventing CNS relapse; (B) the use of i.t. MTX-DMT alone compares similarly with cranial irradiation plus i.t. MTX-DMT in the incidence of CNS relapse; and (C) relapse-free survival and survival in patients with a WBC count less than 50,000 were significantly longer in those without cranial irradiation.","['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['S0006-4971(20)83929-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,

Three groups of patients were identified. Eight patients achieved complete remission with one cycle of chemotherapy; seven patients achieved complete remission with a second cycle of the same regimen and seven patients did not respond. Marrow studies performed approximately 3 weeks following the first cycle of therapy were analyzed. Patients who subsequently responded to the regimen differed from non-responders in the residual blasts percentage in the marrow obtained 20-24 days after the initiation of the first cycle. Patients who responded to a second cycle had 11-36% blasts (mean 24%), while non-responders had 35-96% blasts (mean 66%) (p less than 0.01). No patients with more than 40% blasts in their bone marrow achieved complete remission.

Thirty-five patients had pathologically confirmed second independent malignant tumors (not recurrences). The second cancers that developed were varied. The patients who developed these second malignancies ranged in age from 35 to 77 years (24 females, 11 males). The time interval involved was two to 102 months. Nine patients in this group of second malignancies received prior radiation therapy. The following is a list of the second cancers. There were 8 colons, 5 ovaries, 5 lungs, 6 acute myelogenous leukemias, 1 esophagus, 2 bladders, 2 epidermoid carcinomas of the skin, 2 melanomas, 1 chronic lymphatic leukemia, 1 breast cancer, 1 non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma, and 1 stomach cancer. The majority of second malignant tumors were amenable to some form of therapy, ie, surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. However, all of the acute myelogenous leukemias were totally refractory to any therapeutic modalities and rapidly expired. The majority of second cancers developed in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. This is a patient population with a much longer expected survival time, particularly when compared to patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced disease. Twenty-five of the 34 second cancers developed in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy for breast (14) or colorectal (11) cancers. The etiology of the second malignancies is very difficult to determine. However, alkylating agents appeared to be the possible etiologic agent involved in the development of acute myelogenous leukemia.",,['10.1002/jso.2930230315 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

The mean binding ratio was 2.3 +/- 6.8, implying that there was little or no protein binding. There was no correlation between alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) levels and protein binding.

All sera (100%) at diagnosis and 70% of those obtained during the induction of remission demonstrated inhibition of mitogen-induced lymphocyte transformation as evidenced by decreased uptake of [3H]thymidine. The inhibition could not be overcome by an increase in the mitogen concentration. Eighteen sera demonstrating a mean inhibition of 44.2% had elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFA) compared with five sera showing no inhibition (p value = 0.001). Inhibition, within the range produced by leukemic sera, could be achieved by the purified methyl esters of linoleic and linolenic acid in this system. Flow cytometric analysis of mitogen-induced cycling of normal human lymphocytes suggested that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication was inhibited by leukemic sera containing elevated levels of FFA after the G1 phase of cell cycling. Similar inhibition could be achieved by the methyl ester of linolenic acid in this system. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed that sera demonstrating inhibition contained linolenic (C18:3) acid (p value = 0.015), and the majority showed one or more of the following: 1) a concentration of oleic (C18:1) acid greater than 2 standard deviations (SD) above the mean of the control leukemic sera (i.e., those not demonstrating inhibition); 2) an arachidonic (C20:4) to C18:1 ratio that is reduced to greater than 2 SD below the mean of the control group; or 3) the presence of an unexpected fatty acid fraction.

PGE2 (10(-6) M) inhibited the cytolytic activity of freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes against K562 target cells by 50%. The PGE production was inhibited by inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase (indomethacin, aspirin, and ETYA) when present during the incubation. However, pretreatment of monocytes with these cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors was ineffective in preventing PGE production. Kinetic experiments showed that appreciable stimulation of PGE production occurred only after 6 hr of co-culture. Other human tumor cell lines (HSB, SB, and CEM) enhanced PGE production upon co-culture with monocytes but to a lesser extent (twofold to threefold). Monocytes treated with 0.4% formaldehyde or heat (56 degrees C) were not capable of producing PGE when cultured alone or with K526 tumor cells. In contrast, formaldehyde-treated, but not heat-treated, K562 tumor cells were able to induce monocytes to produce PGE. By using a single cell conjugation assay, K562 tumor cells were found to bind equally well to treated or untreated monocytes. In contrast, the lytic activity of treated monocytes against K562 target cells was abolished. The presence of protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, was found to inhibit PGE production by monocytes cultured alone or with K562 tumor cells. Supernatants from K562 tumor cell cultures were also capable of inducing monocytes to produce PGE, and their effect on PGE production from monocytes was suppressed by cycloheximide. In addition, pretreatment of either K562 tumor cells or monocytes with an irreversible protein synthesis inhibitor, emetine, also suppressed the production of PGE upon co-culture with the untreated counterpart. The production of PGE by monocytes in response to exposure to tumor cells may represent a mechanism whereby tumor cells subvert host immune defense against them.","['0 (Prostaglandin Antagonists)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",,"['CA 29589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-00581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

It is postulated that a bacteremia of antibiotic-resistant cocci led to dissemination of these organisms into a virtually defenseless skin.

On the basis of current estimated risk factors, it might be expected that an excess of certain other malignancies could occur in a population of the size of the group exposed to radium (some 3500 cases located, which more than 2000 have measured 226Ra and 228Ra burdens), compared with the incidence in the population at large. An increased incidence of breast cancer has already been reported in female dial workers and it was related to the initial radium intake. On the other hand, very little information is available on the induction of leukaemia by alpha-radiation in human bone marrow. This paper therefore reports an investigation of the incidence of leukaemia among the radium workers. This covers a very wide range of radium burdens and has been done in the light of reasonable estimates of the mean alpha-particle dose received by the skeletal haemopoietic marrow. The number of leukaemia cases is identified and compared with (a) the expected number in a comparable population of the same size and age distribution and (b) predictions based on the risk factor proposed for protection purposes by the ICRP and on the estimated bone marrow doses.",['W90AYD6R3Q (Radium)'],['10.1097/00004032-198306001-00004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

HL-60 promyelocytes, a bipotent precursor cell capable of differentiating along either the myeloid or monocytic pathway, were induced by a human lymphocyte-conditioned medium (CM) to differentiate into macrophage-like cells. The promyelocytes had a generation time of approx. 42 h. Most promyelocytes which differentiated became macrophage-like cells after only one cell division. Some, a minority, underwent more than one division. The time between induction of differentiation and expression of differentiated characteristics could thus be very short. Labelled S-phase promyelocytes could differentiate after traversing S. G2 and undergoing mitosis. Some, approx. 21%, required a subsequent complete cell cycle before differentiating. The data suggest a model in which cells must undergo a S-phase-specific differentiation control event in the presence of CM in order to differentiate in the subsequent G1 phase.

B24 cells can be induced to differentiate into macrophage-like cells by treatment with a protein inducer(s) in conditioned medium (CM) of hamster embryo cells. When the cells were treated with various concentrations of CM, cells with a 2C DNA content, G1/0 cells, increased and protein accumulated in these G1/0 cells. The increases in the number of G1/0 cells and in their protein content per cell were proportional to the concentration of CM. Serial analysis of changes in the contents of DNA and protein in differentiating B24 cells showed that DNA synthesis was suppressed by differentiation-induced block of the cell cycle at the G1/0 phase, whereas increase in the protein content was not completely suppressed by block of the cell cycle.

In the present report we characterize the IFN-producing cells (IPC) in this system by cell separation procedures, including panning with different monoclonal antibodies. Two types of cells which were responsible for the IFN production could be identified. The first IPC was classified as monocyte/macrophage because it was present in plastic-adherent cells and apparently carried the OKM1 antigenic marker. T and B lymphocytes were not involved in the IFN production. The second type of IPC was nylon wool-nonadherent, sheep erythrocyte rosette-negative, at least partly Fc receptor-negative and resided in light Percoll density gradient fractions. The natural killer activity and IFN-producing capacity was studied in such cells fractionated by the panning technique, utilizing HNK-1, OKT10 and OKM1 antibodies. When WISH and K562 were used as IFN inducers, HNK-1+ and OKT10+ cells with lytic activity against K562 produced little or no IFN. The IPC were instead confined to HNK-1- and OKT10- cells. With cells fractionated with respect to the OKM1 antigen, natural killer activity against K562 and WISH cells and IFN production stimulated by K562 cells resided in the OKM1+ cells.

Forty-seven months after the diagnosis of breast cancer and 16 months after the end of the treatment, an acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL; M6) was diagnosed after 8 months of a preleukemic state. Treatment did not produce any results and death occurred on the 17th day. Cytogenetic studies on the bone marrow cells of both patients were performed. In the first patient in the ALL phase normal cells coexisted with a 47 chromosome clone, the extra chromosome being a D (+ 13?). In the second patient, several karyotype abnormalities were already present in the preleukemic state and also during the acute leukemic phase. No normal mitoses were found; hypodiploidy was present as well as major abnormalities such as markers, rings, and, among others, the systematic loss of a #5 and a #7. The first patient seems to have presented with a de novo ALL, associated with the malignant tumor; whereas, the second patient showed all the characteristics of an induced ANLL. The clinical, hematologic, and cytogenetic characteristics of these two patients are analyzed and compared to those of other cases in the literature.",,"['0165-4608(83)90001-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(83)90001-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

The disease predominated in children older than age 4 years (95%), with girls being more affected than boys (24 versus 15). The clinical and hematological picture at presentation was similar to that observed in adults with Ph1-positive CML. Most children of this series were treated with busulfan which, as in adults, led to reduction of leucocytosis and organomegaly but did not prevent the occurrence of blastic crisis. Well-documented blastic crisis was observed in 78% of cases. Of 39 children, 12 were still alive, all in the chronic phase. Twenty-seven have died, 21 of them after blastic crisis, 4-156 months after diagnosis (median survival, 53 months). The effect of each diagnostic characteristic on survival was evaluated using the log-rank test. Of the 14 characteristics studied, only the degree of blood and marrow blastosis was associated with a shorter survival. Age, sex, bleeding, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, degree of splenomegaly, hemoglobin level, total leucocyte, immature granulocyte (promyelocytes + myelocytes + metamyelocytes), eosinophil, basophil, and platelet counts in the peripheral blood were of no prognostic significance. The failure to attain a level of statistical significance for some characteristics found to be of prognostic value for adults, could be due to the small sample size and/or to the disease homogeneity. The results of this study, however, stress the importance of the initial blastic infiltration in determining the duration of survival, which is ultimately determined by the occurrence of terminal acute leukemia. In conclusion, this study shows that the Ph1-positive CML of childhood exhibits the same course, incidence of blastic crisis, and survival as the disease of adults. It also indicates that treatment with moderate chemotherapy, such as busulfan, has no effect on the duration of survival. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed for the treatment of this disorder in children.",,['10.1002/1097-0142(19830815)52:4<721::aid-cncr2820520426>3.0.co;2-x [doi]'],"['CA-23766-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F05-TW-02524/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

It is postulated that absence of TdT may predict poor therapeutic efficacy of vincristine and prednisone in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood. The absence of TdT may correlate with other developmental characteristics of lymphoblasts, such as altered function or low numbers of glucocorticoid receptors or resistance to lysis by steroid drugs.

Marked differences in the rates of cholesterol biosynthesis were noted among three morphologically distinct types of leukaemia.

The normal divergence of sterol-synthesizing capacity found between mature neutrophils and monocytes develops at an early stage of differentiation and is detectable even in leukaemic cells.","['0 (Acetates)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1983.tb02120.x [doi]'],"['5 T32 AM 07134-07/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 18577-07/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AM 26678-03/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The carcinogenetic mechanism of alkylating agents seems related to their ability to damage DNA, and this is supported by the findings of multiple cytogenetic abnormalities in these patients. We report a case of ANLL secondary to therapy with melphalan, which was utilized on an adjuvant basis for breast cancer. ANLL developed 24 months after chemotherapy was discontinued. Results of the cytogenetic analysis in our patient showed multiple rearrangements and marker chromosomes. Among these was a large metacentric chromosome, identified in 6 of 8 karyotypes, in the size range of group A, which probably resulted from a translocation t(7;14) (7qter leads to 7p11::14p11 leads to 14qter). The natural history of the underlying disease and of the ANLL in our patient and data from chromosomal analysis seem to confirm the hypothesis that alkylating agents are potentially leukemogenic in man, probably through genetic damage. This possibility should be considered when such cytotoxic drugs are used in an adjuvant setting.",['Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)'],,,,,,,,,,

The Orthoclone monoclonal antibodies (OK series) were applied as well. Like other investigators, we were able to distinguish 4 major classes of ALL: T-ALL, common-ALL with the subclass pre-B-ALL, null-ALL, and B-ALL. We did not encounter a common-ALL antigen-positive T-ALL subclass. In both adult and childhood ALL, all classes were present, and in about the same frequency as reported by others. In children, common-ALL was the most frequent (66%); in adults, null-ALL (38%). T-ALL was seen both in adults and in children with about the same frequency (27 and 23%, respectively). We found pre-B-ALL only in children. Patients with B-ALL comprised the smallest group in both adult and children (8 and 1.5%, respectively). The application of the OKT antibodies led to recognition of 3 major subclasses of T-ALL: an immature, a common thymocyte and a mature thymocyte subclass. These antibodies were helpful in defining a better classification of null-ALL. With regard to remission induction and prognosis in adult ALL, complete remissions were always obtained in T-ALL, followed by 70% of complete remissions in common-ALL. The worst prognosis was encountered in null-ALL and B-ALL, with 50 and 0% remission, respectively, and a shorter survival in null-ALL of those patients who achieved complete remission. Thus, in high number of cases of null-ALL in adults partly explains the generally much worse prognosis for adult ALL.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1983.tb01507.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

The major glycolipids in undifferentiated M1 cells were of the ganglio series, with a small amount of lacto-series glycolipids. A novel branched structure was found as a tetraosylceramide of M1- cells. Upon differentiation, synthesis of lacto-series glycolipids was significantly enhanced and synthesis of globo-series glycolipids was newly induced but the ganglio-series synthesis was much reduced. Undifferentiated cells expressed only i antigen (i+I-Pk-); differentiated macrophage-like cells became I-antigen dominant and Pk-antigen positive (i+/-I+Pk+). The changes proceeded in two sequential steps: (i) an enhancement of lacto-series glycolipid synthesis associated with the conversion of i antigen to I antigen, and (ii) subsequent induction of globo-series glycolipid synthesis accompanied by the appearance of Pk antigen. The experimental system offers a clue for studies on the process of branching (i-to-I conversion) as well as the biological significance of three major glycolipids (globo-, lacto-, and ganglio-series) as markers of cell differentiation.","['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (I Blood-Group System)', '0 (P Blood-Group System)']",['10.1073/pnas.80.10.2844 [doi]'],"['CA 19224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC393928,,,,,,,

On direct marrow examination, erythrocyte precursors in mitosis are usually observed but ordinarily disappear following in vitro culture. In APL (M3) characterized by t(15;17) translocation, the comparison between the proportions of the different categories of cells in mitosis and of karyotypically normal and abnormal cells suggests that erythroblasts do not belong to the leukemic clone. An analogous situation is observed in AML (M2) with t(8;21) and in monocytic leukemia (M5) with chromosome abnormalities. Erythroleukemia could be divided into two categories, one with chromosome abnormalities and persistence of erythroblast mitoses after culture, and another with no detectable chromosome abnormality and with disappearance of erythroblast mitoses following culture. Other examples of blood malignancies demonstrate the importance of the method used in determining which cell categories belong to the leukemic clone.

We previously molecularly cloned the entire F-MuLV genome. Transfection of this cloned DNA into NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts produces a virus with the same leukemia-inducing characteristics as F-MuLV. To identify which portion of the F-MuLV genome is responsible for causing leukemia, we made recombinant viruses between subgenomic fragments of F-MuLV DNA and another retrovirus--Amphotroph clone 4070. Amphotroph clone 4070 is a replication-competent, amphotrophic, N-tropic virus which does not produce any detectable malignancy in mice. A 2.4-kilobase-pair fragment of F-MuLV DNA was isolated. This DNA fragment encompassed approximately 700 base pairs from the 3' end of the F-MuLV pol gene and 1.7 kilobase pairs of the env gene including all of gp70 and the N-terminal four-fifths of p15E.

The major advantages in using these methods is the speed, the number of parameters which are capable of measurement, the sensitivity, and the ability to quantitate large numbers of cells for a particular criterion. These qualities have proved extremely helpful in the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, and other abnormalities. The combination of flow cytometry and a panel of monoclonal antisera (many of which are available commercially) allows the investigator a system of fine resolution which can confidently identify or characterize an abnormal clone or population of cells. With the increase in advanced flow cytometers, it is suggested that time should be allocated for the routine analysis of possible lymphomas and leukemias to allow quick and accurate evaluations of the disease status.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",['10.1007/BF00915491 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

A human promyelocytic cell line (HL-60) differentiates to granulocytes or macrophage-like cells when cultured with a variety of agents. How these agents trigger myeloid differentiation is not understood. This study shows that 1.0-10.0 micrograms/ml bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) induced myeloid differentiation of HL-60 in liquid culture. After 7 days, BrdU (3.0 micrograms/ml) produced only moderate inhibition of HL-60 growth, but induced myeloid maturation with 40% of the cells becoming morphologically more mature; 41% developed the ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT); 19% phagocytized Candida albicans; and 18% developed Fc receptors. The action of BrdU was mimicked by 5-iodo-deoxyuridine. Thymidine (Td) (1- to 10-fold excess) competitively inhibited incorporation of [3H]BrdU into DNA of HL-60 and inhibited the triggering of HL-60 differentiation by BrdU. The BrdU-induced maturation of HL-60 correlated with the incorporation of BrdU into DNA of HL-60. DNA buoyant density studies showed that about 46% of the Td was replaced by BrdU in each DNA strand of HL-60 as the cells differentiated in culture containing 3 micrograms/ml BrdU for 7 days. We established 20 thymidine kinase (TK)-deficient HL-60 clones. The HL-60 TK-deficient cells were unable to phosphorylate Td, to incorporate either [3H]Td or [3H]BrdU or differentiate in the presence of BrdU (1-1000 micrograms/ml). The HL-60 TK-deficient cells retained the ability to differentiate in the presence of other HL-60 inducers. Taken together, the studies suggest myeloid differentiation of HL-60 is triggered because of incorporation of BrdU into DNA of the cells.","['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",['10.1002/jcp.1041160117 [doi]'],"['CA 26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

They showed complete dependence on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for colony formation in agar. In addition to the presence of granulocytic colonies, some showed granulocyte-macrophage characteristics, suggesting that bipotential cells were also involved in long-term growth. Initially, they showed localized proliferation on or around giant fibroblast-like cells. Even after constant growth was established, attempts to transfer these cells were unsuccessful, and their growth was confined to the original flasks. These observations seen to indicate that their growth was not autonomous but dependent on the adherent cells in the flasks. This was also supported by a coculture experiment in which the cells were demonstrated to proliferate for 4 months only in the presence of normal bone marrow particles and bone marrow particle-derived feeder layers.

Morphological maturation was accompanied by a total loss of transferrin binding and a 7-fold increase in the percentage of cells reducing nitro blue tetrazolium. Cell surface membrane proteins and glycoproteins were labeled with 125I by the lactoperoxidase-H2O2 or 1,3,4,6-tetrachloro-3 alpha, 6 alpha-diphenylglycoluril (Iodo-Gen) methods and analyzed by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.

This was accomplished by cloning HL-60 cells in 0.3% agar in diffusion chambers, which were subsequently implanted in the peritoneal cavities of mice. These animals were given injections i.v. with anthracycline antibiotics, and the chambers were transferred to a second recipient 24 hr later. After an additional 8 days, the chambers were removed, the cloning efficiency was determined, and colonies were scored for the presence of differentiated cells based on their ability to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT). Marcellomycin produced dose-dependent decreases in cloning efficiency and increases in the number of differentiated cells present in chambers. At all dose levels of marcellomycin tested, three types of colonies were observed; these were colonies consisting entirely of undifferentiated cells and approximately equal numbers of colonies consisting of solely differentiated cells and those with mixtures of both differentiated and undifferentiated cells. An 8-fold increase in colonies containing differentiated cells (both pure and mixed) was observed after a single injection of marcellomycin (10 mg/kg), a dose which reduced cloning efficiency by 40%. At that dosage level, aclacinomycin A also induced differentiation, while doxorubicin was ineffective, a finding consistent with the effects of these anthracyclines on HL-60 cells in suspension culture. In addition to the functional changes accompanying differentiation, commitment was characterized by a limitation in proliferative potential. Thus, the average size of uniform NBT-positive colonies was approximately 16 cells, and few clones of NBT-positive cells greater than 32 cells in number were observed; this contrasted with NBT-negative clones which contained up to 100 cells. This finding suggests that HL-60 cells undergo an average of four and a maximum of five divisions upon commitment to granulocytic differentiation. The in vivo system described may be useful in further evaluation of differentiation-inducing agents for therapeutic potential after an initial in vitro screen to identify active compounds.","['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '3296X8L13E (marcellomycin)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)']",,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

All patients had bulky disease histologically proven to be non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with bone marrow involvement. They were separated into two groups according to the extent of bone marrow involvement. Group IVA included 14 patients with 25% or less lymphoblasts in the bone marrow. Group IVB included 27 patients with more than 25% blasts in the marrow. Their clinical characteristics with regard to age, sex, hemogram, histology, primary site, and blast morphology are compared.

Globin chains were labelled with 14C-labelled amino acids, separated by isoelectric focusing and quantitated by fluorography. The synthesis of gamma-chains in the erythropoietic bursts comprised 89.0% of the total non-alpha-chains. The G gamma:A gamma ratio was 0.67, which is within the ratios obtained in newborns. Furthermore, individual erythropoietic bursts contained varying ratios of both gamma and beta chains and all revealed more G gamma than A gamma chain synthesis.

In most cases the pathogenetic mechanism causing the hypercalcaemia remains poorly understood. We recently studied in detail two patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia who developed hypercalcaemia during the course of their illness. The results of these studies conclusively excluded primary hyperparathyroidism or ectopic parathyroid hormone production as causes of the patients' hypercalcaemia. In vitro studies carried out on short-term suspension cultures of one patient's peripheral blood blast cells demonstrated production of a factor with potent bone resorbing activity, distinct from parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Further characterization of the bone resorbing factor suggested that it bore some similarity to osteoclast activating factor (OAF). Hypercalcaemia in the other case appeared to be due to a combination of skeletal invasion by malignant cells, and to ectopic secretion of an unidentified humoral factor with bone resorbing activity. These two cases demonstrate that the hypercalcaemia complicating acute myelogenous leukaemia may be due to a variety of mechanisms distinct from parathyroid hormone production.","['0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (bone resorption factor)']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1983.tb02075.x [doi]'],"['AM 28376/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 30102/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 125/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

A second treatment protocol, in which glucocorticoid is added to cells recovering from the effects of 24 h exposure to Ara-C, results in a clear synergism between the 2 drugs. This synergism is observed over a range of concentrations (5-100 nM), but is most significant at low doses, where inhibition of cell growth by Ara-C occurs but cell killing is minimal. Prior treatment with Ara-C increases the number of cells killed in the presence of steroid during the period 12-24 h after removal of the S-phase block. Combinations of Ara-C and steroid can thus be either synergistic or antagonistic, depending on the drug scheduling.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",['10.1038/bjc.1983.103 [doi]'],,PMC2011387,,,,,,,

Despite demonstrating in vitro virus neutralizing activity equivalent to that seen with antiviral serum or IgG, the virus-specific F(ab')2 preparations were devoid of protective activity. Given that passively administered F(ab')2 of goat origin have been reported to persist at stable levels in the mouse circulation, the failure of these F(ab')2 preparations to protect against virus challenge cannot be ascribed to rapid clearance from the treated animals. These results indicate that the passive serum therapy of FLV-induced disease is Fc dependent, consistent with the involvement of an ADCC-type mechanism, as well as confirming the previous suggestion that virus neutralization does not represent the sole mechanism of serum protection in this system.","['0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",['10.1016/0042-6822(83)90477-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

Age-adjusted annual incidence rates for all leukemias per 100,000 cats or dogs were 224.3 and 30.5, respectively. The cat had 6.1 times more malignant lymphomas and 15.7 times more myeloproliferative disease than the dog. Feline age-specific rates indicated a bimodal age pattern for all leukemias and for malignant lymphoma alone and a single early peak for myeloproliferative disease. In the dog, all age-specific patterns increased with age and peaked later in life. Feline sex-specific, age-adjusted rates showed that the neutered female was at lowest risk, followed by the neutered male, entire female, and entire male. In the dog, the neutered male was at lowest risk while the other three sex categories were clustered. However, the magnitude of expression within each species separately was the same for the neutered male, entire male, and entire female, but not for the neutered female.

Our results show that iron-carrying transferrin became bound to specific dimeric cell surface receptors. Iron accumulated within the cell with time, whereas intact transferrin was released back to the medium. Chloroquine and NH4Cl, known as pH-raising agents in vesicles of the lysosomal system, inhibited iron accumulation and transferrin binding in a dose-dependent manner. This suggests that the acid pH in endosomes leads to the cleavage of the iron-transferrin bonds. Transferrin degradation was not found, which leads us to suggest a process of 'acid flushing' for the dissociation of iron from transferrin without the involvement of endosome-lysosome fusion. Taken together, the data agree with the concept of receptor-mediated endocytosis, as described for many macromolecules. Iron was stored in ferritin in the cell types tested. Only a minor part (less than 15%) of the iron was bound in hemoglobin in the K-562 cell line. The relationship between iron stores and exogenously added iron in heme synthesis was investigated using a double labelling (55Fe/59Fe) technique. The results showed that exogenous iron was preferentially used before the iron stored in ferritin.

Although many of these patients were treated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, many received no radiotherapy at all. Drugs most frequently implicated in the causation of acute leukemia and other second neoplasms are the alkylating agents, procarbazine and the nitrosoureas. The frequency of this syndrome varies from less than 1 per cent to 7 per cent in many reported series of patients. There could develop a reluctance to use cytotoxic agents to treat malignant neoplasms for fear of inducing acute leukemia. Although one has to consider this complication, one should not, however, withhold these drugs from a patient with a neoplasm or other potentially fatal disease in whom such therapy is the treatment of choice. We seem to be faced with the paradox that patients benefiting most from chemotherapy may be at highest risk of suffering its undesirable consequences. Although the risk of leukemogenesis or carcinogenesis in man may be small, these drugs should be used with caution in patients with indolent non-neoplastic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.","['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)']",,,,,,,,,,

Tissue ferritin stores are markedly increased in hemochromatosis, a disease of iron overload that has been linked to chromosome 6. In order to provide further information concerning the genetics of ferritin synthesis and to determine if the structural gene for ferritin was on chromosome 6, studies were performed to identify the human chromosome that contains the ferritin gene. Ferritin immunoassays were performed on extracts of Chinese hamster ovary somatic cells that were hybridized with human lymphocytes and fibroblasts and contained various human chromosomes in different combinations. None of the 13 cell lines that lacked immunoreactive human ferritin contained chromosome 19, and all 9 of the cell lines that produced human ferritin contained chromosome 19. No other human chromosome shared this association with human ferritin. In studies of subclones of ferritin-positive cell lines, immunoreactive ferritin consistently segregated only with chromosome 19. Immunoprecipitation studies performed on cells that had been incubated with 59Fe-containing transferrin indicated that chromosome 19-containing cells incorporated iron into intact and functional molecules of human ferritin. The necessary and exclusive association of chromosome 19 with human ferritin indicates that a defect in the structural gene for human ferritin cannot account for the abnormalities of hemochromatosis.

Hexamethylenebisacetimide, a potent inducer of murine erythroleukemia cell differention, induced high levels of both alpha- and beta-globin gene transcription within 48 to 72 h in culture. Butyric acid, a modest inducer of murine erythroleukemia cells, induced a somewhat lower level of globin gene transcription. With both inducers, alpha-globin transcriptional rates exceeded those of beta-globin. Hemin, on the other hand, showed no detectable increase over the basal rate observed in uninduced cells, even at a time (48 h) when newly synthesized globin mRNA was accumulating in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that there are at least two mechanisms responsible for regulating alpha- and beta-globin structural gene expression in induced murine erythroleukemia cells and that the mechanisms involved are inducer dependent. Hexamethylenebisacetimide and butyric acid increase the rate at which globin genes are transcribed, but hemin appears to allow constitutive levels of transcripts to accumulate.","['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",['10.1128/mcb.3.2.229-232.1983 [doi]'],"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31768-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC368526,,,,,,,

The chemotherapy program consisted of induction with vincristine, dexamethasone, and intrathecal methotrexate, intensification with adriamycin and asparaginase, central nervous system treatment with cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate, and continuation treatment with 5-day courses of combination chemotherapy administered every three weeks. The first phase of continuation therapy incorporated vincristine, adriamycin, 6-mercaptopurine, and dexamethasone. In the second phase, oral methotrexate was substituted for the adriamycin in non-T-cell patients; in T-cell patients, cytosine arabinoside or cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in alternating cycles were substituted for the adriamycin and asparaginase was added. Total duration of therapy was approximately 2.5 years. Connaught BCG was administered by Heaf gun on days 8 and 15 of each 3-week cycle for the first 8 months of treatment in approximately one-third of the patients. Actuarial disease-free survival with a median follow-up of 59 months shows no difference in outcome between the BCG and non-BCG poor-risk patients. However, there is an improvement in disease-free survival of BCG-treated good- and average-risk girls (P = 0.04). While patients were actively receiving BCG there was also a trend toward the development of fewer significant infections than when patients were not receiving BCG (P = 0.85). Toxicities from BCG administration included satellite rashes, local tenderness, lymphadenopathy, secondary infection, and residual scars. Overall disease-free survival by actuarial analysis is 60% at 6 years; for patients with unfavorable prognostic features it is 40%. In this trial the addition of BCG prolonged the disease-free survival of girls with good- and average-risk prognostic features and also may have decreased the susceptibility to infection while it was being administered.

The study (SWOG No. 7581) was initiated in December 1975 and was closed to new entry in September 1979 and to data collection in February 1981. Heights, weights, and blood samples for growth hormone and somatomedin activity were obtained at the time of initial diagnosis and at intervals during the 55 months of observation. The percentage of boys less than 4 years of age below the 50th percentile is significantly greater than the expected 50% for both initial and final height (P less than 0.01). Girls less than 4 years appeared to have significantly different percentile height distribution from the normal for their final height measurement (P less than 0.05) but not for their initial height measurement. No other significant differences in the percentile height distribution were found. When growth rate, since time of diagnosis of ALL, is compared to the expected growth of normal children of the same age by linear regression analysis, there is a difference in the slope of the lines. Children with ALL are significantly shorter. The mean initial growth hormone and somatomedin concentration, 6.2 ng/ml and 1.3 micrograms/ml, respectively, vs mean remission growth hormone and somatomedin of 2.5 ng/ml and 1.1 micrograms/ml, respectively, were different. This was significant at P less than 0.01. The slope of the computed regression lines for multiple analysis of growth hormone and somatomedin were negative for more than 60% of the patients when compared to the initial concentration. These data suggest that a significant number of the children less than 4 years of age are short prior to the onset of therapy, and this persists throughout the course of their disease. Second, there is a reduction in growth rate during intensive therapy or the first year of the disease, with a normal growth rate thereafter.

Hence, a bone marrow biopsy performed after six days of therapy permits the recognition of the majority of patients who will enter complete remission or alternatively who need more aggressive therapy.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']","['0145-2126(83)90059-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(83)90059-0 [doi]']",['CA 5834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

The cells were also tested with a panel of immunological markers including monoclonal antibodies. Of 869 TdT positive cases detected, 555 were diagnosed as ALL and 32 as blast crisis of CGL; 226 were provisionally diagnosed as 'acute leukaemia' and finally diagnosed as ALL partly on the basis of immunological data; 56 TdT+ cases were provisionally diagnosed as acute non-lymphocytic or myeloid leukaemia; 266 cases of AML and 177 cases of CGL in blast crisis were TdT negative. Eleven of the above 'AML' cases were anti-cALL+ as well as TdT+ and were re-diagnosed and treated successfully as cALL. The remaining 45 were anti-cALL negative and finally diagnosed and treated, at least initially, as AML. Eleven of these cases had only 5-10% TdT+ cells which could have been normal, non-myeloid cells. Twenty cases had 11-50% TdT+ cells and 14 cases had 50-100% TdT+ cells. Of these latter two groups, details on 28 patients were available for evaluation. Three cases on review had no definitive myeloid cytochemistry and were haematologically AUL with a null-ALL phenotype (TdT+ DR+ cALL-). In 14 cases there was a large overlap (greater than 75%) of the proportion of cells with myeloid cytochemistry (Sudan black, peroxidase or esterases) and TdT; individual blast cells were therefore expressing these markers concurrently. In the remaining cases, mixtures of TdT negative myeloid and TdT+ (lymphoid?) cells may have coexisted although this was not proven unequivocally. Twenty-two cases of newly diagnosed TdT+ 'AML' received induction chemotherapy for AML (DAT regime) and only six (37%) obtained a complete remission. It is concluded that TdT positive 'myeloid' leukaemias do occur, albeit infrequently (approx. 5%) and may have a relatively poor prognosis.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']","['0145-2126(83)90054-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(83)90054-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,

This study characterizes differences in the in vitro effects of these viruses on hematopoietic cells of (BALB/c x DBA/2)F1 mice. Both variants induced erythroid bursts that proliferated and differentiated without added erythropoietin (EPO). However, while the bursts induced by FVP were well ""hemoglobinized"" (i.e., most cells contained hemoglobin), the cells of FVA-induced bursts contained little or no hemoglobin. The nonhemoglobinized bursts, induced by FVA, were established to be erythroid by cytochemistry, electron microscopy, and hormone sensitivity. FVA-induced cells appeared to be hypersensitive to EPO, since small concentrations of the hormone produced marked increases in hemoglobin production--even when the hormone was added to the culture 3 days post infection. Time-lapse photography documented that EPO stimulated hemoglobin synthesis in virally transformed cells rather than uninfected erythroid precursors. This observation of FVA-induced hypersensitivity prompted the reexamination of the hormone requirements of FVP-induced bursts--previously considered to be EPO-independent. Reduction of the serum in the cultures allowed the demonstration that FVP-induced erythroid cells also were hypersensitive to EPO. Thus FVA and FVP can be readily distinguished in vitro by the relative EPO sensitivity of virus-induced bursts. From these findings, a hypothesis is drawn: i.e., oncogenic transformation may result from increased sensitivity of progenitor cells for natural, physiologic regulators, and transformation is not necessarily accompanied by a block in differentiation. In addition, since hypersensitive virus-induced bursts could be recognized and picked from the cultures, these studies provide a method for obtaining highly purified erythroid precursors for the study of the regulation of terminal differentiation by EPO and other regulatory factors.",['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],,['CA-26306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Survival rates varied considerably by primary site. For most sites, as age increased the relative and observed survival rates decreased. Analysis of relative survival rates by ech year of diagnosis, 1973-78, and for each year following diagnosis suggested increasing rates for cancers of the colon, lung, and prostate gland, whereas there were no definite increases for cancers of the female breast and corpus uteri.

The presence of structural ribosomal proteins in the isolated particles was studied by using antisera against individual rat liver small ribosomal subunit proteins. The analysis is based on the established crossreactivity between rat and mouse ribosomes [F. Noll and H. Bielka (1970) Mol. Gen. Genet. 106, 106-113]. The identification of the proteins was achieved by two independent immunological techniques: the passive haemagglutination test and the enzyme immunoassay of electrophoretically fractionated proteins, blotted on nitrocellulose. All 17 proteins tested are present in cytoplasmic ribosomes. A large number of proteins (S3a, S6, S7, S8, S11, S14, S18, S20, S23/24 and S25) are present in the '80-S' preribosome. Only two proteins (S3 and S21) are added during the formation of the '40-S' preribosome in the nucleolus. Four proteins (S2, S19, S26 and S29) are added at later, possibly extranucleolar, stages of ribosome formation. The results obtained provide evidence for the sequential addition of proteins during the formation of the small ribosomal subunit in Friend erythroleukemia cells.","['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Precursors)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1983.tb07259.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells cultured in complete medium were found to be noncytotoxic for chicken erythrocytes in an 18-hr 51Cr-release assay. These cells have been shown to acquire several characteristics of mature macrophages upon incubation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and when PMA was included in the medium during the assay, the HL-60 cells became strongly cytotoxic to the target cells in the absence of exogenous antibody, lectin, or serum complement. Freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes also became cytotoxic in the presence of PMA, whereas peripheral blood lymphocytes and the U937 histiocytic cell line did not. Detectable target lysis was observed between 4 and 8 hr after HL-60 stimulation with PMA, and HL-60 cells prestimulated with PMA for 24 hr retained their cytotoxic activity following washing and assay in PMA-free medium. Cytotoxic HL-60 cells developed after exposure to 10(-6) to 10(-9) M PMA, and significant target cell lysis occurred at effector:target cell ratios as low as 0.5:1. The PMA-induced HL-60-mediated cytotoxic response was markedly inhibited by blockers of protein synthesis, inhibition of microfilament function, and depletion of cellular superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Interestingly, cytotoxicity of HL-60 cells for chicken erythrocyte targets was modulated by the direct addition of certain simple saccharides to the assay in a fashion similar to that observed with spontaneously cytotoxic mononuclear cells from several vertebrate and invertebrate species. Thus, the cytolytic effector function induced in HL-60 cells by incubation with PMA presents a useful model for the study of cellular cytotoxic mechanisms as well as the mechanisms utilized by nonimmune cells in the recognition of non-self.","['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Disaccharides)', '16462-44-5 (Cellobiose)', 'HF30HB040V (gentiobiose)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['0008-8749(83)90348-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(83)90348-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,
