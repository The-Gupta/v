Mainly there is on the T cells subpopulation. During fetal life B CD5+ cells are major subpopulation of B cells in the spleen, lymph nodes and there are also in the cord blood. In adult CD5+ cells are minor subpopulation (27%) of B cells from the peripheral blood. CD5 there are on chronic lymphocyte leukaemia B cells (B-CLL) also. Usually expression CD5 on B-CLL cells associated with weak or lack expression of the surface immunoglobulins and CD79 beta, CD20, CD22, CD21 (CR-2), CD35 (CR-1) antigens. It appeared interesting to compare the expression of CD5 antigen (the mean fluorescence intensity--MFI of CD5) on B cells from the cord blood, adults peripheral blood and B-CLL patients. MFI of CD5 on B and T cells were also compared in each groups. MFI of CD 19 was studied too. Lymphocytes from the cord blood (11 assays), adult peripheral blood of healthy volunteers (18 assays) and the peripheral blood of no treated patients with B-CLL (56 assays) were studied. The immunological phenotype of lymphocytes was evaluated with the monoclonal antibodies anti-CD5 and anti-CD19 by the flow cytometry method. We have demonstrated that MFI of CD5 on B cells from patients with B-CLL was strongest and weakest from normal individuals. MFI of CD5 on T cells from patients with B-CLL is stronger in comparison to healthy volunteers. MFI of CD19 is weakest on cells from patients with B-CLL and strongest in normal individuals. On the basis of the our results and other medical papers we suggest on the one hand that biology of B-CLL depend on deficit antigens specific for B cells lines on the other hand depend on overexpression of CD5 antigens on leukaemic B and T cells also.","['Rolinski, J', 'Rupniewska, Z M', 'Wasik-Szczepanek, E']","['Rolinski J', 'Rupniewska ZM', 'Wasik-Szczepanek E']",['Zaklad Immunologii Klinicznej AM w Lublinie.'],['pol'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,['0 (CD5 Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/*analysis', 'Fetal Blood/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Reference Values', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,2000/03/31 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/03/31 09:00'],"['2000/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 1999 Apr;101(4):307-14.,"Ekspresja czasteczki CD5 na komorkach B i T we krwi pepowinowej, we krwi doroslych osob zdrowych i chorych na przewlekla bialaczke limfatyczna B-komorkowa (PBL-B).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three children with a graft versus host reaction were submitted to 18, 30 and 46 extracorporeal photopheresis courses respectively. In the same time, the other immunosuppressive treatments were tapered or definitively stopped (ciclosporin). RESULTS: A dramatic improvement of cutaneous status and biological data was observed after the first courses. However, the extracorporeal photopheresis treatment did not improve the mucous lesions. No serious adverse effect was encountered. COMMENTS: As published elsewhere, extracorporeal photopheresis was effective on the graft versus host reaction lichenoid cutaneous lesions and in case of visceral involvement. In all of our cases, the immunosuppressive drug could have been tapered. No adverse event was observed. Thus, extracorporeal photopheresis should be indicated in case of resistance to immunosuppressive drugs.","[""D'incan, M"", 'Kanold, J', 'Halle, P', 'De Lumley, L', 'Souteyrand, P', 'Demeocq, F']","[""D'incan M"", 'Kanold J', 'Halle P', 'De Lumley L', 'Souteyrand P', 'Demeocq F']","['Service de Dermatologie, CHRU-Hotel-Dieu, BP 69, 63001 Clermont-Ferrand Cedex 01, France.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', '*Photopheresis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/03/31 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/31 09:00'],"['2000/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2000 Feb;127(2):166-70.,Photochimiotherapie extracorporelle dans le traitement de la reaction chronique du greffon contre l'hote: trois cas.,['MDOI-AD-03-2000-127-2-0151-9638-101019-ART60 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Testicular assessments, serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone measurements, semen analysis and sperm Comet assays were carried out at presentation (pre-FLU therapy), after 1 and 7 months of FLU treatment, and finally at 11 months after completion of chemotherapy. We found that testicular damage occurred within a month, as indicated by reduced testicular volume, oligozoospermia, elevated FSH and LH, and lower testosterone concentrations. Spermatozoa with a large range of DNA damage were detected in the samples from both the control and treated men. DNA damage in the spermatozoa was marked by 7 months of FLU treatment. The high levels of sperm DNA damage seen during and possibly persisting after treatment suggests that caution should be exercised if the ejaculates from these men are used for in-vitro fertility treatment. Further experiments are needed to assess the biological significance of these DNA changes; it may, however, be prudent at present to be cautious when counselling these patients.","['Chatterjee, R', 'Haines, G A', 'Perera, D M', 'Goldstone, A', 'Morris, I D']","['Chatterjee R', 'Haines GA', 'Perera DM', 'Goldstone A', 'Morris ID']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College Hospital, London WC1E 6AU, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligospermia/chemically induced/pathology', 'Spermatozoa/*chemistry', 'Testicular Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Testis/*chemistry/pathology', 'Testosterone/blood', 'Time Factors', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",,2000/03/31 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/03/31 09:00'],"['2000/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2000 Apr;15(4):762-6. doi: 10.1093/humrep/15.4.762.,,['10.1093/humrep/15.4.762 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the potential roles that different classes of proteases play in the monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, cells were treated with phorbol ester in the presence of various serine and cysteine protease inhibitors. The serine protease inhibitors 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), N-alpha-tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), and N-alpha-tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) repressed a number of phenotypic markers of monocytic differentiation including surface expression of the CD11b integrin, cell aggregate formation, cell cycle exit, and cell death. CD11b was not detected at the cell surface by FACS analysis up to 24 h after induction of differentiation; however, both CD11b mRNA and protein were present. Downregulation of c-myc mRNA and upregulation of c-fos and egr-1 mRNA and protein, which normally occur during TPA-induced differentiation, were not affected by inclusion of the protease inhibitors. These data indicate that serine proteases specifically mediate many of the phenotypic aspects of TPA-induced monocytic differentiation but are not involved with the induction or repression of differentiation-sensitive transcription factors and suggest that serine protease activity is required for intracellular processing of CD11b.","['Bestilny, L J', 'Riabowol, K T']","['Bestilny LJ', 'Riabowol KT']","['Departments of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Oncology, The University of Calgary Health Sciences Centre, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfones)', '2104-86-1 (Tosyllysine Chloromethyl Ketone)', '34284-75-8 (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride)', '402-71-1 (Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/genetics/physiology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tosyllysine Chloromethyl Ketone/pharmacology', 'Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2000/03/31 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/31 09:00'],"['2000/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2000 Apr 10;256(1):264-71. doi: 10.1006/excr.2000.4821.,,"['10.1006/excr.2000.4821 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(00)94821-3 [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By electrophoresis mobility shift assays using probes corresponding to different segments of the putative human c-myb intron 1 transcription pause region and nuclear extracts from myeloid leukemia HL 60 and fibroblast WI 38 cells, we detected a HL-60-specific DNA-protein complex with a 123-bp fragment containing binding sites for the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) nuclear proteins. Formation of the DNA-protein complex was abrogated by competition with an oligomer containing the wild-type, but not the mutated, IRF binding site and the complex was specifically supershifted by the anti-IRF-1 or the anti-IRF-2 antibody. Moreover, in vitro translated IRF-1 or IRF-2 protein did interact with the 123-bp c-myb intron 1 fragment. Upon TPA-induced differentiation, c-myb expression was readily down-modulated in parental HL 60 cells, but not in cells transfected with an antisense IRF-1 plasmid. Moreover, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity driven by a c-myb promoter containing the entire intron 1 was suppressed upon IRF-1, but not IRF-2 expression. Together, these results are consistent with the existence of a functional relationship between IRF-1 and c-myb in which IRF-1 negatively regulates c-myb expression at the transcriptional level by a mechanism that may depend on the interaction of IRF-1 with a segment of the c-myb gene implicated in transcription pausing.","['Manzella, L', 'Gualdi, R', 'Perrotti, D', 'Nicolaides, N C', 'Girlando, G', 'Giuffrida, M A', 'Messina, A', 'Calabretta, B']","['Manzella L', 'Gualdi R', 'Perrotti D', 'Nicolaides NC', 'Girlando G', 'Giuffrida MA', 'Messina A', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Kimmel Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Bluemle Life Sciences Building, 233 South 10th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (IRF2 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-2)', '0 (Irf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Irf2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Genes, myb', 'Genomic Library', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-2', '*Introns', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2000/03/31 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/31 09:00'],"['2000/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2000 Apr 10;256(1):248-56. doi: 10.1006/excr.1999.4794.,,"['10.1006/excr.1999.4794 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(99)94794-8 [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],['CA09644/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surgically treated idiopathic scoliosis patients had the largest total radiation skin entrance and organ dose exposures. This group's risks for developing leukemia, breast cancer, or a heritable defect, respectively, were 0.8%, 2.1%, and 3.0% higher than baseline risks. The other treatment groups had increased carcinogenic risks of <1%. The use of serial radiographs during the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis, hip dysplasia, and leg-length discrepancy appears relatively safe. The increased risk of carcinogenesis or hereditary defects in these patients is minimal.","['Bone, C M', 'Hsieh, G H']","['Bone CM', 'Hsieh GH']","['Shriners Hospital for Children, Spokane, Washington, USA. cmbone1@pol.net']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Orthop,Journal of pediatric orthopedics,8109053,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Congenital Abnormalities/*diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Hip Dislocation, Congenital/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Limb Deformities, Congenital/diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Orthopedics/methods', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scoliosis/congenital/diagnostic imaging', 'Sex Distribution', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Orthop. 2000 Mar-Apr;20(2):251-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are several ways for cancer cells to develop resistance or defense mechanisms against cytotoxic drugs. This review paper will focus on membrane transport-associated multidrug resistance (MDR). The proteins involved, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), MRP1 and LRP/MVP, share the ability to act as drug transport proteins. Following upregulation of the mdr-1 gene, the energy-dependent transmembrane P-gp overexpression results in diminished intracellular concentrations of anthracyclins, vinca-alkaloids and epipodophyllotoxins. The other transmembrane protein, MRP1, also has intracellular epitopes which are involved in intracellular redistribution and sequestration of drugs. The last named mechanism has also been ascribed to LRP, a protein which only occurs intracellularly. In leukemia patients, cellular drug resistance profiles determined in vitro at the time of presentation show a strong correlation with outcome. In AML, mdr-1 overexpression at diagnosis is a strong independent predictor for CR and long-term survival. In ALL, mdr-1 expression is of minor importance for prediction of outcome. In AML, MRP1 expression at diagnosis is not correlated with clinical response and survival in most studies. In ALL, MRP1 expression at diagnosis is not associated with response and long-term survival in the few studies on this aspect which have been published. The studies on LRP in AML emphasize the importance of the correlation between LRP-expression and anthracycline accumulation and suggest that LRP-expression has prognostic value at diagnosis. However, there is an equal number of studies where a predictive value in the case of LRP-expression in de novo AML cannot be shown. The highest levels of LRP have been reported in multiple relapses of ALL. Furthermore, new membrane-associated drug transport proteins have been reported including the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), the anthracyclin resistance-associated protein (ARA), five new homologues of MRP (MRP2, or MOAT, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, and MRP6), the sister of P-glycoprotein (sP-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Studies on the (clinical) significance of these proteins have not yet been reported.","['van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Pieters, R']","['van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Sonneveld P', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport/genetics', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics/physiology', 'Genes, MDR/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Up-Regulation']",184,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 Mar;38(3):94-110. doi: 10.5414/cpp38094.,,['10.5414/cpp38094 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also compared MIT with the effect of PSC 833 on the cytotoxicity of daunorubicin (DNR) and doxorubicin (DOX). While PSC 833 and CsA had no effect on the cytotoxicity, accumulation and retention of MIT in the parent K562 cells, PSC 833 and CsA restored accumulation and retention of MIT in K562/D1-9 cells dose-dependently. Consequently, there was increased sensitivity of K562/D1-9 cells to MIT. The reversing activity of PSC 833 on the cytotoxicity of MIT was stronger than that of CsA, and was almost the same as the reversing activity of PSC 833 on the cytotoxicity of DNR and DOX. The resistance index of MIT decreased from 43.9-fold to 2.8-fold by 0.4 microM PSC 833, which is a clinically achievable plasma concentration. These results suggest that the combination of PSC 833 with MIT could be a promising treatment in reversing PGP-mediated MDR in leukemia patients.","['Fukushima, T', 'Yamashita, T', 'Takemura, H', 'Suto, H', 'Kishi, S', 'Urasaki, Y', 'Ueda, T']","['Fukushima T', 'Yamashita T', 'Takemura H', 'Suto H', 'Kishi S', 'Urasaki Y', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Matsuoka, Japan. tfukus@fmsrsa.fukui-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Mar;24(3):249-54. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00177-0.,,"['S0145-2126(99)00177-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00177-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that a low concentration of ACR induces the in vitro differentiation of leukemic progenitor cells from patients with MDS. ACR (0.1 ng/ml) significantly increased the number of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-dependent colonies from circulating blast cells in vitro in six out of seven MDS patients with refractory anemia with excess of blast in transformation or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, but not in all four patients with primary acute myelogenous leukemia. In these MDS patients, the effect of ACR gradually disappeared along with the progression of MDS. Interestingly, the majority of G-CSF/ACR-dependent colonies consisted of rather differentiated myeloid cells such as myelocytes and metamyelocytes, whereas colonies formed by G-CSF alone were composed mainly of immature blastic cells. The number of G-CSF-responding progenitors significantly increased during a 24-48 h incubation with ACR alone. The circulating blasts in MDS patients expressed G-CSF receptors at unchanged levels before and after the incubation with ACR. It is suggested that ACR might increase clonogenic progenitor responsiveness to G-CSF in MDS, probably through modulating downstream signaling cascades associated with G-CSF receptors, and induce these progenitors to differentiate in response to G-CSF.","['Akashi, K', 'Eto, T', 'Shibuya, T', 'Shimoda, K', 'Harada, M', 'Niho, Y']","['Akashi K', 'Eto T', 'Shibuya T', 'Shimoda K', 'Harada M', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. akashi@leland.stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Mar;24(3):243-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00175-7.,,"['S0145-2126(99)00175-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00175-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The translocation of these genes results in an abnormal chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). The chimeric bcr-abl gene is a fundamental phenomenon in the pathogenesis of CML. Malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells is also accompanied by the c-myc gene changes (translocation, amplification). Nuclear topology of the abl, bcr and c-myc genes was determined in differentiated as well as in irradiated HL-60 cells using dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation and image analysis by means of a high resolution cytometer. After the induction of the granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), the abl and bcr homologous genes were repositioned closer to the nuclear periphery and the average distances between homologous abl-abl and bcr-bcr genes as well as between heterologous abl-bcr genes were elongated as compared with untreated human leukemic promyelocytic HL-60 cells. Elongated gene-to-gene and centre-to-gene distances were also found for the c-myc gene during granulocytic differentiation. In the case of the monocytic maturation of HL-60 cells treated with phorbol esters (PMA), the abl and bcr homologous genes were repositioned closer to each other and closer to the nuclear centre. The position of the c-myc gene did not change significantly after the PMA stimulus. The proximity of the abl and bcr genes was also found after gamma irradiation using 60Co (5 Gy). Immediately after the gamma irradiation c-myc was repositioned closer to the nuclear centre, but 24 h after radiation exposure the c-myc position returned back to the pretreatment level. The c-myc gene topology after gamma irradiation (when the cells are blocked in G2 phase) was different from that detected in the G2 sorted control population. We suggest that changes in the abl, bcr and c-myc topology in the case of gamma irradiation are not the effects of the cell cycle. It is possible, that differences in the cell cycle of hematopoietic cells after the gamma irradiation and concurrent proximity of the abl, bcr and c-myc genes could be important from the point of view of contingent gene translocations, that are responsible for malignant transformation of cells.","['Bartova, E', 'Kozubek, S', 'Kozubek, M', 'Jirsova, P', 'Lukasova, E', 'Skalnikova, M', 'Buchnickova, K']","['Bartova E', 'Kozubek S', 'Kozubek M', 'Jirsova P', 'Lukasova E', 'Skalnikova M', 'Buchnickova K']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, Brno.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*radiation effects', '*Genes, abl', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Mar;24(3):233-41. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00174-5.,,"['S0145-2126(99)00174-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00174-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined here the in vitro effect of CML-derived and normal peripheral blood (PB) monocytes on short- and long-term cultured haematopoietic progenitor cells. Short-term coculture (5 days) of CML or normal monocytes with CML or normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC)/CD34+ cells as targets resulted in a significant inhibition of colony-forming cell (CFC) growth. Coculture conditioned medium (CCM) from 5-days cocultures of normal or CML CD14+ monocytes with CD34+ cells were likewise inhibitory to CFC. In 5-week long-term cocultures of monocytes in direct contact with normal bone marrow (BM) progenitors, CML monocytes reduced the proportion of long-term cultured CFC (LTC-CFC) significantly to 52% of the controls, while normal monocytes had a less pronounced inhibitory effect (89% of the controls) on LTC-CFC. Reduction of LTC-CFC was great when CML monocytes and target cells were separated by a transwell membrane as compared to control cultures in the absence of CD14+ cells (53.5 vs. 9%). CCM from 5-week cocultures of normal or CML CD14+ monocytes with CD34+ progenitors from bone marrow (BM) cells were also inhibitory to CFC.

Among non-M3 AML 15 patients were categorized without EMD and 17 cases with EMD. Cytogenetic abnormalities of chromosome 5, 7, 3 or a complex karyotype were found in eight of 17 patients with EMD and in one of 15 cases without EMD (P = 0.018). Seven patients in each category exhibited a normal karyotype. Classical induction therapy with three to four doses of daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 and standard doses of cytosine arabinoside (AraC) for 7 days lead to complete remission in 11 of 14 (78.6%) cases without EMD but only in four of 14 (28.6%) cases with EMD (P = 0.021). High doses (2000 mg/m2 per 12-h x 10) of AraC plus daunorubicin induced complete remission in seven of 10 patients with EMD. Patients with EMD showed significantly worse overall survival (P = 0.03) with a median 13.5 months, while the median survival was estimated to 68.7 months in cases without EMD. The dysplastic features of EMD, karyotypes typical for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), poor response to classical therapy and survival show a relation of AML with EMD to MDS. AML without EMD may represent a different biological favorable category.","['Lemez, P', 'Galikova, J', 'Haas, T']","['Lemez P', 'Galikova J', 'Haas T']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Hospital Jihlava, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Erythroblasts/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/etiology/genetics/*pathology']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Mar;24(3):207-15. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00184-8.,,"['S0145-2126(99)00184-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00184-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The induction regimen included high dose ara-C (3 g/m2 by 3-h i.v. days 1-5) and mitoxantrone (80 mg/m2 by 15-30 min i.v. 12-20 h after the first dose of ara-C). The study design called for a maximum of 55 patients, with early termination if less than nine of the first 30 achieved complete remission. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients entered the study, and 31 were included in the analysis. All 31 completed one course of induction therapy. Four patients died of infection and a fifth of cardiomyopathy with possible sepsis. Seven patients achieved complete remission (23%; 95% confidence interval 10-41%).

The hypothesis explored is that the proliferation and survival signals are distinct and can be separately studied with the proper cell lines and growth factor stimulation. The anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and BAD are highly implicated in EPO-dependent survival of erythroid cells. Stat5 activity appears to be upstream of Bcl-XL expression such that pathologic, constitutive activation of Stat5 may be a common event in leukemic cells that become resistant to apoptosis by constitutive expression of Bcl-XL. Other signals apparently also control the expression of Bcl-XL, such as the expression of JunB which seem to be required to suppress Bcl-XL expression when EPO is withdrawn. Apoptosis may also be triggered by inactivation of Bcl-XL by BAD. Dephosphorylation of BAD as a result of withdrawal of survival factors converts prosurvival BAD to proapoptotic BAD. Phosphorylation of BAD at the serine 112 residue seems critical to promoting survival. Constitutive activation of a kinase that phosphorylates BAD serine 112 may, therefore, contribute to resistance to apoptosis in leukemic cells. We describe the resistance of erythroleukemic cells to apoptosis induced by EPO withdrawal apparently caused by constitutive BAD phosphorylation. The resistance to apoptosis in these cells is reversed by treatment with the PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, suggesting that resistance to apoptosis in these cells likely results from constitutive P13-kinase that is an upstream activator of an S-112 BAD kinase. The MAP kinase cascade is apparently active in EPO-dependent and stem cell factor (SCF)-dependent proliferation but not survival. In addition, autocrine tumor necrosis factor-a! (TNF-alpha) may also be a proliferation factor not affecting survival.

We tested the hypothesis that the pulmonary epithelium is susceptible to retroviral-mediated gene transfer when stimulated to proliferate by a mitogen, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). METHODS: Rats received keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, 2.5 micrograms/g x 4 doses, two consecutive days) intratracheally followed by high titer amphotropic retrovirus expressing beta-galactosidase. Gene transfer was assessed five days later. RESULTS: KGF stimulated transient proliferation in the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelia (30-40% PCNA positive cells at peak) which decreased to background levels seven days after administration. Gene transfer to epithelia (X-Gal positive cells) occurred more frequently in KGF treated rats, but proliferation exceeded the level of gene transfer. X-gal positive cells were noted in the alveolar epithelium and occasionally in the bronchiolar epithelium. In order to understand the discrepancy between the number of proliferating and transduced cells, primary rat tracheal epithelium cultured at the air-liquid interface was infected from either the apical or basolateral side. Gene transfer was achieved only through basolateral application of vector, suggesting that epithelial polarity represents a barrier to MuLV-based lung gene transfer in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: KGF transiently stimulates epithelial proliferation in vivo, facilitating MuLV-based gene transfer. Retroviral vectors may encounter multiple barriers which have evolved to defend the lung from infections.","['Wang, G', 'Slepushkin, V A', 'Bodner, M', 'Zabner, J', 'van Es, H H', 'Thomas, P', 'Jolly, D J', 'Davidson, B L', 'McCray, P B Jr']","['Wang G', 'Slepushkin VA', 'Bodner M', 'Zabner J', 'van Es HH', 'Thomas P', 'Jolly DJ', 'Davidson BL', 'McCray PB Jr']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (FGF10 protein, human)', '0 (FGF7 protein, human)', '0 (Fgf10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fgf10 protein, rat)', '0 (Fgf7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fgf7 protein, rat)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 10)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '126469-10-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Polarity', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 10', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 7', '*Fibroblast Growth Factors', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lung/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gene Med. 1999 Jan-Feb;1(1):22-30. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1521-2254(199901/02)1:1<22::aid-jgm1>3.3.co;2-o.,,['10.1002/(sici)1521-2254(199901/02)1:1<22::aid-jgm1>3.3.co;2-o [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In AML, identification of MLL breakpoints is an important prognostic factor. Breakpoints are clustered in an 8 kb DNA fragment (bcr) and can be detected by Southern blotting or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Our objective in this study was to design a DNA probe set that enables optimal detection of MLL rearrangements using interphase FISH. Two PAC clones, 217A21 and 167K13, spanning the MLL gene with a minimal overlap in the bcr were isolated and labeled. Twenty-seven AML/ALL patients with cytogenetic 11q23 abnormalities, seven AML/ALL patients without 11q23 abnormalities but MLL rearrangement by Southern blotting, and eight healthy donors were analyzed by FISH. We compared this double-color FISH analysis with FISH using a YAC clone (yB22B2) and with Southern blotting. The PAC probe combination detects an MLL breakpoint in all cases with MLL rearrangement detected by Southern blotting except for cases with a partial tandem duplication detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). FISH using the PAC probes also detected MLL breakpoints in four cases with MLL deletions telomeric to the breakpoint that could not be detected by the single probe yB22B2. This new probe set provides a reliable and rapid assay for the diagnosis of AML and ALL patients with MLL/11q23 breakpoints.","['von Bergh, A', 'Emanuel, B', 'van Zelderen-Bhola, S', 'Smetsers, T', 'van Soest, R', 'Stul, M', 'Vranckx, H', 'Schuuring, E', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Kluin, P']","['von Bergh A', 'Emanuel B', 'van Zelderen-Bhola S', 'Smetsers T', 'van Soest R', 'Stul M', 'Vranckx H', 'Schuuring E', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Kluin P']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Robust estimation of susceptibility to apoptosis within neoplastic cell populations provides a means of either accurately determining pharmacologically induced changes in apoptosis sensitivity or comparing cell population responses to different apoptosis inducers. METHODS: Experimentally determined CFDs for VP-16 (etoposide)-induced apoptosis were measured by phosphotidylserine surface expression and mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation (DeltaPsi(m)) in BV173 leukemia cells. CFDs were modelled by a modified Hill equation using a four-parameter nonlinear regression from which median apoptosis tolerance (K) was estimated. RESULTS: Median apoptosis tolerance (K) was estimated from nonlinear regression analysis of CFDs for DeltaPsi(m) collapse and loss of membrane asymmetry. The error distribution of K determined from nonlinear regression analysis of 100 simulated CFDs was shown to exhibit an asymmetrical distribution. The asymmetrical likelihood intervals for K were computed iteratively, thereby providing a measure of experimental error. CONCLUSIONS: A distribution-based approach to apoptosis assay using multivariate flow analysis offers a powerful, quantitative technique for investigating the phenotypical basis of neoplastic cell responsiveness to apoptosis therapy, permitting separation of cell populations on the basis of apoptosis susceptibility.","['Fennell, D A', 'Cotter, F E']","['Fennell DA', 'Cotter FE']","[""Department of Experimental Haematology, St Bartholomew's and The Royal London School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Light', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Linear Models', 'Membrane Lipids/biosynthesis', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Phosphatidylserines/biosynthesis', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 Apr 1;39(4):266-74.,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(20000401)39:4<266::AID-CYTO4>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]'],"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATM mutations are also involved in the development of sporadic human cancers such as T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Little is known, however, on the association of ATM mutations with non-lymphoid malignancy. Here, we analyzed a panel of cell lines derived from human solid tumors for the presence of ATM mutations. PCR-SSCP analysis of 25 tumor cell lines revealed 50 sequence alterations in 16 cell lines. The most striking feature was a high frequency of deletions within the intronic mononucleotide tracts exclusively in the 5 colon tumor cell lines with microsatellite instability, which accounted for 62% of the sequence alterations observed here. Generation of aberrant splicing variants (497del22 or 1236del372) was associated with 2 such intronic deletions at splice acceptor sites preceding ATM exon 8 or exon 12, respectively. The level of ATM protein was partially depressed in the 3 cell lines where expression of protein-truncating 497del22 transcripts dominated. This implies that ATM is a novel mutation target of microsatellite instability where abnormal transcripts are generated indirectly by intronic mutations, which is distinct from the other mutation targets such as the type II TGF-beta receptor gene or BAX, where exonic repeats are directly affected.","['Ejima, Y', 'Yang, L', 'Sasaki, M S']","['Ejima Y', 'Yang L', 'Sasaki MS']","['Department of Radiological Sciences and Technology, Hiroshima Prefectural College of Health and Welfare, Hiroshima, Japan. ezima@hpc.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', '*Introns', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Apr 15;86(2):262-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000415)86:2<262::aid-ijc17>3.0.co;2-i.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000415)86:2<262::AID-IJC17>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000415)86:2<262::aid-ijc17>3.0.co;2-i [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a cytofluorimetric approach, we found that ET-18-OCH(3) induced disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) followed by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA fragmentation in leukemic cells. ET-18-OCH(3) also induced caspase-3 activation in human leukemic cells, as assessed by cleavage of caspase-3 into the p17 active form and cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). ET-18-OCH(3) analogues unable to induce apoptosis failed to disrupt DeltaPsi(m) and to activate caspase-3. ET-18-OCH(3)-resistant Jurkat cells generated from sensitive Jurkat cells showed no caspase-3 activation and did not undergo DeltaPsi(m) disruption upon ET-18-OCH(3) incubation. Cyclosporin A partially inhibited DeltaPsi(m) dissipation, caspase activation and apoptosis in ET-18-OCH(3)-treated leukemic cells. Overexpression of bcl-2 by gene transfer prevented DeltaPsi(m) collapse, ROS generation, caspase activation and apoptosis in ET-18-OCH(3)-treated leukemic T cells. Pretreatment with the caspase inhibitor Z-Asp-2, 6-dichlorobenzoyloxymethylketone prevented ET-18-OCH(3)-induced PARP proteolysis and DNA fragmentation, but not DeltaPsi(m) dissipation. ET-18-OCH(3) did not affect the expression of caspases and bcl-2-related genes. ET-18-OCH(3)-induced apoptosis did not require protein synthesis. Our data indicate that DeltaPsi(m) dissipation and caspase-3 activation are critical events of the apoptotic cascade triggered by the antitumor ether lipid ET-18-OCH(3), and that the sequence of events in the apoptotic action of ET-18-OCH(3) on human leukemic cells is: DeltaPsi(m) disruption, caspase-3 activation and internucleosomal DNA degradation.","['Gajate, C', 'Santos-Beneit, A M', 'Macho, A', 'Lazaro, M d', 'Hernandez-De Rojas, A', 'Modolell, M', 'Munoz, E', 'Mollinedo, F']","['Gajate C', 'Santos-Beneit AM', 'Macho A', 'Lazaro Md', 'Hernandez-De Rojas A', 'Modolell M', 'Munoz E', 'Mollinedo F']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Apr 15;86(2):208-18. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000415)86:2<208::aid-ijc10>3.0.co;2-e.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000415)86:2<208::AID-IJC10>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000415)86:2<208::aid-ijc10>3.0.co;2-e [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the authors examined the use of ciprofloxacin as outpatient management in selected patients with fever during an episode of neutropenia. METHODS: Febrile neutropenic patients with a diagnosis of cancer were eligible for outpatient management with oral ciprofloxacin if they appeared well and demonstrated the following characteristics: age 1-21 years, malignancy in remission, absolute phagocyte count > 100/mm(3), > 7 days since the initiation of the last course of chemotherapy, and reliable parents. Eligible children received a single dose of ceftazidime and were observed for 2-23 hours. Patients were discharged receiving oral ciprofloxacin (20/mg/kg/day divided in 2 doses) until the patient was afebrile for 24 hours, had sterile blood cultures, and had evidence of bone marrow recovery. Patients were admitted if they appeared toxic, had positive blood cultures, or were febrile for >/= 5 days. RESULTS: Forty-five evaluable episodes occurred in 32 children. Forty of the 45 patients (89%) were treated successfully in the outpatient setting. The 95% lower confidence bound on the proportion of successful outcomes was 70%. Five children required hospitalization: 2 due to noncompliance, 1 to receive intravenous acyclovir for herpes zoster, and 2 (4%) whose blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus viridans and S. pneumoniae. All had uncomplicated hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that very carefully selected, low risk patients with febrile neutropenia may be treated successfully without hospitalization using oral ciprofloxacin. Additional research is required to refine further the optimal criteria for the selection of appropriate patients for outpatient management.","['Aquino, V M', 'Herrera, L', 'Sandler, E S', 'Buchanan, G R']","['Aquino VM', 'Herrera L', 'Sandler ES', 'Buchanan GR']","['Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas 75235-9063, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ciprofloxacin/*administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Apr 1;88(7):1710-4.,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000401)88:7<1710::AID-CNCR27>3.0.CO;2-1 [pii]'],['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],['T32 CA09640/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study population was comprised of all young adult survivors (n = 96) of childhood cancer who were seen in the After the Cancer Experience (ACE) Young Adult Program prior to January 31, 1999. The median age of the survivors was 22.8 years (range, 17-34 years) and the median interval from the time of cancer diagnosis was 15.2 years (range, 6-25 years). Primary cancer groups included: leukemia, 33%; sarcoma, 24%; Hodgkin disease, 15%; non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 12%; Wilms' tumor, 9%; and other, 7%. Late effects were graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 2 (CTCv2), developed by the National Cancer Institute. RESULTS: Approximately 69% of the patients (66 of 96) had at least 1 late effect. Thirty-three percent of patients had a single late effect whereas 36% had >/= 2 late effects. Thirty percent of patients had a CTCv2 Grade 3 or 4 late effect. CONCLUSIONS: The current study represents an example of a successful multidisciplinary transition program in an ambulatory, adult setting for young adult survivors of childhood cancer. Late effects of cancer treatment are common in young adult survivors, with approximately 33% being moderate to severe. Further studies are needed to modify CTCv2 with the aim of developing a reliable and valid tool to assess late effects in long term survivors of childhood cancer.","['Oeffinger, K C', 'Eshelman, D A', 'Tomlinson, G E', 'Buchanan, G R', 'Foster, B M']","['Oeffinger KC', 'Eshelman DA', 'Tomlinson GE', 'Buchanan GR', 'Foster BM']","['Department of Family Practice and Community Medicine, After the Cancer Experience (ACE) Young Adult Program, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas 75235-9067, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', '*Continuity of Patient Care', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', '*Survivors']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Apr 1;88(7):1687-95.,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000401)88:7<1687::AID-CNCR24>3.0.CO;2-M [pii]'],['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the current study was to determine the diagnostic value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzyme analysis for the diagnosis of CNS involvement in hematooncologic patients. METHODS: The study was comprised of 63 consecutive hematooncologic patients without previous CNS disease who underwent CSF examination as an integral part of their initial staging procedures (44 patients) or for the evaluation of neurologic symptoms (19 patients). Fifteen of these patients had CNS involvement by leukemia or lymphoma. The LDH isoenzyme pattern was established in the CSF of all patients and analyzed by the classification and regression trees (CART) method to construct a decision tree for the prediction of CNS involvement. An additional group of 30 consecutive patients comprised a validation set that was used for cross-validation of the CART-derived decision tree. RESULTS: A decision tree, with a single split at LDH5 >/= 2.8% for the prediction of CNS involvement, was constructed and validated by data from a validation set of patients. The decision tree had a sensitivity of 93% and a negative predictive value of 98%. One patient (1.6%) and 2 patients (6.6%) were misclassified in the derivation and validation sets, respectively. Overall, in the combined derivation and validation patient population, the decision tree misclassified 3.2% of patients, whereas CSF cytologic examination misclassified 4.3% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the LDH isoenzyme pattern in CSF fluid may be helpful in the evaluation of CNS involvement in patients with hematologic malignancies. The combination of CSF cytology and LDH isoenzyme analysis may improve the sensitivity of CSF cytology significantly.","['Lossos, I S', 'Breuer, R', 'Intrator, O', 'Lossos, A']","['Lossos IS', 'Breuer R', 'Intrator O', 'Lossos A']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital and Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis', '*Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Leukemia/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Apr 1;88(7):1599-604.,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000401)88:7<1599::AID-CNCR14>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]'],['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Atypical carcinoids tend to have less predictable biologic behavior and are associated with a worse prognosis than typical carcinoids. The authors examined apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis regulating proteins Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, and Mcl-1 in 21 typical and 10 atypical bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumors. To find features distinguishing the growth of these types of tumors, the expression of p53 protein and the proliferation marker Ki-67 were also investigated. Finally, the parameters were compared with clinical follow-up data. METHODS: Thirty-one bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumors were examined by using in situ 3'-end labeling of DNA (TUNEL) for apoptosis and immunohistochemical staining methods for Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, Mcl-1, p53, and Ki-67 in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue specimens. RESULTS: The apoptotic indices (AIs) were low in general (mean 0.18%), but higher AIs (> 0.5%) were observed significantly more often in atypical than in typical carcinoids (P < 0.008) in association with shortened survival (P < 0. 008). No relation between apoptosis and Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, or Mcl-1 expression was found. Expression of p53 protein was detected in only three atypical carcinoids, which also had significantly higher AIs than p53 negative tumors (P < 0.03). Proliferation rates measured by Ki-67 index were unusually low; the highest proliferation rates were observed in atypical carcinoids. There was a positive correlation between AI and Ki-67 indices (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the extent of apoptosis in bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumors is low. This, together with a low proliferation rate and an apparent absence of p53 mutation, enables a benign growth pattern. Some atypical carcinoids with enhanced apoptosis are associated with shortened survival, clearly deviating from typical carcinoids.","['Laitinen, K L', 'Soini, Y', 'Mattila, J', 'Paakko, P']","['Laitinen KL', 'Soini Y', 'Mattila J', 'Paakko P']","['Department of Pathology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis', 'Bronchial Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Carcinoid Tumor/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Apr 1;88(7):1590-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(20000401)88:7<1590::aid-cncr13>3.0.co;2-c.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000401)88:7<1590::AID-CNCR13>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(20000401)88:7<1590::aid-cncr13>3.0.co;2-c [doi]']",['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since long-term cultures are known to decrease the number of bcr/abl-fused cells, it is questionable whether similar effects are detectable in short-term cultures, a technique often preceding FISH analysis. Therefore, we evaluated bone marrow aspirates of 10 CML patients at biopsy and after culturing for between 24 and 144 h by FISH. The percentage of bcr/abl-fused cells in FISH varied between 15 and 70% at biopsy. In samples with 15 and 30% of aberrant cells at biopsy, an increase of about 20% per day was seen within the first 48 h. In longer lasting cultures, the percentage of leukaemic cells then asymptotically approached a value of 60-70%. In patients with 38 and 50% of bcr/abl-fused cells at biopsy, an increase of about 20% could be detected in the first 24 h. Then 65-70% of the cells already bore the bcr/abl fusion, and the percentage of leukaemic cells was almost constant for longer lasting cultures up to 144 h. In patients with a percentage of about 70% before culturing, no increase in positive cells was detected. These results emphasize the impact of short-term culturing on the number of bcr/abl-fused cells. In particular, the importance for monitoring CML patients is obvious. Therefore the effect described should be taken into account in order to avoid misinterpretation and incorrect therapy decisions in CML patients.","['Wilkens, L', 'Varga, S', 'Werner, M', 'Nolte, M', 'v Wasielewski, R', 'Georgii, A']","['Wilkens L', 'Varga S', 'Werner M', 'Nolte M', 'v Wasielewski R', 'Georgii A']","['Pathologisches Institut der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover, Deutschland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Fusion', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 1999 Jul-Aug;67(4):163-8. doi: 10.1159/000028067.,,"['28067 [pii]', '10.1159/000028067 [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 S.

The enzyme catalyses the conversion of uridine triphosphate (UTP) into CTP, and has a high activity in various malignancies, which has led to the development of inhibitors of CTP synthetase for therapeutic purposes. We studied both CTP synthetase activity and ribonucleotide concentrations in leukaemic cells of 12 children suffering from acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL), and performed incubation experiments with cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPEC), a nucleoside analogue that is capable of inhibiting CTP synthetase. The CTP synthetase activity in ANLL cells (5.1+/-2.3 nmol CTP/mg/h) was significantly higher compared with granulocytes of healthy controls (0.6+/-0.4 nmol CTP/mg/h, P=0.0002), but was not different from the CTP synthetase activity in non-malignant CD34+ bone marrow cells (5. 6+/-2.4 nmol CTP/mg/h). Major shifts were observed in the various ribonucleotide concentrations in ANLL cells compared with granulocytes: the absolute amount of ribonucleotides was increased with a substantial rise of the CTP (2.4 versus 0.4 pmol/microg protein, P=0.0007) and UTP (8.7 versus 1.6 pmol/microg protein, P=0. 0007) concentrations in ANLL cells compared with granulocytes. Treatment of ANLL cells in vitro with CPEC induced a major depletion (77% with 2.5 microM of CPEC) in the concentration of CTP, whilst the concentrations of the other ribonucleotides remained unchanged. Therefore, the high activity of CTP synthetase in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemic cells can be inhibited by CPEC, which provides a key to a new approach for the treatment of ANLL.","['Verschuur, A C', 'Van Gennip, A H', 'Leen, R', 'Muller, E J', 'Elzinga, L', 'Voute, P A', 'Van Kuilenburg, A B']","['Verschuur AC', 'Van Gennip AH', 'Leen R', 'Muller EJ', 'Elzinga L', 'Voute PA', 'Van Kuilenburg AB']","['Laboratory of Genetic Metabolic Diseases, Division of Clinical Chemistry, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Emma Kinderziekenhuis AMC, P.O.

In the transplant setting, the use of UVB radiation may reduce or abolish T-cell activation without compromising either bone marrow (BM) engraftment or graft-versus-leukemia effect. In this study, BM and apheresis-derived peripheral blood HPCs were used to investigate the effects of UVB on colony-forming ability, CD34+ cell viability, and growth potential, as well as on the secretion of MNC cytokines and the expression of cell surface markers and adhesion molecules. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: After UVB radiation, enriched populations of T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were treated with PHA, and the MNC response was measured, as was colony-forming ability. CD34+ cells were quantified and their growth potential was determined in culture. Next, T-cell activation status, cell adhesion molecule and cell surface activation marker expression, and cytokine profiles were evaluated, and cytokine mRNA was quantitated. Parallel studies were done in unirradiated control cell populations. RESULTS: Low-dose (10 mJ/cm(2)) UVB mitigates MNC proliferative responses by 94 percent while maintaining 60 and 80 percent of colony-forming ability in peripheral blood HPC and BM preparations, respectively, and >50 percent of colony-forming ability in CD34+ cell-enriched samples. Low-dose UVB radiation also significantly reduces T-cell production of TNFalpha, TNFalpha mRNA, TNFbeta, IL-2, and IL-6 and downregulates T-cell expression of CD28, CD25, CD69, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. CONCLUSION: These findings have shown that a ""window"" of low-dose UVB radiation (10 mJ/cm(2)) exists, at which BM- and peripheral blood-derived MNC proliferation is inactivated, while the HPCs are relatively spared. UVB light selectively affects T cells, while APCs are resistant to low doses of UVB. UVB radiation also alters the expression of some cell surface markers and cytokines that are important in T-cell activation pathways. Reduction of T-cell activation without cytocidal effect may allow UVB radiation to become an immunomodulating agent in BM or HPC transplantation.","['Lankford, K V', 'Mosunjac, M', 'Hillyer, C D']","['Lankford KV', 'Mosunjac M', 'Hillyer CD']","['Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and of Medicine, and the Winship Cancer Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/radiation effects', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*radiation effects', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/radiation effects', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/radiation effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/immunology/radiation effects', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2000 Mar;40(3):361-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2000.40030361.x.,,['10.1046/j.1537-2995.2000.40030361.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best mobilization strategy for oncology patients remains unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In 27 patients who met either the CD34 (n = 3) or CFU-GM (n = 2) criteria or both (n = 22), the results obtained with two successive strategies-that is, chemotherapy and G-CSF at 10 microg per kg (Group 1, n = 7) and G-CSF at 10 microg per kg alone (Group 2, n = 20) used for a second mobilization course-were retrospectively analyzed. The patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (5), Hodgkin's disease (3), multiple myeloma (5), chronic myeloid leukemia (1), acute myeloid leukemia (1), breast cancer (6), or other solid tumors (6). Previous therapy consisted of 10 (1-31) cycles of chemotherapy with additional chlorambucil (n = 3), interferon (n = 3), and radiotherapy (n = 7). RESULTS: The second collection was undertaken a median of 35 days after the first one. In Group 1, the results of the two mobilizations were identical. In Group 2, the number of CD34+ cells per kg per apheresis (0.17 [0.02-0.45] vs. 0.44 [0.11-0.45], p = 0. 00002), as well as the number of CFU-GM (0.88 [0.00-13.37] vs. 4.19 [0.96-21.61], p = 0.00003), BFU-E (0.83 [0.00-12.72] vs. 8.81 [1. 38-32.51], p = 0.00001), and CFU-MIX (0.10 [0.00-1.70] vs. 0.56 [0. 00-2.64], p = 0.001134) were significantly higher in the second peripheral blood HPC collection. However, yields per apheresis during the second collection did not significantly differ in the two groups. Six patients in Group 1 and 18 in Group 2 underwent transplantation, and all but one achieved engraftment, with a median of 15 versus 12 days to 1,000 neutrophils (NS), 22 versus 16 days to 1 percent reticulocytes (NS), and 26 versus 26 days to 20,000 platelets (NS), respectively. However, platelet engraftment was particularly delayed in many patients. CONCLUSION: G-CSF at 10 microg per kg alone may constitute a valid alternative to chemotherapy and G-CSF to obtain adequate numbers of peripheral blood HPCs in patients who previously failed to achieve mobilization with chemotherapy and G-CSF. This strategy should be tested in prospective randomized trials.","['Fraipont, V', 'Sautois, B', 'Baudoux, E', 'Pereira, M', 'Fassotte, M F', 'Hermanne, J P', 'Jerusalem, G', 'Longree, L', 'Schaaf-Lafontaine, N', 'Fillet, G', 'Beguin, Y']","['Fraipont V', 'Sautois B', 'Baudoux E', 'Pereira M', 'Fassotte MF', 'Hermanne JP', 'Jerusalem G', 'Longree L', 'Schaaf-Lafontaine N', 'Fillet G', 'Beguin Y']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*immunology']",,2000/03/30 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/30 09:00'],"['2000/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2000 Mar;40(3):339-47. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2000.40030339.x.,,['10.1046/j.1537-2995.2000.40030339.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence analysis of the genomic breakpoints indicated that the translocation had been mediated by an illegitimate V(D)J recombination event that disrupted the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha locus and placed the TCR alpha locus enhancer on the derivative 21 chromosome. We identified a previously unreported transcript, designated BHLHB1 (for basic domain, helix-loop-helix protein, class B, 1) that had been activated by the translocation. BHLHB1 mapped to the region of chromosome 21 that has been proposed to be responsible, at least in part, for the learning deficits seen in children with Down's syndrome. Although BHLHB1 expression normally is restricted to neural tissues, T-cell lymphoblasts with the t(14;21)(q11.2;q22) also expressed high levels of BHLHB1 mRNA. Expression of BHLHB1 dramatically inhibited E2A-mediated transcription activation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and Jurkat T cells. This observation suggests that BHLHB1, similar to SCL/TAL1, may exert a leukemogenic effect through a functional inactivation of E2A or related proteins.","['Wang, J', 'Jani-Sait, S N', 'Escalon, E A', 'Carroll, A J', 'de Jong, P J', 'Kirsch, I R', 'Aplan, P D']","['Wang J', 'Jani-Sait SN', 'Escalon EA', 'Carroll AJ', 'de Jong PJ', 'Kirsch IR', 'Aplan PD']","['Department of Cancer Genetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Mar 28;97(7):3497-502. doi: 10.1073/pnas.97.7.3497.,,"['97/7/3497 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.97.7.3497 [doi]']",,"['P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['GENBANK/AF221520'],PMC16268,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we show that nonviral apoptotic proteins can be displayed on viral membrane surfaces and that the displayed proteins can execute their normal effector functions. We introduced the genes encoding the apoptosis effector proteins, human CD95 ligand (hFasL) or human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (hTRAIL), into a cell line that packages Moloney murine leukemia virus vectors. Retrovirus preparations from these lines killed target cells efficiently, and target killing was prevented by Fas-Ig fusion protein or soluble TRAIL receptor (sDR5), respectively. We show that the virus preparation exhibiting Fas-specific cytotoxicity has the same density as a retrovirus, contains full-length FasL protein, and can be depleted of infectivity by immunoadsorption with anti-FasL antibody. This novel property of retroviruses-the display of functional effector proteins-may allow the custom design of reagents whose normal function requires their being embedded in a membrane.","['Strehlow, D', 'Jodo, S', 'Ju, S T']","['Strehlow D', 'Jodo S', 'Ju ST']","['The Arthritis Center, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, USA. strehlow@bu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Metalloendopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Virus Assembly']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Apr 11;97(8):4209-14. doi: 10.1073/pnas.070049197.,,"['10.1073/pnas.070049197 [doi]', '070049197 [pii]']",,"['R01 AI036938/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-36938/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC18199,,,,,,,,,,,

Atrophy was also seen in the bones, including medullary bones of the chickens suffering from ML. Proliferation of myelocytes was seen in the bone marrow and periosteum of ossified cartilaginous rings of the trachea and larynx. Marked proliferation of myelocytes was seen in the dura mater of spinal cords, and it subsequently depressed the spinal cords. Bone formation with cartilage was seen in the periosteum of the sternum having marked proliferation of myelocytes in the bone marrow and periosteum. Ultrastructurally, tumor cells showed large nuclei and cytoplasm with large round electron-dense lysosomes. The virus particles were rarely detected in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. The polymerase chain reaction test of tumor samples showed positive for subgroup J avian leukosis virus. This study indicates that the myelocytes can invade through the compact bones to the periosteum in the sternum, ribs, vertebrae, synsarcum, and ossified cartilage of trachea and larynx having thinner compact bones. In addition, the periosteal osteogenesis with cartilage in the sternum may be reactive change against the bone atrophy because of the marked proliferation of myelocytes.","['Nakamura, K', 'Ogiso, M', 'Tsukamoto, K', 'Hamazaki, N', 'Hihara, H', 'Yuasa, N']","['Nakamura K', 'Ogiso M', 'Tsukamoto K', 'Hamazaki N', 'Hihara H', 'Yuasa N']","['National Institute of Animal Health, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone and Bones/*pathology', 'Chickens', 'Liver/pathology', 'Poultry Diseases/*pathology']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Avian Dis. 2000 Jan-Mar;44(1):215-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied lymphomas and B-cell leukemias from 25 children with AIDS for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene clonality, c-myc oncogene abnormalities, and presence of HIV and Epstein-Barr virus. RESULTS: Monoclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were identified in 22 of 23 cases tested, the single exception being one of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Immunoglobulin gene/c-myc translocations were found in 3 of 4 cases of B (surface immunoglobulin-positive)-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 8 of 11 small noncleaved cell lymphomas, and 1 of 5 large cell lymphomas. Mutations of c-myc were found in 2 of 13 small noncleaved cell lymphomas, 1 of 2 Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue neoplasms, and 1 of 4 Epstein-Barr virus-negative B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Six small noncleaved cell lymphomas, both mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue neoplasms and one of large cell lymphoma had high levels of Epstein-Barr virus in tumor tissue. Hodgkin's disease tissue and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia tumors were negative for EBV. Proviral HIV-1 was not detected in any tumor. CONCLUSIONS: AIDS-associated lymphoid malignancies in children appear to have a different distribution of histologic subtypes than adult HIV-infected individuals, fewer large cell lymphomas occur in children. The small noncleaved cell lymphomas exhibit a lower frequency as well as different locations of c-myc mutations than AIDS-associated small noncleaved cell lymphomas in adults.","['McClain, K L', 'Leach, C T', 'Jenson, H B', 'Joshi, V V', 'Pollock, B H', 'Hutchison, R E', 'Murphy, S B']","['McClain KL', 'Leach CT', 'Jenson HB', 'Joshi VV', 'Pollock BH', 'Hutchison RE', 'Murphy SB']","[""Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Hematology Service, Houston, USA. kmcclain@txccc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),100892005,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications/genetics', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, myc', 'HIV/isolation & purification', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*complications', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/*complications', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/genetics', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2000 Feb 1;23(2):152-9. doi: 10.1097/00126334-200002010-00007.,,['10.1097/00126334-200002010-00007 [doi]'],,"['CA55507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on our experiences with ten cardiac procedures in nine patients (3 males, 6 females, 19-85 yr old, mean age 61 yr). METHODS AND RESULTS: There were two patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and one patient each with Waldenstrom's syndrome, multiple myeloma, polycythemia, myelodysplasia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and idiopathic aplastic anemia. Cardiac diseases included coronary artery disease in six, aortic stenosis in two, and mitral insufficiency in one patient. Consecutively, cardiac procedures were coronary artery bypass grafting in six, aortic valve replacement in two, and mitral valve replacement in one patient. No patient died. Postoperatively, one patient suffered from a pericardial tamponade requiring surgical removal and 5 months later from a prosthetic endocarditis necessitating change of the bioprosthesis. One patient developed a superficial wound infection, which was treated conservatively. Four patients received no blood products. Altogether, we transfused 32 packed red blood cells, seven units of fresh frozen plasma and 16 platelet concentrates. Total drainage loss was 883 ml (250-1510 ml). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac surgery in patients suffering from malignant hematological disorders may be performed, but carries an increased morbidity.

Treatment of cells with taxol for 12 h resulted in apoptosis of HL-60 cells. TPA was protective against taxol-induced apoptosis and this anti-apoptotic effect was reversible when TPA was used in conjunction with staurosporine and H-7, PKC inhibitors, suggesting that TPA may protect HL-60 cells against taxol-induced apoptosis via the PKC-dependent pathway. Since TPA stimulates MEK signal transduction pathway in HL-60 cells, we postulated that MEK pathway may be playing a role in the ability of TPA to inhibit taxol-induced apoptosis. PD098059, a specific MEK kinase inhibitor, abolished the ability of TPA to inhibit taxol-induced apoptosis.

Hypusine is formed by the transfer of the butylamine portion from spermidine to the epsilon-amino group of a specific lysine residue of eIF-5A precursor and the subsequent hydroxylation at carbon 2 of the incoming 4-aminobutyl moiety. Agents that reduce cell hypusine levels inhibit the growth of mammalian cells. These observations suggest that hypusine is crucial for proliferation and transformation of eukaryotic cells. Here we have studied whether the inhibition of hypusine synthesis can potentiate the anti-cancer activity of the anti-tumour agents interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) and cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). We have found that IFN alpha increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) expression, but reduced S phase and proliferative marker expression in human epidermoid KB cells and that this effect was antagonised by epidermal growth factor (EGF). Growth inhibition induced by IFN alpha was paralleled by decreased hypusine synthesis and, when EGF counteracted anti-proliferative effects, a reconstitution of hypusine levels was recorded. We also studied the effects of IFN alpha on the cytotoxicity of the recombinant toxin TP40 which inhibits elongation factor 2, another step of protein synthesis, through EGF-R binding and internalisation; IFN alpha induced an about 27-fold increase of TP40 cytotoxicity in KB cells. Ara-C, another antineoplastic agent commonly used in haematologic malignancies, induced both apoptosis and iron depletion in human acute myeloid leukaemic cells. The combination of ara-C and of the iron chelator desferioxamine, a strong inhibitor of hypusine synthesis, had a synergistic activity on apoptosis in these cells. The data strongly suggest that the post-translational modifications of eIF-5A could be a suitable target for the potentiation of the activity of anti-cancer agents.","['Caraglia, M', 'Tagliaferri, P', 'Budillon, A', 'Abbruzzese, A']","['Caraglia M', 'Tagliaferri P', 'Budillon A', 'Abbruzzese A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics F.

As p53 is involved in the maintenance of chromosomal stability, we investigated the role of p53 in the emergence of abnormal karyotypes in cells which had undergone lineage switching. Single strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis of cDNA, together with protein immunoprecipitations, were used to assess the p53 status of parental and variant cell lines. Unexpectedly, four or five monocytic lines with chromosomal alterations contained wild type p53. Conversely, a p53 point mutation found in one aneuploid monocytic line was also present in the diploid parental pre-B cell.

Further analysis revealed that these ribonucleotides were formed from labeled 2-chloroadenine (CAde), which contaminated commercial tritiated CdA at a proportion of 2-3%. Since CAde is the major catabolite of CdA measured in plasma after oral or intravenous administration of CdA to patients, its metabolism and in particular its potential cytotoxicity were investigated both in EHEB cells and in B-CLL lymphocytes. Phosphorylation of CAde was inhibited by adenine, indicating that its initial metabolism most probably proceeds via adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7). In both cell types, chloro-ATP was the major metabolite formed from CAde and its concentration increased proportionally at least up to 50 microM CAde. At high concentration, CAde metabolism was accompanied by a decrease in intracellular ATP. Cytotoxicity of CAde, evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, showed an IC(50) of 16 microM in EHEB cells and 5 microM in B-CLL lymphocytes. At cytotoxic concentrations, apopain/caspase-3 activation and high molecular weight DNA fragmentation were observed, indicating that CAde cytotoxicity results from induction of apoptosis. However, since CAde cytotoxicity requires higher concentrations than CdA, it probably does not play a role in the therapeutic effect of CdA in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Bontemps, F', 'Delacauw, A', 'Cardoen, S', 'Van Den Neste, E', 'Van Den Berghe, G']","['Bontemps F', 'Delacauw A', 'Cardoen S', 'Van Den Neste E', 'Van Den Berghe G']","['Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Christian de Duve Institute of Cellular Pathology, Brussels, Belgium. bontemps@bchm.ucl.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '1839-18-5 (2-chloroadenine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cladribine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Nucleotides/biosynthesis', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 May 15;59(10):1237-43. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00258-6.,,"['S0006-2952(00)00258-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00258-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug-induced growth inhibition paralleled the uptake of HMAF into both tumor and normal cells, although normal cells were 3- to 4-fold more tolerant to the accumulated drug. In both tumor and normal cells, approximately two-thirds of internalized [(14)C]HMAF-derived radioactivity was bound covalently to macromolecules. Trypan blue exclusion and cell counts indicated that HMAF was cytotoxic in tumor but cytostatic in normal cells. Correspondingly, profound apoptosis was detected in all tumor cell lines examined. A 4-hr treatment with HMAF followed by 20-hr post-incubation induced a potent DNA fragmentation in nearly all tumor lines. Apoptosis-resistant PC-3 and HT-29 cells underwent significant DNA fragmentation after 24 hr of continuous treatment with HMAF. In contrast to tumor cell lines, marginal or very low levels of apoptosis were detected in the normal cells even after prolonged treatments with HMAF at concentrations that exceeded 15- to 800-fold the GI(50) values in tumor cells. This resistance of normal cells to apoptosis could not be accounted for by differences in drug accumulation or drug covalent binding to macromolecules. The qualitatively different responses of the tumor and normal cells studied suggest a greater tolerance of normal cells to HMAF-macromolecular adducts. The demonstrated differential cytotoxic/cytostatic and apoptotic effects of HMAF can be of significance for the clinical use of this promising new agent.","['Woynarowska, B A', 'Woynarowski, J M', 'Herzig, M C', 'Roberts, K', 'Higdon, A L', 'MacDonald, J R']","['Woynarowska BA', 'Woynarowski JM', 'Herzig MC', 'Roberts K', 'Higdon AL', 'MacDonald JR']","['The University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA. bwoynar@saci.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '6B799IH05A (irofulven)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 May 15;59(10):1217-26. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00254-9.,,"['S0006-2952(00)00254-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00254-9 [doi]']",,['R01 CA 78706/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current investigation, we analysed expression of EAT/mcl-1 at the mRNA level by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization, as well as at the protein level, by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Our results identified constant expression of this gene in the placenta throughout pregnancy as well as a shift in its localization from the cytotrophoblast in the first trimester to the syncytiotrophoblast in the third trimester. In addition, there was an inverse correlation between EAT/mcl-1 expression and TaT-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labelling (TUNEL) reactivity in trophoblasts in the first trimester.

Six to 20 h later, the expression of CD69, an early T-cell activation antigen, was detected using flowcytometry. Living cells and necrotic cells served as control groups. Apoptotic K562 or HL-60 cells induced by either FTY720 or CHX unanimously inhibited CD69 expression on the CD3+ mouse T cells while living and necrotic cells did not. The inhibition was proportional to the number of apoptotic cells and was different in the T-cell subsets, showing a rapid and transient inhibition on the CD3+CD8+ T-cell activation but with a slow and continuous inhibition on CD3+CD8- T-cell activation. In conclusion, the apoptotic cells actively inhibit a T-cell activation that is independent of the cell lines or the apoptotic inducers, indicating that the apoptotic cells dominantly regulate T-cell immunity.","['Sun, E', 'Zhang, L', 'Zeng, Y', 'Ge, Q', 'Zhao, M', 'Gao, W']","['Sun E', 'Zhang L', 'Zeng Y', 'Ge Q', 'Zhao M', 'Gao W']","['Hemopurification and Renal Transplantation Center, Zhujiang Hospital, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Concanavalin A/*pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Propylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/*metabolism']",,2000/03/29 00:00,2000/03/29 00:01,['2000/03/29 00:00'],"['2000/03/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/29 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2000 Mar;51(3):231-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3083.2000.00666.x.,,"['sji666 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-3083.2000.00666.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to determine the relationship between antiasparaginase antibodies or hypersensitivity reactions and event-free survival (EFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-four children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia received Escherichia coli asparaginase 10,000 IU/m(2) intramuscularly three times weekly for nine doses during multiagent induction and reinduction phases and for seven monthly doses during continuation treatment. Erwinia asparaginase was used in case of clinical hypersensitivity to E coli but not for subclinical development of antibodies.

RESULTS: Antibodies were detectable in 54 patients (35.5%), of whom 30 (55.6%) exhibited hypersensitivity to asparaginase. Of the 98 patients who had no detectable antibodies, 18 (18.4%) had allergic reactions. Patients with antibodies were more likely to have a reaction than those without antibodies (P <.001).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven children with very high-risk ALL were randomized (slow early response to therapy, 55 patients; translocation t(9;22) or t(4;11), 12 patients). Consolidation consisted of six courses of chemotherapy; the first, third, and fifth courses were a combination of high-dose cytarabine, etoposide, and dexamethasone (R3), whereas the second, fourth, and sixth courses included vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (COPADM). G-CSF was given after each course, and the next scheduled course was started as soon as neutrophil count was > 1 x 10(9)/L and platelet count was > 100 x 10(9)/L. CDI was calculated using the interval from day 1 of the first course to hematologic recovery after the fifth course (100% CDI = 105-day interval). RESULTS: CDI was significantly increased in the G-CSF group compared with the non-G-CSF group (mean +/- 95% confidence interval, 105 +/- 5% v 91 +/- 4%; P <.001). This higher intensity was a result of shorter post-R3 intervals in the G-CSF group, whereas the post-COPADM intervals were not statistically reduced. After the R3 courses, the number of days with fever and intravenous antibiotics and duration of hospitalization were significantly decreased by G-CSF, whereas reductions observed after COPADM were not statistically significant. Duration of granulocytopenia was reduced in the G-CSF group, but thrombocytopenia was prolonged, and the number of platelet transfusions was increased. Finally, the 3-year probability of event-free survival was not different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: G-CSF can increase CDI in high-risk childhood ALL. Its effects depend on the chemotherapy regimen given before G-CSF administration.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred forty-seven children (ages 1 to 15 years) with previously untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were enrolled onto the Tokyo L92-13 study, which excluded patients with mature B-cell ALL and patients less than 1 year old. One hundred twenty-four patients were classified as standard risk, 122 as high risk, and 101 as extremely high risk, according to age, peripheral-blood leukocyte count, selected genetic abnormalities, and immunophenotype. All subjects received four drugs for remission induction, followed by a risk-directed multidrug intensification phase and therapy for presymptomatic leukemia in the CNS. Maintenance chemotherapy with oral mercaptopurine and methotrexate was administered for 6 months, with all treatment stopped by 1 year after diagnosis. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival rates for all patients were 59.5% +/- 3.4% and 81.5% +/- 2.2%, respectively, at 5. 5 years after diagnosis. EFS rates by risk category were similar (60. 2% +/- 6.0% for standard risk, 57.7% +/- 5.6% for high risk, and 62. 5% +/- 5.7% for extremely high risk), whereas overall survival rates differed significantly (91.2% +/- 2.7%, 80.0% +/- 4.1%, and 72.1% +/- 4.5%, respectively, P <.0001 by the log-rank test). There were 107 relapses. Eighty-five (79.4%) of these 107 patients achieved second complete remissions, with subsequent EFS rates of 61.5% +/- 7. 9% (standard risk), 42.6% +/- 8.1% (high risk), and 9.6% +/- 6.4% (extremely high risk). Of the five risk factors analyzed, only the response to prednisolone monotherapy among extremely high-risk patients proved important. CONCLUSION: Early treatment intensification did not compensate for a truncated phase of maintenance chemotherapy in children with standard- or high-risk ALL. However, 6 months of antimetabolite treatment seemed adequate for extremely high-risk patients who were good responders to prednisolone and received intensified chemotherapy that included high-dose cytarabine early in the clinical course.","['Toyoda, Y', 'Manabe, A', 'Tsuchida, M', 'Hanada, R', 'Ikuta, K', 'Okimoto, Y', 'Ohara, A', 'Ohkawa, Y', 'Mori, T', 'Ishimoto, K', 'Sato, T', 'Kaneko, T', 'Maeda, M', 'Koike, K i', 'Shitara, T', 'Hoshi, Y', 'Hosoya, R', 'Tsunematsu, Y', 'Bessho, F', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Saito, T']","['Toyoda Y', 'Manabe A', 'Tsuchida M', 'Hanada R', 'Ikuta K', 'Okimoto Y', 'Ohara A', 'Ohkawa Y', 'Mori T', 'Ishimoto K', 'Sato T', 'Kaneko T', 'Maeda M', 'Koike Ki', 'Shitara T', 'Hoshi Y', 'Hosoya R', 'Tsunematsu Y', 'Bessho F', 'Nakazawa S', 'Saito T']","[""Department of Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, and Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Apr;18(7):1508-16. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.7.1508.,,['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.7.1508 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-two consecutive, previously untreated patients with Hodgkin's disease who were younger than 20 years of age at diagnosis and who were referred to Roswell Park Cancer Institute (Buffalo, NY) for treatment between January 1, 1960, and December 31, 1989, were studied. Sex-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship of several demographic and treatment variables to SMN incidence. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients developed an SMN at a mean of 14.93 +/- 8.09 years (range, 2.65 to 29.88 years) after diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease. The cumulative percentage of patients who developed an SMN was 26.27 +/- 6.75% at 30 years after diagnosis. The SIR was 9.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.05 to 18.49) for male patients and 10.16 (95% CI, 5.56 to 17.05) for female patients. The most frequent SMNs were thyroid cancer, breast cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and acute leukemia. Multivariate analysis of sex, treatment with any alkylating agent, treatment with doxorubicin, splenectomy, and relapse (as a time-dependent covariate) with time to SMN onset gave nonsignificant results. CONCLUSION: Successfully treated children and adolescents with Hodgkin's disease have a substantial risk for the occurrence of subsequent neoplasms. The most frequent SMNs (skin, thyroid, and breast) are readily detected by physical examination and available screening procedures.","['Green, D M', 'Hyland, A', 'Barcos, M P', 'Reynolds, J A', 'Lee, R J', 'Hall, B C', 'Zevon, M A']","['Green DM', 'Hyland A', 'Barcos MP', 'Reynolds JA', 'Lee RJ', 'Hall BC', 'Zevon MA']","['Departments of Pediatrics, Cancer Prevention, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Pathology, Radiation Medicine, and Psychology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. daniel.green@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Factors']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Apr;18(7):1492-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.7.1492.,,['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.7.1492 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of knowledge of the sequence of the selected gene, various modifications of Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) technology have been employed. Several lines of evidence in mouse and cattle indicate that expression patterns of genes from in vitro-produced embryos are not necessarily representative of those of in vivo embryos. An important gene that has been found to be expressed by in vivo-derived bovine blastocysts, but not in their in vitro-produced counterparts, is the Connexin43 gene that is crucial for maintenance of compaction. The bovine leukemia inhibitory factor (bLIF) and LIF-receptor-beta (LR-beta) genes were expressed by in vitro-produced embryos, but not in their in vivo counterparts. The heat shock protein gene 70.1 (Hsp 70.1) was upregulated by blastocysts produced in vitro compared to in vivo embryos, while the glucose transporter-1 mRNA (Glut-1) was downregulated by morulae produced in vitro as compared to in vivo-derived morulae. Furthermore, mRNA expression levels of a set of ""marker genes"" were shown to be affected by the presence or absence of serum in the culture medium. Most embryos grown under serum-free conditions had higher mRNA abundances than those cultured in serum-enriched medium. It is hypothesized that persistent alterations of the normal gene expression patterns may be responsible for the large offspring syndrome that is observed in approximately one third of the calves resulting from the transfer of in vitro-produced embryos. A primary candidate for such deviations may be an altered methylation pattern that can either lead to silencing or induction of a specific gene. Messenger RNA phenotyping of genes essential in early development provides a useful tool to assess the normality of the produced embryos and a tool to optimize in vitro culture conditions for bovine embryos.","['Niemann, H', 'Wrenzycki, C']","['Niemann H', 'Wrenzycki C']","['Department of Biotechnology, Institut fur Tierzucht und Tierverhalten (FAL), Neustadt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Theriogenology,Theriogenology,0421510,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*metabolism', 'Cattle/*embryology/*genetics', 'Culture Techniques', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro/veterinary', '*Gene Expression', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",80,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Theriogenology. 2000 Jan 1;53(1):21-34. doi: 10.1016/s0093-691x(99)00237-x.,,"['S0093-691X(99)00237-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0093-691x(99)00237-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these, 27 (16 boys and 11 girls) were evaluable. Median age at diagnosis was 6.3 (range: 1.9-15.7) years. This population was treated with two consecutive protocols: 13 patients were included in the AML-HPG-90 protocol and 14 in the AML-HPG-95. The initial treatment was the same for both protocols: an induction 8-day phase with cytarabine, idarubicin, and etoposide was followed by a consolidation with cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, 6-mercaptopurine, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone. Two courses of intensification with high-dose (HD) cytarabine and etoposide were given in the first study. Only one intensification course was administered in the second study, with HD cytarabine plus idarubicin or etoposide decided by randomization. Complete remission was achieved in 67% (18/27) of cases. Mortality on induction was quite high, 30% (8/27) mainly due to hemorrhages from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The event-free survival estimate for all patients was 0.47 (SE: 0.1). From April 1994, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) was administered just during the first days of the induction phase (median: 9, range: 2-27) to stop or prevent DIC. Eighteen patients received ATRA and 9 did not. Three patients developed signs of ATRA syndrome during the first days of administration but no one died due to this toxicity. The impact of a short course of ATRA on early control of DIC was studied by analyzing the number of platelet, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma transfusions during the induction phase in both groups. No statistical differences in complete remission rate, early mortality, need of transfusion of blood components for DIC, and survival estimates could be established between patients who received ATRA and those who did not. ATRA used in a short-course schedule during induction of APL did not stop early mortality due to DIC. Moreover, survival results did not improve with this method of ATRA usage. Longer periods of ATRA administration during APL therapy are strongly recommended.","['Zubizarreta, P A', 'Rose, A B', 'Felice, M S', 'Alfaro, E', 'Delfino, S', 'Cygler, A M', 'Sackmann-Muriel, F']","['Zubizarreta PA', 'Rose AB', 'Felice MS', 'Alfaro E', 'Delfino S', 'Cygler AM', 'Sackmann-Muriel F']","['Hematology-Oncology Department, Hospital de Pediatria SAMIC Professor Dr. J.

Rapid inactivation of ERK was observed after expression of ras17N. Slow but significant inactivation of ERK was also observed during EPO-induced differentiation. Furthermore, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of ERK-activating kinase (MAPKK) was found to suppress erythroid differentiation, while pharmacological inhibition of MAPKK induced differentiation. These findings suggest that down-regulation of Ras/ERK signaling pathway may be an essential event in EPO-induced erythroid differentiation in this system.","['Matsuzaki, T', 'Aisaki, K i', 'Yamamura, Y', 'Noda, M', 'Ikawa, Y']","['Matsuzaki T', 'Aisaki Ki', 'Yamamura Y', 'Noda M', 'Ikawa Y']","['Department of Retroviral Regulation, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Medical Research Division, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Yushima, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (tetracycline resistance-encoding transposon repressor protein)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (Map3k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Globins/drug effects/genetics', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology/virology', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Repressor Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wortmannin', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Mar 16;19(12):1500-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203461.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1203461 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Tax did not directly bind to p53, this repression required the activation of CREB pathway by Tax. In contrast to a recent report by Pise-Masison et al. (1998a, b) we found that the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser 15 is not a major cause of the Tax-mediated inactivation of p53. However, Tax with a mutation in the coactivator CBP-binding site (K88A), which activates NF-kappaB but not the CREB pathway, could not repress the p53 trans-activation function. Moreover, Tax inhibited p53 binding to CBP in vitro and inhibited synergistic activation of transcription by CBP and p53. Thus, Tax is likely to compete with p53 in binding with CBP, thereby repressing its trans-activation function.","['Ariumi, Y', 'Kaida, A', 'Lin, J Y', 'Hirota, M', 'Masui, O', 'Yamaoka, S', 'Taya, Y', 'Shimotohno, K']","['Ariumi Y', 'Kaida A', 'Lin JY', 'Hirota M', 'Masui O', 'Yamaoka S', 'Taya Y', 'Shimotohno K']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Mar 16;19(12):1491-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203450.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1203450 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighteen patients (11%) developed CMV disease, 14 post BMT and four post PBSCT. Lethal CMV-related interstitial pneumonia (CMV-IP) occurred in 13 cases of whom 12 patients were bone marrow recipients (P = 0.04). The subgroup of seronegative patients with a CMV seropositive donor had a significantly lower risk of developing CMV antigenemia, GCV-resistant CMV antigenemia (P < 0.01) and CMV-related disease (P = 0.01).

The numbers of CD28- T cells and CD8+ T cells expressing CD8alpha/alpha homodimer (CD8alpha/alpha+ T cells), a thymus-independent population, increased shortly after BMT, beyond the levels of healthy children in some patients. The numbers of Vgamma9+Vdelta2+ and Valpha24+ T cells, which represent populations of extrathymic development, were less than 200/microl during the 6 months after BMT. There was a significant inverse correlation between the percentages of CD4+CD45RA+ and CD28-T cells at 1 month, and a positive correlation between the percentages of CD28- and CD8alpha/alpha+ T cells at 2 and 3 months after BMT. The mean age at BMT was higher in patients with a high level of CD8alpha/alpha+ T cells than in those without an increase in these cells, suggesting the influence of thymic function on the regenerative pathways.

In this study we demonstrate that resveratrol, a phytoalexin with anti-oxidant and chemopreventive activity, exhibits anti-leukemic activity against mouse (32Dp210, L1210) and human (U937, HL-60) leukemic cell lines by inhibiting cell proliferation. Long-term exposure to resveratrol also inhibits the clonal growth of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells but at a higher IC50 of resveratrol than that for most of the leukemia cell lines tested. The inhibitory effect of resveratrol on hematopoietic progenitors is partially reversible, whereas the effect on leukemia cells is largely irreversible. The inhibition of leukemia cells by resveratrol involves nucleosomal DNA fragmentation (apoptosis). On the other hand, resveratrol does not induce or enhance spontaneously occurring apoptotic death in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. In vivo experiments performed with untreated and resveratrol-treated bone marrow showed comparable hematopoietic reconstitution in lethally irradiated mice (10 Gy) as determined by survival, hematologic recovery, and the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells present in the marrow of reconstituted animals. Taken together, these results indicate the potential use of resveratrol for ex vivo pharmacological purging of leukemia cells from bone marrow autografts without significant loss in the hematopoietic activity of progenitor cells.","['Gautam, S C', 'Xu, Y X', 'Dumaguin, M', 'Janakiraman, N', 'Chapman, R A']","['Gautam SC', 'Xu YX', 'Dumaguin M', 'Janakiraman N', 'Chapman RA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI 48202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'U937 Cells/drug effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Mar;25(6):639-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702189.,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702189 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cross-regulation by CXCR1 and CXCR2.,9201-8,"To investigate the regulation of the CCR1 chemokine receptor, a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell line was modified to stably express epitope-tagged receptor. These cells responded to RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, and monocyte chemotactic protein-2 to mediate phospholipase C activation, intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization and exocytosis. Upon activation, CCR1 underwent phosphorylation and desensitization as measured by diminished GTPase stimulation and Ca(2+) mobilization. Alanine substitution of specific serine and threonine residues (S2 and S3) or truncation of the cytoplasmic tail (DeltaCCR1) of CCR1 abolished receptor phosphorylation and desensitization of G protein activation but did not abolish desensitization of Ca(2+) mobilization. S2, S3, and DeltaCCR1 were also resistant to internalization, mediated greater phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and sustained Ca(2+) mobilization, and were only partially desensitized by RANTES, relative to S1 and CCR1. To study CCR1 cross-regulation, RBL cells co-expressing CCR1 and receptors for interleukin-8 (CXCR1, CXCR2, or a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of CXCR2, 331T) were produced. Interleukin-8 stimulation of CXCR1 or CXCR2 cross-phosphorylated CCR1 and cross-desensitized its ability to stimulate GTPase activity and Ca(2+) mobilization. Interestingly, CCR1 cross-phosphorylated and cross-desensitized CXCR2, but not CXCR1. Ca(2+) mobilization by S3 and DeltaCCR1 were also cross-desensitized by CXCR1 and CXCR2 despite lack of receptor phosphorylation. In contrast to wild type CCR1, S3 and DeltaCCR1, which produced sustained signals, cross-phosphorylated and cross-desensitized responses to CXCR1 as well as CXCR2. Taken together, these results indicate that CCR1-mediated responses are regulated at several steps in the signaling pathway, by receptor phosphorylation at the level of receptor/G protein coupling and by an unknown mechanism at the level of phospholipase C activation. Moreover selective cross-regulation among chemokine receptors is, in part, a consequence of the strength of signaling (i.e. greater phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and sustained Ca(2+) mobilization) which is inversely correlated with the receptor's susceptibility to phosphorylation. Since many chemokines activate multiple chemokine receptors, selective cross-regulation among such receptors may play a role in their immunomodulation.","['Richardson, R M', 'Pridgen, B C', 'Haribabu, B', 'Snyderman, R']","['Richardson RM', 'Pridgen BC', 'Haribabu B', 'Snyderman R']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. richa021@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Ccr1 protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, CCR1)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8B)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phospholipase C beta', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', '*Receptor Cross-Talk', 'Receptors, CCR1', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8B', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",,2000/03/29 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/29 09:00'],"['2000/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Mar 31;275(13):9201-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.13.9201.,,"['10.1074/jbc.275.13.9201 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)30023-1 [pii]']",,"['AI-38910/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-43184/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DE-03738/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After this injury hepatocytes in noninjured middle and central zones start to proliferate first, followed by proliferation of cholangiocytes and intraportal oval cells. Proliferation of all cell types peaks at 2 days, but oval cells continue to proliferate and differentiate through days 4 and 6 as they reconstitute the necrotic zone. By day 10, the injured zone is completely repaired, and no dividing cells remain. During the first 3 to 4 days after injury, the number of proliferating hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and sinusoidal cells is lower in IL-6 knockout mice than in normal mice, whereas the number of dividing oval cells is higher. However, overall repair of the injury is accomplished in the same time period in both groups. During repair of the periportal zone, oval cells acquire differentiation markers of hepatocytes as they cross the zone of injury. In conclusion, the phenobarbital/cocaine injury model is useful to study restitutive proliferation of mouse liver cell lineages. The proliferative response in IL-6 knockout mice shows that IL-6 is not required for proliferation of liver cells; timely repair of liver injury occurs in both normal and IL-6 knockout mice. Increased proliferation of oval cells in IL-6 knockout mice may compensate for the lower proliferation of other liver cell types.","['Rosenberg, D', 'Ilic, Z', 'Yin, L', 'Sell, S']","['Rosenberg D', 'Ilic Z', 'Yin L', 'Sell S']","['Division of Experimental Pathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY 12208-3479, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'I5Y540LHVR (Cocaine)']",IM,"['Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', '*Cell Division', '*Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Cocaine/*administration & dosage', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Interleukin-6/analysis/*deficiency/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Liver Diseases/pathology', '*Lymphokines', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Necrosis', 'Portal System/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/genetics']",,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hepatology. 2000 Apr;31(4):948-55. doi: 10.1053/he.2000.5410.,,"['S0270913900838446 [pii]', '10.1053/he.2000.5410 [doi]']",,"['CA53102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71390/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that pretransplant immunization of allogeneic BMT donors with a recipient-derived tumor cell vaccine increases both GVT activity and lethal GVHD because of the priming of donor T cells against putative minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs) on the tumor vaccine cells. The work reported here tested the hypothesis that tumor cell vaccination after BMT would produce an increase in GVT activity without exacerbating GVHD. C3H.SW donor bone marrow and splenocytes were transplanted into major histocompatibility complex-matched, mHAg-mismatched C57BL/6 recipients. One month after BMT, recipients were immunized against either a C57BL/6 myeloid leukemia (C1498) or fibrosarcoma (205). Immunized recipients had a significant increase in survival and protection against tumor growth in both tumor models, and significant tumor protection was seen even in recipients with preexisting micrometastatic cancer before immunization. Alloreactivity appeared to contribute to the in vitro anti-tumor cytolytic activity, but in vivo immunity was tumor specific, and no exacerbation of GVHD was observed. Although the immunodominant mHAg B6(dom1) was shown to be expressed by all B6 tumors tested and was largely responsible for the alloreactivity resulting from tumor immunization of donors, the in vitro alloreactivity of immune recipients was more restricted and was not mediated by recognition of B6(dom1).

Using a panel of anti-ERK, JNK, and p38 phosphospecific antibodies, the study showed that phosphorylation of ERK and JNK is decreased following treatment of cells with butyrate, whereas phosphorylation of p38 is increased. In contrast, a K562 subline defective in butyrate-mediated induction of erythroid differentiation did not reveal these changes in phosphorylation patterns. Inhibition of ERK activity by UO126 induces erythroid differentiation and acts synergistically with butyrate on hemoglobin synthesis and inhibition of cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of p38 activity by SB203580 completely abolished induction of hemoglobin expression by butyrate.

As well as effluxing xenotoxins, functional P-gp can confer resistance to caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by a range of different stimuli, including Fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor, UV irradiation, and serum starvation. However, P-gp-positive cells remain sensitive to caspase-independent death induced by cytotoxic T-cell granule proteins, perforin, and granzyme B. It is, therefore, possible that agents that induce cell death in a caspase-independent manner might circumvent P-gp-mediated MDR. We demonstrated here that hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) induced equivalent caspase-independent cell death in both P-gp-positive and -negative cell lines at concentrations of 10 mmol/L and above. The HMBA-induced death pathway was marked by release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and reduction of Bcl-2 protein levels. In addition, we show that functional P-gp specifically inhibits the activation of particular caspases, such as caspases-8 and -3, whereas others, such as caspase-9, remain unaffected. These studies greatly enhance our understanding of the molecular cell death events that can be regulated by functional P-gp and highlight the potential clinical use of drugs that function via a caspase-independent pathway for the treatment of MDR tumors.","['Ruefli, A A', 'Smyth, M J', 'Johnstone, R W']","['Ruefli AA', 'Smyth MJ', 'Johnstone RW']","['Austin Research Institute, Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2000 Apr 1;95(7):2378-85.,,['S0006-4971(20)64201-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By comparing the DNA from leukemic cells to buccal mucosa cells, LOH was detected with markers D5S476 and D5S1372 with retention of flanking markers D5S500 to D5S594. The D5S500-D5S594 interval, which covers approximately 700 kb, thus represents a minimal localization for the tumor suppressor gene. Further refinement of the physical map enabled the specification of 9 transcription units within the encompassing radiation hybrid bins and 7 in flanking bins. The 9 candidates include genes CDC25, HSPA9, EGR1, CTNNA1, and 5 unknown ESTs. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirms that all of them are expressed in normal human bone marrow CD34(+) cells and in AML cell lines and thus represent likely candidates for the MDS-AML tumor suppressor gene at 5q31.","['Horrigan, S K', 'Arbieva, Z H', 'Xie, H Y', 'Kravarusic, J', 'Fulton, N C', 'Naik, H', 'Le, T T', 'Westbrook, C A']","['Horrigan SK', 'Arbieva ZH', 'Xie HY', 'Kravarusic J', 'Fulton NC', 'Naik H', 'Le TT', 'Westbrook CA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CTNNA1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (alpha Catenin)', '0 (hsp9 protein, S pombe)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha Catenin', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/genetics']",,2000/03/25 00:00,2000/04/29 00:00,['2000/03/25 00:00'],"['2000/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 00:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2000 Apr 1;95(7):2372-7.,,['S0006-4971(20)64200-8 [pii]'],,"['P01CA75606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA72593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant expression occurred in 33 (85%) patients in the following frequencies: Rb, 51%; p16(INK4A), 41%; p53, 26%. Thirteen patients (33%) had abnormalities in 2 or more genes. Outcomes were compared in patients with 0 to 1 abnormality versus patients with multiple abnormalities. The 2 groups did not differ in a large number of clinical and laboratory characteristics. The CR rates for patients with 0 to 1 and multiple abnormalities were similar (69% and 54%, respectively). Patients with 0 to 1 abnormality had a median survival time of 25 months (n = 26; 95% CI, 13-46 months) versus 8 months (n = 13; 95% CI, 4-12 months) for those with multiple abnormalities (P <.01). Stem cells (CD34+lin-) were isolated from adult ALL bone marrows and tested for p16(INK4A) expression by immunocytochemistry. In 3 of 5 patients lymphoblasts and sorted stem cells lacked p16(INK4A) expression. In 2 other patients only 50% of sorted stem cells expressed p16(INK4A). By contrast, p16 expression was present in the CD34+ lin- compartment in 95% (median) of 9 patients whose lymphoblasts expressed p16(INK4A). Therefore, cell cycle regulatory gene abnormalities are frequently present in adult ALL lymphoblasts, and they may be important determinants of disease outcome. The presence of these abnormalities in the stem compartment suggests that they contribute to leukemogenesis. Eradication of the stem cell subset harboring these abnormalities may be important to achieve cure.","['Stock, W', 'Tsai, T', 'Golden, C', 'Rankin, C', 'Sher, D', 'Slovak, M L', 'Pallavicini, M G', 'Radich, J P', 'Boldt, D H']","['Stock W', 'Tsai T', 'Golden C', 'Rankin C', 'Sher D', 'Slovak ML', 'Pallavicini MG', 'Radich JP', 'Boldt DH']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Separation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma/genetics', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2000 Apr 1;95(7):2364-71.,,['S0006-4971(20)64199-4 [pii]'],,"['CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA3333572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA6032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labelling (TUNEL) method for detecting the apoptotic cells. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to examine the expression of the B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 gene (bcl-2) and Fas. Apoptotic cells were shown in 11 of 20 cases (55%) by TUNEL. Histological sections showed that dyskeratotic cells and vacuolar alteration of the basal cells were more commonly observed in the TUNEL-positive group. In all cases of PCA, epidermal expression of bcl-2 was minimal, while expression of Fas was observed on keratinocytes in the basal to granular layers: however, these findings were not different from those in normal skin.

The diagnosis requires mature-appearing lymphocytes in the peripheral blood to >5 x 10(9)/L. The immunophenotype typically includes B cell antigens CD19, CD20 and CD23, low expression of surface immunoglobulin and CD5+, with other T cell antigens absent. Bone marrow biopsy, although not required for diagnosis, must show at least 30% lymphocytes. Cytogenetic abnormalities are frequent in patients with CLL, and may be associated with poor prognosis. Clinically, most patients are asymptomatic at presentation, with incidental lymphadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly in the routine physical examination. Infections by opportunistic pathogens are the major cause of death. Aggressive transformation occurs in 10% of patients with CLL, most commonly prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) and Richter's syndrome. PLL de novo must be differentiated from PLL of an aggressive transformation. The incidences of autoimmune diseases and solid or haemopoietic secondary malignancies are increased in patients with CLL. Clinical stage is the strongest prognostic factor in CLL. There is no indication for early intervention. The current recommendation to start treatment includes disease-related symptoms, massive and/or progressive hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, increasing bone marrow failure, autoimmune disease, and recurrent infections. Alkylating agents (e.g. chlorambucil) and nucleoside analogues (e.g. fludarabine) are the most active agents for CLL. Fludarabine induces higher response rates, but no improvement in overall survival has been observed. Fludarabine is the drug of choice for the majority of patients with CLL. Chlorambucil may be helpful for elderly patients with poor performance, and for patients who do not tolerate fludarabine. No drug combination is better than single agents. For patients refractory to initial treatment, referral to a clinical trial is the best choice. Other salvage therapy includes retreatment with the same initial agent (chlorambucil or fludarabine) if initial response was observed, or fludarabine for patients refractory to chlorambucil. Promising new approaches include cycle-active agents, nelarabine, biological therapy such as anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, bone marrow transplantation, including the use of submyeloablative preparative regimens ('minitransplant') to induce graft-versus-leukaemia effect, and gene therapy. Prophylactic antibacterials and intravenous immunoglobulin should not be used routinely during supportive care. Epoetin may be helpful for patients who have anaemia without obvious cause. Assessment of response to therapy in CLL has been updated by the National Cancer Institute Working Group, and these guidelines are used worldwide for clinical trials.","['Kalil, N', 'Cheson, B D']","['Kalil N', 'Cheson BD']","['National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/drug therapy/therapy']",236,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs Aging. 2000 Jan;16(1):9-27. doi: 10.2165/00002512-200016010-00002.,,['10.2165/00002512-200016010-00002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have tried to establish the value of the p53 protein expression in peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) cells of patients with some hematological malignancies. A recently developed fixation/permeabilization method was modified for flow cytometric assessment of p53 protein expression using two anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies. p53 quantitation expressed as molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome per cell (MESF) providing valuable data contributing to a more precise definition of leukemic cells, was also applied. Our findings showed higher percentage of p53 expression in cells of AML patients at the time of diagnosis opposite to the controls. These data, in association with immunophenotype of cells, accompanied diagnosis of relapse or definition of remission after allogeneic BM transplantation. We observed also elevated levels of p53 protein at initial diagnosis of early B-ALL. According to our results quantitation of p53 protein allows better characterization of selected population of BM cells and should be used for the monitoring of blast persistence during and after therapy and might also be one of the methods to indicate early relapse. Percentage of p53 protein positivity varied in our group of B-CLL patients tested in connection with progression of disease. We documented also one case of Burkitt's lymphoma with high percentage of p53 positivity. Measurement of p53 protein expression by flow cytometry may be of clinical importance by indicating levels of positivity.

The classification of leukemia is based on comparison of normal and pathological cells. The study of expression of CD38, CD71 and other markers on thymocytes simultaneously with DNA analysis can be useful for answer if expression of CD38 and CD71 on pathologic cells is a sign of their proliferative ability, a part of immature phenotype in some leukemia, or it is a case of aberrant immunophenotype.

In summary, a strong parallelism was observed regarding the positive relationship between the proliferative rate (assessed by the number of S-phase cells) of stimulated thymocytes and the quantitative (% and MESF) values of some markers - CD71, CD25, CD26 and HLA-DR and negative one with CD38 marker values.","['Babusikova, O', 'Ondrackova, V', 'Prachar, J', 'Kusenda, J', 'Hraska, V']","['Babusikova O', 'Ondrackova V', 'Prachar J', 'Kusenda J', 'Hraska V']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology/metabolism/physiology']",,2000/03/25 00:00,2000/03/25 00:01,['2000/03/25 00:00'],"['2000/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 1999;46(6):349-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retrospective chart review. PATIENTS: A total of 123 patients with B-cell LPD (4 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 17 with multiple myeloma, and 100 with B-cell NHL), 38 patients with non-B-cell LPD (5 with adult T-cell lymphoma, 8 with Hodgkin's disease, and 25 with non-B-cell NHL) and 516 patients with miscellaneous diseases other than liver diseases or LPD (control) were studied. RESULTS: HCV infection was detected in 17 of 100 patients with B-cell NHL versus none of 25 patients with non-B-cell NHL (p=0.023) and in 34 patients (6.6%) in the control group with miscellaneous diseases (p=0.0011). In HCV-positive B-cell NHL, primary liver involvement was detected in 3 of 17 patients compared to none of 83 HCV-negative patients (p=0.0019). Intermediate-grade lymphoma (Working Formulation) was the most frequent histology. Eleven of 15 HCV-positive patients achieved complete remission after chemotherapy, and 6 of 7 deaths were caused by liver-related diseases. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HCV infection was higher in patients with B-cell NHL than in those with non-B-cell NHL and the control group. Primary liver involvement and liver-related causes of death were frequent in HCV-positive patients with B-cell NHL.","['Mizorogi, F', 'Hiramoto, J', 'Nozato, A', 'Takekuma, Y', 'Nagayama, K', 'Tanaka, T', 'Takagi, K']","['Mizorogi F', 'Hiramoto J', 'Nozato A', 'Takekuma Y', 'Nagayama K', 'Tanaka T', 'Takagi K']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Daisan Hospital, Jikei University School of Medicine, Komae, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,"['0 (Hepatitis C Antibodies)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Hepacivirus/genetics/immunology', 'Hepatitis C/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies/analysis', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",24,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Intern Med. 2000 Feb;39(2):112-7. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.39.112.,,['10.2169/internalmedicine.39.112 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) has been implicated in cancer chemoresistance, whereas high levels of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax promote apoptosis and sensitize tumor cells to various anticancer therapies. Though the mechanisms by which Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis are diverse, ultimately they govern decision steps that determine whether certain caspase family cell death proteases remain quiescent or become active. To date, approximately 17 cellular homologs of Bcl-2 and at least 15 caspases have been identified in mammals. Other types of proteins may also modulate apoptotic responses through effects on apoptosis-regulatory proteins, such as BAG-1-a heat shock protein 70 kDa (Hsp70/Hsc70)-binding protein that can modulate stress responses and alter the functions of a variety of proteins involved in cell death and division. In this report, we summarize our attempts thus far to explore the expression of several Bcl-2 family proteins, caspase-3, and BAG-1 in primary breast cancer specimens and breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, we describe some of our preliminary observations concerning the prognostic significance of these apoptosis regulatory proteins in breast cancer patients, contrasting results derived from women with localized disease (with or without node involvement) and metastatic cancer.","['Krajewski, S', 'Krajewska, M', 'Turner, B C', 'Pratt, C', 'Howard, B', 'Zapata, J M', 'Frenkel, V', 'Robertson, S', 'Ionov, Y', 'Yamamoto, H', 'Perucho, M', 'Takayama, S', 'Reed, J C']","['Krajewski S', 'Krajewska M', 'Turner BC', 'Pratt C', 'Howard B', 'Zapata JM', 'Frenkel V', 'Robertson S', 'Ionov Y', 'Yamamoto H', 'Perucho M', 'Takayama S', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute, Program on Apoptosis and Cell Death Research, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Endocr Relat Cancer,Endocrine-related cancer,9436481,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",78,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocr Relat Cancer. 1999 Mar;6(1):29-40. doi: 10.1677/erc.0.0060029.,,['10.1677/erc.0.0060029 [doi]'],,['U10 CA2115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both thymidine and hypoxanthine are required to reverse MTA growth inhibition in leukaemia and colon cancer cells. Prevention of MTA growth inhibition by thymidine and/or hypoxanthine was investigated in two human lung (A549, COR L23) and two breast (MCF7, T47D) tumour cell lines, and the effect of the nucleoside/base transport inhibitor dipyridamole (DP) on thymidine and hypoxanthine rescue defined. MTA IC50 values (continuous exposure three population doublings) were: A549-640 nM, COR L23-28 nM, MCF7-52 nM and T47D-46 nM. Thymidine (1 microM) completely prevented growth inhibition at the MTA IC50 in all cell lines. At 10 x IC50, growth inhibition was only partially reversed by thymidine (< or = 10 microM); both thymidine and hypoxanthine (30 microM) being required for complete reversal, reflecting the multi-targeted nature of MTA. Growth inhibition by MTA was not affected by hypoxanthine alone. A non-toxic concentration (1 microM) of DP prevented thymidine/hypoxanthine rescue of MTA indicating that DP may potentiate MTA activity by preventing nucleoside and/or base salvage. Thymidine transport was inhibited by > or = 89% by 1 microM DP in all cell lines, whereas hypoxanthine transport was inhibited only in A549 and MCF7 cells. Therefore, prevention of end-product reversal of MTA-induced growth inhibition by DP can be explained by inhibition of thymidine transport alone.","['Smith, P G', 'Marshman, E', 'Newell, D R', 'Curtin, N J']","['Smith PG', 'Marshman E', 'Newell DR', 'Curtin NJ']","['Cancer Research Unit, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Medical School, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glutamates)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Dipyridamole/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glutamates/*pharmacology', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Pemetrexed', 'Thymidine/*metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/25 00:00,2000/03/25 00:01,['2000/03/25 00:00'],"['2000/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2000 Feb;82(4):924-30. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.1999.1020.,,"['S0007092099910200 [pii]', '10.1054/bjoc.1999.1020 [doi]']",,,,,,PMC2374405,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of chemo- and radiotherapy on growth and auxiological parameters in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) since 1984 to 1996. We studied growth, pubertal development and endocrine functions in 32 patients who were treated for ALL. Two of them had endocrine abnormalities. Both took a different course of disease and treatment because of local relapse in uterus (the girl) and in testis (the boy). All patients received cranial preventive radiotherapy but two of them also received: abdominal irradiation (the girl) and direct testicular irradiation (the boy) with total doses 24 Gy. The girl had clinical and biochemical symptoms of primary thyroid failure, growth hormone deficiency and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism recognized after 8 years following the completion of therapy. The boy had biochemical symptoms of hypogonadism with low serum testosterone concentration responses to stimulation with human gonadotropin after 4 years of remission. CONCLUSION: We suggest that clinical and biochemical assessment of endocrinological functions including growth, pubertal development, thyroid function should be performed at regular intervals following chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and another carcinomas.","['Balcerska, A', 'Birkholz, D']","['Balcerska A', 'Birkholz D']","['Kliniki Pediatrii, Hematologii, Onkologii i Endokrynologii Akademii Medycznej w Gdansku.']",['pol'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Wiad Lek,"Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",9705467,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endocrine Glands/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Endocrine System Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Wiad Lek. 1998;51 Suppl 4:289-95.,Odlegle skutki chemio- i radioterapii u dwojga dzieci z rozpoznaniem ostrej bialaczki limfoblastycznej.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nucleotide sequence of the human GATA-2 gene 5' flanking region was determined over 10 kbp, and a human IS exon was identified in the locus through sequence comparison analysis with that of the mouse GATA-2 IS exon. RNA blotting and reverse-transcribed PCR analyses identified a transcript that starts from the IS exon in human leukemia-derived cell lines. The IS-originated transcript was also identified in CD34-positive bone marrow and cord blood mononuclear cells, which are recognized as clinically important hematopoietic stem cell-enriched fractions. Phylogenic comparison of the human and mouse GATA-2 gene sequences revealed several regions in the locus that exhibit high sequence similarity. These results demonstrate that the GATA-2 gene regulatory machinery is conserved among vertebrates. The fact that the human IS promoter is active in the hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor fraction may be an important clue for the design of a vector system that can specifically express various genes in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors.","['Pan, X', 'Minegishi, N', 'Harigae, H', 'Yamagiwa, H', 'Minegishi, M', 'Akine, Y', 'Yamamoto, M']","['Pan X', 'Minegishi N', 'Harigae H', 'Yamagiwa H', 'Minegishi M', 'Akine Y', 'Yamamoto M']","['Institutes of Basic Medical Sciences and Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance (TARA) and Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba 305-8577, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteriophage P1/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', '*Exons', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism/physiology', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2000 Jan;127(1):105-12. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022570.,,['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022570 [doi]'],,,['J Biochem (Tokyo). 2007 May;141(5):767'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report two cases with jumping translocations. One had follicular lymphoma and jumping translocations of 1q onto the telomeric regions of 5p, 9p, and 15q in three cell lines, co-existing with the specific translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21). The second case had acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and jumping translocations of 11q as the sole aberration, onto multiple derivative chromosomes in each of the abnormal cells. A total of 17 telomeric regions were seen as the recipients of 11q in this case, and 9q was always involved as one of the recipients in all abnormal cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the identification of 11q material in the derivative chromosomes. While 1q has been the most common donor of acquired jumping translocations, this is the first report on jumping translocations of 11q. Different from all previously reported jumping translocations which involve only one recipient in each cell line and lead to a mosaic trisomy, multiple recipients in most of the abnormal cells in this case had led to a tetrasomy, or a pentasomy of 11q. The pattern of chromosome involvement as the recipients of 11q appears to show a continuing evolutionary process of jumping, stabilization, and spreading of the donor material into other chromosomes. Somatic recombinations between the interstitial telomeric or subtelomeric sequences of a derivative chromosome and the telomeric sequences of normal chromosomes are believed to be the underlying mechanism of jumping translocations and their clonal evolution.","['Fan, Y S', 'Rizkalla, K', 'William, B F', 'Engel, C J']","['Fan YS', 'Rizkalla K', 'William BF', 'Engel CJ']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Western Ontario, Faculty of Medicine, London, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aneuploidy', 'Chromosome Painting', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics', 'Male', 'Telomere/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",30,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2000 Apr 1;118(1):35-41. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00149-1.,,"['S0165-4608(99)00149-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00149-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five abnormalities were designated as clonal (monosomy 21 in three metaphases and 64 approximately 69,XXY in three metaphases from one patient at different times, and del(20)(q12q13) in three metaphases, add(13)(q34) in two metaphases, and ?del(19)(p11) in two metaphases from three different patients). Seven abnormalities were previously described: del(5)(q12), del(5)(q33), -7, del(11)(q23), +12, and +13 each in one metaphase, and del(20)(q12q13) in three metaphases). The remaining cytogenetic abnormalities were nonclonal and random. Flow cytometry and analysis of IgH and TcR gene rearrangements showed that all evaluable patients were in immunophenotypic and molecular remission, respectively. Eight patients remain in clinical and molecular remission a median of 9 months (range 7-18) after detecting the cytogenetic abnormality, and the leukemia in two patients has relapsed. During remission, cytogenetic abnormalities may not be a harbinger of leukemia relapse in pediatric ALL; therefore, a wait-and-see approach is prudent.","['Sandoval, C', 'Mayer, S P', 'Giamelli, J', 'Farley, T', 'Ozkaynak, M F', 'Tugal, O', 'Jayabose, S']","['Sandoval C', 'Mayer SP', 'Giamelli J', 'Farley T', 'Ozkaynak MF', 'Tugal O', 'Jayabose S']","['Department of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Clone Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2000 Apr 1;118(1):9-13. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00161-2.,,"['S0165-4608(99)00161-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00161-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive chromosome G-banded studies have revealed the secondary changes are nonrandom and frequently include trisomy 8, isochromosome 17q, trisomy 19, or an extra copy of the Philadelphia chromosome. In addition to these secondary chromosome changes, complex structural rearrangements often occur to form marker structures that remain unidentified by conventional G-banded analysis. The CML-derived cell line, K562, has been widely used in research since it was originally established in 1975. The K562 karyotype however, has remained incomplete, and marker structures have never been fully described. Recent advances in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technology have introduced the possibility of chromosome classification based on 24-color chromosome painting (M-FISH). In this study, we report a clarified karyotype for K562 obtained by a combination of the following molecular cytogenetic techniques: comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), FISH mapping using locus-specific probes, and M-FISH. Multicolor FISH has identified the marker structures in this cell line. The characteristic marker chromosome in K562 has been confirmed by this study to be a der(18)t(1;18). Multicolor FISH confirmed the identity of marker structures partially identified by G-banding as der(6)t(6;6),der(17)t(9;17),der(21)t(1;21),der(5)t(5;6). In addition M-FISH has revealed a deleted 20q and a complex small metacentric marker comprised of material from chromosomes 1, 6, and 20. A cryptic rearrangement was revealed between chromosomes 12 and 21 that produced a structure that looks like a normal chromosome 12 homologue by G-banding analysis. Finally, M-FISH detected regions from chromosome 13 intercalated into two acrocentric markers.","['Gribble, S M', 'Roberts, I', 'Grace, C', 'Andrews, K M', 'Green, A R', 'Nacheva, E P']","['Gribble SM', 'Roberts I', 'Grace C', 'Andrews KM', 'Green AR', 'Nacheva EP']","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Painting', 'Color', 'DNA Probes/genetics', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'K562 Cells', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Recombination, Genetic/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2000 Apr 1;118(1):1-8. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00169-7.,,"['S0165-4608(99)00169-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00169-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Assisted reproductive unit. PATIENT(S): Fourteen healthy volunteers. INTERVENTION(S): Blood sampling for LH, E(2), and progesterone (P4) determinations. Daily vaginal ultrasounds. Two endometrial biopsies per volunteer, 7 days apart, during luteal phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Endometrial dating, pinopodes formation, immunohistochemical determination of integrins (alphavbeta3, alpha4beta1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1R tI), mouse ascites Golgi (MAG), the transmembrane mucin (MUC-1), and P4 receptor expression. RESULT(S): In 26 of 28 biopsies observers agreed; in two biopsies there was a discrepancy (difference of 72 hours). With use of LH peak, 24 of 26 samples were in phase, and 2 were 3 days behind. Pinopodes appeared on days 20-21 and persisted through day 28 in small groups or larger areas. beta3 Integrin was highly expressed in luminal and glandular epithelium from day 22 through 28; 48 hours thereafter pinopodes appeared. alpha4 Subunit exhibited luminal epithelium reaction positivity on days 22-23 and glands on days 18-23. LIF and IL-1R tI showed weak, erratic expression. MAG antibodies showed luminal epithelium expression up to day 22 and glands up to day 25. MUC-1 showed positivity during the whole luteal phase. P4 receptors were positive through day 20 and at the end of the luteal phase. CONCLUSION(S): The three most cited markers that frame the window of implantation do not correlate in our material. Pinopodes are present from day 20 on; beta3 and alpha4 integrin subunits indicate a window opening on days 22-23.","['Acosta, A A', 'Elberger, L', 'Borghi, M', 'Calamera, J C', 'Chemes, H', 'Doncel, G F', 'Kliman, H', 'Lema, B', 'Lustig, L', 'Papier, S']","['Acosta AA', 'Elberger L', 'Borghi M', 'Calamera JC', 'Chemes H', 'Doncel GF', 'Kliman H', 'Lema B', 'Lustig L', 'Papier S']","['University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Mucins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1 Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Receptors, Vitronectin)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/anatomy & histology/*physiology', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Golgi Apparatus/immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Menstrual Cycle/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Mucins/metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1 Type I', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vitronectin/metabolism', 'Reference Values']",,2000/03/25 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/25 09:00'],"['2000/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2000 Apr;73(4):788-98. doi: 10.1016/s0015-0282(99)00605-6.,,"['S0015-0282(99)00605-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0015-0282(99)00605-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paraffin-embedded skin and tongue tissues were processed in a polymerase chain reaction, using primers to amplify a 306-bp region of the thymidine kinase gene of feline herpesvirus type 1, resulting in a distinct amplification product of the predicted size. The distribution of feline herpesvirus was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and nonradioactive in situ hybridization. Positive immunostaining was found in nuclei and cytoplasm of numerous epithelial cells within and next to the lesions, whereas in situ hybridization, performed with a digoxigenin-labeled double-stranded DNA probe, revealed hybridization signal only in nuclei of intact epithelial cells.

Committee of Bangkok International Hemophilia Training Center.,S49-56,"Fibrin glue (FG) is one of the blood products known to be very useful for local hemostatic measure and as a medically valuable tool for adhesion, sealing, anastomosis, repair microvascular and nerve grafts in medical and surgical procedures. Before 1996, FG was used to a limited extent in Thailand due to the high cost. Technology for locally prepared FG was transferred to Bangkok International Hemophilia Training Center of the World Federation of Hemophilia (IHTC-WFH) in July 1996 by Prof. Uri Martinowitz and the late Prof. Henri Horoszowski. Since then FG has been widely used and proved to be very useful in Thailand. This paper reports 145 cases using low cost locally prepared FG at Ramathibodi Hospital during November 1996 to December 1997. A total of 145 cases with age range from 5 months to 73 years, which included 55 pediatrics and 90 adults, 100 males and 45 females. The amount of FG used was 1-80 ml per case. Clinical procedures included dental surgery (46), open heart surgery (35), ENT (28), orthopedic (13) including 2-3 joint correction in one session in 2 hemophiliacs, neurology (11), plastic repair (7), liver (2) and severe bleeding in dengue hemorrhagic fever (3). Forty-seven cases had hemostatic disorders. The result of local hemostatic, adhesive and sealant effect of FG was satisfactory with no complications. In open heart surgery, the amount of content in chest drain decreased and none required reopen-surgery to stop bleeding. Dental surgery was performed in 43 patients with bleeding disorders i.e. hemophilia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, patients on anticoagulant, etc. Only 3 cases (7%) required blood component compared to all of the 50 no-FG controlled cases (100%) that required blood component therapy. FG has proved to be very useful in many aspects i.e. minimizing blood product usage, decreasing medical workload, reducing medical cost and increasing patients' convenience and satisfaction in particular.","['Isarangkura, P', 'Chiewsilp, P', 'Chuansumrit, A', 'Suwannuraks, M', 'Keorochana, S', 'Attanawanich, S', 'Tardtong, P', 'Martinowitz, U', 'Horoszowski, H']","['Isarangkura P', 'Chiewsilp P', 'Chuansumrit A', 'Suwannuraks M', 'Keorochana S', 'Attanawanich S', 'Tardtong P', 'Martinowitz U', 'Horoszowski H']","['Bangkok International Hemophilia Training Center, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,"['0 (Fibrin Tissue Adhesive)', '0 (Hemostatics)', '0 (Tissue Adhesives)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiac Surgical Procedures', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Dentistry, Operative', 'Female', 'Fibrin Tissue Adhesive/*therapeutic use', 'Hemostatics/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thailand', 'Tissue Adhesives/economics/*therapeutic use']",,2000/03/24 00:00,2000/03/24 00:01,['2000/03/24 00:00'],"['2000/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 1999 Nov;82 Suppl 1:S49-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The knowledge of determinants is useful for the definition of policies to tackle inequities. The aim of this paper is to analyse the social distribution of cancer incidence, fatality and mortality in the city of Turin during the 80's and to estimate the amount of inequality produced within the health system. SOURCES OF DATA: The social distribution of the risk of death in Turin during 1981-1989, estimated from the Turin Longitudinal Study, is compared with incidence and fatality during approximately the same time period. RESULTS: Among men, the relative risks for all cancer sites, among social classes, appear to confirm the hypothesis of a multiplicative model of incidence and fatality. In particular, colo-rectal, prostatic, bladder cancers and lymphoma and leukaemia show relative risks similar to the expected ones. Cancers of larynx, lung and stomach seem to be less coherent. Among women, colon-rectum, lung, breast and lymphoma and leukaemia show coherent results, whereas relative risks for uterus are far from the expected. DISCUSSION: The coherence with the expected values of the social distribution of mortality suggests the adequacy of the multiplicative model for the provision of mortality from incidence and fatality. Therefore it is possible to state that the portion of inequality in health originated within the health system is big enough to suggest the need to put the equity in the access to health services in the agenda of interventions.","['Faggiano, F', 'Zanetti, R', 'Rosso, S', 'Costa, G']","['Faggiano F', 'Zanetti R', 'Rosso S', 'Costa G']",['Dipartimento di Sanita Pubblica-Universita di Torino.'],['ita'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,2000/03/24 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/24 09:00'],"['2000/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 1999 Oct-Dec;23(4):294-9.,"Differenze sociali nell'incidenza, letalita e mortalita per tumori a Torino.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cs-A was used for treatment of a female patient with refractory B-CLL and was shown to increase dramatically the number of leukemic B cells in association with a simultaneous increase in T cells in vivo. To study this effect more precisely, CD19+ (B cells) and CD3+ (T cells) cells were isolated from the patient and cultured in the presence or absence of Cs-A. When Cs-A was added to the culture, no cell stimulation was seen. However, CD3+ cells from the patient underwent cell death, relative to those from healthy donors. On the other hand, CD19+ cells from the patient were more resistant to Cs-A than those from healthy donors. Because in vitro experiments cannot explain this phenomenon of Cs-A increasing leukemic cells (not only B-CLL cells but also T cells), care should be exercised in the clinical use of Cs-A in B-CLL patients.","['Nishii, K', 'Katayama, N', 'Mitani, H', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Miwa, H', 'Kita, K', 'Shiku, H']","['Nishii K', 'Katayama N', 'Mitani H', 'Matsumoto T', 'Miwa H', 'Kita K', 'Shiku H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan. kaz@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Japan/ethnology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology']",,2000/03/24 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/24 09:00'],"['2000/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2000 Jan;71(1):59-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All constitutively active STAT5 showed constitutive phosphorylation on their tyrosine residues and induced factor-independent growth in a mouse interleukin-3-dependent cell line, Ba/F3. Sequence analysis of these active STAT5 revealed two important mutations: S710F and N642H. The N642H mutation localized in the SH2 domain was able to induce autonomous growth of Ba/F3 cells by itself, whereas S710F in the effector domain was able to induce autonomous growth of Ba/F3 cells in concert with a second mutation including H298R and E150G. Recently, constitutive activation of STAT5 has been reported in patients' leukemic cells and is implicated in leukemogenesis. We attempted to clarify whether leukemic cells harbored activating mutations primarily in STAT5 proteins, and analyzed the sequence of STAT5 derived from 49 leukemic patients. No mutations were found, however, in the regions surrounding S710 and N642 of STAT5A and corresponding residues of STAT5B. We also cloned full-length cDNAs for STAT5s from three patients whose leukemic cells exhibited constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the STAT5 protein and expressed the derived STAT5 proteins in Ba/F3 cells. However, none of these clones exhibited constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation or gave rise to FI proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. These results indicate that constitutive activation of STAT5 is a secondary event in most leukemias.","['Yamada, K', 'Ariyoshi, K', 'Onishi, M', 'Miyajima, A', 'Hayakawa, F', 'Towatari, M', 'Saito, H', 'Oka, Y', 'Asano, S', 'Nosaka, T', 'Kitamura, T']","['Yamada K', 'Ariyoshi K', 'Onishi M', 'Miyajima A', 'Hayakawa F', 'Towatari M', 'Saito H', 'Oka Y', 'Asano S', 'Nosaka T', 'Kitamura T']","['Department of Hematopoietic Factors, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat5b protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/etiology/genetics', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mutation', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/03/24 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/24 09:00'],"['2000/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2000 Jan;71(1):46-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty patients were followed up to 3 years; four were lost to follow-up. Mean age was 43; mean prebariatric surgery weight 134 kg; height 1.65 meters; body mass index 40.1; ideal body weight 62.7 kg; excess weight 70.5 kg; per cent excess weight 214%. A 250 cm stomach-to-ileocecal valve segment of small bowel was used, and the biliopancreatic secretions were brought into the terminal ileum 100 6 in from the ileocecal valve. Mean pouch size was 63 cc; length of hospital stay 5 days; operative blood loss 616 cc; operative time 130 min. RESULTS: Intraoperative complications included three splenic injuries (without splenectomy). Early complications included one deep vein thrombosis, two marginal ulcers, one GI hemorrhage, one wound dehiscence, one pouch outlet obstruction and one pancreatitis. Late complications included: one death from protein malnutrition/ ARDS; 21 hypoproteinemia; six protein malnutrition, and of these, three had hyperalimentation; three cholecystitis; 27 anemia; 22 incisional hernia; two staple-line disruption (reoperated); 26 low serum iron; 11 prolonged (>6 months) diarrhea; three prolonged frequent vomiting; and two unrelated deaths (chronic myelogenous leukemia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Mean excess weight loss was 83% at 12 months; 89% at 24 months; and 94% at 36 months. CONCLUSION: The distal gastric bypass is fraught with the operative and immediate post-operative complications experienced in any revisionary bariatric surgery. Distal gastric bypass is very effective in producing long-term weight loss. Nutritional problems are common but usually easily corrected. The most serious nutritional complication is protein malnutrition, which must be identified and corrected early. Success of this procedure is dependent upon patient compliance with proper nutrition and supplements, and regular office follow-up with monitoring of laboratory data. Patients who are noncompliant are at significant risk for complications.","['Fox', 'Fox', 'Oh']","['Fox SR', 'Fox KS', 'Oh KH']","['Tacoma, WA, 98408, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Obes Surg,Obesity surgery,9106714,,,,,1996/04/01 00:00,2000/03/24 00:00,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/24 00:00 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Obes Surg. 1996 Apr;6(2):145-150. doi: 10.1381/096089296765557097.,,['10.1381/096089296765557097 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF was absent during the early and late follicular phases. LIF was observed mainly in the cytoplasm of the endometrial glands during the early luteal phase, reached maximum intensity during the mid-luteal phase and declined again during late luteal phase. In-situ hybridization also showed a similar cyclic pattern in the expression of LIF. Stromal cells only showed signals for LIF during the mid-luteal phase. In ovariectomized marmosets, graded dosages of oestradiol alone failed to induce the appearance of LIF protein. Progesterone treatment following oestradiol priming, however, induced distinct glandular localization of LIF, indicating that LIF is a progesterone-dependent protein. Thus endometrial LIF is under maternal control and is secreted in response to the increased progesterone concentrations in circulation. It is possible that high concentrations of LIF during mid-luteal phase may prepare the endometrium for blastocyst implantation in marmosets.","['Kholkute, S D', 'Katkam, R R', 'Nandedkar, T D', 'Puri, C P']","['Kholkute SD', 'Katkam RR', 'Nandedkar TD', 'Puri CP']","['Primate Biology Division, Institute for Research in Reproduction (ICMR), Jehangir Merwanji Street, Parel, Mumbai 400 012, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Callithrix/metabolism', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Estradiol/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hormones/metabolism', 'Immunoblotting/methods', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ovary/drug effects/physiology', 'Progesterone/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger']",,2000/03/24 09:00,2000/08/01 11:00,['2000/03/24 09:00'],"['2000/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/01 11:00 [medline]', '2000/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2000 Apr;6(4):337-43. doi: 10.1093/molehr/6.4.337.,,['10.1093/molehr/6.4.337 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, the highly homologous determinant RSPWFTTL, expressed by tumor cells induced by Friend/Moloney/Rauscher (FMR) MuLV, is not immunogenic, even when presented to the immune system as vaccinia virus-encoded cytosolic or endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted minigene products. Such minigene products are usually highly immunogenic since they bypass the need for cells to liberate the peptide or transport the peptide into the ER by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Using KSPWFTTL-specific CTLs that cross-react with RSPWFTTL, we previously demonstrated that presentation of RSPWFTTL from its natural viral gene product is TAP dependent. Here, we show first that C57BL/6 mice express mRNA encoding RSPWFTTL but not KSPWFTTL and second that the ER-targeted RSPWFTTL minigene product is highly immunogenic in C57BL/6 mice with a targeted deletion in TAP1. These findings provide the initial demonstration of TAP-dependent tolerance induction to a specific self peptide and demonstrate that this contributes to the differential recognition of RSPWFTTL and KSPWFTTL by C57BL/6 mice.","['Kim, V', 'Yewdell, J W', 'Green, W R']","['Kim V', 'Yewdell JW', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School and The Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Animals', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/chemistry/*immunology', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunization', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/chemistry/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/virology', 'Self Tolerance', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/administration & dosage/chemistry/immunology']",,2000/03/23 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/23 09:00'],"['2000/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Apr;74(8):3924-8. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.8.3924-3928.2000.,,['10.1128/jvi.74.8.3924-3928.2000 [doi]'],,"['CA-69525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-07363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC111904,,,,,,,,,,,

This is in contrast to a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retrovirus vector (SRalphaLEGFP). We therefore replaced the internal CMV promoter of CSCG with three different murine oncoretroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoters-murine sarcoma virus (MSV), MoMLV (MLV), and the LTR (termed Rh-MLV) that is derived from the ampho-mink cell focus-forming (AMP/MCF) retrovirus in the serum of one rhesus macaque monkey that developed T-cell lymphoma following autologous transplantation of enriched bone marrow stem cells transduced with a retrovirus vector preparation containing replication-competent viruses (E.

Interestingly, there was a further two- to threefold increase in EGFP expression (thus, 10-fold-higher expression than with CMV) when the Rh-MLV promoter and Deltagag(871-1612) were used in a self-inactivating-vector setting that has a further deletion in the U3 region of the HIV-1 LTR.

However, the mechanisms of lovastatin-induced apoptosis are still unclear. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the signal transduction pathway for lovastatin-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The features of this apoptosis were attenuated by the presence of mevalonate, a metabolic intermediate of cholesterol synthesis. Treatment of lovastatin caused a rapid release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytosol and subsequent induction of caspase-3, but not caspase-1 activity. Lovastatin also stimulated proteolytic cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and followed by the appearance of caspase activity and DNA fragmentation.

Given the relevance of apoptosis to the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's disease (HD), it was decided to examine the expression of p27KIP1 in relation to apoptosis in these lesions. Paraffin-wax sections from a total of 65 histologically confirmed HD tumours were used to derive apoptotic index (AI) and DNA fragmentation index (DFI) scores, which were compared with the expression of various cell-cycle-regulating proteins, including p27KIP1 (p27), p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21) and cyclin D1, and with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status. The DFI was measured by TdT-mediated dUTP-FITC nick end-labelling (TUNEL), and the AI by conventional morphology. Cells showing the typical morphology of apoptosis, together with those resembling so-called 'mummified' Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, were included in AI measurements. Increasing numbers of p27-positive HRS cells were associated with lower levels of apoptosis in these cells, as indicated by significantly lower AI and DFI scores. There was a trend towards poorer survival in those patients with the highest numbers of p27-positive HRS cells and with lower AI and DFI scores, but these differences were not statistically significant. p21-positive HRS cells were significantly more frequent in those cases with lower AI scores. A similar trend was observed for p21 and DFI, although this relationship was not statistically significant. There was also a trend towards higher levels of cyclin D1 protein in HD cases with high AI and DFI values. A tendency for increasing numbers of p27-positive and p21-positive HRS cells in EBV-positive cases was noted, but this relationship was not statistically significant. EBV status did not correlate with either AI or DFI scores. The results of this study suggest that p27, and possibly also p21, may be involved in protection from apoptosis in HD.","['Kolar, Z', 'Flavell, J R', 'Ehrmann, J Jr', 'Rihakova, P', 'Macak, J', 'Lowe, D', 'Crocker, J', 'Vojtesek, B', 'Young, L S', 'Murray, P G']","['Kolar Z', 'Flavell JR', 'Ehrmann J Jr', 'Rihakova P', 'Macak J', 'Lowe D', 'Crocker J', 'Vojtesek B', 'Young LS', 'Murray PG']","['Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, and Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Centre of Molecular Biology and Medicine (CMBM), Palacky University, Olomouc, CZ-77515, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/03/23 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/03/23 09:00'],"['2000/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pathol. 2000 Apr;190(5):604-12. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(200004)190:5<604::AID-PATH561>3.0.CO;2-P.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(200004)190:5<604::AID-PATH561>3.0.CO;2-P [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(200004)190:5<604::AID-PATH561>3.0.CO;2-P [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular free calcium concentration is not affected by the treatment with a high dose of CPT. In contrast, fluorescence measurements of cells loaded with the pH indicator BCECF-AM indicate that the intracellular pH decreases significantly. Incubation of the leukemia cells with a high drug concentration for 5 h or with lower drug concentrations for 15 h results in a pronounced intracellular acidification. Measurements with the whole cell population show a decrease of 0.3-0.4 pH units. The extent of the acidic shift is proportional to the drug concentration and the period of incubation. No such effects were observed with P388CPT5 cells resistant to CPT. The results support the hypothesis that apoptosis induced in leukemia cells by CPT is associated with decreased intracellular pH. Modification of intracellular pH by topoisomerase inhibitors is viewed as an essential event responsible for the induction and/or propagation of apoptosis.

Encouraging results have also been obtained using RIT to treat some solid tumors, primarily in patients with relatively low tumor burdens. RIT is generally well tolerated, with the primary toxicity being transient reversible myelosuppression in most nonmyeloablative studies.

Inhibition of the Bcr-Abl kinase activity in Bcr-Abl-expressing cell lines and CD34(+) cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients induces apoptosis by suppressing the capacity of Stat5 to interact with the bcl-x promoter.

This data is consistent with the closer relationship between the feline and human genomes and provides another experimental system in which to analyse Bmi-1 function.","['Kinnon, S', 'Fulton, R']","['Kinnon S', 'Fulton R']","['School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, Scotland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,DNA Seq,DNA sequence : the journal of DNA sequencing and mapping,9107800,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,DNA Seq. 1999;10(4-5):335-8. doi: 10.3109/10425179909033960.,,['10.3109/10425179909033960 [doi]'],,,,,['GENBANK/AJ132013'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which this mode of cell death (seen both in animal and plant cells), takes place have been examined in detail. Extracellular signals and intracellular events have been elaborated. Of interest to the clinician, is the concentrated effort to study pharmacological modulation of programmed cell death. The attempt to influence the natural phenomenon of programmed cell death stems from the fact that it is reduced (like in cancer) or increased (like in neurodegenerative diseases) in several clinical situations. Thus, chemicals that can modify programmed cell death are likely to be potentially useful drugs. From foxglove, which gave digitalis to the Pacific Yew from which came taxol, plants have been a source of research material for useful drugs. Recently, a variety of plant extracts have been investigated for their ability to influence the apoptotic process. This article discusses some of the interesting data. The ability of plants to influence programmed cell death in cancerous cells in an attempt to arrest their proliferation has been the topic of much research. Various cell-lines like HL60, human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (KIM-1), a cholangiocarcinoma cell-line (KMC-1), B-cell hybridomas, U937 a monocytic cell-line, HeLa cells, human lymphoid leukemia (MOLT-4B) cells and K562 cells have been studied. The agents found to induce programmed cell death (measured either morphologically or flow cytometrically) included extracts of plants like mistletoe and Semicarpus anacardium. Isolated compounds like bryonolic acid (from Trichosanthes kirilowii var. Japonica, crocin (from saffron) and allicin (from Allium sativum) have also been found to induce programmed cell death and therefore arrest proliferation. Even Chinese herbal medicine ""Sho-saiko-to"" induces programmed cell death in selected cancerous cell lines. Of considerable interest is the finding that Panax ginseng prevents irradiation-induced programmed cell death in hair follicles, suggesting important therapeutic implications. Nutraceuticals (dietary plants) like soya bean, garlic, ginger, green tea, etc. which have been suggested, in epidemiological studies, to reduce the incidence of cancer may do so by inducing programmed cell death. Soy bean extracts have been shown to prevent development of diseases like polycystic kidneys, while Artemisia asiatica attenuates cerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats. Interestingly enough, a number of food items as well as herbal medicines have been reported to produce toxic effects by inducing programmed cell death. For example, programmed cell death in isolated rat hepatocytes has been implicated in the hepatitis induced by a herbal medicine containing diterpinoids from germander. Other studies suggest that rapid progression of the betel- and tobacco-related oral squamous cell carcinomas may be associated with a simultaneous involvement of p53 and c-myc leading to inhibition of programmed cell death. Several mechanisms have been identified to underlie the modulation of programmed cell death by plants including endonuclease activation, induction of p53, activation of caspase 3 protease via a Bcl-2-insensitive pathway, potentiate free-radical formation and accumulation of sphinganine. Programmed cell death is a highly conserved mechanism of self-defense, also found to occur in plants. Hence, it is natural to assume that chemicals must exist in them to regulate programmed cell death in them. Thus, plants are likely to prove to be important sources of agents that will modulate programmed cell death.","['Thatte, U', 'Bagadey, S', 'Dahanukar, S']","['Thatte U', 'Bagadey S', 'Dahanukar S']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seth GS Medical College, Parel, Mumbai, India. kemarc@vsnl.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,['0 (Plant Extracts)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Plants, Medicinal/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",85,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2000 Feb;46(1):199-214.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the real risk for thrombosis in these patients has not been clearly established. DESIGN: Prospective analysis of consecutive patients younger than 40 at the time of the diagnosis of ET and followed in our department between 1980 and 1998. SUBJECTS: Sixty-eight patients (28 males and 40 females, median follow-up 99.14 months) affected by ET diagnosed in agreement with the Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Asymptomatic ET patients were not treated. In contrast, patients with associated atherosclerotic risk factors, microvascular disturbances, or a previous major arterial thrombosis were given acetyl salicylic acid (ASA 100 mg/day). Only patients with major thrombotic complications and a platelet count > 1,000 x 10(9)/L received cytoreductive therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) to evaluate thrombotic complications in young patients with ET, (2) to relate thrombotic risk to the presence of general atherosclerotic risk factors, and (3) to adopt treatment, and (4) to report the outcome of the pregnancies monitored in our population. RESULTS: Fifteen patients had major thrombosis, 11 of which were the presenting features of ET. No rethrombosis has been observed. Only one patient with thrombotic complications was under efficient treatment. Atherosclerotic risk factors are more common in patients with major arterial thrombosis than in asymptomatic subjects. Thirteen normal babies were delivered out of 16 pregnancies, 6 of the pregnant women were on ASA therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Most thrombosis in young ET patients occurred at the time of the diagnosis, and venous thrombotic events represent one-third of total thrombosis. Cardiovascular risk factors seem to be concurrent stimuli for arterial thrombosis in ET. The thrombotic complication rate was 2.6/100 patients/year ASA reduces microvascular disturbances, thrombosis, and rethrombosis and possibly reduces obstetric complications in women with ET.","['Randi, M L', 'Rossi, C', 'Fabris, F', 'Girolami, A']","['Randi ML', 'Rossi C', 'Fabris F', 'Girolami A']","['Department of Medical and Surgical Science, University Medical School of Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,9508125,"['5Q7ZVV76EI (Warfarin)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Aspirin/administration & dosage', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Heparin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/drug therapy/etiology', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenectomy', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*complications/*therapy', 'Venous Thrombosis/drug therapy/etiology/surgery', 'Warfarin/therapeutic use']",,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 2000 Jan;6(1):31-5. doi: 10.1177/107602960000600105.,,['10.1177/107602960000600105 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AvWD in patients with a monoclonal gammapathy and/or a lymphoproliferative disorder is featured by a prolonged bleeding time, normal platelet count, and a decreased or absent ristocetine-induced platelet aggregation in combination with a prolonged aPTT and normal PT due to low levels of factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (vWF) parameters in the absence of a factor VIII inhibitor in the Bethesda assay. In vitro and vivo experiments consistently showed that the anti-vWF autoantibodies in monoclonal gammapathies cause a rapid clearance of the factor VIII/vWF complex from the circulation after DDAVP and factor VIII/vWF concentrate infusion. Multimeric analysis of the vWF usually show a type II-like AvWD due to the absence of large vWF multimers as the consequence of the rapid clearance of the anti-vWF-factor VIII/vWF complex from the circulation. There is a poor response to intravenous DDAVP and factor VIII/vWF concentrate infusion, but high dose intravenous gamma globulin (1 g/kg for 2 days) usually induces a transient correction of the factor VIII/vWF parameters for 1 to a few weeks.","['Michiels, J J', 'van Vliet, H H']","['Michiels JJ', 'van Vliet HH']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,9508125,['0 (gamma-Globulins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bleeding Time', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Paraproteinemias/*complications', 'Platelet Count', 'gamma-Globulins/*administration & dosage', 'von Willebrand Diseases/blood/*etiology/*prevention & control']",,2000/03/22 00:00,2000/03/22 00:01,['2000/03/22 00:00'],"['2000/03/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/22 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 1999 Jul;5(3):152-7. doi: 10.1177/107602969900500302.,,['10.1177/107602969900500302 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because about one-half of ET patients remain asymptomatic long term, the decision to use aspirin acetylsalicylic acid, (ASA) or myelotoxic drugs has not yet been clearly established. While vasomotor symptoms are improved by small doses of ASA, higher doses (900 mg/day) induce an unacceptable rate of serious hemorrhagic complications in patients with polycythemia vera. This retrospective study evaluates the utility of therapy in preventing thrombosis in ET and the efficacy and a safety of 100 mg/day of ASA in these patients. One hundred ninety-five consecutive patients with ET diagnosed in agreement with the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) criteria are evaluated. All vascular complication before, at, or after diagnosis were recorded and related to the treatment used: no therapy, ASA alone, myelosuppressive agents or both. All treated patients had a significant reduction of thrombotic complications without increased hemorrhagic complications, in spite of therapy adopted. In addition, a significant reduction of rethrombosis was obtained in 60 patients with a previous thrombosis. A low rate of thrombosis (5.1%) was observed during the follow-up of the 135 patients previously asymptomatic for major complications. No difference appears to exist between the use of ASA and cytotoxic drugs in preventing thrombosis and rethrombosis in ET patients. However, the possible increase of cancer and leukemia with myelosuppressive drugs is minimized in patients treated with ASA. A low dose of ASA would seem to be a safe and effective agent in ET.","['Randi, M L', 'Rossi, C', 'Fabris, F', 'Menapace, L', 'Girolami, A']","['Randi ML', 'Rossi C', 'Fabris F', 'Menapace L', 'Girolami A']","['II Chair of Internal Medicine, University of Padua Medical School, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,9508125,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aspirin/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Thrombosis/blood/drug therapy/*prevention & control']",,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 1999 Apr;5(2):131-5. doi: 10.1177/107602969900500210.,,['10.1177/107602969900500210 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, 32 hematopoietic cell lines were analysed for the expression of HLA-DR, CIITA, RFX5 or HLA-ABC. Fourteen cell lines were positive and 18 were negative for HLA-DR. All the 14 HLA-DR positive cell lines were demonstrated to express CIITA mRNA by RT-PCR. On the other hand, in all the 18 HLA-DR negative cell lines, the expression of CIITA was not demonstrated. RFX5, which is one of the transcription factors of MHC-II, was expressed ubiquitously in all 32 cell lines. Three cell lines out of 23 hematopoietic cell lines examined were negative for HLA-ABC, and all three of these cell lines were negative for both HLA-DR and CIITA expression. Furthermore, CIITA cDNA was transfected into K562 cells, which were negative for HLA-ABC, -DR and -DQ, but positive for HLA-DP. The transfection rendered HLA-DR negative to positive and increased the expression level of HLA-DP, but HLA-DQ remained negative. In addition to HLA-DR, HLA-ABC was also induced to express by the transfection of CIITA gene. The present study demonstrated that the expression of HLA-DR in hematopoietic cells is regulated in subordination to CIITA and the expression of HLA-DR (and HLA-ABC in K562) is induced by transfection with the CIITA gene. These findings revealed the applicability of CIITA in potentiating anti-tumour immunity of HLA-DR negative tumour cells for immunotherapy of hematological malignancies.","['Liu, A', 'Takahashi, M', 'Toba, K', 'Zheng, Z', 'Hashimoto, S', 'Nikkuni, K', 'Furukawa, T', 'Koike, T', 'Aizawa, Y']","['Liu A', 'Takahashi M', 'Toba K', 'Zheng Z', 'Hashimoto S', 'Nikkuni K', 'Furukawa T', 'Koike T', 'Aizawa Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Niigata University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (MHC class II transactivator protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RFX5 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'HLA Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics/pathology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1999 Dec;17(4):149-60. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1099-1069(199912)17:4<149::aid-hon645>3.0.co;2-f.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1099-1069(199912)17:4<149::AID-HON645>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1099-1069(199912)17:4<149::aid-hon645>3.0.co;2-f [doi]']","['Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies suggested that IGF-I plays a role in drug resistance during anticancer therapy. This resistance to diverse cytotoxic drugs, named multidrug-resistance (MDR), is mainly due to high levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The gene encoding this membrane-associated transporter protein was named MDR1, and increased levels of P-gp are linked to enhanced MDR1 mRNA expression. Our aim was to investigate a possible effect of rhIGF-I on MDR1 gene expression in vitro. We cultured the T-lymphoblastoid cell line CCRF-CEM with different rhIGF-I concentrations (0, 5, 20 and 50 ng/ml) in serum-free medium for 3 days. CCRF-CEM cells are drug-sensitive and express MDR1 at low levels. MDR1 mRNA expression was measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR using a competitive assay with a heterologous DNA construct. In addition, GAPDH mRNA was amplified as an internal control for RNA integrity. P-gp activity was determined by a flow cytometric assay measuring rhodamine 123 accumulation. Furthermore, cell proliferation was monitored in all experiments. Our data do not support an effect of rhIGF-I on MDR1 mRNA expression, P-gp activity or cell proliferation in the CCRF-CEM cell line. MDR1 mRNA levels were inversely correlated to cell density with high significance (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, multidrug resistance linked to P-gp is not induced by IGF-I in CCRF-CEM cells. At high density, CCRF-CEM cells downregulate MDR1 gene expression. Our experimental model provides a very useful tool for monitoring the influence of growth factors on multidrug resistance in vitro.","['Schwarze, C P', 'Neu, S', 'Beck, J', 'Mavridou, K', 'Ranke, M B', 'Binder, G']","['Schwarze CP', 'Neu S', 'Beck J', 'Mavridou K', 'Ranke MB', 'Binder G']","[""University Children's Hospital Tubingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Horm Res,Hormone research,0366126,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', '*Cell Count', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Horm Res. 1999;52(4):192-9. doi: 10.1159/000023460.,,"['23460 [pii]', '10.1159/000023460 [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 S.

Although B cells can respond to GM-CSF, there is controversy concerning the extent to which various resting and activated B cell types can themselves produce this cytokine, and the possibility that it can function in an autocrine fashion has not previously been considered. The aim of the present study was to address these issues using hairy cells (HCs) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, two intrinsically activated mature malignant B cell types (with activation being more uniform and more pronounced in HCs). Normal B cells were used for comparison. Using a number of techniques, we demonstrated the constitutive production of GM-CSF by all three cell types and showed that the cytokine was biologically active. GM-CSF mRNA and protein were increased after cell activation by PMA, and constitutive production of the cytokine was highest in HCs, suggesting that the level of GM-CSF production is influenced by cell activation. Because GM-CSF is known to be antiapoptotic for myeloid cells, we used blocking anti-GM-CSF Abs to examine the contribution of autocrinely produced cytokine to cell survival. The Abs produced marked reduction in the in vitro survival of HCs, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, and normal B cells by promoting apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that, in combination with other known rescue factors, autocrinely produced GM-CSF may contribute to normal and malignant B cell survival in vivo.","['Harris, R J', 'Pettitt, A R', 'Schmutz, C', 'Sherrington, P D', 'Zuzel, M', 'Cawley, J C', 'Griffiths, S D']","['Harris RJ', 'Pettitt AR', 'Schmutz C', 'Sherrington PD', 'Zuzel M', 'Cawley JC', 'Griffiths SD']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom. harris@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Autocrine Communication/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell-Free System/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Apr 1;164(7):3887-93. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.164.7.3887.,,"['ji_v164n7p3887 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.164.7.3887 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the number of Ag-specific T cells in any single lesion of autoimmunity may be quite low. Successful gene transfer into autoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells would serve as an ideal vehicle for site-targeted gene therapy if it were possible to transduce preferentially the small number of autoantigen-specific T cells. In this study we have demonstrated that retroviral infection of CD4+ lymphocytes from either autoantigen-stimulated TCR transgenic mice, or Ag-activated immunized nontransgenic mice, with a retroviral vector (pGCIRES), resulted in the transduction of only the limited number of Ag-reactive CD4+ T cells. In contrast, polyclonal activation of the same cultures resulted in transduction of non-antigen-specific lymphocytes. Transduction of Ag-reactive CD4+ T cells with pGCIRES retrovirus encoding the regulatory genes IL-4 (IL4) and soluble TNF receptor (STNFR) resulted in stable integration and long-term expression of recombinant gene products. Moreover, expression of the pGCIRES marker protein, GFP, directly correlated with the expression of the upstream regulatory gene. Retroviral transduction of CD4+ T cells targeted specifically Ag-reactive cells and was cell cycle-dependent and evident only during the mitosis phase. These studies suggest that retroviral transduction of autoantigen-specific murine CD4+ T cells, using the pGCIRES retroviral vector, may provide a potential method to target and isolate the low frequency of autoantigen-specific murine CD4+ T cells, and provides a rational approach to gene therapy in animal models of autoimmunity.","['Costa, G L', 'Benson, J M', 'Seroogy, C M', 'Achacoso, P', 'Fathman, C G', 'Nolan, G P']","['Costa GL', 'Benson JM', 'Seroogy CM', 'Achacoso P', 'Fathman CG', 'Nolan GP']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA 94305, USA. ginac@leland.stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", ""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/immunology"", '3T3 Cells', ""5' Untranslated Regions/immunology"", 'Animals', 'Autoantigens/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes, Reporter/immunology', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/chemical synthesis', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitosis/genetics/immunology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic/*immunology']",,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Apr 1;164(7):3581-90. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.164.7.3581.,,"['ji_v164n7p3581 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.164.7.3581 [doi]']",,"['5T32-AI-07290/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 36535/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 39646/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although cytokines are integral to the development of naive CTL into cytolytic effectors, the role of cytokines on mechanisms of CTL killing is just emerging. In this study, we evaluate the effects of IL-4 in Fas(CD95)/FasL(CD95L)-mediated killing of Fas-overexpressing target cells. Recombinant vaccinia viruses (vv) were constructed to express respiratory syncytial virus M2 Ag alone (vvM2) or coexpress M2 and IL-4 (vvM2/IL-4). MHC-matched Fas-overexpressing target cells (L1210Fas+) were used to measure both perforin- and FasL-mediated killing pathways. In contrast to Fas-deficient (L1210Fas-) target cells, effectors from vvM2/IL-4-immunized mice were able to lyse L1210Fas+ target cells with similar magnitude as vvM2-infected mice. Addition of EGTA/Mg2+ revealed that effectors from vvM2/IL-4-infected mice primarily lyse targets by a Ca2+-independent Fas/FasL pathway. Analysis of FasL expression by flow cytometry showed that IL-4 increased cell surface FasL expression on CD4+ and CD8+ splenocytes, with peak expression on day 4 after infection. These data demonstrate that IL-4 increases FasL expression on T cells, resulting in a shift of the mechanism of CTL killing from a dominant perforin-mediated cytolytic pathway to a dominant FasL-mediated cytolytic pathway.","['Aung, S', 'Graham, B S']","['Aung S', 'Graham BS']","['Department of Microbiology, Vanderbilt University, School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (HN Protein)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (attachment protein G)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics/*immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', '*HN Protein', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Interleukin-4/*administration & dosage/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/immunology', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/immunology', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Apr 1;164(7):3487-93. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.164.7.3487.,,"['ji_v164n7p3487 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.164.7.3487 [doi]']",,['R01-AI-33933/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1968 to 1994, 55 children received megavoltage RT at our institution as part of treatment for Wilms' tumor. A total of 42 (76.4%) have survived and have a minimum follow-up of 5 years. There were 25 female and 17 male patients with a median age at diagnosis of 48 months (range, 7-126 months). There were 12 Stage I, eight Stage II, 15 Stage III, six Stage IV, and one Stage V patient. RT was delivered to the hemiabdomen in 36 and whole abdomen in six patients. RT dose was 1000-1200 cGy (Group A) in 12, 1201-2399 cGy (Group B) in 11, and 2400-4000 cGy (Group C) in 19. Whole-lung RT was delivered to 13 patients either at diagnosis or pulmonary relapse. All patients received chemotherapy; the most common agents were actinomycin-D/vincristine/adriamycin in 13 and actinomycin-D/vincristine in 18. Median follow-up was 181 months (range, 60-306 months). RESULTS: Of 42 patients, 13 (31.0%) did not have late effects of treatment. The number of patients who developed muscular hypoplasia, limb length inequality, kyphosis, and iliac wing hypoplasia were seven (16.7%), five (11.9%), three (7.1%), and three (7.1%), respectively. Scoliosis was seen in 18 (42.9%) with only one patient requiring orthopedic intervention. Median time to development of scoliosis was 102 months, with a range of 16-146 months. The actuarial incidence of scoliosis at 5, 10, and 15 years after RT was 4.8 +/- 3.3%, 51.8 +/- 9.0%, and 56.7 +/- 9.3%, respectively. Only one of 12 Group A patients developed scoliosis. The 10- and 15-year actuarial incidences of scoliosis for Group A and B patients were 37.7 +/- 12.4% and 37.7 +/- 12.4%, whereas for Group C patients the incidences were 65.8 +/- 12.0% and 74.4 +/- 11. 7% (p = 0.03, log rank test). The actuarial incidence of bowel obstruction at 5, 10, and 15 years was 9.5 +/- 4.5%, 13.0 +/- 5.6%, and 17.0 +/- 6.5%. Of 23 patients, five irradiated within 10 days of surgery and one of 19 irradiated after 10 days developed bowel obstruction (p = 0.09, log rank test). Three patients developed hypertension with normal blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels; another patient had chronic renal insufficiency in a nonirradiated kidney. One patient developed diffuse interstitial pneumonitis. Of the 19 female patients who have reached puberty, three have given birth, and 15 have regular and one has irregular menstrual periods. Four patients developed benign neoplasms; three were in the RT field (two osteochondroma, one lipoma) and one outside (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II). There were three second malignancies (chronic myelogenous leukemia at 9 years, osteosarcoma at 11 years, and breast cancer at 25 years after initial diagnosis of nephroblastoma); both solid malignancies occurred in the RT field. CONCLUSIONS: Late effects of therapy were seen in more than two thirds of children treated for Wilms' tumor.

An expression plasmid was made in which a single chain Fv antibody specific for EGFRvIII was inserted at a novel position within a disulphide-bonded surface loop near the native receptor binding site of the Moloney leukemia virus ecotropic envelope glycoprotein. This fusion protein was expressed and incorporated into retroviral particles as efficiently as normal envelope glycoprotein. Retroviral vectors made with the fusion protein were able to bind peptide antigen and EGFRvIII expressed on the surface of human glioblastoma cells. The retroviral vectors had normal levels of infectivity on mouse cells, showing that the envelope glycoprotein tolerated a large insertion at this site, but did not show significant infectivity to human cells expressing EGFRvIII. Thus we were able to redirect retrovirus binding to this tumour-specific target without perturbing the normal function of the ecotropic envelope glycoprotein, but this was not sufficient to mediate infectivity via this receptor.","['Lorimer, I A', 'Lavictoire, S J']","['Lorimer IA', 'Lavictoire SJ']","['Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, Cancer Research Group, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, K1H 8L6. ilorimer@cancercare.on.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/chemistry/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics']",,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2000 Apr 3;237(1-2):147-57. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(99)00219-7.,,"['S0022-1759(99)00219-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(99)00219-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLV infects B lymphocytes and induces a non-neoplastic persistent lymphocytosis (PL) of B lymphocytes in cattle. A characteristic of BLV- and HTLV-induced disease is spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). To investigate the role of virus expression on lymphocyte survival and proliferation, we evaluated cell cycle position, apoptosis and virus expression on a single-cell basis of cultured PBMC from BLV-infected PL cattle, BLV-infected non-PL cattle and uninfected cattle. Results demonstrated that the majority of bovine B lymphocytes spontaneously entered G(2)/M of the cell cycle and died by apoptosis by 24 h post-culture, regardless of BLV infection or PL status. The spontaneous proliferation that characterizes PL cattle was primarily due to a small population of surviving B lymphocytes, but T lymphocytes also contributed. Viral protein expression was detectable in only 5-15% of cultured PBMC from PL cattle and the majority of these lymphocytes were delayed in cell cycle and spared from apoptosis. Unexpectedly, we determined that only 3% of the spontaneously proliferating lymphocytes expressed viral proteins. Previous reports show that spontaneous proliferation decreases when virus expression is suppressed. Together with our results, this suggests that virus expression by one population of B lymphocytes promotes proliferation of another population of B lymphocytes that does not express virus. This may be due to an effect of virus on CD4 T lymphocytes, as depletion of CD4 T lymphocytes significantly decreased spontaneous proliferation.","['Stone, D M', 'Norton, L K', 'Davis, W C']","['Stone DM', 'Norton LK', 'Davis WC']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, PO Box 647040, Pullman, WA 99164, USA. dstone@vetmed.wsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Cycle/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology/*virology']",,2000/03/22 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/22 09:00'],"['2000/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2000 Apr;81(Pt 4):971-81. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-81-4-971.,,['10.1099/0022-1317-81-4-971 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cysteine creation mutations were chosen near the N- and C-termini of CA and at a site adjacent to the M-MuLV Glu-Ala Fv1 N/B host range determination sequence. Analysis of immature virions showed that PrGag proteins were crosslinked at C-terminal CA residues to form dimers while crosslinking of particle-associated N-terminal and N/B region mutant proteins did not yield dimers, but showed evidence of linking to an unknown 140- to 160-kDa partner. Analysis of mature virions demonstrated that both N- and C-terminal CA residues participated in dimer formation, suggesting that processed CA N- and C-termini are free to establish interprotein associations.

In this study, we have inserted a 15-mer peptide that binds specifically to the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin into the Moloney MuLV SU protein, including regions that are surface exposed in the crystal structure of the ecotropic receptor-binding domain. We have concentrated in particular on the variable regions VRA, VRB, and VRC, which are responsible for the use of distinct cellular receptors by different MuLV subtypes and therefore may be more likely to accommodate a heterologous binding moiety. Despite these considerations, only 8 of 26 insertion sites were tolerated, including two separate regions in VRA, a cluster of sites in VRC, and previously identified sites at the N-terminus of the protein and in the proline-rich region immediately downstream of the receptor-binding domain. When expressed on retroviral vector particles, all of the viable proteins retained the ability to bind to and transduce murine cells, although the VRC mutants and an insertion in VRA gave reduced binding and titer. Finally, although all of the viable chimeras could bind to alpha(v)beta(3) in a solid-phase binding assay, we were unable to demonstrate expanded tropism for alpha(v)beta(3)-expressing human cells.

Receptor-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with a PiT-2 construct that could be induced by the removal of tetracycline. The level of PiT-2 expression measured by virus binding in uninduced and in fully and partially induced transfectants correlated with the efficiency of transduction by an amphotropic retroviral reporter vector. Fully induced CHO-PiT-2 cells gave apparent viral titers similar to NIH 3T3 fibroblasts while addition of tetracycline reduced titers by up to 140-fold. Binding of the same vector preparation to purified CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) was always less than to uninduced CHO-PiT-2 transfectants even after preincubation in 10-ng/ml concentrations of IL-3, IL-6, and stem cell factor, which increased retroviral binding by an average of 35%. The level of expression of the amphotropic retroviral receptor PiT-2 thus significantly limits transduction efficiency within the range observed in target cells of importance in human gene therapy.","['Macdonald, C', 'Walker, S', 'Watts, M', 'Ings, S', 'Linch, D C', 'Devereux, S']","['Macdonald C', 'Walker S', 'Watts M', 'Ings S', 'Linch DC', 'Devereux S']","['Department of Haematology, University College London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Primers', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic']",,2000/03/21 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/21 09:00'],"['2000/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2000 Mar 1;11(4):587-95. doi: 10.1089/10430340050015770.,,['10.1089/10430340050015770 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to identify factors that could be optimised to improve outcome following UD transplantation in adults. Data was retrospectively analysed on 55 patients sequentially receiving UD transplants for CML or acute leukaemia (AL), all of whom received serotherapy for the prevention of GVHD and rejection. All patients received standard conditioning regimens. The first 28 patients transplanted also received combined pre- and post-transplant serotherapy with Campath 1G (days -5 to +5) and standard dose CsA plus MTX as GVHD prophylaxis (protocol 1). The subsequent 27 patients received a 5-day course of pre-transplant serotherapy alone either with ATG (CML patients) or Campath 1G (AL patients) on days -5 to -1 inclusive, with high-dose CSA plus MTX (protocol 2). The incidence of acute GVHD was low with no patient receiving either protocol developing > grade 2 disease. The use of protocol 2 and the administration of a bone marrow cell dose above the median (2.17 x 10(8)/kg) were the most important factors predicting engraftment (P = 0.03 and P = 0.001, respectively) but this only remained significant for cell dose in multivariate analysis (P = 0.03). Overall survival for the group was 45% at 3 years and was influenced by both age (P = 0.02) and disease status at transplantation (P = 0.001). Receiving a cell dose above the median was also associated with a trend towards better survival (P = 0.08), due primarily to a reduction in the TRM to 8.2% compared with 54.5% in those receiving a lower cell dose (P = 0.002). We conclude that pre-transplant serotherapy alone is highly effective at preventing acute GVHD following UD BMT and that additional post-transplant serotherapy does not confer any benefit. Furthermore, a high marrow cell dose infused has a major effect in reducing transplant related mortality following UD BMT.","['Byrne, J L', 'Stainer, C', 'Cull, G', 'Haynes, A P', 'Bessell, E M', 'Hale, G', 'Waldmann, H', 'Russell, N H']","['Byrne JL', 'Stainer C', 'Cull G', 'Haynes AP', 'Bessell EM', 'Hale G', 'Waldmann H', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Cell Count', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia/mortality/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/03/21 00:00,2000/03/21 00:01,['2000/03/21 00:00'],"['2000/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Feb;25(4):411-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702165.,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702165 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cumulative overall risk of SMNs was not different with CY/TBI or Mel/TBI (8/393 vs 4/363; 10 year risk 4.4%, 95% CI 1.8-10.6 vs 8.4%, 95% CI 2.9-22.9; P = NS). The risk was significantly higher with use of additional cranial or cranio-spinal irradiation (17.5% vs 2.7% at 10 years; P = 0.0241). Transplants for acute lymphatic leukaemia resulted in a higher incidence of SMNs than did transplants for other diseases (ALL: 17.4%, 95% CI 6.3-42.6%; other diseases: 3.4% (95% 1.3-8.5%, P = 0.0469). The risk of SMN for patients with chronic GVHD was 8.4% (95% CI 3.7-18.7%) as compared to 3.5% (95% CI 1-11.1%) for patients without chronic GVHD (P = NS). No factor was associated with independently increased risk in multivariate analysis. Use of melphalan and TBI for transplant conditioning does not appear to be associated with higher risk of second malignant neoplasms than cyclophosphamide and TBI.","['Kulkarni, S', 'Powles, R', 'Treleaven, J', 'Singhal, S', 'Horton, C', 'Sirohi, B', 'Bhagawati, N', 'Tait, D', 'Saso, R', 'Killick, S', 'Pinkerton, R', 'Atra, A', 'Meller, S', 'Mehta, J']","['Kulkarni S', 'Powles R', 'Treleaven J', 'Singhal S', 'Horton C', 'Sirohi B', 'Bhagawati N', 'Tait D', 'Saso R', 'Killick S', 'Pinkerton R', 'Atra A', 'Meller S', 'Mehta J']","['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melphalan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",,2000/03/21 00:00,2000/03/21 00:01,['2000/03/21 00:00'],"['2000/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Feb;25(4):365-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702148.,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702148 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, high-dose conditioning regimens designed both to control the malignancy and to prevent graft rejection are associated with a high incidence of acute and long-term side-effects. This has largely precluded the use of allografting for patients older than 55 years or for younger patients with certain pre-existing organ damage. In order to manage the side-effects, transplants have traditionally been delivered in highly specialized hospital wards or intensive care settings. Thus, an important goal is to develop safer allografting procedures that can be extended to older patients or patients with pre-existing organ dysfunction who are currently excluded from consideration for transplant. Recent observations have shown that donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) can eradicate some malignancies that relapse after conventional allografting. These observations confirmed earlier evidence in favor of a graft-versus-leukemia effect based on the association of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with a lower likelihood of relapse of malignancy after allografting. Given the potential efficacy of DLI as the sole modality for eradication of malignancy, new strategies for allografting can incorporate the concept of less intensive conditioning therapy which is given with the sole aim of facilitating allogeneic engraftment. Recent pre-clinical studies in a canine model have shown that conditioning regimens for allografting can be markedly reduced in intensity yet still achieve the goal of engraftment. This review briefly summarizes the initial translational clinical studies, using a minimally myelosuppressive-conditioning regimen based on low dose total body irradiation (TBI) or fludarabine alone or in combination with other drugs followed by a short course of immunosuppression with post-grafting cyclosporine and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil.","['Carella, A M', 'Champlin, R', 'Slavin, S', 'McSweeney, P', 'Storb, R']","['Carella AM', 'Champlin R', 'Slavin S', 'McSweeney P', 'Storb R']",,['eng'],"['Editorial', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dogs', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",42,2000/03/21 00:00,2000/03/21 00:01,['2000/03/21 00:00'],"['2000/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Feb;25(4):345-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702204.,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702204 [doi]'],,['P01 CA078902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed an increased number of abnormal flower-like lymphocyte (951/microliter). Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging found no abnormality in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. These findings yielded a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Though ATL patients typically exhibit a variety of clinical symptoms, SIADH is rarely one of the complications. Further investigation showed that IL-1 beta and IL-6 concentrations were increased in spinal fluid but not in serum. Recently, it has been reported that exogeneous IL-6 is an inducer of ADH secretion, and that primary ATL cells and HTLV-I infected cell lines can produce IL-6. In this case, we speculated that IL-6 produced by ATL cells that infiltrated a cerebral lesion may have played an important role in the development of SIADH.","['Imaizumi, R', 'Fujiwara, H', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Matsushita, K', 'Ohtsubo, H', 'Hidaka, S', 'Arima, N', 'Tei, C']","['Imaizumi R', 'Fujiwara H', 'Matsumoto T', 'Matsumoto M', 'Matsushita K', 'Ohtsubo H', 'Hidaka S', 'Arima N', 'Tei C']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Jiaikai Imamura Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Inappropriate ADH Syndrome/*etiology', 'Interleukin-1/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Interleukin-6/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/cerebrospinal fluid/complications/*pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Meninges/*pathology']",,2000/03/21 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/03/21 09:00'],"['2000/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2000 Feb;41(2):140-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of NF-kappa B by both T-cell costimulatory signals and the HTLV Tax protein involves stimulation of I kappa B kinase (IKK). As a genetic approach to dissect the intermediate steps involved in NF-kappa B activation in human T cells, we performed somatic cell mutagenesis to isolate signaling-defective mutant Jurkat T-cell lines. One of the mutant cell lines was shown to have a specific blockade in the IKK signaling pathway but remained competent in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and MAP kinase pathways.

Expression of exogenous IKK gamma in the mutant cells restored NF-kappa B activation by both the T-cell costimulation agents and Tax. These findings provide genetic evidence for the requirement of IKK gamma in NF-kappa B signaling triggered by both T-cell costimulatory signals and HTLV-I Tax protein.","['Harhaj, E W', 'Good, L', 'Xiao, G', 'Uhlik, M', 'Cvijic, M E', 'Rivera-Walsh, I', 'Sun, S C']","['Harhaj EW', 'Good L', 'Xiao G', 'Uhlik M', 'Cvijic ME', 'Rivera-Walsh I', 'Sun SC']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, Pennsylvania, PA 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', '*Mutagenesis', 'NF-kappa B/deficiency/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/*immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,2000/03/21 00:00,2000/03/21 00:01,['2000/03/21 00:00'],"['2000/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Mar 9;19(11):1448-56. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203445.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1203445 [doi]'],,['R01CA68471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examines molecular mechanisms in the MG-induced signal transduction leading to apoptosis, focusing particularly on the role of JNK activation. We first confirmed that MG caused apoptosis in Jurkat cells and that it was cell type dependent because it failed to induce apoptosis in MOLT-4, HeLa, or COS-7 cells. A caspase inhibitor, Z-DEVD-fmk, completely blocked MG-induced poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage and apoptosis, showing the critical role of caspase activation. Inhibition of JNK activity by a JNK inhibitor, curcumin, remarkably reduced MG-induced caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and apoptosis. Stable expression of the dominant negative mutant of JNK also protected cells against apoptosis notably, although not completely. Correspondingly, loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential induced by MG was decreased by the dominant negative JNK. These results confirmed a crucial role of JNK working upstream of caspases, as well as an involvement of JNK in affecting the mitochondrial membrane potential.","['Du, J', 'Suzuki, H', 'Nagase, F', 'Akhand, A A', 'Yokoyama, T', 'Miyata, T', 'Kurokawa, K', 'Nakashima, I']","['Du J', 'Suzuki H', 'Nagase F', 'Akhand AA', 'Yokoyama T', 'Miyata T', 'Kurokawa K', 'Nakashima I']","['Department of Immunology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Aichi 466-8550, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '722KLD7415 (Pyruvaldehyde)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'COS Cells', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Pyruvaldehyde/*toxicity', 'Transfection']",,2000/03/21 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/03/21 09:00'],"['2000/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2000 Mar;77(2):333-44. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(20000501)77:2<333::aid-jcb15>3.0.co;2-q.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(20000501)77:2<333::AID-JCB15>3.0.CO;2-Q [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(20000501)77:2<333::aid-jcb15>3.0.co;2-q [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate magnetic field exposures resulting from these activities, the static, ELF, and VLF magnetic fields produced by 72 TV sets used by children to watch TV programs and 34 TV sets used to play video games were characterized in a field study conducted in Washington DC and its Maryland suburbs. The resulting TV-specific magnetic field data were combined with information collected through questionnaires to estimate the magnetic field exposure levels associated with TV watching and video game playing. The geometric means of the ELF and VLF exposure levels so calculated were 0.0091 and 0.0016 microT, respectively, for children watching TV programs and 0.023 and 0.0038 microT, respectively, for children playing video games. Geometric means of ambient ELF and VLF levels with TV sets turned off were 0.10 and 0.0027 microT, respectively. Summed over the ELF frequency range (6-3066 Hz), the exposure levels were small compared to ambient levels. However, in restricted ELF frequency ranges (120 Hz and 606-3066 Hz) and in the VLF band, TV exposure levels were comparable to or larger than normal ambient levels. Even so, the strengths of the 120 Hz or 606-3066 Hz components of TV fields were small relative to the overall ambient levels. Consequently, our results provide little support for a linkage between childhood leukemia and exposure to the ELF magnetic fields produced by TV sets. Our results do suggest that any future research on possible health effects of magnetic fields from television sets might focus on the VLF electric and magnetic fields produced by TV sets because of their enhanced ability relative to ELF fields to induce electric currents.","['Kaune, W T', 'Miller, M C', 'Linet, M S', 'Hatch, E E', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Wacholder, S', 'Mohr, A H', 'Tarone, R E', 'Haines, C']","['Kaune WT', 'Miller MC', 'Linet MS', 'Hatch EE', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Wacholder S', 'Mohr AH', 'Tarone RE', 'Haines C']","['EM Factors, Richland, Washington 99352, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Background Radiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'District of Columbia', 'Electricity/adverse effects', '*Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', '*Magnetics/adverse effects', 'Maryland', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Television', 'Time Factors', '*Video Games/adverse effects']",,2000/03/21 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/21 09:00'],"['2000/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 2000 Apr;21(3):214-27. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1521-186x(200004)21:3<214::aid-bem8>3.0.co;2-y.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(200004)21:3<214::AID-BEM8>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1521-186x(200004)21:3<214::aid-bem8>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, it has been suggested that the activation of dihydroceramide synthase is responsible for increased ceramide production through this pathway. In this study, accumulation of ceramide mass in Molt-4 human leukemia cells by the chemotherapy agent etoposide was found to occur primarily due to activation of the de novo pathway. However, when the cells were labeled with a substrate for dihydroceramide synthase in the presence of etoposide, there was no corresponding increase in labeled ceramide. Further investigation using a labeled substrate for serine palmitoyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway, resulted in an accumulation of label in ceramide upon etoposide treatment. This result suggests that the activation of serine palmitoyltransferase is the event responsible for increased ceramide generation during de novo synthesis initiated by etoposide. Importantly, the ceramide generated from de novo synthesis appears to have a distinct function from that induced by sphingomyelinase action in that it is not involved in caspase-induced poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase proteolysis but does play a role in disrupting membrane integrity in this model system. These results implicate serine palmitoyltransferase as the enzyme controlling de novo ceramide synthesis during apoptosis and begin to define a unique function of ceramide generated from this pathway.","['Perry, D K', 'Carton, J', 'Shah, A K', 'Meredith, F', 'Uhlinger, D J', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Perry DK', 'Carton J', 'Shah AK', 'Meredith F', 'Uhlinger DJ', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Mycotoxins)', '0 (Palmitates)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.1.- (dihydroceramide desaturase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.50 (SPTLC2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.50 (Serine C-Palmitoyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Ceramides/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Models, Biological', 'Mycotoxins/pharmacology', 'Oxidoreductases/analysis', 'Palmitates/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Serine C-Palmitoyltransferase', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Trypan Blue/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Mar 24;275(12):9078-84. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.12.9078.,,"['10.1074/jbc.275.12.9078 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)30225-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This p36 MBP kinase, which phosphorylates MBP in an in-gel kinase assay, results from the caspase-3-mediated proteolytic cleavage of MST/Krs protein, a mammalian Ste20-like serine/threonine kinase. Herein the correlation between cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis and the activation of MST/Krs proteins was examined in human tumor cell lines, including leukemia-, lung-, epidermoid-, cervix-, stomach-, and brain-derived cell lines. In cytotrienin A-sensitive cell lines, we observed a strong activation of p36 MBP kinase by cleavage of the C-terminal regulatory domain of full-length MST/Krs proteins by caspase-3. When the kinase-inactive mutant form of MST/Krs protein was overexpressed in cytotrienin A-sensitive HL-60 cells, the cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis was partially inhibited. Because cytotrienin A also activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase, we examined the effect of the expression of dominant negative c-Jun on cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis. The expression of dominant negative c-Jun also partially inhibited cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, coexpression of kinase-inactive MST/Krs protein and dominant negative c-Jun completely suppressed cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that the proteolytic activation of MST/Krs and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation are involved in cytotrienin A-induced apoptosis in human tumor cell lines.","['Watabe, M', 'Kakeya, H', 'Onose, R', 'Osada, H']","['Watabe M', 'Kakeya H', 'Onose R', 'Osada H']","['Antibiotics Laboratory, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Rifamycins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (cytotrienin A)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Rifamycins/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Mar 24;275(12):8766-71. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.12.8766.,,"['10.1074/jbc.275.12.8766 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)30186-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, first, it is shown that 1843U89, even without polyglutamylation, is a potent folate-based inhibitor of purified malarial parasite thymidylate synthase. The binding was noncompetitive with respect to methylenetetrahydrofolate, and 1843U89 had a K(i) of 1 nM. The compound also had potent antimalarial activity in vitro. Plasmodium falciparum cells in culture were inhibited by 1843U89, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of about 70 nM. The compound was effective against drug-sensitive as well as drug-resistant clones of P. falciparum. As predicted by the biochemistry of the parasite, the potent inhibition of parasite proliferation by 1843U89 could not be reversed with 10 microM thymidine. In contrast, in the presence of 10 microM thymidine, mammalian cells were unaffected by 1843U89 even at concentrations as high as 0.1 mM, thus offering a selectivity window of more than 1,000-fold.

Early myeloid cells also normally express c-Kit and their survival, proliferation and differentiation is promoted by SCF. It might therefore be expected that c-Kit mutations could also be involved in some acute and/or chronic myeloid leukaemias. We have found that mutant c-Kit (and normal c-Kit in the presence of SCF) provides a strong differentiation stimulus in normal and immortalised murine early myeloid cells. Since maturation of haemopoietic cells, with the exception of mast cells, results in down-regulation of c-Kit expression, the transforming effects of mutant receptor may be self-limiting in most lineages. This is consistent with the observation that multipotential progenitor cells from some patients with systemic mastocytosis express mutant c-Kit. However, c-Kit mutations have been observed in a few cases of myelodysplastic syndromes or AML without mast cell features. Oncogenesis involves multiple genetic changes and the phenotype of malignant haemopoietic cells expressing mutant c-Kit may be influenced by co-oncogenic events. For example mutations blocking the differentiative effect of mutant c-Kit might result in AML rather than mastocytosis. Thus the extent to which c-Kit mutations contribute to malignancies of early myeloid phenotype remains unknown, and resolution of this issue is complicated by the heterogeneity of this family of diseases.","['Ashman, L K', 'Ferrao, P', 'Cole, S R', 'Cambareri, A C']","['Ashman LK', 'Ferrao P', 'Cole SR', 'Cambareri AC']","['Division of Haematology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia. leonie.ashman@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Corrected and Republished Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/physiology']",,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Mar;37(1-2):233-43. doi: 10.3109/10428190009057652.,,['10.3109/10428190009057652 [doi]'],,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Aug;34(5-6):451-61.

T cell clonality was detected by PCR in all cases with increased cytotoxic T-cells in which adequate DNA was obtained from peripheral blood. Since in 2 patients the LDGL was not present at diagnosis but developed during follow up, our data suggests that clonal LDGL may develop in response to the HCL. The significance of LDGL in the setting of HCL and flow cytometric evaluation of HCL versus LDGL will be discussed.","['Xie, X Y', 'Sorbara, L', 'Kreitman, R J', 'Fukushima, P I', 'Kingma, D W', 'Stetler-Stevenson, M']","['Xie XY', 'Sorbara L', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Fukushima PI', 'Kingma DW', 'Stetler-Stevenson M']","['Laboratory of Pathology, Division of Clinical Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications/*immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Mar;37(1-2):97-104. doi: 10.3109/10428190009057632.,,['10.3109/10428190009057632 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, there is a need to develop new strategies for these patients. This study was undertaken to determine the efficacy and toxicity of a chronic low-dose oral idarubicin regimen in these patients as positive data has been generated on this agent in shorter schedules given to patients with other hematological malignancies. Eighteen patients were treated on study. The starting dose of oral idarubicin was 2 to 5 mg/m2 daily depending in initial WBC count. This dose was escalated in the absence of Grade 4 myelosuppression or Grade 3 or 4 extramedullary toxicity. Oral idarubicin was given daily for 28 days followed by a 21 day break off treatment in repeated cycles until there was evidence of disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The dose of idarubicin was adjusted, at 2-week intervals, by 25% to maintain a white blood cell (WBC) count between 2 and 4x10(9)/L and a platelet count of >75x10(9)/L. The dose was reduced by 25% for grade 2 extramedullary toxicity and held until toxicity resolved to grade 2 or better for grade 3 toxicity. Oral idarubicin was then restarted at 75% of the initial dose. Five out of 14 CML patients achieved a complete hematologic remission. No CMML patient responded (median survival 3 months). The overall median survival was 24 months. CML patients had a median survival of 28 months. Major toxicities (myelosuppression, gastrointestinal, cardiac) were infrequent with a median cumulative dose of 1110 mg/m2 (range 54-9750). Five patients have received oral idarubicin for > 1 year with no overt cardiotoxicity, reaching median cumulative dose of 2756 mg/m2 (range 2550-9750) which is higher than those documented in prior studies. We conclude that oral idarubicin is sufficiently safe and active to warrant phase II studies investigating it as part of interferon-based regimens in patients with advanced CML.","['Giles, F J', 'Wong, G C', 'Clark, S J', 'Pierce, S', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Keating, M J']","['Giles FJ', 'Wong GC', 'Clark SJ', 'Pierce S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. fgiles@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Mar;37(1-2):87-95. doi: 10.3109/10428190009057631.,,['10.3109/10428190009057631 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The variations in clinical results and the high costs of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have led to confusion over appropriate use for leukemia patients. In this paper, we reviewed published information on costs and cost-effectiveness of growth factors for childhood and adult leukemia patients. Medline and Healthstar databases were searched for original research articles that contain cost or cost-effectiveness analyses of G-CSF (filgrastim) and GM-SCF (sargramostim) in oncology cooperative group trials. Published manuscripts and abstracts presented at national or international oncology conferences were included. The cost of adjunct treatment was evaluated in two studies of pediatric ALL, one study of adult AML, and two studies of AML in older adults (>55 years). The use of G-CSF for children with ALL was associated with reductions in days to ANC recovery, fewer documented infections, a shorter duration of hospitalization, and small (but not significant) additional costs. In adult AML patients, benefits included a shortening of the duration of neutropenia and hospital stays, a lower incidence of infection and febrile episodes, less use of antibiotics, and cost savings of $2,230 and $2,310 in two studies and an increase if $120 in the third study. This summary suggests that economic analyses can provide useful information to assist clinical decision-making. For pediatric ALL patients, this information indicates that G-CSF use is unlikely to have significant cost implications, and its use should be based on clinical considerations. In studies of adult and older adult AML patients, both GM-CSF and G-CSF have clinical benefits and can be expected to lead to a decrease in overall costs.","['Bennett, C L', 'Stinson, T J', 'Laver, J H', 'Bishop, M R', 'Godwin, J E', 'Tallman, M S']","['Bennett CL', 'Stinson TJ', 'Laver JH', 'Bishop MR', 'Godwin JE', 'Tallman MS']","['Chicago VA Healthcare System-Lakeside Division, and Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA. cbenne@nwu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*economics/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*economics/therapy']",,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Mar;37(1-2):65-70. doi: 10.3109/10428190009057629.,,['10.3109/10428190009057629 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide directly induced apoptosis in the acute promyelocytic cell line NB4 cells at a low dose of 1 microM, whereas all-trans-retinoic acid caused the cells to differentiate and finally induced apoptosis. In addition to the involvement of caspase 3 in arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells, the activation of caspase 8 was also shown to be involved by Western blot analysis or by apoptosis inhibition assay using caspase 8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO. The down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein was shown in arsenic trioxide-treated pre-apoptotic and early apoptotic mouse B-cell line LyH7 cells, which overexpress Bcl-2 protein, by the studies of Western blot and immunoelectron microscopy. Arsenic trioxide also induced apoptosis in the majority of neuroblastomas cell lines. The arsenic-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines was mediated by the activation of caspase 3 in all cases tested. In regard to the intracellular content of reduced glutathione in various neuroblastoma cell lines, the level in the cells sensitive to arsenic trioxide was under 40 nmol/mg protein, but the cells having more than 40 nmol/mg protein did not undergo apoptosis. N-acetylcysteine protected neuroblastoma cells from arsenic-induced apoptosis. Therefore, the intracellular glutathione content may be a good indicator of application of arsenic trioxide for various kinds of cancer cells. Our results raise the possibility that arsenic trioxide will be effective even against a solid tumor such as neuroblastoma and warrants clinical trials for patients with other kinds of tumors not only by systemic therapy but also using local therapy.","['Akao, Y', 'Yamada, H', 'Nakagawa, Y']","['Akao Y', 'Yamada H', 'Nakagawa Y']","['Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, Kani-gun, Japan. giib21@Kani.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspases', 'Down-Regulation', 'Glutathione', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",29,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Mar;37(1-2):53-63. doi: 10.3109/10428190009057628.,,['10.3109/10428190009057628 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigators have also noted induction of apoptosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells following treatment with methylxanthines, a phenomenon that may, at least in part, be due to the activity of these drugs as non-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. We discuss three general strategies for altering cAMP-mediated signal transduction in lymphoid cells. After a review of what is known about the expression and regulation of PDE families in human lymphoid cells, we focus on the use of isoform-specific PDE inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents in CLL. Our work has suggested that despite the presence of PDE1, PDE3B, PDE4 and PDE7 enzymes in CLL, inhibition of PDE4 results in uniquely potent induction of apoptosis in CLL cells. This effect is relatively specific as comparable treatment of human peripheral blood T cells does not induce apoptosis. Clinical trials utilizing PDE4 inhibitors are indicated in the therapy of CLL patients resistant to standard therapy.","['Lerner, A', 'Kim, D H', 'Lee, R']","['Lerner A', 'Kim DH', 'Lee R']","['Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine, MA 02118, USA. alerner@med-medl.bu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Xanthines)', '28109-92-4 (methylxanthine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 1)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 1', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Xanthines/pharmacology']",72,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Mar;37(1-2):39-51. doi: 10.3109/10428190009057627.,,['10.3109/10428190009057627 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, however, it has been reported that some acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts expressed c-mp1 on their cell surface and proliferated in response to TPO. We therefore investigated the effect of thrombopoietin on the growth of leukemic blasts from patients with CD7-positive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which is a distinct biological and clinical subtype of AML. Significant growth responses of leukemic blasts to TPO were seen in 10/10 CD7+ and 7/20 CD7- AML cases using 3H-thymidine incorporation, while synergistic stimulatory effects of TPO with stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were observed in both groups. In a leukemic blast colony assay, significant growth response to TPO was observed in 5/6 CD7+ and 4/17 CD7- AML cases examined. Furthermore, the expression of c-mp1 seemed to be higher in CD7+ AML cases than in CD7- cases, suggesting a relationship between the expression of c-mp1 and the proliferative response to TPO. These findings imply that CD7+ leukemic blasts express functional TPO receptors and proliferate in response to TPO. Thus CD7 expression on AML blasts may indicate the involvement of leukemic progenitors at an early stage of multipotent hemopoietic stem cells. In this review, we discuss the effect of TPO on AML blasts, especially in CD7+ AML cases.","['Tokunaga, Y', 'Miyamoto, T', 'Gondo, H', 'Okamura, T', 'Niho, Y']","['Tokunaga Y', 'Miyamoto T', 'Gondo H', 'Okamura T', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD7/*physiology', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology/*physiology']",38,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Mar;37(1-2):27-37. doi: 10.3109/10428190009057626.,,['10.3109/10428190009057626 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about invariant Valpha24+ NKT cell function or mechanisms of effector activity. Evidence suggests this cell population protects against autoimmunity and has antitumor effects against leukemia and solid tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the phenotype and function of invariant Valpha24+ NKT cells, from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and normal donors, generated by stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with alpha-galactosylceramide pulsed monocyte-derived dendritic cells. The CD4(-)CD8(-) (double negative) population was studied further. RESULTS: Activated human invariant Valpha24+ NKT cells were cytotoxic against autologous and allogeneic peripheral blood dendritic cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells but not against autologous or allogeneic T-cell PHA blasts, B-cell lymphoblastoid cell lines, monocytes, or leukemic cells from patients with CML. The findings are consistent with previous observations showing the importance of CD1d in target cell recognition. None of the Valpha24+ NKT cell lines expressed the NK markers CD16, CD56, CD94, or killer inhibitory receptors, but all expressed NKR-P1A. There was no difference in phenotype, function, or ease of generation of invariant Valpha24+ NKT cells between normal donors and patients with CML. CONCLUSION: Based on our results and the previous evidence linking reduced Valpha24+ NKT cells to autoimmunity, we propose that double-negative Valpha24+ NKT cells have important immune regulatory functions, including contribution to the prevention of excessive antigen stimulation by virtue of cytotoxic activity against antigen presenting cells, particularly in dendritic cells.","['Nicol, A', 'Nieda, M', 'Koezuka, Y', 'Porcelli, S', 'Suzuki, K', 'Tadokoro, K', 'Durrant, S', 'Juji, T']","['Nicol A', 'Nieda M', 'Koezuka Y', 'Porcelli S', 'Suzuki K', 'Tadokoro K', 'Durrant S', 'Juji T']","['Department of Medicine, University of Queensland, Queensland Institute of Medical Research and Royal Brisbane Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. nicolaj@odyssey.com.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology']",,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Mar;28(3):276-82. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00149-6.,,"['S0301-472X(99)00149-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00149-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also involved in the organization of basement membranes. So far the genomic organization of the dystroglycan gene DAG1 has not been completely investigated. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of 162 kb of dog genomic DNA containing the complete approximately 71-kb canine DAG1 gene, which consists of three exons, with the translation start codon located in exon 2. Its 2679-nucleotide ORF encodes a polypeptide of 892 amino acids, which is highly similar to human, rabbit, and bovine orthologs. To further characterize the dog DAG1 gene we determined the transcription start site and several naturally occurring polymorphisms, which partially result in amino acid substitutions of the dystroglycan protein. The dog DAG1 gene was assigned to chromosome 20q15.1-q15.2 by FISH analysis. The analysis of the entire reported sequence revealed that the genes for aminomethyltransferase (AMT), bassoon (BSN), TCTA (T-cell leukemia translocation-associated) gene, and an as yet uncharacterized protein are located very close to the DAG1 gene. Therefore, this study defines a novel syntenic region among dog chromosome 20q15, human chromosome 3p21, and murine chromosome 9F.","['Leeb, T', 'Neumann, S', 'Deppe, A', 'Breen, M', 'Brenig, B']","['Leeb T', 'Neumann S', 'Deppe A', 'Breen M', 'Brenig B']","['Institute of Veterinary Medicine, University of Gottingen, 37073 Gottingen, Germany. tleeb@zucht.tiho-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DAG1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Dystrophin)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '146888-27-9 (Dystroglycans)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Contig Mapping', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'Dogs', 'Dystroglycans', 'Dystrophin/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Rabbits']",,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2000 Mar;10(3):295-301. doi: 10.1101/gr.10.3.295.,,['10.1101/gr.10.3.295 [doi]'],,,,,['GENBANK/AJ012166'],PMC311422,,,,,,,,,,,

This delayed phosphorylation was almost completely inhibited by anti-gp130 blocking antibody RX435, but not by TAK044 (ET-A/B-R antagonist), prazosin, or propranolol. AngII induced phosphorylation of gp130 in the late stage, which was temporally in parallel with the delayed phosphorylation of STAT3. AngII augmented IL-6, CT-1, and LIF mRNA expression at 30-60 min, but not CNTF expression. AngII increased IL-6 protein levels by 3-fold in the conditioned media at 2 h compared with the control.

This type of change occurs in the sympathetic sweat gland innervation during development and can be induced in cultured sympathetic neurons by extracts of sweat gland-containing footpads or by leukemia inhibitory factor. Sympathetic neurons initially produce norepinephrine (NE) and contain the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), which packages NE into vesicles, and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), which removes NE from the synaptic cleft to terminate signaling. We have used a variety of biochemical and molecular techniques to test whether VMAT2 and NET levels decrease in sympathetic neurons which stop producing NE and make acetylcholine. In cultured sympathetic neurons, NET protein and mRNA decreased during the switch to a cholinergic phenotype but VMAT2 mRNA and protein did not decline. NET immunoreactivity disappeared from the developing sweat gland innervation in vivo as it acquired cholinergic properties. Surprisingly, NET simultaneously appeared in sweat gland myoepithelial cells. The presence of NET in myoepithelial cells did not require sympathetic innervation. VMAT2 levels did not decrease as the sweat gland innervation became cholinergic, indicating that NE synthesis and vesicular packaging are not coupled in this system. Thus, production of NE and the transporters required for noradrenergic transmission are not coordinately regulated during cholinergic development.","['Habecker, B A', 'Klein, M G', 'Cox, B C', 'Packard, B A']","['Habecker BA', 'Klein MG', 'Cox BC', 'Packard BA']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon 97201-3098, USA. habecker@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Slc18a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc18a2 protein, rat)', '0 (Slc6a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc6a2 protein, rat)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (Vesicular Biogenic Amine Transport Proteins)', '0 (Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mice', 'Neurons/*metabolism', '*Neuropeptides', 'Norepinephrine/*metabolism', 'Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sweat Glands/innervation', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/cytology/metabolism', '*Symporters', 'Vesicular Biogenic Amine Transport Proteins', 'Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins']",,2000/03/18 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/18 09:00'],"['2000/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2000 Apr 1;220(1):85-96. doi: 10.1006/dbio.2000.9631.,,"['10.1006/dbio.2000.9631 [doi]', 'S0012-1606(00)99631-3 [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],['R01 HL068231/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, they induce the reactive transformation of astrocytes (gliosis) and influence growth and differentiation of neuroectodermal tumor cell lines in vitro. However, their role in gliomas is largely unknown. We studied the expression of CNTF and its receptor subunits in human astrocytomas and glioblastomas. In more than 95% of the tumors, CNTF transcripts were found by RNAase protection assay; in more than 80% of the cases, tumor cells were CNTF immunoreactive. CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFR alpha), the specific component of the tripartite CNTF receptor system, was detectable by Northern blot analysis in 80% of the cases. In situ hybridization revealed CNTFR alpha mRNA in the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells. Transcripts of the remaining two components of the CNTF receptor system, gp130 and LIFR beta, were found by Northern blotting in 83% and 70% of the tumors, respectively. Simultaneous expression of CNTF and all its receptor components was detected in approximately half of the tumors.

This suggests that these gliomas have acquired mechanisms to prevent Fas-mediated apoptosis from occurring. Candidates for such a role include transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGFbeta2) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2). TGFbeta2 effectively functions by hiding tumor cells from the immune system. This may potentially prevent the delivery of FasL from cytolytic T cells to Fas bearing astrocytomas. Bcl-2 works by rendering gliomas resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed seventy-six human astrocytomas (11 World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, 17 grade II, 17 grade III, and 31 grade IV) for the expression of Fas, FasL, TGFbeta2 and Bcl-2 in vivo. Positive immunoreactivity was found to significantly increase with increasing tumor grade for Fas (p < 0.0002), FasL (p < 0.0001), TGFbeta2 (p < 0.001) and Bcl-2 (p < 0.01). In addition, Fas/FasL co-expression, a counter-intuitive combination of factors in regards to glioma survival, also increased with WHO grade. Forty-five of 76 (59%) astrocytomas co-expressed Fas and FasL. Of those co-expressing Fas and FasL, 44 of 45 (98%) produced TGFbeta2, and 26 of 45 (58%) expressed Bcl-2. We found a significant positive correlation between Fas/FasL co-expression and TGFbeta2 (p < 0.002) and Bcl-2 (p < 0.005) production.

In two studies patients who required one or more platelet transfusions during their first course of chemotherapy were found to require fewer platelet transfusions if their second cycle was augmented with IL-11. The drug was generally safe, with cardiovascular compromise the only significant complication occurring in a minority of patients. Although these reports included patients with various malignancies, studies of IL-11 in patients with myeloproliferative disorders have not been presented. In several clinical trials in cancer patients treatment with TPO was safe, and when administered early following a moderately aggressive cytotoxic insult was effective in accelerating platelet recovery. In addition, in both pre-clinical and clinical trials, TPO given to stem cell donors during mobilization lead to accelerated hematopoietic recovery. Finally, TPO appears safe when administered to patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), both with respect to acute toxicity and long-term outcome of the leukemia. However, when used following a 7-day course of standard chemotherapy, the agent does not appear to accelerate platelet recovery. As such, additional clinical trials to test different growth factor regimens are ongoing.

Several mechanisms may account for this phenomenon, including failure of the cell to undergo apoptosis in response to chemotherapy, or failure of the drug to reach and/or affect its intracellular target. This review focuses on the latter mechanism, and on intracellular drug transport resistance mechanisms in particular. Expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has generally been reported to correlate with prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Additionally, but more controversial, expression of the ABC transporter multidrug resistance protein (MRP) and the vault-transporter lung resistance protein (LRP) have been correlated with outcome in AML. Despite these findings, functional efflux assays indicate the presence of non-Pgp, non-MRP transporters in AML. Recently, a novel ABC transporter, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) was cloned and sequenced in our laboratory. Transfection and overexpression of BCRP in drug-sensitive cells confers drug-resistance to the cells. BCRP is a half-transporter, and may homodimerize or form heterodimers (with a yet unknown half-transporter) to produce an active transport complex. Relatively high expression of BCRP mRNA is observed in approximately 30% of AML cases, suggesting a potential role for this new transporter in drug resistance in leukemia.","['Ross, D D']",['Ross DD'],"['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/physiology', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/physiology', 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Dimerization', 'Drosophila melanogaster/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/*physiology', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Insect Proteins/physiology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/physiology']",80,2000/03/17 00:00,2000/03/17 00:01,['2000/03/17 00:00'],"['2000/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Mar;14(3):467-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401694.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401694 [doi]'],,['R01-CA77545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that overexpression of FLI-1 in pluripotent human hematopoietic cells leads to the induction of a megakaryocytic phenotype. In this report we show that FLI-1 also acts as an inhibitor of erythroid differentiation. Following the induction of erythroid differentiation, pluripotent cells express reduced levels of FLI-1. In contrast, when FLI-1 is overexpressed in these cells, the levels of erythroid markers are reduced. The ability of FLI-1 overexpressing cells to respond to erythroid-specific inducers such as hemin and Ara-C is also inhibited, and the uninduced cells show a reduced level of the erythroid-associated GATA-1 transcription factor mRNA. Furthermore, expression of a GATA-1 promoter-driven reporter construct in K562 cells is inhibited by co-transfection with a construct expressing FLI-1. Our results support the hypothesis that FLI-1 can act both positively and negatively in the regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation, and that inhibition of GATA-1 expression may contribute to FLI-1-mediated inhibition of erythroid differentiation.","['Athanasiou, M', 'Mavrothalassitis, G', 'Sun-Hoffman, L', 'Blair, D G']","['Athanasiou M', 'Mavrothalassitis G', 'Sun-Hoffman L', 'Blair DG']","['Intramural Research Support Program, SAIC Frederick, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",,2000/03/17 00:00,2000/03/17 00:01,['2000/03/17 00:00'],"['2000/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Mar;14(3):439-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401689.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401689 [doi]'],,['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here investigate the effects of As2O3 on RA-resistant APL in vivo and in vitro using our RA-resistant APL model system. As2O3 can induce inhibition of cellular growth of both RA-sensitive NB4 and RA-resistant UF-1 APL cells via induction of apoptosis in vitro. The expression of BCL-2 protein decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner in NB4 cells. Interestingly, the levels of BCL-2 protein were not modulated by As2O3, but it did upregulate BAX protein in UF-1 cells. UF-1 cells (1x10(7)) were transplanted into hGM-CSF-producing transgenic SCID mice and successfully formed subcutaneous tumors. After 40 days of implantation, mice were treated with As2O3, all-trans RA and PBS for 21 days. In all-trans RA- and PBS-treated mice, tumors grew rapidly, with a 4.5-fold increase in volume at day 21 compared to the initial size. In marked contrast, tumor size was decreased to half of the initial size by the treatment of As2O3, which resulted in cells with the typical appearance of apoptosis. Interestingly, one of the As2O3-treated mice showed mature granulocytes in the diminished tumor, suggesting that As2O3 had dual effects on RA-resistant APL cells in vivo: both inducing apoptosis and differentiation of the leukemic cells. We conclude that our RA-resistant APL model will be useful for evaluating novel therapeutic approaches to patients with RA-resistant APL, and for further investigation of the metabolism of As2O3 in vivo.","['Kinjo, K', 'Kizaki, M', 'Muto, A', 'Fukuchi, Y', 'Umezawa, A', 'Yamato, K', 'Nishihara, T', 'Hata, J', 'Ito, M', 'Ueyama, Y', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Kinjo K', 'Kizaki M', 'Muto A', 'Fukuchi Y', 'Umezawa A', 'Yamato K', 'Nishihara T', 'Hata J', 'Ito M', 'Ueyama Y', 'Ikeda Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bad protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2000/03/17 00:00,2000/03/17 00:01,['2000/03/17 00:00'],"['2000/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Mar;14(3):431-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401646.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401646 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result of this translocation, two novel chimeric genes are generated and the bcr/abl and abl/bcr fusion proteins expressed. The bcr/abl fusion mRNA is present in all CML patients, whereas the reciprocal abl/bcr fusion mRNA is detectable in about 80% of the Ph+ CML patients. These fusion proteins may undergo enzymatic degradation in the cytosol and give rise to MHC class I restricted peptide epitopes originating from the junctional regions of the translocation products, which thus may serve as novel tumor specific antigens. Previously, other groups have tested peptides corresponding to the junctional region of the bcr/abl protein for their binding capacity to HLA class I molecules and have identified a few candidate epitopes. Peptides originating from the abl/bcr fusion protein have on the other hand so far been neglected, for no apparent reason. We have now extended these studies to include also the reciprocal abl/bcr translocation product by testing a large panel of synthetic peptides corresponding to the junctional regions of both the abl/bcr and the bcr/abl fusion proteins for their ability to stabilize HLA class I molecules. We find that the abl/bcr translocation product may be an even more important source of CML specific peptide antigens and together the junctional sequences of both these proteins contain peptide sequences which bind efficiently to a number of HLA molecules (HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, -A11, -B7, -B27, -B35) and thus may serve as candidate CML specific tumor antigens.","['Berke, Z', 'Andersen, M H', 'Pedersen, M', 'Fugger, L', 'Zeuthen, J', 'Haurum, J S']","['Berke Z', 'Andersen MH', 'Pedersen M', 'Fugger L', 'Zeuthen J', 'Haurum JS']","['Institute of Cancer Biology, the Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/metabolism', 'Epitopes/chemistry/immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/*immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-B Antigens/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/*immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism']",,2000/03/17 00:00,2000/03/17 00:01,['2000/03/17 00:00'],"['2000/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Mar;14(3):419-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401703.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401703 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant upregulation of CD80 (B7-1) and enhancement of alloantigen presentation was seen with the addition of GM-CSF and TNFalpha alone or with additional cytokines. The combination of GM-CSF and TNFalpha, either alone or in combination with an additional cytokine, resulted in enhancing alloantigen presentation by at least two-fold over the media control group in 10/12 patients studied, and resulted in CD80 expression of greater than 15% in 11/12 patients studied.

Here we report that CD40 ligand (CD40L) in the presence of recombinant IL-3 increased proliferation of BCP-ALL cells by upregulating expression of IL-3R. Upregulation of IL-3R in BCP-ALL cells was observed as early as 1 h after treatment with CD40L, and a 50- to 500-fold increase of IL-3R expression after 24 h was detected in all 12 cases studied. Moreover, expression of receptors for IL-7 (IL-7R) and stem cell factor (SCF-R, c-Kit) was also induced by CD40L in the majority of BCP-ALL cases examined; however, levels of induction were low compared to those for IL-3R. To test the functional activity of upregulated receptors for IL-3, SCF and IL-7, we evaluated the proliferation and growth of BCP-ALL cells cultured in serum-free media with CD40L plus these factors. When CD40L was added with either a single cytokine (IL-3, SCF and IL-7) or their combinations, cell proliferation was significantly increased as detected by DNA synthesis assay. Combinations of CD40L plus IL-3 and either SCF or IL-7 were able to support long-term growth of BCP-ALL cells for at least 8 weeks in three of the seven cases studied. Immunophenotyping and gene rearrangement studies indicated that cells in long-term cultures were monoclonal and retained their original phenotypes. The leukemic cells remained primarily dependent on the presence of IL-3 and its receptor for long-term growth, as shown by selective withdrawal of growth factors or antibody blockade of receptors. These results suggest an important role for CD40L in upregulating expression of IL-3R on BCP-ALL cells and enabling these cells to proliferate in long-term cultures in the presence of IL-3 and either SCF or IL-7.","['Zhou, M', 'Gu, L', 'Holden, J', 'Yeager, A M', 'Findley, H W']","['Zhou M', 'Gu L', 'Holden J', 'Yeager AM', 'Findley HW']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",,2000/03/17 00:00,2000/03/17 00:01,['2000/03/17 00:00'],"['2000/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Mar;14(3):403-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401682.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401682 [doi]'],,['R29 CA72020-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe here that constitutively activated NF-kappaB complexes are found in the vast majority (39 out of 42 samples) of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without any subtype restriction. Electrophoretic shift analysis further demonstrates that these complexes are composed of p50-p50 and p65-p50 dimers. Proteasome inhibition in primary ALL cultures results in a hyperphosphorylated form of IkappaBalpha, indicating that activation of upstream kinases, which trigger IkappaBalpha degradation, has led to nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Careful inhibition of cellular proteolytic activities is of importance when analyzing extracts from primary ALL cells. Degradation of p65 and other proteins in ALL samples could be specifically suppressed by alpha-1 antitrypsin. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation is thus a common characteristic of childhood ALL and strongly suggests a critical role of this factor for leukemia cell survival.","['Kordes, U', 'Krappmann, D', 'Heissmeyer, V', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Scheidereit, C']","['Kordes U', 'Krappmann D', 'Heissmeyer V', 'Ludwig WD', 'Scheidereit C']","['Max-Delbruck-Centrum for Molecular Medicine, Universitatsklinikum Charite, Campus Berlin-Buch, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Child', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dimerization', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/17 00:00,2000/03/17 00:01,['2000/03/17 00:00'],"['2000/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Mar;14(3):399-402. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401705.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401705 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, no difference was detected between bcr1 and bcr3 when HLA alleles were grouped according to their peptide binding specificities. Comparing HLA frequencies, clinical features at diagnosis and clinical outcome of the 64 patients homogeneously treated with all-trans retinoic acid and idarubicin (AIDA protocol) we observed a statistically significant association between HLA-B*13 and risk of relapse by univariate and multivariate regression analysis.

Between 1984 and 1990, a total of 71 patients with newly diagnosed CML had been enrolled into two consecutive IFN trials at our institution. Follow-up extended to December 1998, resulting in a median observation period for surviving patients of 11.4 years. The median survival time from diagnosis was 5.9 years. A plateau in the actuarial survival curve was found from 8.2 to 12.3 years following diagnosis with a projected 10-year survival rate of 32%. 'Landmark' studies showed a significant survival advantage for patients with karyotype responses. Of 68 patients accessible to calculation of the Hasford score, three were in the high risk group, 24 belonged to the medium risk group, and 41 had low risk features. The majority of cytogenetic responders including all eight assessable patients in complete cytogenetic remission were in the low risk group. Achieving a cytogenetic remission was found to provide a survival advantage also for patients with low risk disease. Of the seven patients surviving more than 11 years, six were in continuous complete cytogenetic remission. Their favorable outcome appears to translate into an out-flattening of the survival curve for the 71 single center patients presented. It will be of interest to see whether prolonged follow-ups of the large multicentric randomized trials will similarly show a subset of long-term surviving patients with ongoing IFN-induced remission.","['Kloke, O', 'Opalka, B', 'Niederle, N']","['Kloke O', 'Opalka B', 'Niederle N']","['Department of Internal Medicine, West German Cancer Center, University of Essen Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/03/17 00:00,2000/03/17 00:01,['2000/03/17 00:00'],"['2000/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Mar;14(3):389-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401661.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401661 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the cytotoxic interaction produced by the combination of the active metabolite of fludarabine phosphate, fludarabine (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine, 2-F-ara-A), and some commonly used antileukemic agents against human hairy cell leukemia cell line JOK-1, human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line SKW-3, and adult T cell leukemia cell lines ED-40810 (-) and SALT-3. The leukemia cells were exposed simultaneously to 2-F-ara-A and to the other agents for 4 days. Cell growth inhibition was determined using MTT reduction assay. The isobologram method of Steel and Peckham was used to evaluate the cytotoxic interaction. 2-F-ara-A and cytarabine showed synergistic effects in SKW-3 cells, additive and synergistic effects in JOK-1 and SALT-3 cells, and additive effects in ED-40810(-) cells. 2-F-ara-A and doxorubicin showed additive effects in SKW-3, ED-40810(-) and SALT-3 cell lines, and additive and synergistic effects in JOK-1 cells. 2-F-ara-A showed additive effects with etoposide, 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide, and hydroxyurea in all four cell lines. 2-F-ara-A showed antagonistic effects with methotrexate and vincristine in all four cell lines. Our findings suggest that the simultaneous administration of fludarabine phosphate with cytarabine, doxorubicin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, or hydroxyurea would be advantageous for cytotoxic effects. Among these agents, cytarabine may be the best agent for the combination with fludarabine phosphate. The simultaneous administration of fludarabine phosphate with methotrexate or vincristine would have little cytotoxic effect, and this combination may be inappropriate. These findings may be useful in clinical trials of combination chemotherapy with fludarabine phosphate and these agents.","['Kano, Y', 'Akutsu, M', 'Tsunoda, S', 'Suzuki, K', 'Ichikawa, A', 'Furukawa, Y', 'Bai, L', 'Kon, K']","['Kano Y', 'Akutsu M', 'Tsunoda S', 'Suzuki K', 'Ichikawa A', 'Furukawa Y', 'Bai L', 'Kon K']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Tochigi Cancer Center, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology/toxicity']",,2000/03/17 00:00,2000/03/17 00:01,['2000/03/17 00:00'],"['2000/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Mar;14(3):379-88. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401684.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401684 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subcutaneous injection of the transformed 32D cells caused leukemia in addition to subcutaneous tumors in C3H/HeJ mice. To develop a FLT3-targeted therapy, we examined tyrosine kinase inhibitors for in vitro growth suppression of the transformed 32D cells. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, remarkably inhibited the growth of the transformed 32D cells at 0.1 microM, at which concentration it was ineffective in parental 32D cells. Herbimycin A suppressed the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant FLT3 but not the phosphorylation of the ligand-stimulated wild-type FLT3. In mice transplanted with the transformed 32D cells, the administration of herbimycin A prolonged the latency of disease or completely prevented leukemia, depending on the number of cells inoculated and schedule of drug administration.

Unlike B-precursor ALL, most investigators are still using cranial radiation (CRT) and are hesitant to rely solely on intrathecal therapy for T-ALL. In this study we assessed the effects of CRT upon event-free survival and central nervous system (CNS) relapses in a cohort of children with high risk features of T cell leukemia. In a series of six consecutive studies (1987-1995) patients were non-randomly assigned their CNS prophylaxis per individual protocol. These protocols were based on POG 8704 which relied on rotating drug combinations (cytarabine/cyclophosphamide, teniposide/Ara-C, and vincristine/doxorubicin/6-MP/prednisone) postinduction. Modifications such as high-dose cytarabine, intermediate-dose methotrexate, and the addition of G-CSF, were designed to give higher CNS drug levels (decreasing the need for CRT), to eliminate epidophyllotoxin (decreasing the risk of secondary leukemia), and to reduce therapy-related neutropenia (pilot studies POG 9086, 9295, 9296, 9297, 9398). All patients included in this analysis qualified for POG high risk criteria, WBC >50000/mm3 and/or CNS leukemia. Patients without CNS involvement received 16 doses of age-adjusted triple intra-thecal therapy (TIT = hydrocortisone, MTX, and cytarabine) whereas patients with CNS disease received three more doses of TIT during induction and consolidation. Patients who received CRT were treated with 2400 cGy (POG 8704) or 1800 cGy (POG 9086 and 9295). CNS therapy included CRT in 144 patients while the remaining 78 patients received no radiation by original protocol design. There were 155 males and 57 females with a median age of 8.2 years. The median WBC for the CRT+ and CRT- patients were 186000/mm3 and 200000/mm3, respectively. CNS involvement at diagnosis was seen in 16% of the CRT+ and 23% of the CRT- groups. The complete continuous remission rate (CCR) was not significantly different for the irradiated vs. non-irradiated groups (P = 0.46). The 3-year event-free survival was 65% (s.e. 6%) and 63% (s.e. 4%) for the non-irradiated vs. the radiated group. However, the 3-year CNS relapse rate was significantly higher amongst patients who did not receive CRT; 18% (s.e. 5%) vs. 7% (s.e. 3%) in the irradiated group (P = 0.012). Our analysis in a non-randomized setting, suggests that CRT did not significantly correlate with event-free survival but omitting it had an adverse effect on the CNS involvement at the time of relapse.","['Laver, J H', 'Barredo, J C', 'Amylon, M', 'Schwenn, M', 'Kurtzberg, J', 'Camitta, B M', 'Pullen, J', 'Link, M P', 'Borowitz, M', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Murphy, S B', 'Shuster, J']","['Laver JH', 'Barredo JC', 'Amylon M', 'Schwenn M', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Camitta BM', 'Pullen J', 'Link MP', 'Borowitz M', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Murphy SB', 'Shuster J']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425-3311, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Podophyllotoxin/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/03/17 00:00,2000/03/17 00:01,['2000/03/17 00:00'],"['2000/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Mar;14(3):369-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401693.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401693 [doi]'],,"['CA-15525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33603/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-69177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UK Medical Research Council's Working Party on Childhood Leukaemia.,356-63,"Treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) aims to cure all patients with as little toxicity as possible and, if possible, to restrict further intensification of chemotherapy to patients with an increased risk of relapse. However in Medical Research Council (MRC) trial UKALL X two short myeloablative blocks of intensification therapy given at weeks 5 and 20 were of benefit to children in all risk groups. The successor trials, MRC UKALL XI and MRC ALL97, tested whether further intensification would continue to benefit all patients by randomising them to receive, or not, an extended third intensification block at week 35. After a median follow-up of 4 years (range 5 months to 8 years), 5 year projected event-free survival was superior at 68% for the 894 patients allocated a third intensification compared with 60% for the 887 patients who did not receive one (odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.90, 2P = 0.002). This difference was almost entirely due to a reduced incidence of bone marrow relapses in the third intensification arm (140 of 891 in the third intensification arm vs. 171 of 883 in the no third intensification, 2P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis suggests benefit of the third intensification for all risk categories. Overall survival to date is no different in the two arms, indicating that a greater proportion of those not receiving a third intensification arm and subsequently relapsing can be salvaged. These results indicate that there is benefit of additional intensification for all risk subgroups of childhood ALL.","['Hann, I', 'Vora, A', 'Richards, S', 'Hill, F', 'Gibson, B', 'Lilleyman, J', 'Kinsey, S', 'Mitchell, C', 'Eden, O B']","['Hann I', 'Vora A', 'Richards S', 'Hill F', 'Gibson B', 'Lilleyman J', 'Kinsey S', 'Mitchell C', 'Eden OB']","[""Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infections/mortality', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2000/03/17 00:00,2000/03/17 00:01,['2000/03/17 00:00'],"['2000/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Mar;14(3):356-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401704.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401704 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival did not correlate with gender, RAI uptake, initial histology, or grade. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the single strongest predictor of survival was the volume of FDG-avid disease. The 3-yr survival probability of patients with FDG volumes of 125 mL or less was 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.91, 1.0) compared with 0.18 (95% confidence interval, 0.04, 0.85) in patients with FDG volume greater than 125 mL. Only 1 death (of leukemia) occurred in the PET-negative group (n = 66). Of the 10 patients with distant metastases and negative PET scans, all were alive and well. Patients over 45 yr with distant metastases that concentrate FDG are at the highest risk. Once distant metastases are discovered in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, FDG-PET can identify high and low risk subsets.

Northern blot analysis showed a faint band corresponding to the MLL chimeric transcript. Structural analysis of a genomic clone with the rearranged MLL gene from der(11) chromosome demonstrated the breakpoint to be localized between exons 6 and 7 of the the MLL gene and to lie in an Alu sequence of this region. The partner gene fused to the 3' part of MLL was shown to be the AF6 gene on chromosome 6q27 by in situ chromosome hybridization and nucleotide sequencing of chimeric MLL cDNA clones. However, it was shown that MLL exon 5 was fused to AF6 in one clone, whereas most clones were MLL exon 6/AF6 chimeric cDNA clones. These findings indicate that exon 6 of MLL is spliced out in the process of transcription in a variant MLL/AF6. In addition, we were able to detect the splicing of exon 6 in either this chimeric MLL/AF6 or MLL transcripts from untranslocated chromosomes by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

In two patients, MLL was amplified on double-minute chromosomes (dmins). In both cases, an interstitial deletion in 11q23 including the MLL gene was associated with the occurrence of the dmins containing MLL. As a rarely described mechanism, MLL amplification in the form of size-variable ring chromosomes was observed in two patients. Remodeling of the ring chromosomes leads to multiple copies of MLL and obviously provided a selective growth advantage. In one of the two cases with ring chromosomes, the centromeric alpha-satellite DNA of the ring chromosome was not detectable. Our fifth patient showed the unique finding of MLL amplification within a uniformly (homogeneously?) stained region in interaction with amplified ribosomal DNA sequences. Also, one of the patients with ring chromosomes exhibited the amplification of ribosomal DNA on the ring chromosomes.

For 2-CdA to manifest its chemotherapeutic activity, it must first enter the cell through one of several specific nucleoside transporter systems. We present data to show that bryostatin 1-induced enhanced influx of 2-CdA is in part the result of bryostatin 1-induced modulation of nucleoside transporters in WSU-CLL cells. The bi-directional equilibrative NBMPR sensitive transporters in WSU-CLL cells were significantly down-regulated 90 min post-exposure to 1-200 nM bryostatin 1. This down-regulation was evident up to 144 h. In contrast, WSU-CLL cells exhibited a transient increase in Na+-dependent concentrative 2-CdA influx from 48 to 96 h after bryostatin 1 exposure which was evident for a longer duration than that accounted for by the increase in deocycytidine kinase activity. These data may, in part, explain the enhanced efficacy of 2-CdA seen in WSU-CLL cells following 48-72 h exposure to bryostatin 1. It may raise questions as to the importance of the bi-directional transporters in determining the resistance or sensitivity of CLL cells to 2-CdA or other nucleoside analogues.","['Beck, F W', 'Al-Katib, A M', 'Ahmad, I', 'Wall, N R', 'Liu, K Z', 'Mantsch, H H', 'Mohammad, R M']","['Beck FW', 'Al-Katib AM', 'Ahmad I', 'Wall NR', 'Liu KZ', 'Mantsch HH', 'Mohammad RM']","['Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cladribine/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2000/03/17 00:00,2000/03/17 00:01,['2000/03/17 00:00'],"['2000/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2000 Apr;5(4):341-7. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.5.4.341.,,['10.3892/ijmm.5.4.341 [doi]'],,['R01CA79837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current estimates indicate that PML ultimately develops in up to 5% of all patients with AIDS. This demyelinating disease results from infection with JC virus, a papova virus, that most of the world's population is exposed to prior to adulthood. Although PML commonly occurs in the setting of advanced immunosuppression, it may be observed in patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts in excess of 200 cells/mm3. Focal neurological symptoms and signs coupled with hyperintense signals abnormalities of the white matter on T2-weighted cranial magnetic resonance imaging are highly suggestive of the disease. In this setting, a positive CSF polymerase chain reaction for JCV DNA has been felt to be sufficiently diagnostic to eliminate the need for brain biopsy. Survival of AIDS-associated PML is poor with median survivals averaging just 6 months. However, as many as 10% of AIDS patients with PML will have prolonged (>12 months) survival and partial recovery. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been demonstrated to have a salutary effect on survival.","['Berger, J R', 'Major, E O']","['Berger JR', 'Major EO']","['Department of Neurology, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington 40536-0284, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Neurol,Seminars in neurology,8111343,,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal']",89,2000/03/16 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/16 09:00'],"['2000/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Neurol. 1999;19(2):193-200. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1040837.,,['10.1055/s-2008-1040837 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated telomerase expression in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and correlated telomerase activity with conventional prognostic parameters. STUDY DESIGN: A consecutive series of patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing surgical salvage for persistent or progressive disease after failed radiation therapy. METHODS: Twenty patient samples of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and 20 adjacent histologically normal mucosal samples were assayed using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) method for detection of telomerase activity. The leukemic cell line, K562, acted as a positive control and the human fibroblast line, Hs21Fs, as a negative control. A sample was classified as telomerase positive when an RNase-sensitive hexameric repeat ladder was observed. Absence of laddering was considered a negative result. RESULTS: Seventeen of 20 (85%) tumor samples and 4 of 20 (20%) adjacent histologically normal samples were telomerase positive. No statistically significant difference was observed when densitometric readings were compared by T category, tumor grade, or site (by ANOVA). CONCLUSIONS: Although telomerase activity is present in laryngeal cancer, levels of activation do not correlate with conventional parameters used for prognostication. Our study indicates that the marker may be a useful adjunctive method in the diagnosis of malignancy after radiation failure.","['Curran, A J', 'Gullane, P J', 'Irish, J', 'Macmillan, C', 'Freeman, J', 'Kamel-Reid, S']","['Curran AJ', 'Gullane PJ', 'Irish J', 'Macmillan C', 'Freeman J', 'Kamel-Reid S']","['Department of Otolaryngology, The Toronto Hospital/Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Laryngoscope,The Laryngoscope,8607378,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*enzymology/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Densitometry', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Laryngeal Mucosa/enzymology', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Ribonucleases/genetics', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/*genetics']",,2000/03/16 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/03/16 09:00'],"['2000/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Laryngoscope. 2000 Mar;110(3 Pt 1):391-6. doi: 10.1097/00005537-200003000-00011.,,['10.1097/00005537-200003000-00011 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prerequisits to induce chimerism are immuno-suppression, myeloablation, or severe immunodeficiency of the recipients on the one side and donor originated immuno-hematopoietic cells in the graft on the other. The pathologic or special immunogenetic conditions to establish chimerism are combined with bone marrow transplantation, transfusion, and various kinds of solid organ grafting. Different types of chimerism are known including complete, mixed and mosaic, or split chimerism. There are various methods used to detect the type of chimera state, depending on the immunogenetic differences between the donor and recipient. The induction of complete or mixed chimerism is first determinated by the effect of myeloablative therapy. The chimera state seems to be one of the leading factors to influence the course of the post-transplant period, the frequency and severity of GVHD, and the rate of relapse. However, the most important contribution of the chimeric state is in development of graft versus leukemia effect.

The presence of patient alloantibodies against donor antigens demonstrated by a positive crossmatch is a strong risk factor for graft rejection. The availability of matched donors for patients lacking a genotypically HLA-matched sibling has been greatly improved by the establishment of international registries of HLA-typed volunteer donors. The development of accurate and reproducible high-resolution DNA-based typing methods has significantly improved the prospects for identifying unrelated donors who are well matched with the patient for HLA.

Forty patients receiving transplants from unrelated donors were typed prospectively for HLA and non-HLA markers. Non-HLA markers near HLA-B (beta-block markers) and in the DRB1 introns (delta-block markers) were used to assess MHC match between donors and recipient. Patients whose donors were matched at the beta- and delta-blocks had improved event free survival (63%) compared to patients whose donors were mismatched at one or both blocks (25%) (p < 0.05). Patients whose donors were matched at the beta-block had significantly less severe acute graft versus host disease (p < 0.05). In order to investigate the basis for improved outcome block matching was correlated with HLA matching as determined by DNA sequencing. Beta-block matching was highly correlated with matching for exons 2 and 3 of HLA-B but less so for HLA-C. Delta-block matching was highly correlated with matching for exon 2 of HLA DRB1. It is concluded that matching for non-HLA markers in the MHC improves matching for HLA genes.

Microsatellite analysis was used to test whether this locus also is involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its prognostic relevance determined. METHODS: The authors analyzed 49 patients with adult ALL for deletions at the 13q14 locus using a battery of 6 microsatellite markers corresponding to this region (D13S260, STR257, D13S263, D13S153, D13S319, and AFMa301wb5). RESULTS: Five of the 49 adult ALL patients analyzed (10%) showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or deletions at 13q14. Similar to CLL, the significant minimal deletions appeared to be localized between D13S260 and AFMa301wb5 and did not involve the retinoblastoma or BRCA2 genes. Among newly diagnosed patients, LOH was associated with shorter survival (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the 13q14 gene, commonly deleted in CLL patients, also is deleted in some patients with adult ALL.

Clinical and biological parameters define prognostic categories and therapeutic approaches. For the majority of children with B-progenitor ALL, age (1-9 yrs) and white blood count (WBC<50,000) indicate standard risk disease; WBC>50,000 and age>9 yrs. define eligibility for high-risk protocols. Infants (<1 yr. old) are high-risk, frequently associated with chromosomal t(4;11) translocation and extramedullary disease. T-cell immunophenotype is usually associated with clinical high-risk features, including older age, high WBC, and extramedullary disease. T-cell immunophenotype is usually associated with clinical high-risk features, including older age, high WBC, and extramedullary disease. Current regimens include induction chemotherapy, consolidation (often including high-dose systemic methotrexate, MTX), and continuation phases; intensification or reinduction is incorporated for high-risk disease. Preventive CNS therapy is a critical component of therapy. Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy (MTX +/- cytosine-arabinoside and hydrocortisone) and systemic agents provide adequate CNS therapy in standard risk patients. The ""threshold"" for using preventive cranial irradiation (Crl, 18 Gy) varies among protocols, but systematically includes those with T-cell ALL and WBS>50,000; other criteria may include B-progenitor ALL with WBC>100,000,philadelphia chromosome positive ALL, residual marrow disease at day 7, or male gender, For the 5% of children with CNS leukemia at diagnosis (defined as CSF with 5 or greater WBC/uL and positive cytology), Crl is administered at does of 18 to 24 Gy. Recent series show a CNS relapse rate approximating 5% Reinduction chemotherapy, IT therapy, and subsequent craniospinal irradiation ( typically 24, Gy Crl, 15 Gy spine) achieve durable secondary disease control in greater than 60% of cases with isolated CNS relapse. High-dose systemic MTX has virtually eliminated testicular relapse. CNS toxicities (including leukoencephalopathy) relate to systemic and IT MTX as well as Crl. Late neuropsychologicral data following Crl at 18 Gy show little intellectual deficit compared with children receiving MTX- based preventive therapy alone. Neuroendocrine dysfunction is apparent in long-term survivors following Crl at 24 Gy. The relative efficacy and toxicities of Crl versus more intensive MTX-based regimens are yet controversial.

However, the question of the ""best"" TBI schedule has not been answered. Available radiobiological and clinical data show that (1) the role of fractionation (or dose rate) on leukemia cell killing may vary with the leukemia type. Acute myeloid leukemia cells have been found to be insensitive or only slightly sensitive to fractionation, whereas chronic myeloid leukemia cells appear to be sensitive. Data are still controversial for acute lymphocytic leukemia and the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas; (2) the immunosuppressive effect of TBI is very fractionation sensitive; and (3) most normal tissues at risk are also highly sensitive to fractionation and dose rate. These data permit some cautious adaptations of the TBI schemes to the type of leukemia, use of T-cell-depleted donor marrow, and potential normal tissue toxicity. However, we still lack data concerning the precise intrinsic and fractionation radiosensitivity of the leukemia/lymphoma of a given patient. Recent improvements in leukemia-cell cultures allowing the generation of dose survival curves and the study of in vitro radiation-induced apoptosis (mainly for lymphomas) may soon provide radiation oncologists with the data to allow further refinement and individualization of TBI schedules.","['Cosset', 'Socie', 'Girinsky', 'Dubray', 'Fourquet', 'Gluckman']","['Cosset JM', 'Socie G', 'Girinsky T', 'Dubray B', 'Fourquet A', 'Gluckman E']","[""Departement d'Oncologie Radiotherapique, Institut Curie, Paris, France""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Radiat Oncol,Seminars in radiation oncology,9202882,,,,,1995/10/01 00:00,2000/03/16 00:00,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/16 00:00 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Radiat Oncol. 1995 Oct;5(4):301-315. doi: 10.1054/SRAO00500301.,,"['10.1054/SRAO00500301 [doi]', '00500301 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased MVD in primary breast cancers appears to adversely affect disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with breast cancer. However, the clinical implications of angiogenesis in breast cancer metastases have not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to compare intratumoral MVD in primary breast cancer tissues with MVD in axillary lymph node metastases and to evaluate the relationships among primary- and metastatic-tumor MVD, disease-free survival, and overall survival in patients with lymph node-positive, stage II breast cancer who were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy in Cancer and Leukemia Group B Protocol 8082. METHODS: Immunostaining for factor VIII-related antigen was performed on tissue sections from 47 primary tumors and 91 axillary lymph nodes containing metastases from 110 patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer. Sections were examined for the presence or absence of focal areas of relatively intense neovascularization (vascular hot spots), and a quantitative assessment of intratumoral MVD was performed. RESULTS: The presence of vascular hot spots in axillary lymph node metastases, but not primary breast cancers, was associated with statistically significantly decreased disease-free survival (P =.006) and overall survival (P =.004) by univariate analysis. Similarly, increased MVD in metastases, but not in primary tumors, was statistically significantly associated with diminished overall survival in these patients (P =.02). In multivariate analysis, the number of positive axillary lymph nodes and the presence of vascular hot spots in axillary lymph node metastases predicted decreased disease-free survival (P =.0001 and.02, respectively) and overall survival (P =.0001 and.007, respectively). All P values were two-sided. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that assessing neovascularization in axillary lymph node metastases may provide clinically useful information regarding survival in patients with primary breast cancer.","['Guidi, A J', 'Berry, D A', 'Broadwater, G', 'Perloff, M', 'Norton, L', 'Barcos, M P', 'Hayes, D F']","['Guidi AJ', 'Berry DA', 'Broadwater G', 'Perloff M', 'Norton L', 'Barcos MP', 'Hayes DF']","['North Shore Medical Center, Salem, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Axilla', 'Breast Neoplasms/*blood supply/*pathology/therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/blood supply/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/03/16 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/16 09:00'],"['2000/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2000 Mar 15;92(6):486-92. doi: 10.1093/jnci/92.6.486.,,['10.1093/jnci/92.6.486 [doi]'],,"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of action of Tcl1 is unknown. Because the virus containing the v-akt oncogene causes T-cell lymphoma in mice and Akt is a key player in transduction of antiapoptotic and proliferative signals in T-cells, we investigated whether Akt and Tcl1 function in the same pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that endogenous Akt1 and Tcl1 physically interact in the T-cell leukemia cell line SupT11; both proteins also interact when cotransfected into 293 cells. Using several AKT1 constructs in cotransfection experiments, we determined that this interaction occurs through the pleckstrin homology domain of the Akt1 protein. We further demonstrated that, in 293 cells transfected with TCL1, the endogenous Akt1 bound to Tcl1 is 5-10 times more active compared with Akt1 not bound to Tcl1. The intracellular localization of Tcl1 and Akt1 in mouse fibroblasts was investigated by immunofluorescence. When transfected alone, Akt1 was found only in cytoplasm whereas Tcl1 was localized in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Interestingly, Akt1 was also found in the nucleus when AKT1 was cotransfected with TCL1, suggesting that Tcl1 promotes the transport of Akt1 to the nucleus. These findings were supported by the intracellular localization of Akt1 or Tcl1 when Tcl1 or Akt1, respectively, were confined to the specific cellular compartments. Thus, we demonstrate that Tcl1 is a cofactor of Akt1 that enhances Akt1 kinase activity and promotes its nuclear transport.","['Pekarsky, Y', 'Koval, A', 'Hallas, C', 'Bichi, R', 'Tresini, M', 'Malstrom, S', 'Russo, G', 'Tsichlis, P', 'Croce, C M']","['Pekarsky Y', 'Koval A', 'Hallas C', 'Bichi R', 'Tresini M', 'Malstrom S', 'Russo G', 'Tsichlis P', 'Croce CM']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",,2000/03/15 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/15 09:00'],"['2000/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Mar 28;97(7):3028-33. doi: 10.1073/pnas.040557697.,,"['10.1073/pnas.040557697 [doi]', '040557697 [pii]']",,"['R01CA57436/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'D.102/Telethon/Italy', 'CA76259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA076259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA057436/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC16186,,,,,,,,,,,

Utilization of recombinatory PCR allowed the insertion of very subtle nucleotide changes resulting in a series of restriction site polymorphisms in the two retroviral vectors.

Our first aim was to clarify whether the therapeutic application of 188Re-MAb against nonspecific cross-reacting antigen 95 (NCA-95) can be predicted from biokinetic data derived from 99mTc-labeled NCA-95. Our second aim was to show that a radiation absorbed dose of > or =12 Gy in the bone marrow can be achieved using 188Re-MAb. METHODS: Dosimetric data were obtained for both radiotracers from multiple planar whole-body scans (double-head gamma camera), blood samples, and urine measurements from 12 patients with advanced leukemia. Radiation absorbed doses were calculated using MIRDOSE 3 software. RESULTS: Radiation absorbed doses to bone marrow, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney were 2.24, 0.50, 1.93, 0.05, and 0.90 mGy/MBq, respectively, using 99mTc-MAb and 1.45, 0.43, 1.32, 0.07, and 0.71 mGy/MBq, respectively, using 188Re-MAb. These differences were statistically significant for bone marrow, spleen, and kidney. The main differences were less accumulation of 188Re-MAb in bone marrow (31%+/-13% compared with 52%+/-13%) and faster elimination through urine (25%+/-3% compared with 15%+/-5% after 24 h). On the basis of these data, a mean marrow dose of 14+/-7 Gy was achieved in 12 patients suffering from leukemia after application of approximately 10+/-2 GBq 188Re-MAb. CONCLUSION: Myeloablative radiation absorbed doses can easily be achieved using 188Re-MAb. 99mTc- and 188Re-MAb showed similar whole-body distributions. However, direct prediction of radiation absorbed doses from the 99mTc-MAb, assuming identical biokinetic behavior, is not valid for the 188Re-MAb in a single patient. Therefore, individual dosimetry using 188Re-MAb is needed to calculate therapeutic activity.","['Kotzerke, J', 'Glatting, G', 'Seitz, U', 'Rentschler, M', 'Neumaier, B', 'Bunjes, D', 'Duncker, C', 'Dohr, D', 'Bergmann, L', 'Reske, S N']","['Kotzerke J', 'Glatting G', 'Seitz U', 'Rentschler M', 'Neumaier B', 'Bunjes D', 'Duncker C', 'Dohr D', 'Bergmann L', 'Reske SN']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '7440-15-5 (Rhenium)', '7440-26-8 (Technetium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phantoms, Imaging', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Radiometry', 'Rhenium/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Technetium/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Tissue Distribution', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",,2000/03/15 00:00,2000/03/15 00:01,['2000/03/15 00:00'],"['2000/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2000 Mar;41(3):531-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HYPOTHESIS: Exposure to cosmic radiation and other physical or chemical agents may pose health risks for flight personnel. METHODS: We performed an exhaustive search for published and unpublished cohort studies of flight personnel from 1986-98. We combined relative risks (RR) for selected causes from four mortality and/or incidence studies of pilots and two incidence studies of flight attendants, using standard meta-analytic methods. Heterogeneity among the combined studies was explored and adjustments were made for possible confounding by socioeconomic status (SES), where indicated, using correction factors from published studies. RESULTS: SES-adjusted combined RRs were elevated (>1.2) among male pilots for mortality from melanoma 11.97 (95%, CI: 1.02-3.82)] and brain cancer [1.49 (0.89-2.20)], and for cancer incidence of the prostate [1.65 (1.19-2.29)] and the brain [1.74 (0.87-3.30)]. Among female flight attendants, increases were seen for incidence of all cancers [1.29 (0.98-1.70)], melanoma [11.54 (0.83-2.87)], and breast cancer [1.35 (1.00-1.83)]. CONCLUSIONS: Flight personnel appear to be at increased risk for several types of cancer. Both occupational exposures and well-established non-occupational risk factors may contribute to this increased risk. To better control for confounding factors and to identify exposures potentially amenable to preventive measures, future studies should compare risks within cohorts by flight routes, work history, and exposure to cosmic and UV radiation, electromagnetic fields, and chemical substances.","['Ballard, T', 'Lagorio, S', 'De Angelis, G', 'Verdecchia, A']","['Ballard T', 'Lagorio S', 'De Angelis G', 'Verdecchia A']","['Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Laboratorio di Igiene Ambientale, Rome, Italy. ballard@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Aviat Space Environ Med,"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",7501714,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Aircraft', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Military Personnel', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Risk Assessment']",,2000/03/15 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/15 09:00'],"['2000/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Aviat Space Environ Med. 2000 Mar;71(3):216-24.,,,,,['Aviat Space Environ Med 2000 Dec;71(12):1262'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the hemopoietic compartments, stromal cells were responsible for the biotransformation of doxorubicin. The capability of the SR-4987 established stromal cell line to metabolize doxorubicin was higher than that of primary cultures of hepatocytes and bone marrow, and the highest activity was concentrated in the microsomes.

The cytokine receptor class I superfamily, characterized by structural homology in the extracellular domain, includes receptors for many interleukins and hematopoietic growth factors, but also those of growth hormone, leptin, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). The receptors for interferons are structurally distinct and have therefore been categorized separately (class II cytokine receptors). The discovery of the JAK/STAT pathway in the early 1990s has been an important step forward in deciphering cytokine mediated signaling. This pathway connects activation of the receptor complexes directly to transcription of genes. Studies of humans and mice, deficient for one of the JAKs or STATs, have revealed crucial roles of these molecules in embryonic development, blood cell formation and immune responses. In addition, recent studies have revealed some of the mechanisms that control the activation of the JAKs and STATs, which contribute to signal intensity and specificity. In this review we will summarize these recent insights and discuss their implications for a variety of pathological conditions.","['Touw, I P', 'De Koning, J P', 'Ward, A C', 'Hermans, M H']","['Touw IP', 'De Koning JP', 'Ward AC', 'Hermans MH']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam (Room 1314), PO Box 1738, 3000DR, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. touw@hema.fgg.eur.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology']",113,2000/03/15 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/03/15 09:00'],"['2000/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2000 Feb 25;160(1-2):1-9. doi: 10.1016/s0303-7207(99)00206-3.,,"['S0303-7207(99)00206-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0303-7207(99)00206-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, cultured endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells express low, approximately equal amounts of HLA-A, -B, and -C mRNAs, whereas donor-matched, EBV transformed B cells express much more HLA-B mRNA, suggesting that cell type dependent regulation underlies differential locus expression. Finally, expression of HLA class I molecules on the cell surface correlates with total HLA mRNAs but not with mRNAs encoded by any one locus.

Severe neuropsychiatric toxicity has been described in patients receiving rIFNalpha2b, although the frequency of and the risk factors for developing this toxicity are not well described. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors for the development of severe neuropsychiatric toxicity in CML patients receiving rIFNalpha2b-based therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a prospective cohort of 91 Philadelphia chromosome-positive, previously untreated, chronic-phase CML patients treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9013, a phase II trial of rIFNalpha2b plus cytarabine, the following were recorded at baseline: age, sex, race, pretreatment history of neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis, spleen size, blood counts, and peripheral blast count. Best response to treatment, rIFNalpha2b cumulative dose, dose duration, and dose-intensity were recorded during follow-up. Severe neuropsychiatric toxicity was defined as grade 3 or 4 events, according to CALGB expanded common toxicity criteria. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify variables that were associated with the development of severe neuropsychiatric toxicity. RESULTS: Severe neuropsychiatric toxicity developed in 22 patients (24.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15.2% to 32.8%). Toxicity resolved after withdrawal of treatment in all patients. Five of six patients developed recurrence of symptoms with rechallenge. Twelve (63%) of 19 patients with a pretreatment neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis developed severe neuropsychiatric toxicity, as compared with 10 (14%) of 72 patients without a pretreatment neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis (P =.001), resulting in a relative risk of 4. 55 (95% CI, 2.33 to 8.88) for developing severe neuropsychiatric toxicity. No other variables were independently associated with the development of neuropsychiatric toxicity. CONCLUSION: CML patients with a pretreatment history of a neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis are at significantly increased risk of developing severe neuropsychiatric toxicity during therapy with rIFNalpha2b plus cytarabine. Monitoring for neuropsychiatric symptoms and avoiding rechallenge are recommended measures for such patients receiving rIFNalpha2b-based therapy.","['Hensley, M L', 'Peterson, B', 'Silver, R T', 'Larson, R A', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Szatrowski, T P']","['Hensley ML', 'Peterson B', 'Silver RT', 'Larson RA', 'Schiffer CA', 'Szatrowski TP']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10021, USA. hensleym@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*chemically induced', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*etiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors']",,2000/03/15 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/15 09:00'],"['2000/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Mar;18(6):1301-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.6.1301.,,['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.6.1301 [doi]'],,"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No differences were found regarding age, sex, WBC and platelet counts, incidence of coagulopathy, hemoglobin and fibrinogen levels, promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor (PML/RAR) alpha fusion type, or complete remission (CR) rate in the comparison of the CD56(+) and CD56(-) populations. Conversely, compared with patients who were CD56(-), patients with CD56(+) APL had shorter CR duration (P =.04) and overall survival (P =.002). In the multivariate analysis, CD56 positivity and initial WBC count greater than 10 x 10(9) cells/L retained statistical significance in overall survival (P =.04 and P =.02, respectively). CONCLUSION: The expression of CD56 is significantly associated with inferior CR duration and survival in patients with APL who were treated with modern frontline treatment that included ATRA and simultaneous chemotherapy. Combined with other well-established prognostic factors such as WBC count, CD56 expression at diagnosis might be used to build prognostic scores for risk-adapted therapy in APL.","['Ferrara, F', 'Morabito, F', 'Martino, B', 'Specchia, G', 'Liso, V', 'Nobile, F', 'Boccuni, P', 'Di Noto, R', 'Pane, F', 'Annunziata, M', 'Schiavone, E M', 'De Simone, M', 'Guglielmi, C', 'Del Vecchio, L', 'Lo Coco, F']","['Ferrara F', 'Morabito F', 'Martino B', 'Specchia G', 'Liso V', 'Nobile F', 'Boccuni P', 'Di Noto R', 'Pane F', 'Annunziata M', 'Schiavone EM', 'De Simone M', 'Guglielmi C', 'Del Vecchio L', 'Lo Coco F']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Sezione TERE, Servizio di Immunoematologia, Ospedale Cardarelli, Naples, Italy. ferrara@itb.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'CD56 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,2000/03/15 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/15 09:00'],"['2000/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Mar;18(6):1295-300. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.6.1295.,,['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.6.1295 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six hundred fifty-one eligible patients were entered onto the study. Vincristine, prednisone, and asparaginase were used for remission induction therapy. Patients were randomized to receive intensification with IV MTX 1,000 mg/m(2) plus IV MP 1,000 mg/m(2) (regimen A) or IV MTX 1,000 mg/m(2) alone (regimen C). Twelve courses were administered at 2-week intervals. Triple intrathecal therapy was used for CNS prophylaxis. Continuation therapy included standard oral MP, weekly MTX, and triple intrathecal therapy every 12 weeks for 2 years. RESULTS: Six hundred forty-five patients (99.1%) achieved remission. Three hundred twenty-five were assigned to regimen A and 320 to regimen C. The estimated 4-year overall continuous complete remission for patients treated with regimen A is 82.1% (SE = 2.4%) and for regimen C is 82.2% (SE = 2.6%; P =.5). No significant difference in overall outcome was shown by sex or race. Serious grade 3/4 neurotoxicity, principally characterized by seizures, was observed in 7.6% of patients treated with either regimen. CONCLUSION: Intensification with 12 courses of IV MTX is an effective therapy for prevention of relapse in children with B-precursor ALL who are at lower risk for relapse but may be associated with an increased risk for neurotoxicity. Prolonged infusions of MP combined with IV MTX did not provide apparent advantage.","['Mahoney, D H Jr', 'Shuster, J J', 'Nitschke, R', 'Lauer, S', 'Steuber, C P', 'Camitta, B']","['Mahoney DH Jr', 'Shuster JJ', 'Nitschke R', 'Lauer S', 'Steuber CP', 'Camitta B']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. dmahoney@msmail.his.tch.tmc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis']",,2000/03/15 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/15 09:00'],"['2000/03/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Mar;18(6):1285-94. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.6.1285.,,['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.6.1285 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our current experiments have compared the expression and activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in control cells with cells undergoing differentiation which has been induced by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). When the cultures were initiated with stationary phase cells and DMSO was added at the time of seeding, PI 3-kinase activity was stimulated in both treated and control cells during the first 3 h from seeding. This event appears to be a rate limiting step in commitment since pretreatment of cells with 10 microM LY294002 or down-regulation of p85 expression prior to adding DMSO completely prevents commitment to erythropoiesis. Accordingly, PI 3-kinase inhibition during the commitment period prevents DNA-binding of the transcription factor GATA-1, essential for erythroid differentiation. However, once cells are committed to differentiate, PI 3-kinase activity and expression dramatically decreases along with the differentiation programme, to become barely detectable after 96 h. Remarkably, LY294002 treatment leads to accumulation of cell in G1 phase and prevents DMSO-dependent cyclin D3 induction. Based on these data, we suggest that PI 3-kinase is rate limiting for the completion of the first round cycle of cell division required for initiation of erythrocytic differentiation. On the other hand, the late decrease of PI 3-kinase associated with the differentiation process seems to be part of the programmed shut off of genes not needed in mature erythrocytes.","['Bavelloni, A', 'Faenza, I', 'Aluigi, M', 'Ferri, A', 'Toker, A', 'Maraldi, N M', 'Marmiroli, S']","['Bavelloni A', 'Faenza I', 'Aluigi M', 'Ferri A', 'Toker A', 'Maraldi NM', 'Marmiroli S']","['Cell Biology Laboratory I.O.R., Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wortmannin']",,2000/03/14 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/03/14 09:00'],"['2000/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2000 Jan;7(1):112-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400591.,,['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400591 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations suggest that apoptosis in response to deregulated gene expression may represent a natural brake to tumour development. The pathways by which Myc induces apoptosis are as yet poorly characterised although recent observations on rat fibroblasts over-expressing Myc have demonstrated a requirement for the Fas pathway. To investigate the role of Fas in Myc-induced lymphomagenesis we backcrossed CD2-myc mice onto an lpr background. Rates of tumour development and phenotypic properties, including levels of apoptosis were indistinguishable from CD2-myc controls. Further, tumour cell lines derived from mice expressing a regulatable form of Myc showed inducible apoptosis at similar rates regardless of their lpr genotype. These results show that activation of c-myc and loss of Fas do not collaborate in T lymphoma development and that Myc-induced apoptosis in T-cells occurs by Fas-independent pathways.","['Cameron, E R', 'Morton, J', 'Johnston, C J', 'Irvine, J', 'Bell, M', 'Onions, D E', 'Neil, J C', 'Campbell, M', 'Blyth, K']","['Cameron ER', 'Morton J', 'Johnston CJ', 'Irvine J', 'Bell M', 'Onions DE', 'Neil JC', 'Campbell M', 'Blyth K']","['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Glasgow University Veterinary School, Bearsden Road, Glasgow, G61 1QH, UK.

Here, we have investigated the function of Myb proteins in regulating these key cellular decisions, using the cell line FDCP-mix A4 as a model of early hematopoiesis. High concentrations of IL-3 in these cells favour self-renewal over differentiation and apoptosis. However when endogenous Myb activity was inhibited with an inducible dominant interfering protein, self-renewal was replaced by apoptosis and differentiation. Differentiation was to granulocytes and monocyte/macrophages and was closely associated with a G1-S phase block in the cell cycle. As for normal hematopoiesis, cytokine-induced terminal differentiation of FDCP-mix cells is associated with concomitant proliferation prior to its completion. However, when Myb activity was inhibited during this process, proliferation and survival were both reduced, resulting in a much lower yield of mature cells. These results indicate multiple cellular roles of Myb proteins during normal hematopoiesis.","['White, J R', 'Weston, K']","['White JR', 'Weston K']","['CRC Centre for Cell and Molecular Biology, Institute of Cancer Research, London SW3 6JB, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Transfection']",,2000/03/14 00:00,2000/03/14 00:01,['2000/03/14 00:00'],"['2000/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Feb 24;19(9):1196-205. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203394.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1203394 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the role of autologous transplantation in 17 patients with multiple myeloma over 65 years at our centre using a matched pair analysis with younger patients. The median age of this cohort of patients over 65 years was 67 years (65-74) and their outcome and transplant-related morbidity was compared with 17 younger pair mates with a median age of 55 years (31-64). Sixteen patients received high-dose melphalan, and one received busulphan with autologous stem cell rescue. The high-dose therapy was well tolerated in both elderly patients and the matched pairs, with comparable time to recover neutrophils and platelets. Treatment-related mortality also did not differ significantly in both the groups. Median overall survival of the elderly patients was 3.59 years similar to 3.01 years of the pair mates (P = 0.92). Autologous stem cell transplantation after high-dose melphalan conditioning was equally well tolerated in groups of patients above and below 65 years. There was no difference in relapse rate, OS and myelotoxicity in both the groups. These findings suggest that advanced age should not be an exclusion criterion from autologous transplant programmes.

The blood volume processed was the higher of 200% donor blood volume or 10 liters. The total nucleated cell (TNC) yields from PBSC were 1.1- to 4.3-fold higher than BM (median 7.0 vs 3.1 x 10(8)/kg, P < 0.0001). Although BM contained a higher proportion of CD34+cells (1.3% vs 0.7%, P < 0. 0001) and a comparable proportion of CD3+ cells (median 29% vs 26%, P = 0.4), the absolute numbers of CD34+ and CD3+ cells and their subsets were several times higher in PBSC. There was a poor correlation between BM and PBSC CD34 and TNC numbers, but a significant correlation between BM and PBSC CD3 numbers. Only five of 40 BM harvests contained >/=2 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg compared with 35 of 40 PBSC harvests (P < 0.0001). We conclude that the numbers of progenitor and immunocompetent cells in PBSC are several times higher than in BM. It is possible to collect adequate numbers of progenitor cells from blood after lenograstim stimulation more frequently than from marrow, and donors yielding low quantities of progenitor cells from BM usually deliver better quantities from PBSC.

It is expected that these components in green tea exhibit low toxicity and that there are few side effects of drinking green tea in combination with an antitumor agent. We think that the intake of a favorite beverage favors a positive mental attitude of a patient and increases the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic index, and that this efficacy is useful for improving the quality of life on cancer chemotherapy. In DOX resistant P388 leukemia cell bearing mice theanine increased the DOX induced efficacy through an increase in the DOX concentrations in the tumors. Theanine attacked the same transport process for DOX in both types of cells, elevated the DOX concentration and increased the DOX induced antitumor activity.","['Sadzuka, Y', 'Sugiyama, T', 'Sonobe, T']","['Sadzuka Y', 'Sugiyama T', 'Sonobe T']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Shizuoka, Japan. sadzuka@ys7.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Tea)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8021PR16QO (theanine)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'OBD445WZ5P (Theobromine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Caffeine/administration & dosage', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Catechin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage', 'Glutamates/administration & dosage', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Phytotherapy', 'Tea/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Theobromine/administration & dosage', 'Verapamil/administration & dosage']",,2000/03/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/14 09:00'],"['2000/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2000 Apr 3;114(1-3):155-62. doi: 10.1016/s0378-4274(99)00290-8.,,"['S0378427499002908 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-4274(99)00290-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 3-PGDH gene has a predicted 533 amino acid open reading frame, encoding a 56.8kDa protein that shares 94.0% similarity with rat-liver 3-PGDH. Two different transcripts corresponding to 3-PGDH mRNA were detected in human normal tissues. A dominant 2.1kb transcript was expressed at high levels in prostate, testis, ovary, brain, liver, kidney, and pancreas, and weakly expressed in thymus, colon, and heart. A 710bp transcript also appeared as a weaker band where the 2.1kb mRNA was expressed, and it was more significant than the 2.1kb mRNA in heart and skeletal muscle. The TPA-induced monocytic differentiation of U937, which also resulted in growth arrest, abruptly downregulated the expression of 3-PGDH. Removal of TPA restored cell growth through the retrodifferentiation process and subsequent expression of 3-PGDH. The 3-PGDH mRNA was markedly expressed in human leukemias, lymphoma Sup-T1, colon adenocarcinoma COLO 320DM, epitheloid carcinoma HeLa S3, and murine lymphoma BW5147.G.1.4, but not in human leukemia K562.

It is lost during in vitro culture and can be reinduced by IL-4, albeit to a lower extent than in normal B cells. To elucidate the events controlling CD23 expression in B-CLL cells, the IL-4 mediated induction of STAT6 was investigated. Western-blot analysis demonstrated that B-CLL cells contain comparable amounts of STAT6. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed no constitutive nuclear translocation of STAT6. IL-4 induced the translocation of STAT6 in B-CLL cells from all 22 patients investigated. The increase was transient, dose and time dependent without a distinct difference between B-CLL cells and non-malignant B cells. However, in contrast to normal B lymphocytes no strict correlation between CD23 expression and STAT6 activation was detected in B-CLL. Therefore further signalling pathways and transcription factors in addition to STAT6 have to be activated to explain the high expression of CD23 in B-CLL cells. For example, STAT1 which is induced by IFN-gamma and binds to the classical STAT6 site. It might be involved in the strong induction of CD23 on B-CLL cells after cotreatment with IL-4 and IFN-gamma, while in non-malignant B lymphocytes IFN-gamma leads to a reduction of IL-4 mediated CD23 expression.","['Kneitz, C', 'Goller, M', 'Seggewiss, R', 'Yaman, A', 'Serfling, E', 'Tony, H P']","['Kneitz C', 'Goller M', 'Seggewiss R', 'Yaman A', 'Serfling E', 'Tony HP']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, University of Wurzburg, Klinikstr. 6-8, D-97070, Wurzburg, Germany. christian.kneitz@mail.uni-wuerzburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'CD40 Ligand', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgE/*analysis', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*analysis/metabolism']",,2000/03/14 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/14 09:00'],"['2000/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Apr;24(4):331-7. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00191-5.,,"['S0145212699001915 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00191-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using normal human monocytes stimulated with IL-3, GM-CSF, LPS or combinations of growth factor and LPS, we studied their cytotoxic activity against leukaemic cell-lines and primary AML blasts. IL-3 like GM-CSF, augmented the expression and secretion of TNF but did not prime for further expression and secretion of TNF in response to LPS.

But its relevance to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) remains to be elucidated. To better understand the role of pRB in ATL, we examined the expression and phosphorylation status of pRB in three ATL cell lines and 43 clinical samples, eight peripheral blood samples and 35 lymph node samples, from patients with ATL by Western blotting. In addition, 30 lymph node sections were also evaluated immunohistochemically. As a result, Western blotting analysis revealed that the pRB in the ATL cell lines was in the hyperphosphorylated, but that in 39 of 43 clinical samples, pRB was exclusively in the hypophosphorylated form. Four peripheral blood samples were negative for pRB. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the lymph nodes of all of 30 patients tested were positive for pRB at various staining levels, weak, mild, and strong. But weak expression may be essentially negative for pRB function. Patients with weak pRB expression in their lymph nodes lived significantly shorter lives than those with mild expression. Surprisingly, patients with strong expression also showed a significantly worse prognosis than those with mild expression. Although only the absence of pRB expression was considered previously to be indicative of RB functional loss, it has been reported recently that overexpression of pRB is correlated with progression of disease in patients with advanced bladder carcinoma or follicular lymphoma. These findings indicate that pRB controls tumor proliferation not only as a cell cycle regulator but also by other mechanisms, possibly through the inhibition of apoptosis, as suggested by recent findings in an osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2. In conclusion, pRB may play an essential role in its hypophosphorylated form for progression of ATL, as well as a cell cycle promoter in hyperphosphorylated or negative/excessive reduced form.","['Nakayama, K', 'Yamada, Y', 'Koji, T', 'Hayashi, T', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Kamihira, S']","['Nakayama K', 'Yamada Y', 'Koji T', 'Hayashi T', 'Tomonaga M', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism']",,2000/03/14 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/14 09:00'],"['2000/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Apr;24(4):299-305. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00186-1.,,"['S0145212699001861 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00186-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, detailed studies of the various steps involved during this evolution are difficult to perform, thereby making the study of cell lines that contain the transposed genes BCR-ABL, especially those of human origin, an important focus. In this analysis we investigated the human megakaryoblastic cell line MO7e and its subline transfected with BCR-ABL, MO7e/p210. Initial studies demonstrated that the phenotype of the MO7e line was consistent with a megakaryocytic lineage as originally described and was growth factor dependent in liquid culture. The MO7e/p210 subline, however, was growth factor independent and could be further separated into two distinct sublines based on expression of glycophorin A using the monoclonal antibody R10. The subline R10 negative (R10-) was similar to the parent line MO7e but R10 positive (R10+) cells had a distinct erythroid phenotype. In addition, the R10- and R10+ sublines demonstrated strikingly different colony morphology when cultured in semisolid medium. Furthermore, R10+ cells had additional chromosomal abnormalities not detected in the R10- population. These results demonstrate that the insertion of the BCR-ABL in this human leukemia cell line resulted in two distinct subpopulations of cells, each now growth factor independent, but one with a phenotype and karyotype identical to the parent cell line and the other with a different phenotype and additional chromosomal abnormalities. These two subpopulations derived from the MO7e/p210 transfected cell line may prove useful in further understanding the multistep events that occur in the progression of this disease.","['Berman, E', 'Jhanwar, S', 'McBride, M', 'Strife, A', 'Wisniewski, D', 'Lambek, C', 'Clarkson, B']","['Berman E', 'Jhanwar S', 'McBride M', 'Strife A', 'Wisniewski D', 'Lambek C', 'Clarkson B']","['Department of Medicine, The Laboratory of Hematopoietic Cell Kinetics, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/14 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/14 09:00'],"['2000/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Apr;24(4):289-97. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00179-4.,,"['S0145212699001794 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00179-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether the Fas pathway is involved in etoposide-induced apoptosis in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Both of the studied subclones expressed the Fas receptor (FasR), but only the ER cell line expressed the Fas ligand (FasL). Etoposide caused an increase in the mean fluorescence intensity of FasR in both subclones, and an induction of FasL in the ES subclone. However, no change in the numbers of apoptotic cells induced by etoposide was observed when FasR was blocked by an antagonist anti-Fas antibody, nor was an agonist anti-Fas antibody alone cytotoxic to the subclones or enhanced the cytotoxic effect of etoposide. The Fas-resistant phenotype of the AML cells was converted to a Fas-sensitive one by cycloheximide (CHX) suggesting the presence of an inhibitory protein of the Fas pathway in the cells.

Previously we have shown that the tyrosine kinase Lyn associates with the erythropoietin receptor and is essential for hemoglobin synthesis in three erythroleukemic cell lines. To understand Lyn signaling events in erythroid cells, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to analyze interactions with other proteins. Here we show that the hemopoietic-specific protein HS1 interacted directly with the SH3 domain of Lyn, via its proline-rich region. A truncated HS1, bearing the Lyn-binding domain, was introduced into J2E erythroleukemic cells to determine the impact upon responsiveness to erythropoietin. Truncated HS1 had a striking effect on the phenotype of the J2E line-the cells were smaller, more basophilic than the parental proerythoblastoid cells and had fewer surface erythropoietin receptors. Moreover, basal and erythropoietin-induced proliferation and differentiation were markedly suppressed. The inability of cells containing the truncated HS1 to differentiate may be a consequence of markedly reduced levels of Lyn and GATA-1. In addition, erythropoietin stimulation of these cells resulted in rapid, endosome-mediated degradation of endogenous HS1. The truncated HS1 also suppressed the development of erythroid colonies from fetal liver cells. These data show that disrupting HS1 has profoundly influenced the ability of erythroid cells to terminally differentiate.","['Ingley, E', 'Sarna, M K', 'Beaumont, J G', 'Tilbrook, P A', 'Tsai, S', 'Takemoto, Y', 'Williams, J H', 'Klinken, S P']","['Ingley E', 'Sarna MK', 'Beaumont JG', 'Tilbrook PA', 'Tsai S', 'Takemoto Y', 'Williams JH', 'Klinken SP']","['Laboratory for Cancer Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, the University of Western Australia and Royal Perth Hospital, WA 6001, Western Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (HCLS1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'src Homology Domains', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",,2000/03/14 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/14 09:00'],"['2000/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Mar 17;275(11):7887-93. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.11.7887.,,"['10.1074/jbc.275.11.7887 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)30291-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible involvement of ceramide in heat shock-induced apoptosis.,7668-76,"Ceramide has emerged as a lipid mediator in apoptosis induced by a variety of stresses. As we previously showed that the activation of AP-1, a nuclear transcription factor was indispensable to ceramide-induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells (Sawai, H., Okazaki, T., Yamamoto, H., Okano, H., Takeda, Y., Tashima, M., Sawada, H., Okuma, M., Ishikura, H., Umehara, H., and Domae, N. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 27326-27331), the role and mechanism of heat shock (HS)-increased c-jun expression in apoptosis was here investigated. HS increased morphological changes compatible with apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells, and induced ceramide generation and sphingomyelin hydrolysis with an increase of neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase activity. When HS failed to induce apoptosis in HS-resistant HL-60 cells, ceramide generation was not detected, suggesting that ceramide was involved in downstream signals required for HS-induced apoptosis. Both HS and N-acetylsphingosine (C(2)-ceramide) increased the expression of c-jun/c-fos mRNAs with the peak 2 h after treatment. When we examined whether the inhibition of c-jun expression by its antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS) blocked HS- or C(2)-ceramide-induced apoptosis, AS of c-jun gene inhibited apoptotic morphological changes and DNA fragmentation whereas did not sense oligodeoxynucleotides. Moreover, a synthetic tetrapeptide, acetyl-Asp-Met-Gln-Asp-aldehyde (DMQD-CHO), which inhibited the formation of active form of caspase-3 more efficiently than those of caspase-4, -6, -7, and -8, blocked both caspase-3 like activity, c-jun expression and apoptosis induced by HS or C(2)-ceramide, although DMQD-CHO did not affect HS-induced ceramide generation. These results suggested that the ceramide was generated through sphingomyelin hydrolysis by HS-activated neutral, magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase and that subsequent c-jun expression through activation of caspase-3 played a role in HS-induced HL-60 cell apoptosis.","['Kondo, T', 'Matsuda, T', 'Kitano, T', 'Takahashi, A', 'Tashima, M', 'Ishikura, H', 'Umehara, H', 'Domae, N', 'Uchiyama, T', 'Okazaki, T']","['Kondo T', 'Matsuda T', 'Kitano T', 'Takahashi A', 'Tashima M', 'Ishikura H', 'Umehara H', 'Domae N', 'Uchiyama T', 'Okazaki T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-Kawaramachi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-methionyl-glutaminyl-aspartyl-aldehyde)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heat-Shock Response/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/therapy', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism']",,2000/03/14 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/14 09:00'],"['2000/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Mar 17;275(11):7668-76. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.11.7668.,,"['10.1074/jbc.275.11.7668 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)30264-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little information is available concerning the structural motifs of the 1alpha, 25(OH)(2)D(3) molecule responsible for modulation of differentiation and apoptosis, however. We set out to synthesize singly dehydroxylated A-ring analogs of 19-nor-1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in a catalytic asymmetric fashion, and to investigate their biological activities in leukemia HL-60 cells. RESULTS: A series of singly dehydroxylated 19-nor-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) A-ring analogs were synthesized using a combinatiorial sequence of regioselective propiolate-ene reaction and catalytic asymmetric carbonyl-ene cyclization. Surprisingly, the analogs could be clearly divided into two categories; one group, bearing 1alpha-hydroxy or 3beta-hydroxy groups in the A-ring, were potent differentiators and the second group, bearing 1beta-hydroxy or 3alpha-hydroxy groups, were potent stimulators of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: We have clearly identified the structural motifs of 19-nor-1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) analogs responsible for differentiation and apoptosis in HL-60 cells.

In addition, LIF is required for the changes in neuropeptide expression that normally occur when the axons of sympathetic and sensory neurons are transected. We investigated whether LIF is also necessary for the initial inflammatory response that follows mechanical injury to the sciatic nerve and cerebral cortex of adult mice. We find that inflammatory cell infiltration into crushed sciatic nerve is significantly slower in LIF knock-out (KO) mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Similarly, the microglial and astroglial responses to surgical injury of the cortex are significantly slower in LIF KO mice compared with WT mice. Consistent with these in vivo results, LIF is chemotactic for peritoneal macrophages in a microchamber culture assay. Thus, LIF is a key regulator of neural injury in vivo, where it is produced by glia and can act directly on neurons, glia and inflammatory cells. We also find that the initial inflammatory response to cortical injury is diminished in interleukin (IL)-6 KO mice. Surprisingly, however, the inflammatory response in LIF-IL-6 double KO mice is very similar to that of the single KO mice, suggesting that these cytokines may act in series rather than in parallel in this response.","['Sugiura, S', 'Lahav, R', 'Han, J', 'Kou, S Y', 'Banner, L R', 'de Pablo, F', 'Patterson, P H']","['Sugiura S', 'Lahav R', 'Han J', 'Kou SY', 'Banner LR', 'de Pablo F', 'Patterson PH']","['Biology Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/pathology', 'Brain Injuries/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cerebral Cortex/injuries/metabolism/pathology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Encephalomyelitis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gliosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Growth Inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microglia/pathology', 'Neuritis/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Peripheral Nerve Injuries', 'Peripheral Nerves/*metabolism/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sciatic Nerve/injuries/pathology', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/*metabolism/pathology', 'Wounds, Stab']",,2000/03/11 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/03/11 09:00'],"['2000/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 2000 Feb;12(2):457-66. doi: 10.1046/j.1460-9568.2000.00922.x.,,"['ejn922 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1460-9568.2000.00922.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with PD-98059, an inhibitor of the ERK-kinase cascade, abolished bufalin-induced c-fos and IL-1 beta gene expressions, indicating that the ERK-kinase cascade mediates the induction of inflammatory cytokines by bufalin. Inhibition of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger by KB-R7943 and of protein kinase C (PKC) by Ro-31-8220 suppressed ERK activation and gene expressions of c-fos and IL-1 beta. These findings suggest that Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase inhibition by bufalin induces calcium influx and thereby activates PKC and ERK. In cells treated with an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinases, SB-203580, bufalin-mediated ERK activation became persistent and the induction of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha expressions was significantly augmented. These results suggest that cross talk in bufalin-mediated ERK activation is negatively regulated by endogenous p38 MAP kinase activations.","['Kurosawa, M', 'Numazawa, S', 'Tani, Y', 'Yoshida, T']","['Kurosawa M', 'Numazawa S', 'Tani Y', 'Yoshida T']","['Department of Biochemical Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo 142-8555, Japan. kuromasa@pharm.showa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Tretinoin, an oral vitamin A derivative that reverses abnormal differentiation in APL is now an essential component of first-line therapy for APL, replacing standard intravenous chemotherapy induction regimens. Other advances include an increased understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of oral chemotherapy agents such as etoposide and high dose busulfan, allowing for modifications or individualisation of administration regimens to enhance efficacy or minimise toxicity.

Published data support its use as part of adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer treatment regimens. Cyclophosphamide has generally been administered at a higher dose intensity when given orally compared with intravenous infusion. However, there is currently no evidence that oral cyclophosphamide is either more toxic or more or less effective than an equivalent dose of intravenous cyclophosphamide. There is evidence in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings that classical oral cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil (CMF) is more effective than intravenous CMF, possibly because of the greater dose intensity of classical CMF. Prolonged administration of oral cyclophosphamide up to high cumulative doses is associated with an elevated risk of a secondary leukaemia. The rates of chemotherapy-related amenorrhoea with oral cyclophosphamide are directly related to the total dose of cyclophosphamide administered and the patient's age.

This distinction has a biological logic in the context of the selective pressures for clonal emergence in different developmental and cellular contexts and has a major impact on curability. Most childhood leukaemias and some other mesenchymal stem cell tumours are of fetal origin and can metastasize without corruption of restraints on cell proliferation or bypassing apoptosis. In marked contrast to most invasive or metastatic epithelial carcinomas in adults, these former cancers then retain sensitivity to therapeutic apoptosis. Moreover, their abbreviated and less complex evolutionary status is associated with less genetic diversity and instability, minimising opportunity for clonal selection for resistance. A minority of leukaemias in children and a higher fraction in adults do, however, have genetic alterations that bypass cell cycle controls and apoptosis imposition. These are the 'bad news' genotypes. The cellular and molecular diversity of acute leukaemia impacts also on aetiology. Paediatric acute leukaemias can be initiated prenatally by illegitimate recombination and fusion gene formation in fetal haemopoiesis. For acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children, twin studies suggest that a secondary postnatal molecular event is also required. This may be promoted by an abnormal or delayed response to common infections. Even for a classic case of a cancer that is intrinsically curable by systematic chemotherapy i.e. childhood ALL, prevention may turn out to be the preferred option.","['Greaves, M']",['Greaves M'],"['LRF Centre for the Cell and Molecular Biology of Leukaemia, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, U.K. m.greaves@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diseases in Twins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Biology', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Twins, Monozygotic/genetics']",87,2000/03/11 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/11 09:00'],"['2000/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1999 Dec;35(14):1941-53. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(99)00296-8.,,"['S0959-8049(99)00296-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(99)00296-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To verify whether these GUG and CUG codons could be used as additional initiation codons of translation, two chimeric constructs were built for directing the synthesis of either Rex-CAT or Tax-CAT fusion proteins. In both cases, the CAT reporter sequence was inserted after the Tax AUG codon and in frame with either the Rex or Tax AUG codon. Under transient expression of these constructs, other proteins of higher molecular mass were synthesized in addition to the expected Rex-CAT and Tax-CAT proteins. The potential non-AUG initiation codons were exchanged for either an AUG codon or a non-initiation codon. This allowed us to demonstrate that the two GUG codons in frame with the Rex coding sequence, and only the second CUG in frame with the Tax coding sequence, were used as additional initiation codons. In HTLV-I infected cells, two Rex and one Tax additional proteins were detected that exhibited molecular mass compatible with the use of the two GUG and the second CUG as additional initiation codons of translation. Comparison of the HTLV-I proviral DNA sequence with that of other HTLV-related retroviruses revealed a striking conservation of the three non-AUG initiation codons, strongly suggesting their use for the synthesis of additional Rex and Tax proteins.","['Corcelette, S', 'Masse, T', 'Madjar, J J']","['Corcelette S', 'Masse T', 'Madjar JJ']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, INSERM U 369, Faculte de Medecine Lyon-RTH Laennec, 7 rue Guillaume Paradin, 69372 Lyon Cedex 08, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Codon, Initiator)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Codon, Initiator/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Products, rex/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection']",,2000/03/10 00:00,2000/05/08 00:00,['2000/03/10 00:00'],"['2000/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 00:00 [medline]', '2000/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2000 Apr 1;28(7):1625-34. doi: 10.1093/nar/28.7.1625.,,"['gkd278 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/28.7.1625 [doi]']",,,,,,PMC102795,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study is designed as a cohort study based on a population of 235,635 children born shortly after two different censuses in Sweden. The children were followed from birth to 14 years and cases of cancer were identified in the Swedish cancer registry. The parents' occupational titles in the censuses were linked to a job-exposure matrix with information about magnetic field levels in different occupations. The cancer incidence among the exposed was compared to that among the unexposed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. RESULTS: There was no association between childhood cancer and maternal occupational magnetic field exposure. Paternal exposure was associated with an increased risk of childhood leukemia, with a relative risk of 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.5) for exposures > or = 0.30 microT. A decreased risk was found for brain tumors (RR = 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-1.0). CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support previous findings of an increased risk of childhood brain tumors associated with paternal occupational exposure to magnetic fields. The finding for childhood leukemia has to be interpreted with caution.","['Feychting, M', 'Floderus, B', 'Ahlbom, A']","['Feychting M', 'Floderus B', 'Ahlbom A']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

The predictive performance of the GT MLA SAR model was similar to that of a Salmonella mutagenicity model containing the same number of chemicals. However, the structural determinants (biophores) derived from the GT MLA SAR model include both electrophilic as well as non-electrophilic moieties, suggesting that the induction of mutations in the MLA may occur by both direct interaction with DNA and by non-DNA-related mechanisms. This was confirmed by the observation that the set of biophores associated with MLA overlapped significantly with those associated with phenomena related to loss of heterozygosity, chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy. The MLA SAR model derived from the GT data evaluation was significantly more predictive than an SAR model previously derived from MLA data reported by the US National Toxicology Program [B.

In this study, we measured apoptosis occurring spontaneously, or induced by the synthetic somatostatin analogue, the peptide TT-232. We examined isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 32 nurses exposed bedside to cytostatic drugs, 12 chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL) patients prior to treatment, and 19 unexposed, healthy donors without anamnestic occupational exposure to genotoxic agents. Cells were stimulated by phytohaemagglutinin-P (PHA) and cultured for 69 h with or without 15 microg/ml TT-232, respectively. Cell kinetic parameters and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry after staining with FITC-labeled anti-BrdU and propidium iodide (PI) and the results on spontaneous and peptide-induced apoptosis were compared with the obtained chromosome aberration frequencies (CA). The peptide TT-232 unexpectedly induced chromosome breakage in addition to apoptosis. The mean spontaneous apoptotic fractions were 6.65+/-0.89%, 6.46+/-0. 53%, and 3.07+/-0.57%, and the mean CA yields in the samples without TT-232 were 1.74+/-0.46%, 2.44+/-0.40%, and 4.50+/-1.05%, for healthy subjects, nurses, and CLL patients, respectively. A total of 15 microg/ml TT-232 treatment in healthy subjects increased the mean CA frequency (10.38+/-1.57%), as well as the apoptotic cell fraction (2.63+/-0.45 times higher than the corresponding untreated sample). In TT-232-treated PBLs of nurses, CA remained unchanged and the mean apoptotic cell fraction showed only a slight increase (1.24+/-0.11 times higher than the untreated). Among CLL patients, TT-232 treatment significantly increased both CA (up to 17.83+/-4.04%) and the ratio of apoptotic cells (21.78+/-11.00 times higher than the untreated). These results demonstrated significant differences in apoptosis sensitivity in controls, nurses and CLL donors, after 15 microg/ml TT-232 treatment. Data also indicate that the induced CA yields in CLL donors with high CA are in correlation with TT-232-induced apoptosis.","['Tompa, A', 'Jakab, M G', 'Major, J', 'Idei, M', 'Bocsi, J', 'Mihalik, R', 'Szende, B', 'Keri, G']","['Tompa A', 'Jakab MG', 'Major J', 'Idei M', 'Bocsi J', 'Mihalik R', 'Szende B', 'Keri G']","['National Institute of Chemical Safety, P.O.

The results indicate that inhibition of ETO-induced apoptosis occurs downstream of ETO-mediated cleavable complex formation but early in, or at the level of the mitochondria events of the apoptotic pathway. Further, like other isothioureas, K-1 proved to be a potent inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. This raises the possibility that where the activation of nitric oxide synthase is involved in apoptosis induction, K-1 might also be effective.

In this study, we have examined five leukemic cell lines exhibiting hemizygous chr 2 loss, derived from CBA, C3H, or (C57BLxCBA/H) F1 mice in which AML had been induced by a whole-body dose of radiation. By application of a somatic cell hybridization technique, we have generated interspecific cell hybrids retaining the deleted murine chr 2 homologue. This strategy permitted a very detailed genetic analysis allowing the utilization of any genetic marker on chr 2 without a requirement for polymorphism. Somatic cell hybrid clones were subjected to a high-density polymerase chain reaction-based microsatellite screening using 62-106 informative markers for each cell line. Detailed maps accurately defining chr 2 breakpoints were obtained. The identification of critical breakpoint markers allowed the construction of partial yeast artificial chromosome contigs across chr 2 breakpoints.

To date, the arenavirus Z protein associates with the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML and the ribosomal P proteins. The majority of PML is present in nuclear bodies which are translocated to the cytoplasm by infection with the arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The Z protein is a small zinc-binding RING protein with an unknown function which is required for the viral life cycle. Here, we demonstrate an association between Z and the host cell translation factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) in infected and transfected cells. Z's association with both ribosomal proteins and this translation factor led us to investigate whether Z could modulate host cell translation. In cell culture, Z selectively represses protein production in an eIF-4E-dependent manner. Specifically, we see reduction in cyclin D1 protein production with no effect on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in cells transfected with Z. Previous reports indicate that cyclin D1 is sensitive to eIF-4E levels, whereas GAPDH is not. Consistent with this, we observe preferential downregulation of cyclin D1 during infection and no effect on GAPDH. Further, no changes in RNA levels were observed for cyclin D1 or GAPDH transcripts. The interaction between eIF-4E and Z may provide a mechanism for slower growth observed in infected cells and a viral strategy for establishing chronic infection.","['Campbell Dwyer, E J', 'Lai, H', 'MacDonald, R C', 'Salvato, M S', 'Borden, K L']","['Campbell Dwyer EJ', 'Lai H', 'MacDonald RC', 'Salvato MS', 'Borden KL']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada B3H 4H7.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",,2000/03/09 00:00,2000/03/09 00:01,['2000/03/09 00:00'],"['2000/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Apr;74(7):3293-300. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.7.3293-3300.2000.,,['10.1128/jvi.74.7.3293-3300.2000 [doi]'],,"['R01 CA080728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA80728-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC111830,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to understand how SFFV causes Epo independence, we have been examining erythroid cells rendered factor independent by SFFV infection for constitutive activation of signal-transducing molecules. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that various signal-transducing molecules known to be activated by Epo, including Stat proteins and components of the Raf-1/MAP kinase pathway, are constitutively activated in SFFV-infected erythroid cells in the absence of Epo. Since another signal transduction pathway involving activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) after Epo stimulation plays an important role in erythroid cell proliferation and differentiation, we carried out studies to determine if this pathway was also activated in SFFV-infected cells in the absence of Epo. Our studies show that PI 3-kinase is constitutively activated in erythroid cells rendered factor independent by infection with SFFV and that PI 3-kinase activity, but not Epo receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, is required for the proliferation of these cells in the absence of Epo. We further show that in SFFV-infected erythroid cells grown in the absence of Epo, PI 3-kinase associates with the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-related adapter molecules IRS-2, Gab1, and Gab2, which are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in SFFV-infected cells. Finally, Akt, a protein kinase that is one of the downstream effectors of PI 3-kinase, and SHIP, a lipid phosphatase that is important for Akt activation through PI 3-kinase, are both tyrosine phosphorylated in SFFV-infected cells grown in the absence of Epo. Our results indicate that induction of Epo independence by SFFV requires the activation of PI 3-kinase and suggest that constitutive activation of this kinase in SFFV-infected cells may occur primarily through interaction of PI 3-kinase with constitutively phosphorylated IRS-related adapter molecules.","['Nishigaki, K', 'Hanson, C', 'Ohashi, T', 'Thompson, D', 'Muszynski, K', 'Ruscetti, S']","['Nishigaki K', 'Hanson C', 'Ohashi T', 'Thompson D', 'Muszynski K', 'Ruscetti S']","['Basic Research Laboratory, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Enzyme Activation', 'Erythrocytes/*virology', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,2000/03/09 00:00,2000/03/09 00:01,['2000/03/09 00:00'],"['2000/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Apr;74(7):3037-45. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.7.3037-3045.2000.,,['10.1128/jvi.74.7.3037-3045.2000 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC111802,,,,,,,,,,,

Step 1 consisted of consolidation chemotherapy including cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 twice daily for 4 days concurrent with etoposide 40 mg/kg by continuous infusion over 4 days. During the recovery from this chemotherapy, peripheral blood stem cells were collected under granulocyte colony-stimulating factor stimulation. Step 2, autologous stem cell transplantation, involved the preparative regimen of busulfan 16 mg/kg followed by etoposide 60 mg/kg and reinfusion of unpurged peripheral blood stem cells. A total of 128 patients were treated. During step 1, there was 1 treatment-related death. A median CD34+ cell dose of 14 (x10(6)/kg) was collected in 3 aphereses. Ten patients suffered relapse before transplantation, and 117 patients (91%) proceeded to transplantation. During step 2, there were 2 treatment-related deaths, and 35 patients subsequently suffered relapse. With median follow-up of 30 months, 5-year disease-free survival for all patients entered in the study is projected to be 55%. By cytogenetic risk group, 5-year disease-free survival is 73% for favorable-risk patients, 51% for intermediate-risk patients, and 0% for poor-risk patients. We conclude that this 2-step approach to autologous transplantation produces excellent stem cell yields and allows a high percentage of patients to receive the intended therapy. Preliminary efficacy analysis is very encouraging, with outcomes that appear superior to those of conventional chemotherapy.","['Linker, C A', 'Ries, C A', 'Damon, L E', 'Sayre, P', 'Navarro, W', 'Rugo, H S', 'Rubin, A', 'Case, D', 'Crilley, P', 'Topolsky, D', 'Brodsky, I', 'Zamkoff, K', 'Wolfe, J L']","['Linker CA', 'Ries CA', 'Damon LE', 'Sayre P', 'Navarro W', 'Rugo HS', 'Rubin A', 'Case D', 'Crilley P', 'Topolsky D', 'Brodsky I', 'Zamkoff K', 'Wolfe JL']","['University of California, San Francisco, USA. linkerc@medicine.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/blood/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cytapheresis', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2000/03/09 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/09 09:00'],"['2000/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2000;6(1):50-7. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(00)70052-8.,,"['S1083879100500718 [pii]', '10.1016/s1083-8791(00)70052-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier studies found that virus infection enhanced binding of bacterial respiratory pathogens to epithelial cells in vitro. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of RSV infection of a human monocytic cell line on bactericidal activity and cytokine production in response to these bacterial respiratory pathogens. The effect of RSV infection on binding, uptake and intracellular killing of bacteria by a human monocytic leukaemia cell line, THP-1, was assessed. Cell culture supernates were examined with a mouse fibroblast cell assay for tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) bioactivity. Expression of CD14, CD11a, CD18, CD15 and CD29 on uninfected and RSV-infected THP-1 cells was assessed by flow cytometry in relation to differences in bacterial binding. RSV infection of THP-1 cells significantly decreased their ability to bind and kill bacteria. Compared with uninfected cells, fewer bacteria bound to RSV-infected THP-1 cells and the surface antigens that have been reported to bind bacteria were expressed at lower levels on RSV-infected cells. RSV-infected cells incubated with bacteria exhibited less TNF-alpha bioactivity than uninfected cell incubated with bacteria. The results elucidate some of the mechanisms involved in the increased susceptibility of virus-infected patients to secondary bacterial infection. Reduced bacterial killing by virus-infected monocytes might contribute to reduced clearance of bacteria from the respiratory tract and damage elicited by the bacteria or cytokine response in COPD patients.","['Raza, M W', 'Blackwell, C C', 'Elton, R A', 'Weir, D M']","['Raza MW', 'Blackwell CC', 'Elton RA', 'Weir DM']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and *Medical Statistics Unit, University of Edinburgh, Teviot Place, Edinburgh EH8 9AG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Med Microbiol,Journal of medical microbiology,0224131,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Haemophilus influenzae/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases, Obstructive/*microbiology/virology', 'Monocytes/*immunology/microbiology', 'Moraxella catarrhalis/*immunology', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human/*physiology', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",,2000/03/09 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/03/09 09:00'],"['2000/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Microbiol. 2000 Mar;49(3):227-233. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-49-3-227.,,['10.1099/0022-1317-49-3-227 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-49-3-227 [doi],,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, it is a large-sample method that can exhibit considerable bias when certain types of matched sets are infrequent or when the model contains too many parameters. Sparse-data bias can cause misleading inferences about confounding, effect modification, dose response, and induction periods, and can interact with other biases. In this paper, the authors describe these problems in the context of matched case-control analysis and provide examples from a study of electrical wiring and childhood leukemia and a study of diet and glioma. The same problems can arise in any likelihood-based analysis, including ordinary logistic regression. The problems can be detected by careful inspection of data and by examining the sensitivity of estimates to category boundaries, variables in the model, and transformations of those variables. One can also apply various bias corrections or turn to methods less sensitive to sparse data than conditional likelihood, such as Bayesian and empirical-Bayes (hierarchical regression) methods.","['Greenland, S', 'Schwartzbaum, J A', 'Finkle, W D']","['Greenland S', 'Schwartzbaum JA', 'Finkle WD']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California at Los Angeles, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['*Bias', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Diet', 'Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', '*Epidemiologic Methods', 'Glioma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Likelihood Functions', '*Logistic Models', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', '*Regression Analysis', 'Risk Assessment']",54,2000/03/09 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/09 09:00'],"['2000/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2000 Mar 1;151(5):531-9. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a010240.,,['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a010240 [doi]'],,,,['Am J Epidemiol. 2000 Oct 1;152(7):688-9.

In this paper, the possible identity of DPP IV and CD26 expression in phenotypically defined T-ALL has been examined. The combination of enzyme cytochemistry and immunocytochemistry was used. The correlation between the CD26 antigen expression and DPP IV positivity in the vast majority of T lymphoblasts in T-ALL patients was observed. No CD26 was expressed on DPP IV negative T cells. The variable CD4 and/or CD8 antigen expression, frequent CD7 positivity and absence of membrane CD3 antigen expression were the characteristic immunophenotypic features of CD26/DPP IV positive T cells. CD26/DPP IV activity strongly paralleled the CD71 antigen (transferrin receptor, T cell activation/proliferation antigen) expression. The phenotypic features of CD26/DPP IV positive T cells are characteristic for the relative immature cell population. Noteworthy was the slight disassociation between the very high CD26 antigen J expression and moderate DPP IV activity in cells of some T-ALL patients. The possible existence of enzymatically inactive structures of CD26 antigen or inactive precursors of DPP IV detectable only by immunocytochemistry was discussed. Our study indicates that CD26 antigen expression is tended to identify cells with DPP IV enzymatic activity in T-ALL patients. The results provide information of CD26 antigen possible involvement in the pathology of leukemic cells via its DPP IV enzyme activity.","['Klobusicka, M', 'Babusikova, O']","['Klobusicka M', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. exonklo@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,['EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*enzymology/*immunology/pathology']",,2000/03/09 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/09 09:00'],"['2000/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 1999 Dec;18 Suppl 1:34-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With improved management of infections, malignant disease is more frequently diagnosed and has become one of the commonest causes of death in pediatric AT and NBS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In three consecutive multicenter therapy trials for pediatric non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (NHL-BFM), 1569 patients with newly diagnosed NHL have been registered between 1986 and 1997. Nine patients with AT (n = 5) and NBS (n = 4) were identified and analysed. RESULTS: Median age of patients with AT and NBS at diagnosis of NHL was nine years. NHL-entities differed from non-AT/NBS-patients: diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, n = 7 (78%); ALCL, n = 1; lymphoblastic T-cell lymphoma, n = 1. Cervical nodes, paranasal sinuses and epipharynx were the sites most frequently involved. Stages were: I and II in three patients, III in five and IV in one patient. All patients received polychemotherapy according to tumor-entity and stage, none received radiation. Dose reductions according to individual tolerance concerned mainly ethotrexate, alkylating agents and epipodophyllotoxines. One patient died of toxic complications, two patients relapsed and died, one patient suffered from second malignancy. Five of nine patients are in 1. CCR after a median follow-up of five years. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AT and NBS suffer from rare entities of pediatric NHL. Curative treatment is possible and should be attempted. Intensity of therapy should be adjusted to individual risk factors and tolerance. Alkylating agents, epipodophyllotoxines should be omitted, dose of MTX should be limited to 1 g/m2.

For example, the high affinity IL-2 receptor is expressed by abnormal T cells in patients with certain lymphoid malignancies or autoimmune disorders and in individuals rejecting allografts whereas it is not expressed by normal resting cells. DESIGN: To exploit this difference in receptor expression in normal resting cells and leukemic cells we have introduced different forms of IL-2 receptor directed therapy including an unmodified murine antibody to the alpha subunit of the IL-2 receptor (anti-Tac), humanized anti-Tac as well as this antibody armed with truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin or alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides (e.g., 211At and 90Y). In particular, unmodified murine anti-Tac was used in the therapy of HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). RESULTS: Six of nineteen patients treated with this antibody underwent a partial (four) or complete (two) remission. In a subsequent clinical trial involving anti-Tac armed with 90Y over 50% of the patients with ATL treated underwent a partial or complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: New agents under development include humanized antibodies directed toward shared cytokine receptors such as IL-2/15R beta used by both IL-2 and IL-15 as well as to a shared signal transduction element Jak3 utilized by the T-cell stimulatory cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15.

DESIGN: The present overview updates the available clinical results and discusses important aspects of SCT in patients with CLL including the type of SCT (autologous vs. allogeneic), myeloablative regimens, purging, the predictive value of molecular monitoring of residual disease, and prognostic factors for the outcome of transplant approaches. RESULTS: With appropriate supportive care, autologous SCT is safe and can induce long-lasting clinical and molecular remissions, which may improve the prognosis of patients with CLL. Feasibiliy and efficacy of autologous SCT appears to be best early during the course of the disease, but it is still unclear if autotransplantation can cure the disease even in this favorable subgroup. The role of purging is still unclear. The better disease control observed after allografting appears to be due to graft-versus-leukemia activity and may allow cure in at least a subset of poor-risk patients. Due to the extraordinarily high treatment-related mortality, however, the outcome after allogeneic SCT is still inferior to that after autologous SCT. CONCLUSIONS: Autologous transplantation is a valuable treatment option for younger patients with early or sensitive poor-risk CLL. Selected patients with advanced poor-risk disease and low probability of successful auto-SCT should be considered for allografting. However, it must be kept in mind that both autologous and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation are still experimental procedures and clinical trials further elucidating their value in the treatment of patients with CLL are warranted.","['Dreger, P', 'Michallet, M', 'Schmitz, N']","['Dreger P', 'Michallet M', 'Schmitz N']","['Second Department of Medicine, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",21,2000/03/09 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/03/09 09:00'],"['2000/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2000;11 Suppl 1:49-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Serum and fecal samples from 87 cats with diarrhea, 106 cats without diarrhea, and 12 cats for which fecal consistency was unknown. PROCEDURES: Samples were obtained from client-owned cats and cats at a humane society shelter. Serum was assayed for feline leukemia virus antigen and antibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus, IgM antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii, and IgG antibodies against T gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum. Microscopic examination of unstained feces was performed after centrifugation in a zinc sulfate solution, thin fecal smears were stained with acid fast stain and examined for C parvum, and bacteriologic culture of feces was used to detect aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Enteric zoonotic organisms were detected in feces from 27 of 206 (13.1%) cats and included C parvum (5.4%), Giardia spp (2.4%). Toxocara cati (3.9%), Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (1.0%), and Campylobacter jejuni (1.0%); each organism was detected in samples from cats with and without diarrhea. Although differences between groups were not significant, a higher proportion of shelter cats (18.2%) had enteric zoonotic organisms than client-owned cats (10.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Enteric zoonotic organisms were detected in feces of 13.1% of cats, suggesting that cats, particularly those in homes of immunocompromised humans, should be evaluated for enteric zoonotic organisms.","['Hill, S L', 'Cheney, J M', 'Taton-Allen, G F', 'Reif, J S', 'Bruns, C', 'Lappin, M R']","['Hill SL', 'Cheney JM', 'Taton-Allen GF', 'Reif JS', 'Bruns C', 'Lappin MR']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Campylobacter Infections/epidemiology/veterinary', 'Cat Diseases/*epidemiology/microbiology/parasitology', 'Cats', 'Colorado/epidemiology', 'Cryptosporidiosis/epidemiology/veterinary', 'Diarrhea/epidemiology/microbiology/parasitology/*veterinary', 'Feces/microbiology/parasitology', 'Female', 'Giardiasis/epidemiology/veterinary', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Intestinal Diseases/epidemiology/microbiology/parasitology/veterinary', 'Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic/epidemiology/veterinary', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Salmonella Infections, Animal/epidemiology', 'Toxoplasmosis, Animal/epidemiology', 'Zoonoses/*epidemiology/microbiology/parasitology']",,2000/03/09 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/09 09:00'],"['2000/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2000 Mar 1;216(5):687-92. doi: 10.2460/javma.2000.216.687.,,['10.2460/javma.2000.216.687 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients treated with donor leukocytes had a relapse of chronic myelogenous leukemia, which was successfully re-induced into remission. The most significant toxicities of this treatment are the development of graft versus host disease and marrow aplasia. Three strategies were developed to limit the former: the infusion of graded doses of donor leukocytes, the depletion of CD8+ cells and the transfer of donor leukocytes transvected with a timidine kinase gene, which renders these cells sensitive to gancyclovir. The post-transplant infectious complications treated successfully with donor leukocytes were Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoproliferative disorders and cytomegalovirus infection. The former, arising most frequently in recipients of unrelated and/or mismatched T-cell depleted grafts, were treated with donor unseparated leukocytes or Epstein-Barr virus-specific T-cells. Cytomegalovirus infection in the early post-transplant period was largely prevented by the infusion of virus-specific T-cell clones, which restored donor-specific immunity to cytomegalovirus in the recipient.","['de Lacerda, J F']",['de Lacerda JF'],"['Unidade de Hematologia, Hospital de Santa Maria, Lisboa.']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Portugal,Acta Med Port,Acta medica portuguesa,7906803,,IM,"['Animals', '*Blood Donors', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",40,2000/03/09 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/09 09:00'],"['2000/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Med Port. 1999 Jul-Nov;12(7-11):255-64.,Infusao de leucocitos de dador apos a transplantacao alogenica de celulas estaminais.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrospective analysis of 3284 autopsies yielded 18 cases of aspergillosis. The specific diagnosis of aspergillosis was rendered by a monoclonal antibody versus Aspergillus spp. Patients with hematological disorders, such as acute leukemia and aplastic anemia, made up about 35% of all patients dying of invasive aspergillosis. Diseases of the airways and the pulmonary parenchyma constituted the second most pathogenetic factor for the development of aspergillosis. The morphologic form of aspergillosis was closely related to the underlying diseases. Non- and semi-invasive forms of aspergillosis--saprophytic infection and chronic necrotizing aspergillosis--were observed only in patients with an isolated underlying pulmonary disease devoid of any other precipitating factor. In contrast, seven patients, five of whom suffered from hematological diseases, had no underlying lung disease and developed aspergillus pneumonia. The remaining 5 patients with aspergillus pneumonia showed a combination of underlying extrapulmonary disease and pulmonary alterations that preceded aspergillosis. The local distribution of fungal infection showed a characteristic distribution pattern with a predominance of the upper lung lobes. Hematogeneous spread beyond the lungs occurred exclusively in cases with aspergillus pneumonia. We conclude that the different forms of aspergillosis are closely related to the nature of the underlying disease.","['Barth, P J', 'Rossberg, C', 'Koch, S', 'Ramaswamy, A']","['Barth PJ', 'Rossberg C', 'Koch S', 'Ramaswamy A']","['Department of Pathology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany. barthp@post.med.uni-marburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,"['0 (Antigens, Fungal)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Fungal/analysis', 'Aspergillosis/etiology/microbiology/*pathology', 'Aspergillus/isolation & purification', 'Autopsy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/etiology/microbiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2000/03/09 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/09 09:00'],"['2000/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 2000;196(2):73-80. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(00)80036-9.,,"['S0344-0338(00)80036-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(00)80036-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In conclusion, the question of whether these deficiencies are responsible for the disease or are the result of a secondary effect of the cancer remain to be answered.

Because cytogenetic studies frequently identify chromosome 5 and 17 deletions within a single clone, we searched for allele loss for 5q loci and TP53 gene mutations in the same leukemic samples. Cosegregating deletions of chromosomes 5 and 17 were found to specifically include the 5q13.3 interval between the loci D5S672 and D5S620/D5S626, a locus hypothesized to harbor a tumor suppressor gene(1) and the TP53 gene on 17p. A rare patient with secondary refractory MDS and an unbalanced translocation [der(5;17)], which resulted in deletions of the 5q13.3-qter and 17p loci, provided clues on the sequence of genetic alterations. Serial molecular analysis of this patient revealed a dysplastic clone with der(5;17), which gave rise to a leukemic clone on acquiring an inactivating mutation of TP53. Our findings are consistent with functional cooperation between a putative tumor suppressor gene at 5q13.3 that contributes toward the progression of early stages of MDS, and the TP53 gene when mutated, causes transformation to AML.

In the subset of patients with SCN that progresses to AML, acquired mutations in the receptor for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) have been detected that result in the expression of truncated forms of the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) protein. G-CSFR truncation mutants from these patients transduce hyperproliferative growth responses. In this paper, we show that the most frequently isolated mutant G-CSFR form from patients with SCN/AML (delta716) confers resistance to apoptosis and prolongs cell survival through a mechanism involving Akt, a downstream target of PI3-kinase. G-CSF stimulation of cells expressing the G-CSFR truncation mutant induces sustained activation of Akt and prolonged phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad, resulting in enhanced cell survival. Extension of cell survival allowing for sufficient time for the acquisition of additional oncogenic events may represent an important mechanism by which G-CSFR mutations contribute to leukemogenesis. These data provide further insight into the pathophysiologic contribution of G-CSFR mutations to AML.

Among them, PDGFRbeta, ABL, JAK2, and TRKC are tyrosine kinases (TK). We identified a novel ETV6 partner gene, ARG (ABL-related gene or ABL2), another TK gene in a cell line established from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML-M3) with a t(15;17)(q22;q11.2) and a t(1;12)(q25;p13), which has the remarkable feature to differentiate to mature eosinophils in culture with all-trans retinoic acid and cytokines. The ETV6/ARG transcripts consisted of exon 1 to 5 of ETV6 and the 3' portion of ARG starting from exon 1B or exon 2, resulting in an open reading frame for a fusion protein consisting of the entire PNT oligomerization domain of ETV6 and all of the functional domains of ARG including the TK domain. This is the same protein structure as identified in the other ETV6 TK fusion proteins. The reciprocal ARG/ETV6 transcript was not expressed, and the normal ETV6 allele was not deleted or rearranged. Although the ABL is known to be involved in various human malignancies, ARG has not been involved in human malignancies despite its high homology to ABL. Thus, this is the first report showing involvement of ARG in human leukemia. The ETV6/ARG protein may be involved in the unique differentiation capacity of this cell line.

Recently, rearrangements of the gene encoding the tyrosine Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) have been reported in human leukemias indicating a direct JAK-signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT)-mediated leukemic process. The leukemia-associated TEL-JAK2 fusion protein is formed by the oligomerization domain of the translocated ets leukemia (TEL) protein fused to the catalytic domain of JAK2. TEL-mediated oligomerization results in a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that, in turn, is able to confer growth factor independence to the murine hematopoietic interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 cell line. Results of the present study indicate that fusion proteins containing the oligomerization domain of TEL and the tyrosine kinase domains of Jak1, Jak2, JAK3, or TYK2 share similar properties and are able to efficiently substitute for the survival and mitogenic signals controlled by IL-3, without concomitant activation of the IL-3 receptor. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated Stat5 as the only activated Stat factor in TEL-Jak2- and TEL-Jak1-expressing cells, whereas other Stats, namely Stat1 and Stat3, could be detected in TEL-JAK3-, TEL-TYK2-, and also in TEL-ABL-expressing Ba/F3 cells. High levels of expression of the Stat5-target genes pim-1, osm, and Cis were observed in all the cytokine-independent cell lines. Furthermore, the expression of a dominant negative form of Stat5A markedly interfered with the growth factor independence process mediated by TEL-Jak2 in Ba/F3 cells. Because the BCR-ABL and TEL-PDGFbetaR oncoproteins also activate Stat5, activation of this factor should be a crucial step in activated tyrosine kinase-mediated leukemogenesis.

Establishment of such culture systems will have significant impact on ex vivo manipulation and expansion of transplantable stem cells in clinical applications such as gene therapy, tumor cell purging, and stem cell transplantation. We have recently developed a stromal-based culture system that facilitates ex vivo expansion of transplantable human HSCs. In this stromal-based culture system, 2 major contributors to the ex vivo stem cell expansion are the addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and the AC6.21 stromal cells. Because the action of LIF is indirect and mediated by stromal cells, we hypothesized that LIF binds to the LIF receptor on AC6.21 stromal cells, leading to up-regulated production of stem cell expansion promoting factor (SCEPF) and/or down-regulated production of stem cell expansion inhibitory factor (SCEIF). Here we demonstrate a secreted SCEPF activity in the conditioned media of LIF-treated AC6.21 stromal cell cultures (SCM-LIF). The magnitude of ex vivo stem cell expansion depends on the concentration of the secreted SCEPF activity in the SCM-LIF. Furthermore, we have ruled out the contribution of 6 known early-acting cytokines, including interleukin-3, interleukin-6, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, stem cell factor, flt3 ligand, and thrombopoietin, to this SCEPF activity. Although further studies are required to characterize this secreted SCEPF activity and to determine whether this secreted SCEPF activity is mediated by a single factor or by multiple growth factors, our results demonstrate that stromal cells are not required for this secreted SCEPF activity to facilitate ex vivo stem cell expansion.

In nearly all French-American-British leukemia subtypes, we found p15 methylation in bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from 58% (46/79) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or acute biphenotypic leukemia (ABL). An identical alteration was detected in blood plasma from 11 of 12 of these patients (92%). We also demonstrated for the first time concomitant p16 and p15 methylation in 22% (8/37) of adults with AML or ALL, exclusively in those with M2, M4, or L2 subtypes. According to cytogenetic data from 35 patients with ALL, AML, or ABL, 82% (14/17) of those with unmethylated p15 alleles had normal karyotypes or hyperdiploidies associated with a favorable prognosis. Conversely, 44% (8/18) of patients with p15 methylation had chromosomal translocations, inversions, or deletions, suggesting an interplay of these abnormalities with p15 methylation. As a prognostic marker for disease monitoring, p15 methylation appears to be more widely applicable than BCR-ABL, AF4-MLL, and AML1-ETO transcripts, which were detectable in only 8% (4/48) of patients by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Thirty-nine of 43 blood samples (91%) sequentially collected from 12 patients with AML, ALL, or ABL showed p15 methylation status in excellent concordance with morphologic disease stage. Early detection of p15 methylation at apparent remission or its acquisition during follow-up may prove valuable for predicting relapse. Overall survival of patients with p15 methylation was notably shortened among 38 adults with AML and 12 adults with ALL. Aberrant p15 methylation may have important prognostic implications for clinical monitoring and risk assessment.

Previous studies have indicated that the telomere length in blood cells may indicate their replicative history. However, the large variation in telomere length between individuals complicates the use of this parameter in CML and other hematologic disorders. To circumvent this problem, we compared the telomere length in peripheral blood or bone marrow cells with purified normal (Ph(-)) T lymphocytes from the same CML patient using fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry. Overall telomere fluorescence was significantly reduced in Ph(+) cells from patients with CML compared to blood leukocytes from normal individuals (P < 0.001) or normal (Ph(-)) T lymphocytes from the same individuals (n = 51, P < 0.001). Cells from patients in accelerated phase or blast phase (AP/BP) showed significantly shorter average telomere length than cells from patients in chronic phase (CP, P = 0.02) or cytogenetic remission (CR, P = 0.03). Patients in CP who subsequently developed BP within 2 years had significantly shorter telomeres than those who did not develop BP for at least 2 years (P < 0.05). Accelerated replication-dependent telomere shortening in Ph(+ )versus Ph(-) leukocytes supports previous evidence that Ph(+) stem cells cycle more actively than their counterparts in normal individuals. Our data further suggest that telomere shortening may serve as a surrogate marker of disease progression in patients with CP CML, supporting a mechanistic link between CML stem cell turnover, genetic instability, and malignant evolution in this disease.

A critical review of the clinical manifestations and management.,212-22,"The FAB group has defined myelodysplasia in adults but direct application of this categorization to children has been controversial. Consequently, to outline the natural history of the disease better we have retrospectively analysed case reports and series published in English between 1982 and 1996. This study also included children with juvenile chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (JCML) and monosomy 7 (Mo7). 340 patients were described in 27 publications. The mean presentation age was 5.91 (SD 5.04) years, and 34.9% were female. Constitutional alterations were described in 68 (20%) where refractory anemia (RA) and RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) predominated and were associated with a significantly longer survival. Among all patients progression to higher forms of MDS was noted in 61 (18%). Cytogenetic anomalies were detected in 59% of 227 children, and in 67 it was to Mo7. Amid those with Mo7, the clinical and laboratory characteristics as well as survival, closely followed their FAB type. Of the treatment options described, survival was significantly higher in those who underwent bone marrow transplant (BMT) (46.9%; P = 0.00021). Among children with JMML (CMML/JCML) not receiving a BMT, time to death was shortest in those best described as JCML (absence of constitutional and karyotypic derangement, thrombocytopenia and elevated Hb F). We conclude that children with constitutional abnormalities survive longer, Mo7 disorders are clinically and morphologically heterogeneous and should not be grouped into a single entity and that CMML and JCML may have biological differences. Finally, BMT remains the treatment of choice for those with primary MDS, as intensive chemotherapy is no better than supportive measures.","['Novitzky, N']",['Novitzky N'],"['The University of Cape Town Leukemia Centre, Department of Haematology, Groote Schuur Hospital, Observatory, Cape, Cape Town, South Africa. novitzky@samiot.uct.ac.za']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/therapy']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2000 Apr;63(4):212-22. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(200004)63:4<212::aid-ajh9>3.0.co;2-d.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(200004)63:4<212::AID-AJH9>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(200004)63:4<212::aid-ajh9>3.0.co;2-d [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) inhibits the polymerization events of sickle hemoglobin (Hb S), thereby ameliorating the clinical symptoms of sickle cell disease. Ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors (RRIs) have been shown to inhibit the growth of myeloid leukemia cells leading to the production of Hb F upon differentiation. Of the RRIs currently in use, hydroxyurea is the most effective agent for Hb F induction. We have examined the capacity of two novel RRIs, didox (DI) and trimidox (TRI), in combination with streptozotocin (STZ), to induce hemoglobin and F-cell production. The K562 cells were cultured with different concentrations of didox-STZ or trimidox-STZ at a fixed molar ratio of 3:1 and 1:5 for 96 hr, respectively. At pre-determined time intervals, aliquots of cells were obtained and total hemoglobin (benzidine positive) levels, number of F-cells, and Hb F were determined by the differential staining technique, fetal hemoglobin assay kit, and fluorescence cytometry respectively. The effect of combined drug treatment on the growth of K562 cells was examined by isobologram analysis. Our results indicate that a synergistic growth-inhibitory differentiation effect occurred when didox or trimidox was used in combination with STZ on K562 cells. There was an increase in the number of both benzidine-positive normoblasts and F-cells, accompanied by morphologic appearances typical of erythroid maturation. On day 4, the number of benzidine-positive cells showed a 6-9-fold increase and the number of F-cells was between 2.5- and 5.7-fold higher than the respective controls. Based upon these results, treatment with a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, such as didox or trimidox, in combination with STZ, might offer an additional promising option in sickle cell disease therapy.","['Iyamu, W E', 'Adunyah, S E', 'Fasold, H', 'Horiuchi, K', 'Elford, H L', 'Asakura, T', 'Turner, E A']","['Iyamu WE', 'Adunyah SE', 'Fasold H', 'Horiuchi K', 'Elford HL', 'Asakura T', 'Turner EA']","['Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamidoxime)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamidines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hemoglobin, Sickle)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'L106XFV0RQ (3,4-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*biosynthesis', 'Hemoglobin, Sickle/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Streptozocin/*therapeutic use']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2000 Apr;63(4):176-83. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(200004)63:4<176::aid-ajh3>3.0.co;2-g.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(200004)63:4<176::AID-AJH3>3.0.CO;2-G [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(200004)63:4<176::aid-ajh3>3.0.co;2-g [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['2P60 H13832/PHS HHS/United States', 'P60 HL33737/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 HL 58930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic mutations of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene have been identified in a number of cancer cell lines and primary cancers. Mutations in PTEN/MMAC1 are most frequently found in advanced cancers. To evaluate the role of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene in leukemia, bone marrow and/or peripheral blood from 62 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, 5 hemopoietic cell lines (HL60, U937, Raji, KG-1, K562), and 30 normal controls were analyzed. The results showed aberrant PTEN/MMAC1 transcripts in 15 of the 62 (24%) AML patients, 4 of the 5 cell lines (80%), and 4 of the 30 (13%) normal controls. As in our previous study of TSG101, the abnormal transcripts may result from aberrant RNA splicing as evidenced by the presence of both these aberrant transcripts and normal full length transcripts in all specimens examined. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis and PCR-SSCP of the entire coding region showed that none of the AML cases had LOH or mutation. Only one frameshift mutation at codon 130 (insertion of CCCG) with premature termination of coding sequence was observed in the U937 cell line. Our results indicate that the PTEN/MMAC1 gene may play a role in a small percentage of AML, but its significance needs to be further evaluated.","['Liu, T C', 'Lin, P M', 'Chang, J G', 'Lee, J P', 'Chen, T P', 'Lin, S F']","['Liu TC', 'Lin PM', 'Chang JG', 'Lee JP', 'Chen TP', 'Lin SF']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2000 Apr;63(4):170-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(200004)63:4<170::aid-ajh2>3.0.co;2-0.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(200004)63:4<170::AID-AJH2>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(200004)63:4<170::aid-ajh2>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our focus is two ongoing clinical studies with transgeneic (genetically altered) cellular therapy; one uses allogeneic (from another person) lymphocytes to treat leukemia, and the second uses xenogeneic (from another species) fibroblast cells genetically altered to contain a toxin-producing suicide gene to treat ovarian cancer. Allogeneic donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are known to induce remission of hematologic malignancies. However, the toxicity associated with DLI is related to graft-versus-host-disease, which is due to donor lymphocytes attacking normal tissue in the recipient. Therefore, we have taken the approach of infusing DLI that have been modified to contain a latent suicide gene to treat leukemia. To treat ovarian cancer, we used xenogeneic nonimmune fibroblast-derived cells to deliver a tumor-directed cytotoxic gene to carcinoma cells. These cells release HStk transgene retroviruses that in turn transduce replicating tumor cells but not quiescent epithelium, rendering the tumor selectively susceptible to ganciclovir-mediated killing. These initial trials summarize the early stage of allogeneic/xenogeneic adoptive cellular therapy for cancer, and although the data are limited, it is encouraging to see some patients with evidence of antitumor responses. Advances in our understanding of the basic science of these treatments, together with improvements in the technology of vector design, will be required to stream-line these methodologies into broader application.","['Link, C J', 'Seregina, T', 'Traynor, A', 'Burt, R K']","['Link CJ', 'Seregina T', 'Traynor A', 'Burt RK']","['Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/genetics/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",33,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2000;5(1):68-74. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.5-1-68.,,['10.1634/theoncologist.5-1-68 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tracked the leukemic clone with an MLL gene translocation during neuroblastoma therapy in a child who developed acute myeloid leukemia. The karyotype of the leukemic clone showed del(11)(q23). We used panhandle PCR-based methods to isolate the breakpoint junction involving MLL and an unknown partner gene. Marrow DNA from neuroblastoma diagnosis and DNA and RNA from serial preleukemic marrows were examined for the translocation. The karyotypic del(11)(q23) was a cryptic t(11;17). GAS7, a growth arrest-specific gene at chromosome band 17p13, was the partner gene of MLL. Two different MLL-GAS7 fusion transcripts were expressed. The translocation was already detectable by 1.5 months after the start of neuroblastoma treatment. The translocation was not detectable in the marrow at neuroblastoma diagnosis or in peripheral blood lymphocyte DNAs of six normal subjects. GAS7 is a new partner gene of MLL in treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia. MLL gene translocations can be present early during anticancer treatment at low cumulative doses of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors.

HCL-V is thought to represent a hybrid between prolymphocytic leukemia and HCL, the nucleus more closely resembling a prolymphocyte and the cytoplasm a hairy cell. The clinical course of HCL-V is aggressive with short survivals.

During this time interval 357 patients with classic HCL received cladribine at Scripps Clinic. Each patient received cladribine at 0.1 mg/kg per day by continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days, repeated at 28-day intervals depending on response status. The 4 patients ranged in age from 28 to 70. Two presented with B-symptoms, 1 had peripheral adenopathy, and all 4 displayed massive splenomegaly. Peripheral blood counts were notable for lymphocytosis associated with mild anemia and thrombocytopenia. Only 1 of the 4 patients had received prior treatment. Peripheral blood immunophenotypic analysis revealed monoclonal B cells with expression of CD11c in 3 patients, lack of CD25 expression in 3 patients and expression of CD103 in all but 1 patient.

The role of other treatment modalities, such as splenectomy, interferon-alpha, and 2'-deoxycoformycin, alone or in combination with cladribine awaits further evaluation.","['Tetreault, S A', 'Robbins, B A', 'Saven, A']","['Tetreault SA', 'Robbins BA', 'Saven A']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Ida M. and Cecil H.

The molecular change(s) responsible for low RB expression in AML are unknown. Since methylation of the RB promoter has been shown to result in decreased expression we hypothesized that this might explain some cases of low RB expression in AML. To investigate this hypothesis Southern blotting and PCR sequencing after bisulfite conversion were used to study the methylation status of the RB gene promoter. DNA and protein lysates were prepared from the mononuclear cell fraction from peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from 46 patients with newly diagnosed AML. By Western blot 16, 22 and 8 patients had low, elevated and hyperphosphorylated patterns of RB expression respectively using previously defined criteria. The SacI endonuclease cuts a 5.7-kb or 6.8 -kb fragment, depending on polymorphism, containing the RB promoter, detected by the probe p123M1.8 that covers the RB promoter region and exon 1. The methylation sensitive endonuclease SacII cuts twice within a key hairpin loop structure in the RB promoter that contains binding sites for AP1, Sp1 and RBF1. Others have demonstrated that methylation within this hairpin loop can decrease RB mRNA transcription by up to 92%. Comparison of the SacI and SacI + SacII digestion fragments showed no evidence of methylation in the promoter region of RB in any of the patients studied. DNA from the promoter region of 11 patients with no/low RB expression was subjected to bisulfite conversion and PCR sequencing. No evidence of methylation was seen by this method either. These results suggests that hypermethylation of the RB promoter region is at best an infrequent event in AML and that RB promoter hypermethylation is not the predominant cause of the low levels of RB expression observed in 20% of AML patients.","['Kornblau, S M', 'Qiu, Y H']","['Kornblau SM', 'Qiu YH']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas M.

A research project was designed to determine whether CAT by itself and in conjunction with HQ could directly induce loss of chromosome 5 and/or 7 and gain of chromosome 8. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome-specific 5, 7, and 8 probes we demonstrate that 5 to 150 uM CAT does not produce chromosomal aberrations, however CAT and 25 uM HQ can act in synergy to induce dose dependent loss of these chromosomes. In addition HQ/CAT selectively induces -5q which is not observed for HQ only.

Since doxorubicin resistance in these cells is associated with the expression of high levels of P-glycoprotein, we evaluated the effect of astemizole on P-glycoprotein activity in cytofluorographic efflux experiments with doxorubicin. Our results indicate that astemizole inhibits the P-glycoprotein pump-efflux activity in a dose-related manner.

In addition, linoleic acid peroxidation initiated by hydroxyl radicals was decreased by 4-HPR to the same extent as by vitamin E.

This cell line should be useful for the study of the role of CBP as a transcriptional regulator in leukemia differentiation and for the functional analysis of the MLL-CBP fusion gene, which will provide new insights into leukemogenesis caused by 11q23 translocations.","['Hayashi, Y', 'Honma, Y', 'Niitsu, N', 'Taki, T', 'Bessho, F', 'Sako, M', 'Mori, T', 'Yanagisawa, M', 'Tsuji, K', 'Nakahata, T']","['Hayashi Y', 'Honma Y', 'Niitsu N', 'Taki T', 'Bessho F', 'Sako M', 'Mori T', 'Yanagisawa M', 'Tsuji K', 'Nakahata T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholecalciferol/*therapeutic use', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Feb 15;60(4):1139-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that Fes induces differentiation in the chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived cell line K-562, suggesting that the Fes signal for differentiation is dominant to the Bcr-Abl signal for transformation in these cells. In addition, Fes has been shown to associate with and phosphorylate Bcr on NH2-terminal sequences retained within Bcr-Abl. To determine whether Fes interacts directly with Bcr-Abl, kinase-inactive Bcr-Abl was coexpressed with Fes in 293T cells, and phosphorylation was assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Bcr-Abl was strongly phosphorylated by Fes under these conditions, suggestive of direct interaction. Similarly, tyrosine phosphorylation of kinase-inactive Fes was observed after coexpression with active Bcr-Abl. To test for the interaction of Fes with Bcr-Abl under physiological conditions, wild-type and kinase-defective Fes were stably expressed in the cytokine-dependent myeloid leukemia cell line, DAGM. Expression of either form of Fes alone did not affect the proliferation or interleukin 3 dependence of these cells. The DAGM/Fes cells were then infected with Bcr-Abl retroviruses, and their rates of cytokine-independent outgrowth were compared. Fes dramatically suppressed Bcr-Abl-induced DAGM cell outgrowth relative to a cell line expressing beta-galactosidase as a negative control. This effect required Fes tyrosine kinase activity, because the kinase-inactive form of Fes did not affect Bcr-Abl-induced cell outgrowth. The phosphotyrosine content of both wild-type and kinase-inactive Fes was strongly enhanced after coexpression with Bcr-Abl in DAGM cells, similar to the 293T result. Phosphorylation of wild-type Fes correlated with stimulation of Fes tyrosine kinase activity in the presence of Bcr-Abl. These results show that Fes and Bcr-Abl interact in myeloid cells, leading to Fes activation and suppression of Bcr-Abl-induced conversion to cytokine independence.","['Lionberger, J M', 'Smithgall, T E']","['Lionberger JM', 'Smithgall TE']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Department of Pathology and Microbiology University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FES protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes', 'Tyrosine']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Feb 15;60(4):1097-103.,,,,['CA58667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that the CDKN2A gene was more frequently methylated in fresh tumor cells isolated from patients with acute ATL (47%) or lymphoma-type ATL (73%) than in those with less malignant chronic (17%) and smoldering (17%) ATL. In addition, deletions of the CDKN2A gene were found in 24% of acute ATL patients; thus, abnormalities of the CDKN2A gene totaled 71% in acute ATL patients. In contrast, no CDKN2A gene methylation was found in asymptomatic carriers or uninfected individuals. Methylation of the p15 gene was not found in any samples from 36 ATL patients. Direct sequencing of the CDKN2A gene after sodium bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA revealed that the methylation of CpG sites had occurred in 24 of 32 ATL cases (75%) including chronic and smoldering ATL, even when MSPCR and the Southern blot had failed to detect CDKN2A gene methylation. Among fresh ATL samples with methylation, methylation was detected in the promoter region and exon in 17 of 24 cases, and methylation in the exon without promoter region was detected in 7 of 24 cases. In one case, the pattern of methylation proved to be different between peripheral blood cells and lymph node cells, suggesting the presence of multiple subclones with regard to methylation patterns, despite the same HTLV-I integration site. Quantitative PCR showed a marked decrease in CDKN2A mRNA expression in the cells with a methylated CDKN2A gene, especially if the promoter region was methylated. These findings suggest that CpG methylation decreases CDKN2A expression and represents a critical factor in the disease progression of ATL.","['Nosaka, K', 'Maeda, M', 'Tamiya, S', 'Sakai, T', 'Mitsuya, H', 'Matsuoka, M']","['Nosaka K', 'Maeda M', 'Tamiya S', 'Sakai T', 'Mitsuya H', 'Matsuoka M']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)""]",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', '*DNA Methylation', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/metabolism', '*Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Feb 15;60(4):1043-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we wanted to further investigate the mechanism of ULS-induced cell death and to determine whether apoptosis is involved. High intensity focused pulsed ULS sonication at a frequency of 750 KHz was delivered to HL-60, K562, U937, and M1/2 leukemia cell line cultures. ULS exposure used with induction of transient cavitation in the focal area was delivered with an intensity level of 103.7 W/cm2 and 54.6 W/cm2 spatial-peak temporal-average intensity. As a control, ULS of lower intensity was delivered at 22.4 W/cm2 spatial-peak temporal-average intensity, presumably without generation of cavitation. Our results indicated that DNA damage induced by ULS cavitation did not involve generation of free radicals in the culture media. Morphological alterations observed in cells after exposure to ULS included: cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation. Apoptotic cells were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and detected using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, which identifies DNA breaks, and by the leakage of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer side of the membrane layer of treated cells. Some bioeffects induced on sonicated HL-60 cells, such as inhibition of cell proliferation, DNA repair, and cell-dependent apoptosis, were found to be similar to those produced by gamma-irradiation. Thus, much of the cell damage induced by therapeutic ULS in leukemia cells surviving ULS exposure appears to occur through an apoptotic mechanism.","['Ashush, H', 'Rozenszajn, L A', 'Blass, M', 'Barda-Saad, M', 'Azimov, D', 'Radnay, J', 'Zipori, D', 'Rosenschein, U']","['Ashush H', 'Rozenszajn LA', 'Blass M', 'Barda-Saad M', 'Azimov D', 'Radnay J', 'Zipori D', 'Rosenschein U']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Free Radicals)'],IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/pathology', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Repair', 'Free Radicals', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultrasonic Therapy']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Feb 15;60(4):1014-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we set out to determine whether antigen-specific CTLs would be suitable vehicles to deliver IT to the site of cancer cells in vivo. A retroviral vector was constructed for gene therapy with (interleukin 4) IL-4 positioned downstream of its 20-amino-acid leader sequence that permitted cotranslational protein synthesis of IT along with truncated diphtheria toxin (DT). IL-4 was chosen as a ligand based on the expression of IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) on most acute myeloid leukemia cases. The first-time expression and secretion of a cytokine/DT fusion toxin was accomplished in mammalian NIH.3T3 cells, and then a retroviral vector was assembled. The retroviral IT was used to transiently transduce T15, a CD8+ CTL T cell line that specifically recognized C1498 (a lethal murine acute myeloid leukemia cell line). Transduced T15 T cells expressed intracellular DT and IL-4 as determined by immunofluorescence. Secreted IT supernatants collected from T15 had enzymatic activity and killed IL-4R+ C1498 cells, but not IL-4R- EL4 cells. Intravenous injection of transduced T15, but not nontransduced T15, into mice with s.c. tumors significantly inhibited tumor growth. In contrast, systemic therapy with a bacterial preparation of the same IL-4 IT given at its maximum tolerated dose did not protect. Retroviral IT-treated mice showed no sign of the renal or hepatic toxicity that is common to this class of IT. Together, these data indicate that retroviral IT may solve problems relating to systemic IT therapy by delivering reagent more directly to the site of cancer in vivo and may impart new anticancer defense mechanisms to antigen-specific T cells.","['Vallera, D A', 'Jin, N', 'Baldrica, J M', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A', 'Chen, S Y', 'Blazar, B R']","['Vallera DA', 'Jin N', 'Baldrica JM', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Chen SY', 'Blazar BR']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Minneapolis 55455, USA. valle001@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Immunotoxins/*genetics', 'Interleukin-4/*genetics', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Liver/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Feb 15;60(4):976-84.,,,,"['R01-CA36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA82154/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of WT1 gene function has been implicated in the development of malignancies including Wilms' tumor and acute leukemias. We have shown previously that ectopic expression of WT1 +KTS isoforms in murine M1 leukemic cells spontaneously induces monocytic differentiation without the requirement for external differentiation-inducing stimuli. To determine whether these observed effects in vitro corresponded to a reduction in tumorigenicity in vivo, parental M1, control M1.Neo, and M1.WT1 +KTS cells were transplanted into C.B-17 scid/scid mice, and the growth and metastatic behavior of the cell lines were monitored for a period of 20 weeks. Mice inoculated either s.c. on the flank or directly into the peritoneal cavity, with M1 cells stably expressing WT1 +KTS isoforms exhibited a marked decrease in tumor formation compared with control groups. Moreover, tumors arising in mice after the injection of M1.WT1 +KTS cells exhibited a loss in ectopic WT1 protein expression. Confirmation that the tumors arose from M1.WT1 +KTS cells was achieved by the amplification of the introduced transgene from tumor samples and indicates that the tumorigenicity of leukemic M1 cells in these animals correlates with a loss in WT1 expression. This investigation is the first to demonstrate the tumor-suppressive effects of WT1 expression in a leukemic cell line, further advancing the notion that WT1 acts as a differentiation-promoting gene during hematopoiesis and that loss of functional WT1 expression may contribute to leukemogenesis in vivo.","['Smith, S I', 'Down, M', 'Boyd, A W', 'Li, C L']","['Smith SI', 'Down M', 'Boyd AW', 'Li CL']","['Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Royal Brisbane Hospital, Herston, Australia. shirleyS@qimr.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'WT1 Proteins']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Feb 15;60(4):808-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells may be found in the blood of patients studied soon after diagnosis or during the period of endogenous hematopoietic recovery that follows myeloreductive therapy. Based on those observations, we have developed a clinical protocol that allows collection of Ph-negative peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) with transplantable hematopoietic regenerative potential. The aim of this study is to examine changes that occur in the percentage of Ph-negative- and Ph-positive-committed progenitor cells and to determine the relationship between changes and clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We followed 15 patients with CML, mobilized and autografted soon after diagnosis with 85%-100% Ph-negative PBPC for a median time of 28 months (range 18-50) after transplant. At 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and last follow-up, cytogenetic analyses were performed on fresh bone marrow cells and on colony-forming cells (CFC). RESULTS: Autologous transplantation induces a reduction in the proportion of Ph-positive CFC, from 70%-100% to 0%-25% in the majority of patients (78%). After autografting, 8 of 15 patients achieved a long-lasting cytogenetic remission (median, 24 months; range, 21-43) with a Ph-positivity ranging between 0% and 20% at the level of mature mononuclear cells and colony-forming cells (CFC). In some patients, the majority of CFC remained Ph-negative, whereas the majority of the mature cells were Ph-positive. Other patients (5/15) developed cytogenetic relapse (100% Ph-positive), although they were in hematological remission. We found that detection of Ph-positive long-term-culture initiating cells (LTC-IC) in the marrow at diagnosis was the only factor significantly associated with recurrence of the disease (p < 0.01); on the other hand, the number of Ph-negative LTC-IC infused showed a significant correlation with a better outcome (p < 0.03). CONCLUSION: We have shown that a prolonged period of complete or almost complete Ph-negative hemopoiesis can be achieved in patients with CML who undergo autografting with Ph-negative progenitors. Longer follow-up study will be needed to assess whether these changes are associated with improved survival.","['Podesta, M', 'Piaggio, G', 'Sessarego, M', 'Pitto, A', 'Figari, O', 'Soracco, M', 'Carella, A M', 'Dejana, A', 'Rosti, V', 'Fugazza, G', 'Ravera, G', 'Lerma, E', 'Cazzola, M', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Frassoni, F']","['Podesta M', 'Piaggio G', 'Sessarego M', 'Pitto A', 'Figari O', 'Soracco M', 'Carella AM', 'Dejana A', 'Rosti V', 'Fugazza G', 'Ravera G', 'Lerma E', 'Cazzola M', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Frassoni F']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia Ospedale S.

Acute myelogenous leukemia developing in patients treated with alkylating agents for other cancers or occupationally exposed to benzene exhibit a pattern of cytogenetic aberrations predominantly involving loss of all or part of chromosomes 5 and/or 7. In contrast, trisomy 8 is observed equally in both de novo and secondary acute myelogenous leukemia. Studies using peripheral lymphocytes or lymphoblastoid cell lines have observed dose-dependent loss of chromosomes 5, 7, and 8 following treatment with the benzene metabolite, hydroquinone. The purpose of this study was to determine the dose response and specificity of hydroquinone-induced aberrations on chromosomes 5, 7, and 8 using human CD34+CD19 bone marrow cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed on CD34+CD19- bone marrow cells using the locus-specific probes, 5q31, 5p15.2, and centromeric probes specific for human chromosomes 7 and 8 following hydroquinone exposure. RESULTS: Hydroquinone exposure results in -7, selective deletion of 5q31 but not chromosome 5 and no loss or gain of chromosome 8 in human CD34+CD19- cells. CONCLUSION: CD34+ bone marrow cells are more susceptible and show a different pattern of cytogenetic aberrations as a result of hydroquinone exposure compared to lymphocytes. CD34+ bone marrow cells exhibit unique susceptibility to the development of specific chromosome aberrations that have been identified as the earliest structural changes occurring in the development of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Stillman, W S', 'Varella-Garcia, M', 'Irons, R D']","['Stillman WS', 'Varella-Garcia M', 'Irons RD']","['The Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences Program, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Benzene/toxicity', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/genetics', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion/drug effects']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Feb;28(2):169-76. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00144-7.,,"['S0301-472X(99)00144-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00144-7 [doi]']",,"['ES06258/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA46934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed whether this incubation period improved recognition of AML cells by CTL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of costimulatory and adhesion molecules on leukemic blasts of 34 patients comprising each AML FAB subclassification were analyzed directly and after 24 hours of culture, and the recognition of these AML cells by an HLA-A2 restricted CTL clone was determined. Blocking studies were performed with antibodies against CD54, CD58, and CD11a. RESULTS: Immunophenotyping showed a low expression of CD80 and CD40 and a variable CD86 expression on most AML cells. CD54 expression was generally low, CD58 expression was high, and CD11a expression was variable, with a higher expression in AML M0, M1, M4, and M5. Twenty-four hours of culture resulted in a significant upregulation of CD40, CD54, and CD58. Impaired recognition of AML cells by the HLA-A2 restricted CTL clone was enhanced 100-200% by 24 hours of preincubation of the leukemic cells. Blocking studies showed the importance of multiple adhesion molecules on the AML cells. CONCLUSION: Low expression of multiple costimulatory and adhesion molecules on AML could be upregulated by 24 hours of culture, which was associated with increased recognition of the AML blasts by CTL. Blocking multiple adhesion molecules completely abolished CTL recognition, showing the importance of the combination of these molecules for T-cell interaction with AML.","['Brouwer, R E', 'Zwinderman, K H', 'Kluin-Nelemans, H C', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H']","['Brouwer RE', 'Zwinderman KH', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Feb;28(2):161-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00143-5.,,"['S0301-472X(99)00143-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00143-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, stromal cells from some MDS RA patients induced an apoptotic change in CD34+ hematopoietic cells. However, the mechanism responsible for this action was unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we established a cloned stromal cell line (LS801) from an MDS RA patient by introducing recombinant SV40-adenovirus vector containing the SV40 early gene. RESULTS: LS801 induced an apoptotic change in CD34+ cells from normal subjects and cloned leukemic cells in a coculture system. When hematopoietic cells were cocultured but kept separate from LS801 by a 0.45-microm Millipore membrane to prevent their attachment, the action of LS801 in inducing apoptosis of hematopoietic cells was inhibited. Additionally, no production of fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor alpha or interferon gamma in LS801 was observed. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the novel stromal cell line LS801 will shed light on research into the mechanism underlying the apoptotic changes induced by stromal cells in hematopoietic cells.","['Aizawa, S', 'Hiramoto, M', 'Hoshi, H', 'Toyama, K', 'Shima, D', 'Handa, H']","['Aizawa S', 'Hiramoto M', 'Hoshi H', 'Toyama K', 'Shima D', 'Handa H']","['Department of Anatomy, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory/*pathology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Feb;28(2):148-55. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00142-3.,,"['S0301472X99001423 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00142-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro studies suggest that veto cells within the progenitors population most likely mediate this facilitating effect. Leukemia relapse is relatively low in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but is greater in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Donor NK cells most likely mediate the resistance to relapse in patients with AML who are recipients of haploidentical transplants. Immune reconstitution in adults but not in children is slow as in adult recipients of HLA matched unrelated bone marrow transplants. The ""mega dose"" concept was also shown recently to be useful for tolerance induction in sublethally irradiated mice, so as to effectively overcome the marked resistance presented by the large number of lymphocytes surviving the sublethal conditioning. Thus, allogeneic chimeras generated by transplantation of large doses of Sca1+Lin- cells, permanently accept allogeneic donor type skin grafts. However, the numbers required to attain this desirable goal may not be easily collected from human donors. Nonalloreactive T cells synergize with murine Sca1+Lin- cells and might, therefore, enable achievement of engraftment of haploidentical transplants in sublethally conditioned patients.","['Reisner, Y', 'Martelli, M F']","['Reisner Y', 'Martelli MF']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. bfrisner@weizmann.weizmann.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Graft Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/therapy', 'Mice']",49,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Feb;28(2):119-27. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00132-0.,,"['S0301-472X(99)00132-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00132-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The carboxy-terminal segment of the third IgG domain of FGFR1 could be encoded by different exons, designated IIIa, IIIb, or IIIc. While exons IIIb or IIIc encode receptor forms with both intracellular and extracellular domains, the FGF receptor becomes potentially a secreted form lacking the intracellular domain and the transmembrane region when exon IIIa is expressed. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we have found that mRNAs encoding the nucleotide sequences of FGFR1-IIIa and FGFR1-IIIc are expressed in HL-60 cells. FGFR1-IIIa fragment was synthesized by a glutathione S-transferase gene fusion system. The purified 33 kDa FGFR1-IIIa fragment fusion protein could bind [125I]-labelled FGF-2 in Western ligand blot analysis. Three species of proteins with the molecular weights of 82, 60, and 50 kDa were identified in serum-free, conditioned medium from HL-60 cells by Western blot using an antiserum against purified FGFR1-IIIa fragment fusion protein. Exposure to FGF-2 caused an increase in [3H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA of HL-60 cells and increased cell proliferation, but the addition of FGFR1-IIIa fragment fusion protein inhibited FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis and caused a dose-dependent inhibition of FGF-2-stimulated cell proliferation. The effects on DNA synthesis were partly reversed by antibody against the FGFR1-IIIa fragment. These results indicate that both cell membrane spanning and secreted FGF receptors are expressed in HL-60 cells, and that the actions of FGFs as paracrine growth factors could be modulated by secreted FGF receptor forms.","['Wang, J F', 'Shen, M', 'Fong, G H', 'Hill, D J']","['Wang JF', 'Shen M', 'Fong GH', 'Hill DJ']","[""Lawson Research Institute, St. Joseph's Health Centre, London, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Solubility', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Growth Factors. 2000;17(3):203-14. doi: 10.3109/08977190009001069.,,['10.3109/08977190009001069 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clostridium septicum infection does not appear to be associated with a single specific defect in cellular or humoral immunity. It has been associated with multiple medical problems, including but not limited to leukemia, malignancy of the bowel, other solid tumors, cyclic neutropenia with enterocolitis, diabetes mellitus, and severe arteriosclerosis. Most cases of C septicum are associated with malignancy, and mortality approaches 100% if care is not rendered within 12 to 24 hours. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate outcomes of patients with C septicum bacteremia, whether treated medically or surgically or both, and to note associated conditions. DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of patients found to have C septicum bacteremia in the past 6 years. SETTING: Two teaching hospitals, Brooke Army Medical Center (250 beds) and Wilford Hall Medical Center (292 beds), were the source of our patients. PATIENTS: All patients found to have C septicum bacteremia during hospitalization or postmortem examination were included in the study. There were no exclusion criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mortality associated with C septicum infection. RESULTS: In our case series, mortality was 33%, which is slightly lower than reported in prior studies (43%-70%). CONCLUSION: Presumptive identification based on Gram stain, awareness of C septicum infection as a paraneoplastic syndrome, and prompt, clear communication between laboratory personnel and clinicians are necessary for early diagnosis of C septicum infection. Early institution of antibiotic therapy improves prognosis.","['Pelletier, J P', 'Plumbley, J A', 'Rouse, E A', 'Cina, S J']","['Pelletier JP', 'Plumbley JA', 'Rouse EA', 'Cina SJ']","['Department of Pathology, Wilford Hall Medical Center, San Antonio, TX 78254, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacteremia/*etiology/microbiology/pathology', 'Child', '*Clostridium/isolation & purification', 'Clostridium Infections/*complications/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/complications/pathology', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*etiology/microbiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2000 Mar;124(3):353-6. doi: 10.5858/2000-124-0353-TROCSI.,,['10.5858/2000-124-0353-TROCSI [doi]'],,,,['Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2000 Nov;124(11):1583.

Despite promising preliminary results, the impact of immunotherapy with interleukin-2 (r-IL-2) on patients with acute leukemia (AL), in first complete remission (CR1) remains unclear. We conducted a prospective multicenter randomized trial to compare outcome in patients with AL in CR1, treated with autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with or without postgraft r-IL-2. One hundred and thirty patients with AL in CR1 (myeloblastic (AML): N = 78; lymphoblastic (ALL): N = 52) were randomized at time of BMT to receive (N = 65) or not (N = 65) r-IL-2. r-IL-2 (RU 49637 from Roussel Uclaf) was started after hematological recovery, as a five cycle regimen (12 M IU/m2/day continuous infusion on day 1-5, 15-17, 29-31,43-45 and 57-59). The two groups were balanced for patient and transplant characteristics. Analysis was based on an intent to treat. Thirty-eight (59%) of the 65 patients randomized into the study group started r-IL-2 at a median of sixty-eight days (23-140) after transplant and received 77% (16-100) of the scheduled dosage. They received a median of 120 x 10(6) IU/m2 (25-156) over 10 (3-13) days during a total median period of 56 (3-78) days. With a median follow-up of 7 years (5.4-8.1 years), 79 patients relapsed (study group: 43 (66%); control group: 36 (55%): p = NS). Survival and leukemia-free survival estimates were 33% (23-45) versus 43% (22-52) and 29% (19-41) versus 36% (24-51) respectively for study and control groups (all p = NS). These results show that leukemic control after autologous BMT is not increased by r-IL-2 therapy. Further studies should investigate more appropriate r-IL-2 schedules and the possibilities offered by better antigen recognition and activated effector cells.","['Blaise, D', 'Attal, M', 'Reiffers, J', 'Michallet, M', 'Bellanger, C', 'Pico, J L', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Payen, C', 'Marit, G', 'Bouabdallah, R', 'Sotto, J J', 'Rossi, J F', 'Brandely, M', 'Hercend, T', 'Maraninchi, D']","['Blaise D', 'Attal M', 'Reiffers J', 'Michallet M', 'Bellanger C', 'Pico JL', 'Stoppa AM', 'Payen C', 'Marit G', 'Bouabdallah R', 'Sotto JJ', 'Rossi JF', 'Brandely M', 'Hercend T', 'Maraninchi D']","['Unite de Transplantation et de Therapie Cellulaire, Universite de la Mediterranee, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, 232, bd Sainte-Marguerite, 13273 Marseille Cedex 9 France. blaised@marseille.fnclcc.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/03/08 00:00,2000/03/08 00:01,['2000/03/08 00:00'],"['2000/03/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/08 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 2000 Mar;11(1):91-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now searched in the same cohort of patients for differences between patients who responded to treatment and remained free of complications and those who relapsed or developed a clonal complication. From 107 patients surviving for more than 1 year after immunosuppression, 34 remained free from complications after the first course of ALG, and 73 presented an event defined as relapse of aplastic anemia, development of a clonal complication such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia, or appearance of a solid tumor. We compared these two groups for survival, clinical performance and blood counts during follow-up. Survival probability was 93% for the event-free patients, and 55% for the patients with a complication event (p = 0.0003). Event-free patients had a higher incidence of complete remission (71%), were more often free of immunosuppressive treatment (79%) and independent of transfusions (100%), and had a higher Karnofsky score (91% with a score > or =90%) as compared to the group with events (29, 37, 67, 48%; p < or = 0.0002). At 1 and 3 years, event-free patients had significantly higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts, as compared to patients with a complication (p < 0.05). However, at 3 and 5 years, event-free patients had borderline higher platelet counts (p = 0.056, p = 0.078) and hemoglobin (p = 0. 097, p = 0.061). The coefficient of variation as an expression of the variability of the results in each group was systematically lower at 3, 5 and 10 years in the group of event-free patients.

To produce peripheral blood values compatible with life, the few remaining stem and precursor cells are put under stress. We defined a 'stress factor' (SF) for various haematopoietic lines as the ratio of the corresponding peripheral blood (PB) value to the total colony number in short-term bone marrow cultures from 86 patients with different outcomes. Both values are expressed as percentage of normal, hence SF averages 1 in normal steady-state haematopoiesis. SF was elevated in all patients, from 2-to 40-fold, with wide variations in different patient groups and striking differences between haematopoietic lineages. In long-term disease-free survivors after ALG (group 1) the mean total colony count was 19% of normal, with a significantly higher proportion of erythroid burst-forming units compared to normal. They had ineffective erythropoiesis with haemoglobin (Hb) values below, and reticulocyte counts above normal; platelet counts were 67% of normal. In contrast, monocyte counts were in the high normal range, resulting in a high SF (18.7 +/- 1.9) for monocytes. In patients who developed paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) after ALG (group 2), ineffective erythropoiesis, reflecting haemolysis, was more pronounced and they had striking relative monocytosis, resulting in a significantly higher SF for monocytes (33.7 +/- 5.7) compared with group 1 (p < 0.0001). High monocyte counts most likely reflect the relative resistance of nucleated cells to complement, compared with red cells and platelets. Patients who developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) after ALG, with or without PNH (group 3), had the highest SF for monocytes (39 +/- 10). They also had neutrophil counts in the upper range, or above normal, resulting in a high SF for neutrophils: 32 +/- 19. In patients with persisting or relapsing-remitting pancytopenia without a clinically detectable clonal disorder (group 4), all values were strikingly similar to those of the PNH group. In patients who achieved normal PB values after uncomplicated bone marrow transplantation (group 5), the SF averaged 3, but they also had ineffective erythropoiesis and mild relative monocytosis, a possible sign of occult PNH. We conclude that all patients after treatment of SAA have ineffective erythropoiesis and relative monocytosis, and that these abnormalities probably reflect PNH. We suggest that the resulting high SF for the leukocyte - particularly the monocyte line - predisposes to the development of MDS/AML. We discuss how these results may provide some of the missing pieces in the puzzle of SAA/PNH.","['Nissen, C', 'Genitsch, A', 'Sendelov, S', 'Dalle Carbonare, V', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz, A']","['Nissen C', 'Genitsch A', 'Sendelov S', 'Dalle Carbonare V', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz A']","['Department of Research and Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Haematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland. nissen@magnet.ch']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*complications/pathology/therapy', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cohort Studies', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*complications/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cells']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;103(1):33-40. doi: 10.1159/000041002.,,"['41002 [pii]', '10.1159/000041002 [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 S.

However, under supportive therapy alone, spontaneous remissions were observed in up to 20% of severe cases, reflecting the natural course of the disease. Therefore, in evaluating new forms of treatment, one has to keep in mind that remission is not necessarily response, and that final proof of utility of any new therapy still requires a randomized study design. Transition to leukemia or myelodysplasia was rarely observed if the initial diagnosis was accurate. The much higher incidence of leukemias in patients treated by IST, but not by BMT is probably due to the better life expectancy of patients at risk, rather than to a leukemogenic potential of IST itself. 'Outdated' therapeutic modalities, such as androgens or splenectomy, may still be justified as an adjuvant therapy in selected cases.","['Heimpel, H']",['Heimpel H'],"['Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Ulm, Deutschland. hermann.heimpel@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/diagnosis/*history/therapy', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*history/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*history', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/history', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/history', 'Pancytopenia/history', 'Prognosis']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;103(1):11-5. doi: 10.1159/000040998.,,"['40998 [pii]', '10.1159/000040998 [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 S.

The cholinergic marker protein vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), co-expressed in mature cholinergic sympathetic neurons, are first detectable during embryonic development of rat sympathetic ganglia. However, the subpopulation of cholinergic sympathetic neurons which innervates sweat glands in mammalian footpads starts to express VAChT and VIP during the first postnatal weeks, under the influence of sweat gland-derived signals. In vitro evidence suggests that the sweat gland-derived cholinergic differentiation factor belongs to a group of neuropoietic cytokines, including LIF, CNTF and CT-1, that act through a LIFRbeta-containing cytokine receptor. To investigate whether the embryonic expression of cholinergic properties is elicited by a related cytokine, the expression of VAChT and VIP was analyzed in stellate ganglia of mice deficient for the cytokine receptor subunits LIFRbeta or CNTFRalpha. The density of VAChT- and VIP-immunoreactive cells in stellate ganglia of new-born animals was not different in LIFRbeta(-/-) and CNTFRalpha(-/-) ganglia as compared to ganglia from wild-type mice.

We have investigated the potential of Shc to integrate IL-3 signalling pathways and demonstrate that Shc associates with the beta subunits of the human (betac) and murine (Aic2A) IL-3 receptors, SHIP and Gab2 following IL-3 stimulation. The interaction between Shc and the IL-3 receptor beta chains was direct, mediated by both the SH2 and PTB domains. Interaction with SHIP was via the Shc PTB domain and the Shc SH2 domain mediated the interaction with Gab2. Phosphopeptide competition studies suggest that the SH2 domain interacts primarily with tyrosine 612 of betac (610 of Aic2A), and the PTB domain with tyrosine 577 of betac (575 of Aic2A). PTB binding to IL-3R beta chains was of highest affinity, and appeared to play the primary role in binding. These findings suggest that Shc may play an important role in coordinately integrating IL-3 signalling pathways.","['Bone, H', 'Welham, M J']","['Bone H', 'Welham MJ']","['Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (GAB2 protein, human)', '0 (Gab2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', '*src Homology Domains']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2000 Mar;12(3):183-94. doi: 10.1016/s0898-6568(99)00088-1.,,"['S0898-6568(99)00088-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0898-6568(99)00088-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the cytokines tested, oncostatin M resulted in the most dramatic induction of Stat1 and Stat3 in all cell lines analysed, as assessed by the formation of protein/DNA complexes. Interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor also induced Stat complexes more selectively and to a lesser magnitude than oncostatin M. The kinetics of Stat1 and Stat3 activation was rapid and transient; the nuclear accumulation of DNA binding-proficient Stat protein was detected in the nucleus within minutes of cytokine induction. The transcriptional potential of the oncostatin M-activated Stat molecules was demonstrated in two glioma cell lines (U87-MG, SNB-19) by transient transfection experiments using a Stat-responsive reporter plasmid. Oncostatin M-dependent transcription from this reporter plasmid was reduced to uninduced levels by the inclusion of a dominant-negative Stat3 molecule, demonstrating that Stat molecules were responsible for the induction. These studies demonstrate that oncostatin M is the most potent activator of Stat molecules in a variety of brain tumour-derived cell lines, an observation that could have implications affecting the balance between proliferation/apoptosis of these cells.","['Schaefer, L K', 'Menter, D G', 'Schaefer, T S']","['Schaefer LK', 'Menter DG', 'Schaefer TS']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2000 Mar;12(3):143-51. doi: 10.1016/s0898-6568(99)00077-7.,,"['S0898-6568(99)00077-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0898-6568(99)00077-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, adult mice with or without LIF gene deletions were used to study the role of LIF in regeneration. The results show that axonal regeneration in vitro from dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) was unaffected by LIF deletion. However, segments from wild type mice promoted DRG axonal outgrowth better than segments from LIF deleted animals when in vivo-injured sciatic nerve segments were co-cultured with DRGs from normal adult mice. Addition of LIF could not restore the deficit.

Our results focus on marrow morphology, and suggest that morphologic MDS may be more important than classical cytogenetics in prediction of an adverse outcome.","['Alter, B P', 'Caruso, J P', 'Drachtman, R A', 'Uchida, T', 'Velagaleti, G V', 'Elghetany, M T']","['Alter BP', 'Caruso JP', 'Drachtman RA', 'Uchida T', 'Velagaleti GV', 'Elghetany MT']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'Fanconi Anemia/*complications/genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2000 Mar;117(2):125-31. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00159-4.,,"['S0165-4608(99)00159-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00159-4 [doi]']",,['MO1RR00073/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transgenic mice overexpressing LIF have mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. Also, during local inflammatory reactions, such as kidney graft rejection or urinary tract infections, urinary LIF excretion is enhanced. The aim of the study therefore was to study LIF production by normal and inflammatory diseased kidneys (glomerulonephritis or graft rejection), maintained in short cultures. To determine the responsibility of the kidney itself in LIF synthesis, we measured LIF secretion into the culture supernatants of human mesangial or renal tubular epithelial cells. Fragments from diseased kidneys, whether grafts or not, released more LIF than normal human kidney fragments, mesangial or renal tubular epithelial cells. However, LIF production was delayed in renal transplants compared to glomerulonephritic samples taken from untreated patients. In every case, LIF production was enhanced by interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and inhibited by IL-4 or dexamethasone, except in two severe rejection episodes. So, LIF appeared to respond to pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli, in vitro and in vivo. Considering its biological effects, LIF could play a role in inflammatory renal diseases.","['Morel, D S', 'Taupin, J L', 'Potier, M', 'Deminiere, C', 'Potaux, L', 'Gualde, N', 'Moreau, J F']","['Morel DS', 'Taupin JL', 'Potier M', 'Deminiere C', 'Potaux L', 'Gualde N', 'Moreau JF']","['Department of Nephrology and Kidney Transplant, Hopital Pellegrin, Bordeaux, France. delphine.morel@chu-acquitaine.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glomerular Mesangium/cytology/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kidney/*metabolism', 'Kidney Diseases/*metabolism/pathology', 'Kidney Tubules/cytology/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged']",,2000/03/08 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/08 09:00'],"['2000/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2000 Mar;12(3):265-71. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1999.0545.,,"['10.1006/cyto.1999.0545 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(99)90545-8 [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to see whether the occasional relatively favorable outcome in -5/-7 patients is a random event or, rather, reflects true heterogeneity in -5/-7. DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 3 factors known to be prognostic in AML for their prognostic significance in 400 -5/-7 patients treated at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1980-1998 for AML or MDS. The outcome of comparative interest was survival as assessed by log-rank test. RESULTS: There was evidence that outcome was better in -5/-7 patients with a simple (rather than complex) karyotype, with > 1 normal metaphase (rather than only metaphases containing -5/-7), and without an antecedent hematologic disorder. More importantly, the 10% of the patients with a simple karyotype, > 1 normal metaphase, and no antecedent hematologic disorder not only had a better outcome than the other -5/-7 patients but had essentially identical outcomes to the 669 AML/MDS patients with a normal karyotype treated at M.D. Anderson during the same period. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the -5/-7 group should not a priori be regarded as having an unfavorable prognosis, and more generally suggest the need to refine prognosis within each of the cytogenetic subsets of AML.","['Estey, E H', 'Pierce, S', 'Keating, M J']","['Estey EH', 'Pierce S', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, Box 61, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. eeskky@odin.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*blood', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Metaphase/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2000/03/07 09:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['2000/03/07 09:00'],"['2000/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Mar;85(3):246-9.,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2000 Mar;85(3):226.

Since cellular redox state regulates these events, we were interested in studying whether it has any role in the responsiveness of AML cells to ATRA. DESIGN AND METHODS: Two human AML cell lines, the ATRA-sensitive OU-AML-3, and the ATRA-resistant OU-AML-7, were used as models. Clonogenic cell culture assay, annexin V method, and measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential were used for the determination of cell growth and apoptosis. Peroxide formation was analyzed by flow cytometry, glutathione and g-glutamylcysteine synthetase (g-GCS) activity was determined spectrophotometrically, and the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) by Western blotting. RESULTS: ATRA inhibited clonogenic cell growth and induced apoptosis particularly in OU-AML-3 cells. The OU-AML-7 cells had a higher basal level of glutathione and g-GCS activity than the OU-AML-3 cells. ATRA enhanced the generation of peroxides after 24h exposure, which was more prominent in the sensitive than the resistant cell line and was not preventable by N-acetyl-L-cysteine. ATRA also increased the activity of g-GCS, which was associated with increased intracellular glutathione in the resistant cell line, while the glutathione level was maintained in the sensitive cell line. During ATRA exposure, MnSOD was induced in the sensitive cell line, but not until after 72 h. Buthionine sulfoximine significantly increased the inhibitory effect of ATRA on colony formation in both cell lines, but only marginally enhanced the effect of ATRA on the induction of apoptosis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The balance between oxidative and antioxidative actions of ATRA, as well as the basal redox state of the cells seem to have a definite influence on the responsiveness of AML cells to ATRA.","['Mantymaa, P', 'Guttorm, T', 'Siitonen, T', 'Saily, M', 'Savolainen, E R', 'Levonen, A L', 'Kinnula, V', 'Koistinen, P']","['Mantymaa P', 'Guttorm T', 'Siitonen T', 'Saily M', 'Savolainen ER', 'Levonen AL', 'Kinnula V', 'Koistinen P']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Glutathione/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Peroxides/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism/physiology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/physiology', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/drug effects/metabolism']",,2000/03/07 09:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['2000/03/07 09:00'],"['2000/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Mar;85(3):238-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutant epo receptors were introduced into these cells to determine whether they could influence the different biological responses to epo in vitro and the development of erythroleukemias. Three mutant receptors were used as cytoplasmic truncation mutants Delta257 and Delta321 (above box 1 and below box 2 respectively), and the cytoplasmic point mutant W282R (defective for JAK2 activation). Strikingly, the Delta321 mutation produced a hyper-sensitive response in vitro to epo-induced differentiation and viability, but not to proliferation. In contrast with the Delta321 receptor, the Delta257 and W282R mutants inhibited all biological responses to epo due to impaired JAK2 phosphorylation. Significantly, erythroleukemias took almost twice as long to develop with cells containing the W282R mutation, indicating that JAK2 plays an important role in the emergence of these leukemias.

It was recently demonstrated that in transfected T-cells HePTP impairs TCR-mediated activation of the MAP-kinase family members ERK2 and p38 and it was suggested that both ERK and p38 MAP-kinases are substrates of HePTP. The HePTP gene has been mapped to human chromosome 1q32.1. Abnormalities in this region are frequently found in various hematopoietic malignancies. HePTP is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia and its expression in fibroblasts resulted in transformation. To address a possible involvement of HePTP in hematopoietic malignancies we sought to identify HePTP substrate(s) in leukemic cells. Using substrate trapping mutants we have identified the MAP-kinase ERK2 as a specific target of HePTP in the myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. Tyrosine phosphorylated ERK2, but not ERK1, p38, or JNK1, efficiently bound to catalytically inactive HePTP mutants in which the active site cysteine (HePTP-C/S) or the conserved aspartic acid residue (HePTP-D/A) had been exchanged for serine and alanine, respectively. Moreover, the interaction of ERK2 with HePTP trapping mutants was dependent on ERK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that HePTP is specifically targeted to activated ERK2. Using a deletion mutant of HePTP (HePTP-dLD), in which 14 amino acid residues within the N-terminus are missing, we show that regions outside the catalytic domain are also required for the interaction. Furthermore, overexpression of HePTP in K562 cells and fibroblasts interfered with PMA or growth factor induced MAP-kinase activation and HePTP efficiently dephosphorylated active ERK2 on the tyrosine residue in the activation loop in vitro. Together, these data identify ERK2 as a specific and direct target of HePTP and are consistent with a model in which HePTP negatively regulates ERK2 activity as part of a feedback mechanism.

To a certain extent, carcinomas preserve differentiation markers of normal tissue, and hemoblastoses precisely reflect the direction and differentiation level of their precursor cells. Both tumor types retain the ability to differentiate. Mechanisms of T and B cell differentiation are reviewed considering the activation of protooncogenes by translocation to the region of tissue-specific genes including the immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) genes. Apart from the classical oncogenes (MYC, PRAD, BCL-2), heterologous differentiation of trans-factors can be activated in a similar manner. Their activation at inappropriate time and place induces oncogenic transformation in a number of hemoblastoses. Chimeric genes and fused proteins are analyzed, including their genesis by specific translocation resulting in transformation and their role in differentiation and maintenance of the tumor phenotype. Induction of terminal differentiation in leukemia can have significant therapeutic effect. These hemoblastoses include hairy cell leukemia, promyelocytic leukemia, and in part chronic myeloid leukemia. Specific attention is given to the role of intercellular interactions in the control of tumor growth and maintenance of a differentiated state of the cells. It is suggested that alterations in these interactions during tumor progression simultaneously stimulate malignant growth and decrease differentiation level, thus inducing re-expression of embryonic antigens in the tumors.","['Abelev, G I']",['Abelev GI'],"['Institute of Carcinogenesis, Blokhin Cancer Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, 115478, Russia. abelev@mx.iki.rssi.ru']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Biochemistry (Mosc),Biochemistry.

This group of viruses consists of T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV 1), herpes viruses (HHV 8 and Epstein-Barr virus), hepatitis B virus, and human papilloma viruses. The most typical feature of this group of viruses is a very long latent period from the initial infection to the development of the disease that varies between 10 and 40 years. The mechanism of malignant cell conversion is specific for each viral type but is mainly associated with a disruption of functions of cellular genes participating in the control of cell division and proliferation. It can be a direct inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by their interaction with viral gene products (papilloma viruses), or a trans-activation of cellular genes modulating cell proliferation by viral gene products (hepatitis B virus and HTLV 1). Viruses play an initiative role and additional genetic changes in the genome of infected cells are necessary for complete expression of the oncogenic potential of the viral genes. Only these cells will give rise to a monoclonal cell population with uncontrolled proliferation. New approaches for the creation of vaccines against cancers associated with hepatitis B virus and papilloma viruses (hepatocellular carcinomas and cervical tumors, respectively) are in progress. These vaccines have been found to be effective in prevention of the disease in the experimental models and are now beginning to be used for human vaccination.","['Kisseljov, F L']",['Kisseljov FL'],"['Institute of Carcinogenesis, Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center, Moscow, 115478, Russia. f.kis@cityline.ru']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Biochemistry (Mosc),Biochemistry.

Blood from donors positive for antibodies to HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 is not used for transfusion. However, patients with the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma mycosis fungoides (MF) are HTLV-1 and -2 seronegative yet harbor proviral sequences identical to those that encode the HTLV-1 transactivating and transforming gene product p40tax in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and they usually have antibodies to p40(tax). Moreover, a study of 250 randomly selected blood donors revealed that approximately 8% of these seronegative individuals also had HTLV-1 tax sequences and antibodies to p40(tax), while they lacked sequences and antibodies related to gag, pol, or env. Thus, it seemed important to determine whether the ""tax-only"" state can be transmitted by transfusion. To this end, PBMCs from HTLV-1 and -2 seronegative tax-only-positive MF patients or from healthy tax-only-positive blood donors were injected into adult rabbits, an established animal model for HTLV-1 infection.

We have examined the role of HTLV-I in these two distinctly different clinical syndromes by examining the life cycle of the virus, with emphasis on the regulation of viral gene expression within relevant target cell populations. In particular, we have examined the impact of specific viral gene products, particularly Tax, on cellular metabolic function. Tax is a highly promiscuous and pleiotropic viral oncoprotein, and is the most important factor contributing to the initial stages of viral-mediated transformation of T cells after HTLV-I infection. Tax, which weakly binds to Tax response element 1 (TRE-1) in the viral long terminal repeat (LTR), can dramatically trans-activate viral gene expression by interacting with cellular transcription factors, such as activated transcription factors and cyclic AMP response element binding proteins (ATF/CREB), CREB binding protein (CBP/p300), and factors involved with the basic transcription apparatus. At the same time, Tax alters cellular gene expression by directly or indirectly interacting with a variety of cellular transcription factors, cell cycle control elements, and cellular signal transduction molecules ultimately resulting in dysregulated cell proliferation. The mechanisms associated with HTLV-I infection, leading to tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) are not as clearly resolved. Possible explanations of viral-induced neurologic disease range from central nervous system (CNS) damage caused by direct viral invasion of the CNS to bystander CNS damage caused by the immune response to HTLV-I infection. It is interesting to note that it is very rare for an HTLV-I infected individual to develop both adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and TSP in his/her life time, suggesting that the mechanisms governing development of these two diseases are mutually exclusive.","['Yao, J', 'Wigdahl, B']","['Yao J', 'Wigdahl B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/epidemiology/metabolism/*virology', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/epidemiology/metabolism/*virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/virology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Virus Replication']",314,2000/03/07 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/07 09:00'],"['2000/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Front Biosci. 2000 Jan 1;5:D138-68. doi: 10.2741/yao.,,['10.2741/yao [doi]'],,['CA 54559-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,20000101,,,,,,,

As such, it has been considered a potential target for antineoplastic therapy. For this purpose, we have examined the role of ERK activation in myeloid leukemia cell growth and differentiation. Using a representative set of myeloid leukemia cell lines, we show that cell proliferation was not accompanied by increases on ERK1/2 activation, and mitogenic stimulation did not enhance ERK activity. Moreover, abolition of ERK function by the inhibitor PD98059 or by a dominant inhibitory mutant ERK2 had no significant effects on proliferation. With the aid of various differentiation inducers, we found that within the same cell line, differentiation to a given lineage could occur with and without ERK1/2 activation, depending on the stimulus. Also, a differentiator could have the same effect in the presence or absence of ERK stimulation, depending on the cell line. ERK inhibition did not affect the differentiation elicited by stimuli whose effects were accompanied by ERK activation. Finally, constitutive ERK activity was also ineffective on proliferation and differentiation.

DESIGN AND METHODS: To address these questions we used thyroid cell lines transformed with E1A oncogene from adenoviruses 5 (PC E1A cell line) or 2 (PC HE4 cell line), or infected with the polyoma murine leukemia virus (PC PyMLV cell line) carrying the middle T gene of the polyoma virus, or, finally, expressing both E1A and PyMLV. These cell lines present various degrees of malignancy: PC EIA and PC HE4 cells are not tumorigenic; PC PyMLV cells induce non-invasive tumors after a long latency period; and PC EIA+PyMLV cells are highly tumorigenic. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid cell proliferation required the transient increase of intracellular cAMP levels, while persistent elevation of cAMP blocked the proliferation of normal thyroid PC Cl 3 cells and of PC Cl 3 cells transformed by a variety of different oncogenes. In addition, sustained levels of cAMP induced apoptosis in cells carrying the adenovirus EIA oncogene, but not in cells transformed with other oncogenes or in the wild-type PC Cl 3 cells. Furthermore, middle T gene of the polyoma virus seemed to afford protection only from apoptosis induced by cAMP when middle T is present in thyroid cells along with the E1A gene.","['Villone, G', 'De Vita, G', 'Chieffi, P', 'Picascia, A', 'Stanzione, R', 'Santoro, M', 'Fusco, A', 'Tramontano, D']","['Villone G', 'De Vita G', 'Chieffi P', 'Picascia A', 'Stanzione R', 'Santoro M', 'Fusco A', 'Tramontano D']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale e Clinica Gaetano Salvatore, Universita di Catanzaro Magna Graecia, via T Campanella 115, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E1A Proteins/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Polyomavirus/genetics', 'Rats', 'Thyroid Gland/cytology/*metabolism', 'Thyrotropin/physiology']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 2000 Mar;142(3):286-93. doi: 10.1530/eje.0.1420286.,,"['1420286 [pii]', '10.1530/eje.0.1420286 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several reports have indicated that anti-epileptic drugs (AED) affect the immune system, but the mechanism has not been clear. We examined whether the commonly used AEDs, diazepam (DZP), carbamazepine (CBZ), phenobarbital (PB), phenytoin (PHT), and VPA, can inhibit activation of the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), in human monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) and in human glioma cells (A-172). NF-kappaB is essential to the expression of the kappa light chain of immunoglobulin and proinflammatory cytokines. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) of nuclear extracts demonstrated that VPA inhibits NF-kappaB activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but the other AEDs do not. Western blot analysis revealed that this inhibition is not linked to preservation of expression of IkappaBalpha protein. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay indicated that NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression is suppressed in glioma cells pretreated with VPA. VPA significantly inhibited LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by THP-1 cells, whereas other AEDs did not. The findings are consistent with the idea that VPA suppresses TNF-alpha and IL-6 production via inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Our results suggest that VPA can modulate immune responses in vitro. These findings raise the possibility that such modulation might occur with clinical use of VPA.","['Ichiyama, T', 'Okada, K', 'Lipton, J M', 'Matsubara, T', 'Hayashi, T', 'Furukawa, S']","['Ichiyama T', 'Okada K', 'Lipton JM', 'Matsubara T', 'Hayashi T', 'Furukawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Minamikogushi, Ube, Japan. ichiyama@po.cc.yamaguchi-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2000 Feb 28;857(1-2):246-51. doi: 10.1016/s0006-8993(99)02439-7.,,"['S0006-8993(99)02439-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-8993(99)02439-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bedside assessment of fluid shifts was carried out in neutropenic patients at high risk of systemic infection. METHODS: Multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed in 41 patients with leukemia or high-malignant lymphoma and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. RESULTS: Hydration was stable during afebrile periods except for transient intra- and extracellular dehydration after chemotherapy. The risk of over-hydration and dehydration increased 3-fold during fever. Over-hydration was more severe when occurring during fever. Extracellular water was highly variable and tended to increase, and intracellular water was slowly depleted. During sepsis, these alterations were enhanced. Changes in hydration status did not predict subsequent progression to sepsis because it developed more slowly than other symptoms of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular over-hydration and intracellular dehydration are observed in febrile infection in neutropenia, similar to severe sepsis. If the technical limits of bioelectrical impedance are taken into account, this method may be useful for non-invasive monitoring of these features of metabolic stress.","['Schwenk, A', 'Schlottmann, S', 'Kremer, G', 'Diehl, V', 'Salzberger, B', 'Ward, L']","['Schwenk A', 'Schlottmann S', 'Kremer G', 'Diehl V', 'Salzberger B', 'Ward L']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Universitat Koln, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Nutr,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",8309603,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Dehydration/physiopathology', 'Electric Impedance', 'Extracellular Space/physiology', 'Female', 'Fever/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Fluid Shifts/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/physiology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications/physiopathology', 'Sepsis/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors', 'Water Intoxication/physiopathology']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Nutr. 2000 Feb;19(1):35-41. doi: 10.1054/clnu.1999.0070.,,"['10.1054/clnu.1999.0070 [doi]', 'S0261-5614(99)90070-5 [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The consistent relationship between the gene expression patterns and the tissue of origin allowed us to recognize outliers whose previous classification appeared incorrect. Specific features of the gene expression patterns appeared to be related to physiological properties of the cell lines, such as their doubling time in culture, drug metabolism or the interferon response. Comparison of gene expression patterns in the cell lines to those observed in normal breast tissue or in breast tumour specimens revealed features of the expression patterns in the tumours that had recognizable counterparts in specific cell lines, reflecting the tumour, stromal and inflammatory components of the tumour tissue. These results provided a novel molecular characterization of this important group of human cell lines and their relationships to tumours in vivo.","['Ross, D T', 'Scherf, U', 'Eisen, M B', 'Perou, C M', 'Rees, C', 'Spellman, P', 'Iyer, V', 'Jeffrey, S S', 'Van de Rijn, M', 'Waltham, M', 'Pergamenschikov, A', 'Lee, J C', 'Lashkari, D', 'Shalon, D', 'Myers, T G', 'Weinstein, J N', 'Botstein, D', 'Brown, P O']","['Ross DT', 'Scherf U', 'Eisen MB', 'Perou CM', 'Rees C', 'Spellman P', 'Iyer V', 'Jeffrey SS', 'Van de Rijn M', 'Waltham M', 'Pergamenschikov A', 'Lee JC', 'Lashkari D', 'Shalon D', 'Myers TG', 'Weinstein JN', 'Botstein D', 'Brown PO']","['Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Breast/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Organ Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/classification/drug effects/*metabolism']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2001/03/23 10:01,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2000 Mar;24(3):227-35. doi: 10.1038/73432.,,['10.1038/73432 [doi]'],,['CA 077097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Nat Genet. 2000 Mar;24(3):208-9.

A (31)P NMR spectroscopic study of Victoria-Blue-BO-sensitized TF-1 cells.,733-9,"Victoria Blue BO (VB BO) is a new and promising photosensitizer currently being evaluated for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Its photochemical processes are mediated by oxygen radicals, but do not involve singlet oxygen. We used (31)P NMR spectroscopy of VB-BO sensitized TF-1 leukemic cells to gain further insight into the biochemical mechanisms underlying PDT-induced cell death. Sham-treatment experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of this photosensitizer in the absence of light irradiation. Significant metabolic differences were detected for TF-1 cells incubated with VB BO but not exposed to light, as compared with native cells (controls). These changes include reductions in phosphocreatine, UDP-hexose and phosphodiester levels (as percentage of total phosphate) and slightly reduced intracellular pH. Complete phosphocreatine depletion, significant acidification and concomitant inorganic-phosphate accumulation were observed for TF-1 cells irradiated after incubation with VB BO. Moreover, significant changes in phospholipid metabolites, i.e., accumulation of cytidine 5'-diphosphate choline and a decrease in phosphodiester levels, were observed for PDT-treated vs. sham-treated cells. Perturbations of phospholipid metabolism may be involved in programmed cell death, and the detection of a characteristic DNA ladder pattern by gel electrophoresis confirmed the existence of apoptosis in PDT-treated TF-1 cells.","['Viola, A', 'Lutz, N W', 'Maroc, C', 'Chabannon, C', 'Julliard, M', 'Cozzone, P J']","['Viola A', 'Lutz NW', 'Maroc C', 'Chabannon C', 'Julliard M', 'Cozzone PJ']","['Laboratoire AM3, ESA-CNRS 6009, Faculte Saint-Jerome, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '020IUV4N33 (Phosphocreatine)', '2390-60-5 (Victoria blue BO)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Free Radicals/analysis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/metabolism', 'Phosphocreatine/metabolism', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*toxicity', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Mar 1;85(5):733-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000301)85:5<733::aid-ijc22>3.0.co;2-c.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000301)85:5<733::AID-IJC22>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000301)85:5<733::aid-ijc22>3.0.co;2-c [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic significance of this association is unknown. Two cohorts of patients with a first diagnosis of non-melanoma skin cancer and a subsequent diagnosis of either NHL (n = 170) or colon cancer (n = 435) were established using national cancer registry data in Denmark. Two other cohorts of patients in whom NHL (n = 600) or colon cancer (n = 1,541) was the patients' first known malignancy served as comparison groups. Mortality rates were compared using Cox's regression analysis. Among patients younger than 80 years at NHL diagnosis, a history of non-melanoma skin cancer was associated with significantly increased mortality [relative risk (RR) = 1.54; 95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.99]. This association was present in both men (RR = 1.38; 1.02-1.86) and women (RR = 2.15; 1.31-3.54) and was similar after both major subtypes of non-melanoma skin cancer. Overall, antedating non-melanoma skin cancer had no prognostic significance for colon cancer patients (RR = 1.00; 0.84-1.18).

To determine if the PML gene might be involved in other neoplasias such as lung cancer, PML expression was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization. Considerable PML protein expression in the PML-oncogenic domain (POD) structure was found in adenocarcinomas (ADC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the lung, but was almost completely absent in all the small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) examined. In situ hybridization showed that both mRNA and DNA of PML were present in SCLC and in normal lung, suggesting that the decreased protein expression was due to either a defect in translation or protein instability, rather than the consequence of decreased transcription or gene deletion. Double staining showed that PML expression was inversely correlated with the proliferation marker Ki-67 and positively correlated with levels of apoptotic cells in these tumors. To determine if the precursor cells of SCLC, the neuroendocrine-producing cells, express PML, double labeling was performed with PML and chromogranin A, a bio-marker for neuroendocrine cells. Neuroendocrine cells from normal tissues were found to be PML positive, indicating that the lack of PML protein in SCLC is associated with the tumorigenic phenotype and is not the result of cell-lineage specificity. Thus, the decreased PML expression may play an important role in SCLC development.","['Zhang, P', 'Chin, W', 'Chow, L T', 'Chan, A S', 'Yim, A P', 'Leung, S F', 'Mok, T S', 'Chang, K S', 'Johnson, P J', 'Chan, J Y']","['Zhang P', 'Chin W', 'Chow LT', 'Chan AS', 'Yim AP', 'Leung SF', 'Mok TS', 'Chang KS', 'Johnson PJ', 'Chan JY']","['Department of Surgery, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Mar 1;85(5):599-605. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000301)85:5<599::aid-ijc1>3.0.co;2-#.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000301)85:5<599::AID-IJC1>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000301)85:5<599::aid-ijc1>3.0.co;2-# [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study dissects the response to taxanes of HL60 acute myelomonocytic leukemia and of K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia, in parallel over a 72-hr time-span. The kinetics of cytotoxicity following pulsed and continuous exposure to either taxol or taxotere showed a delayed response of K562 cells independently of dose and type of exposure. In K562 cells, apoptosis became evident at 48 hr and prominent at 72 hr of treatment. These events were mirrored by delayed kinetics of caspase-3 activation. Comparable microtubule targeting was demonstrated in HL60 and in K562 cell lines, as bcl-2 and raf-1 were phosphorylated following treatment with taxanes. These observations indicate that early activation processes were responsible for apoptosis, but that the delay was determined by other factors. In addition, cell-free-system experiments excluded the presence of excess nuclear and/or cytoplasmic inhibitory factors and demonstrated that K562 cells possess a fully competent caspase system which can be readily activated. Processing of caspase-3 pro-enzyme was in fact increased by addition of cytochrome c. These results extend to taxol and taxotere the notion that drug-induced apoptosis is delayed upstream of caspase-3 activation in K562 cells, that such kinetics is independent of drug concentration and exposure time, and that it is linked to intrinsic cellular characteristics mapping between bcl-2 phosphorylation and cytochrome c release.","['Gangemi, R M', 'Santamaria, B', 'Bargellesi, A', 'Cosulich, E', 'Fabbi, M']","['Gangemi RM', 'Santamaria B', 'Bargellesi A', 'Cosulich E', 'Fabbi M']","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Docetaxel', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Paclitaxel/*analogs & derivatives/*toxicity', '*Taxoids', 'Time Factors']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Feb 15;85(4):527-33. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000215)85:4<527::aid-ijc14>3.0.co;2-#.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000215)85:4<527::AID-IJC14>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000215)85:4<527::aid-ijc14>3.0.co;2-# [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study (Pediatric Oncology Group Protocol 8303) two methods were examined for improving the outcome in these children. METHODS: After remission induction with prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and asparaginase (PVDA) and consolidation chemotherapy with teniposide and cytarabine, patients received weekly continuation chemotherapy with rotating pairs of drugs, comprised of teniposide and cytarabine and vincristine and cyclophosphamide. In addition, they were randomized to receive or not receive repeated reinduction with PVDA. Patients with matched sibling donors were allowed to receive allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) instead of continued chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of 297 evaluable patients 258 (87%) achieved second complete hematologic remission. However, only 23 of these patients remained continuously free of leukemia > or =7 years after chemotherapy or BMT. Neither PVDA pulses nor BMT appeared to influence outcome at a statistically significant level. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study confirm prior reports of the low cure rate of children with ALL who experience hematologic recurrence during initial therapy or shortly after its cessation. New approaches are needed to prevent and retreat hematologic recurrence in pediatric ALL patients.","['Buchanan, G R', 'Rivera, G K', 'Pollock, B H', 'Boyett, J M', 'Chauvenet, A R', 'Wagner, H', 'Maybee, D A', 'Crist, W M', 'Pinkel, D']","['Buchanan GR', 'Rivera GK', 'Pollock BH', 'Boyett JM', 'Chauvenet AR', 'Wagner H', 'Maybee DA', 'Crist WM', 'Pinkel D']","['University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,2000/03/04 00:00,2000/03/04 00:01,['2000/03/04 00:00'],"['2000/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Mar 1;88(5):1166-74. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(20000301)88:5<1166::aid-cncr29>3.0.co;2-w.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000301)88:5<1166::AID-CNCR29>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(20000301)88:5<1166::aid-cncr29>3.0.co;2-w [doi]']",['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],"['CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These markers are located within the 11q13-q23 locus. RESULTS: Of the 36 informative cases, 10 (28%) showed deletions (7 LOH and 3 HDs) at the D11S2179 marker. In two patients, the deletions were extended to the MLL gene locus. These deletions were submicroscopic because only 3% (1 of 36) of patients showed abnormalities involving 11q23 using cytogenetic studies. The authors also estimated the levels of ATM protein in 15 ALL patients and 12 healthy volunteers by radioimmunoassay. The ATM protein levels in cases with LOH at the ATM gene were between 15-50% of those from normal bone marrow. In contrast to CLL patients, patients with LOH or HD at the ATM gene locus showed better survival compared with patients without ATM gene deletions (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: LOH of the ATM gene and protein deficiency are common in adult ALL, are not demonstrated at the cytogenetic level, and are associated with a favorable prognosis. The authors speculate that ATM deficiency may increase the sensitivity of leukemic blasts to the chemotherapy used during induction and after disease remission in patients with adult ALL. The relatively high frequency of deletion of the D11S2179 marker compared with the D11S1356 marker suggests that ATM is the target gene of the deletion at the 11q23 locus, and that such deletions may play a role in the pathogenesis of ALL.","['Haidar, M A', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Manshouri, T', 'Chang, C Y', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Freireich, E', 'Keating, M', 'Albitar, M']","['Haidar MA', 'Kantarjian H', 'Manshouri T', 'Chang CY', ""O'Brien S"", 'Freireich E', 'Keating M', 'Albitar M']","['Section of Hematopathology, Division of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas M.

However, these cells can evade destruction by TNF-alpha. The present study evaluates in three lung cancer cell lines (small cell carcinoma NCI-H69, adenocarcinoma A-427, squamous carcinoma SK-MES-1) and one erythroleukaemia (K-562) cell line the following evasion mechanisms: (1) inhibition of TNF-alpha production, in indirect and direct co-cultures with monocytes; (2) the expression of type I and type II receptors for TNF-alpha (TNFRI and TNFRII) by tumour cell lines, using indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry; (3) the sensitivity of tumour cell lines to the toxic action of recombinant human TNF-alpha (rhTNF-alpha). With the exception of cell line NCI-H69, the other tumour cell lines liberated soluble factors that inhibited TNF-alpha production in monocytes. This effect occurred even after membrane contact with the A-427 and SK-MES-1 cell lines. Erythroleukaemia K-562 cells expressed both types of receptors for TNF-alpha, whereas the NCI-H69 cells expressed only TNFRI, and the A-427 and SK-MES-1 cells expressed no receptors. Lines NCI-H69, A-427 and K-562 were insensitive to the cytotoxic action of rhTNF-alpha. In conclusion, different lung cancer cell lines may evade destruction by TNF-alpha by various mechanisms that range from blocking TNF-alpha production by monocytes to blocking the cytotoxic action of this molecule. For selecting the most effective immunotherapy, knowledge of the evasion mechanisms would be useful.","['Lopez-Gonzalez, J S', 'Hernandez Garcia, A', 'Noyola, M I', 'Cazares, D A', 'Mandoki, J J', 'Morales, F M', 'Mendieta, I C', 'Caloca, J V']","['Lopez-Gonzalez JS', 'Hernandez Garcia A', 'Noyola MI', 'Cazares DA', 'Mandoki JJ', 'Morales FM', 'Mendieta IC', 'Caloca JV']","['Departamento de Enfermedades Cronico-Degenerativas, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias, Tlalpan 4502, Col.

Both sensitivity to dFdC and accumulation of dFdCTP were clearly cell line-dependent: in this panel of cell lines, the head and neck cancer (HNSCC) cell line 22B appeared to be the most sensitive, whereas the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines were the least sensitive to dFdC. The human leukaemia cell line CCRF-CEM accumulated the highest concentration of dFdCTP, whereas the non-SCLC cell lines accumulated the least. Not only the amount of dFdCTP accumulation was clearly related to the sensitivity for dFdC (R=-0.61), but also the intrinsic CTP/UTP ratio (R=0.97). NTP pools were affected considerably by dFdC treatment: in seven cell lines dFdC resulted in a 1.7-fold depletion of CTP pools, in two cell lines CTP pools were unaffected, but in 12 cell lines CTP pools increased about 2-fold. Furthermore, a 1.6-1.9-fold rise in ATP, UTP and GTP pools was shown in 20, 19 and 20 out of 21 cell lines, respectively. Only the UTP levels after treatment with dFdC were clearly related to the amount of dFdCTP accumulating in the cell (R=0.64 (P<0.01)), but not to the sensitivity to dFdC treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrate that besides the accumulation of dFdCTP, the CTP/UTP ratio was clearly related to the sensitivity to dFdC. Furthermore, the UTP levels and the CTP/UTP ratio after treatment were related to dFdCTP accumulation. Therefore, both the CTP and UTP pools appear to play an important role in the sensitivity to dFdC.","['van Moorsel, C J', 'Bergman, A M', 'Veerman, G', 'Voorn, D A', 'Ruiz van Haperen, V W', 'Kroep, J R', 'Pinedo, H M', 'Peters, G J']","['van Moorsel CJ', 'Bergman AM', 'Veerman G', 'Voorn DA', 'Ruiz van Haperen VW', 'Kroep JR', 'Pinedo HM', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, PO Box 7057, 1007 MB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Rats', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000 Mar 6;1474(1):5-12. doi: 10.1016/s0304-4165(99)00209-3.,,"['S0304-4165(99)00209-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-4165(99)00209-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immediate tolerance of fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI) was investigated prospectively. METHODS: From January 1995 to December 1998 162 patients received a FTBI, 6x2 Gy on 3 consecutive days, lung dose 10 Gy, for allogeneic (n=112) or autologous (n=50) bone marrow transplantation. High dose chemotherapy (mostly Cyclophosphamide) was administered after the FTBI. A standardized supportive therapy was administered. The immediate toxicity of FTBI was evaluated prospectively prior to each radiation fraction using a defined questionnaire. RESULTS: Main symptoms distressing the patient during irradiation period were gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and emesis. The prevalence of nausea per fraction increased to 26.1% after the 4th fraction, with a significant higher prevalence in children younger than 10 years at 1st and 2nd fractions. 42.6 and 22. 8%, respectively, of all patients complained of nausea and episodes of emesis, during FTBI. Mild xerostomia and parotiditis were observed in 29.9 and 7.1% of all patients. Further gastrointestinal side effects during FTBI were loss of appetite in 16.0%, indisposition in 25.3%, mild oesophagitis in 3.7% and diarrhoea in 3. 7% of the patients. During FTBI 41.4% of the patients developed a temporary skin irritation (mild erythema). Pruritus was registered in 3.7% of the patients. Headache was observed in 14.8% and Fatigue syndrome in 49.2% of women and 28.3% of men (P<0.005). CONCLUSION: FTBI is a well tolerated therapeutic regimen in high dose therapy. The 162 patients investigated revealed no severe immediate side effects.","['Buchali, A', 'Feyer, P', 'Groll, J', 'Massenkeil, G', 'Arnold, R', 'Budach, V']","['Buchali A', 'Feyer P', 'Groll J', 'Massenkeil G', 'Arnold R', 'Budach V']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Strahlentherapie, Campus Berlin-Mitte, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiation Injuries/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 2000 Feb;54(2):157-62. doi: 10.1016/s0167-8140(99)00178-4.,,"['S0167-8140(99)00178-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-8140(99)00178-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reactive oxygen species can initiate lipid peroxidation and DNA damage leading to mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and cell death, if the antioxidant system is impaired. This study was undertaken to examine the prevalence of oxidative stress and the role of antioxidant defence in untreated leukemia patients. The generation of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by leukocytes, plasma malondialdehyde levels, red cell copper zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activities were determined in 30 patients with different types of leukemias prior to therapy. The superoxide anion generation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes was found to be significantly increased in leukemia patients especially those with acute lymphocytic and nonlymphocytic leukemias, while the hydrogen peroxide levels were comparable to the control values. Plasma lipid peroxidation products in untreated leukemia patients were in the normal range. Red cell Cu-Zn SOD and GSH-PX activities were significantly increased and showed no correlation with the hemoglobin content. Although superoxide generation was high, lipid peroxide levels were normal in these patients. This might be due to the increased activities of the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH-PX) which counteract lipid peroxidation. Increased free radical generation, especially superoxide anion in leukemia patients and increased antioxidant defence enzymes, which is an adaptive protective response, are indicative of mild oxidative stress. There were no significant differences for the parameters cited above between different types of leukemias, suggesting that the changes are not specific to the type of leukemia.","['Devi, G S', 'Prasad, M H', 'Saraswathi, I', 'Raghu, D', 'Rao, D N', 'Reddy, P P']","['Devi GS', 'Prasad MH', 'Saraswathi I', 'Raghu D', 'Rao DN', 'Reddy PP']","['Department of Environmental Toxicology, Institute of Genetics and Hospital for Genetic Diseases, Osmania University, Begumpet, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Free Radicals)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Superoxide Dismutase/analysis/*metabolism']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2000 Mar;293(1-2):53-62. doi: 10.1016/s0009-8981(99)00222-3.,,"['S0009-8981(99)00222-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-8981(99)00222-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of the cells to a range of concentrations of casiopeina II indicates that this copper complex kills cells by apoptosis and necrosis. Condensed chromatin and nuclear fragmentation were observed after exposure to casiopeina II. The caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK) almost completely inhibited apoptosis induced by cisplatin; however, casiopeina II-induced apoptosis was inhibited only by 50-70%. These data are consistent with caspase activation (measured by Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; Z-DEVD-AFC) by casiopeina II and cisplatin and confirm that caspases are activated in the apoptotic cell death induced by casiopeina II. DNA fragmentation was observed in L1210 cells, but not in CH1 cells. No difference in susceptibility to induction of apoptosis by casiopeina II was found between sensitive and cisplatin resistant cells.

The relationship between the amplitude of the store-operated Ca2+ ICR AC and intracellular inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) concentration is complex. In rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-1) cells dialysed with high intracellular Ca2+ buffer, the relationship is supra-linear with a Hill coefficient of 12 and resembles an apparent 'all-or-none' phenomenon. The non-linearity seems to arise from InsP3 metabolism. However, it is not clear which InsP3-metabolising pathway engenders the non-linear behaviour nor whether ICRAC is always activated to its maximal extent by InsP3. 2. Using the whole-cell patch clamp technique, we dialysed RBL-1 cells with different concentrations of the InsP3 analogue InsP3-F. InsP3-F is broken down by Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase but is not a substrate for Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase. The relationship between InsP3-F and ICRAC amplitude was supra-linear and very similar to that with InsP3 but was distinct from the graded relationship seen with the non-metabolisable analogue Ins2,4,5P3. 3. In the presence of high intracellular Ca2+ buffer, InsP3-F activated ICRAC to its maximal extent. With moderate Ca2+ buffer, however, sub-maximal ICRAC could be obtained to a maximal InsP3-F concentration. Nevertheless, the relationship between the amplitude of ICRAC and InsP3-F concentration was still supra-linear. 4. Submaximal ICRAC in response to InsP3-F in the presence of moderate Ca2+ buffer was due to partial depletion of the stores, because the size of the current could be increased by thapsigargin. 5. The data suggest that first Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase is an important factor which contributes to the non-linear relationship between InsP3 concentration and the amplitude of ICRAC and second, InsP3 does not always activate ICRAC to its maximal extent.

Molecular analyses revealed that the MLL gene (also called ALL-1, HRX or HTRX) is broken by the translocations, causing fusion with genes from other chromosomes. The diversity of MLL fusion partners poses a dilemma about the function of the fusion proteins in tumour development. The consequence of MLL truncation and fusion has been analysed by joining exon 8 of Mll with the bacterial lacZ gene using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells. We show that this fusion is sufficient to cause embryonic stem cell-derived acute leukaemias in chimeric mice, and these tumours occur with long latency compared with those found in MLL-Af9 chimeric mice. These findings indicate that an MLL fusion protein can contribute to tumorigenesis, even if the fusion partner has no known pathogenic role. Thus, truncation and fusion of MLL can be sufficient for tumorigenesis, regardless of the fusion partner.","['Dobson, C L', 'Warren, A J', 'Pannell, R', 'Forster, A', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Dobson CL', 'Warren AJ', 'Pannell R', 'Forster A', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, UK. clausen@biochem.mpg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', '*Lac Operon', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2000 Mar 1;19(5):843-51. doi: 10.1093/emboj/19.5.843.,,['10.1093/emboj/19.5.843 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC305624,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual experiments are evaluated using a set of data quality criteria, and summary judgments are made across multiple experiments by applying a criterion of rough reproducibility. The potential for carcinogenicity of MFs is discussed in light of the significant body of carcinogenesis data from animal bioassays that now exists. Excluding abstracts, approximately 80% of the 41 completed studies identified in this and our previous review roughly satisfy data quality criteria. Among these studies, the criterion for independent reproducibility is not satisfied for any positive results but is satisfied for negative results in chronic bioassays in rats and mice and for negative results in both promotion and co-promotion assays using the SENCAR mouse skin model. Results of independent replication studies using the rat mammary carcinoma model were conflicting. We conclude that long-term exposure to continuous 50- or 60-Hz MFs in the range of 0.002-5 mT is unlikely to result in carcinogenesis in rats or mice. Though results of most promotion/progression assays are negative, a weak promoting effect of MFs under certain exposure conditions cannot be ruled out based on available data.","['McCann, J', 'Kavet, R', 'Rafferty, C N']","['McCann J', 'Kavet R', 'Rafferty CN']","['Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, California, USA. jmccann@xpressweb.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment']",159,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2000 Mar;108 Suppl 1:79-100. doi: 10.1289/ehp.00108s179.,,"['sc271_5_1835 [pii]', '10.1289/ehp.00108s179 [doi]']",,,,,,PMC1637772,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB in a clone with the lowest PARP content (Cl-3527, contained 6% of PARP of wild type cells) was about 35-fold of that of the wild-type cells, whereas the change in the DNA-binding activity of AP-1 and SP-1 in the mutant was relatively small or not so significant. Transfection of a PARP-expressing plasmid to the mutant cells decreased the abnormally high levels of NF-kappaB complexes, especially p50/p65(Rel A) complex, to near the normal level. Moreover, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear extracts in vitro suppressed the ability of NF-kappaB to form a complex with its specific DNA probe by approx. 80%. Further analysis with purified recombinant NF-kappaB proteins revealed that both rp50 and rMBP-p65 (Rel A) proteins, but not rGST-IkappaB, could be poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in vitro and that the modification resulted in a marked decrease in the DNA-binding activity of rMBP-p65, whereas a slight activation was observed in rp50. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated p65/NF-kappaB was detected in the cytosol of wild type L1210 cells by immunoblotting with anti-poly(ADP-ribose) and anti-p65 antibodies.

The molecular mechanisms underlying these coordinate functions, however, have not been characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that HoxA9 requires its Pbx interaction motif as well as its amino terminus to enhance the clonogenic potential of myeloid progenitors in vitro. We further show that HoxA9 forms functional trimeric DNA binding complexes with Pbx and Meis-like proteins on a modified enhancer. DNA binding complexes containing HoxA9 and TALE homeoproteins display cooperative transcriptional activity and are present in leukemic cells. Trimeric complex formation on its own, however, is not sufficient for HoxA9-mediated immortalization. Rather, structure-function analyses demonstrate that domains of HoxA9 which are necessary for cellular transformation are coincident with those required for trimer-mediated transcriptional activation. Furthermore, the amino terminus of HoxA9 provides essential transcriptional effector properties and its requirement for myeloid transformation can be functionally replaced by the VP16 activation domain. These data suggest that biochemical interactions between HoxA9 and TALE homeoproteins mediate cellular transformation in hematopoietic cells, and that their transcriptional activity in higher order DNA binding complexes provides a molecular basis for their collaborative roles in leukemogenesis.","['Schnabel, C A', 'Jacobs, Y', 'Cleary, M L']","['Schnabel CA', 'Jacobs Y', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tgif1 protein, mouse)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Biopolymers/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Feb 3;19(5):608-16. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203371.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1203371 [doi]'],,"['AI-07290/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, several proteins with sequence homology to p53 have been identified. In this study, we demonstrated that Tax represses the trans-activation functions of p73alpha, p73beta, and p51A, the p53-related proteins, as well as p53. Moreover, a mutant Tax of coactivator CBP-binding site (K88A), which activated NF-kappaB but not CREB pathway, could not repress the p73 nor p51 trans-activation functions, indicating that CBP-binding domain of Tax is essential for the suppression of their functions. Using proteins of Gal4-fused N-terminal region of p73 and p51, we showed that Tax-mediated inactivation of p73 or p51 requires for their N-terminal trans-activation domains. Furthermore, only the putative N-terminal trans-activation domains of them did not have enough transcriptional activities and their adjacent regions are essential for their full trans-activation, suggesting the existence of their second trans-activation subdomains. Thus, HTLV-1 Tax inactivated the p53-related proteins through their N-terminal trans-activation domains.","['Kaida, A', 'Ariumi, Y', 'Ueda, Y', 'Lin, J Y', 'Hijikata, M', 'Ikawa, S', 'Shimotohno, K']","['Kaida A', 'Ariumi Y', 'Ueda Y', 'Lin JY', 'Hijikata M', 'Ikawa S', 'Shimotohno K']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TP63 protein, human)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', '*Phosphoproteins', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/virology', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Feb 10;19(6):827-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203387.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1203387 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has been shown that oncogenic ras inhibits growth of primary cells, through pathways involving p53 and the cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4a and p19ARF. We have analysed the effect of the ectopic expression of the three mammalian ras genes on the proliferation of K562 leukemia cells, which are deficient for p53, p16INK4a, p15INK4b and p19ARF genes. We have found that high expression levels of both wild-type and oncogenic H-, K- and N-ras inhibit the clonogenic growth of K562 cells. Induction of H-rasV12 expression in K562 transfectants retards growth and this effect is accompanied with an increase of p21WAF1 mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, p21WAF1 promoter is activated potently by oncogenic ras and less pronounced by wild-type ras. This induction is p53-independent since a p21WAF1 promoter devoid of the p53 responsive elements is still activated by Ras. Finally, inhibition of p21WAF1 expression by an antisense construct partially overcomes the growth inhibitory action of oncogenic H-ras. Altogether, these results indicate that the antiproliferative effect of ras in myeloid leukemia cells is associated to the induction of p21WAF1 expression and suggest the existence of p19ARF and p16INK4a-independent pathways for ras-mediated growth inhibition.","['Delgado, M D', 'Vaque, J P', 'Arozarena, I', 'Lopez-Ilasaca, M A', 'Martinez, C', 'Crespo, P', 'Leon, J']","['Delgado MD', 'Vaque JP', 'Arozarena I', 'Lopez-Ilasaca MA', 'Martinez C', 'Crespo P', 'Leon J']","['Grupo de Biologia Molecular del Cancer, Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Unidad Asociada al Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas (CSIC), Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, p16', 'Genes, p53', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Feb 10;19(6):783-90. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203384.,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1203384 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied immunohistochemically KIT expression in 23 canine mast cell tumors (MCTs), 10 histiocytomas, 5 malignant melanomas, and in 2 cell lines derived from mast cells (HMC-1, human and C2, canine). As expected, KIT was detected both in the human mast cell leukemia cell line (HMC- ) and in the canine mastocytoma cell line C2. In normal canine skin, KIT expression was confined to mast cells. All canine MCTs expressed KIT, although the intensity of the staining reaction varied considerably among the 23 neoplasms. Grade III tumors showed the highest expression of KIT, whereas grade I tumors showed the lowest expression of KIT. Two patterns of KIT expression were detected in mast cells. In normal canine mast cells and in some neoplastic mast cells, KIT appeared mainly on the cell membrane. However, in many canine MCTs, KIT is accumulated in the cytoplasm, usually near the cell nucleus. The meaning of these two patterns is not clear. Expression of KIT could not be detected immunohistochemically in any of the other neoplasias investigated. According to our results, it can be concluded that most, if not all, canine MCT express KIT. Furthermore, there is an inverse correlation between the degree of differentiation and the expression of KIT. Moreover, according to our results, KIT can be used as a reliable immunohistochemical marker for canine mast cells and undifferentiated mast cell tumors.","['Reguera, M J', 'Rabanal, R M', 'Puigdemont, A', 'Ferrer, L']","['Reguera MJ', 'Rabanal RM', 'Puigdemont A', 'Ferrer L']","['Department of Patologia i Produccio Animals, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Dog Diseases/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mast Cells/chemistry', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/chemistry/pathology/*veterinary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemistry/pathology/*veterinary', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2000 Feb;22(1):49-54. doi: 10.1097/00000372-200002000-00010.,,['10.1097/00000372-200002000-00010 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF expression was investigated further in vitro in seven different highly purified testicular cell populations using RT-PCR and bioassays combined with neutralization experiments. LIF was found to be produced by peritubular cells and, to a much lesser extent, by the other testicular somatic cell types. No LIF was detected in meiotic and postmeiotic germ cell-conditioned medium, and only low levels of LIF were detected in spermatogonia-conditioned medium. Large amounts of bioactive LIF were measured in testicular lymph. While LIF production was greatly enhanced in presence of serum, lipopolysaccharide, and TNFalpha further increased this production in peritubular and Sertoli cells, and human CG enhanced Leydig cell LIF production. In conclusion, peritubular cells are the principal source of testicular LIF, probably accounting for its high concentration in the lymph. Given the proliferative effect of LIF on immature germ cells, we suggest that peritubular LIF plays an important role in the regulation of testicular function.","['Piquet-Pellorce, C', 'Dorval-Coiffec, I', 'Pham, M D', 'Jegou, B']","['Piquet-Pellorce C', 'Dorval-Coiffec I', 'Pham MD', 'Jegou B']","[""INSERM U.435, Groupe d'Etude de la Reproduction Male, Universite de Rennes I, France.

Confirmation that this region of the monocyte GH promoter-bound SP1 and SP3 was accomplished using electrophoretic mobility shift assays with SP1 consensus and mutant probes as well as specific antibodies to SP1 and SP3. Selective mutation of the SP1/SP3 site increased basal transcription by 73%, indicating that this site is important in transcriptional inhibition. Overexpression of SP1 had no demonstrable effect on the GH promoter, whereas overexpression of SP3 caused inhibition of expression in P-388 monocyte cells. Cotransfection of P-388 cells with overexpression vectors for both SP1 and SP3 transcription factors also resulted in inhibition of basal expression. Transfection experiments in Drosophila SL-2 cells overexpressing SP1 and/or SP3 suggest that both factors repress the basal expression of GH promoter luciferase constructs and that the effect together was additive. Taken together, the results demonstrate that basal expression of monocyte GH may be negatively regulated by SP3.","['Vines, C R', 'Weigent, D A']","['Vines CR', 'Weigent DA']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294-0005, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Electrophoresis', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Growth Hormone/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia P388/genetics/metabolism', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Pregnancy Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Rats', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics/physiology', 'Transfection/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2000 Mar;141(3):938-46. doi: 10.1210/endo.141.3.7381.,,['10.1210/endo.141.3.7381 [doi]'],,"['R01-DK-38024/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-NS-24636/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We identified 5 adults 40+/-13 (mean +/- S.D.) years of age who developed transfusion iron overload in association with successful chemotherapy of de novo acute leukemia. None had evidence of hemochromatosis, viral hepatitis, or other primary hepatic disorders. RESULTS: The mean serum ferritin concentration of our patients was 1531+/-572 ng/mL. Other abnormalities associated with transfusion iron overload were increased stainable iron in bone marrow macrophages, elevated serum concentrations of hepatic enzymes, hyperpigmentation, hyperferremia, elevated iron saturation of serum transferrin, and increased stainable iron in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Rheumatologic, endocrinologic, or cardiac abnormalities attributable to iron overload were not observed. Therapeutic phlebotomy was initiated after chemotherapy; recovery of hemoglobin concentrations after phlebotomy permitted weekly treatment in each case. This yielded an average of 28+/-9 units per patient (range 15-35 units). Abnormalities associated with transfusion iron overload resolved after iron depletion therapy. The mean leukemia-free survival of our patients is 96+/-36 months (range 40-125 months). CONCLUSIONS: Our data and those of others suggest that 15 to 20% of adults who are long-term survivors of acute leukemia develop iron overload, often with hepatic abnormalities. Iron overload is a relatively common sequela to successful management of acute leukemia in adults for which routine evaluation should be performed and for which therapeutic phlebotomy should be used as treatment.","['Barton, J C', 'Bertoli, L F']","['Barton JC', 'Bertoli LF']","['Southern Iron Disorders Center, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iron Overload/*diagnosis/*etiology/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phlebotomy']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 2000 Feb;319(2):73-8. doi: 10.1097/00000441-200002000-00001.,,"['S0002-9629(15)40691-3 [pii]', '10.1097/00000441-200002000-00001 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most laborious routine assays in the application of retroviral-mediated gene transfer is the determination of viral titers of vector producer cell lines. Traditionally, determination of virus titer involves the testing of culture medium from individual packaging cell lines for the ability to transfer drug resistance to susceptible cells - a process that can easily take up to 14 days. It is generally agreed that this method is cumbersome. We sought to develop PCR-based protocols that would significantly simplify and shorten this procedure. Using PCR and primers specific for the Neoregion of the MLV-derived vector LeGSN, we determined 1. the proviral integration in target cells, and 2. the viral nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) content of the vector stock. Results were compared with those using the conventional method.

This bis-indole compound displays potent antiamoebic activities and shows antigardial, antimalarial and cytotoxic effects. Usambarensine is highly toxic to B16 melanoma cells and inhibits the growth of leukemia and carcinoma cells. To date, the molecular basis for its diverse biological effects remains totally unknown. However, its capacity to inhibit nucleic acids synthesis in melanoma cells, on the one hand, and its structural analogy with DNA-binding pyridoindole plant alkaloids recently studied (cryptolepine and matadine), on the other hand, suggested that usambarensine could also bind to DNA. Consequently, we studied the strength and mode of binding to DNA of usambarensine by means of absorption, circular and linear dichroism. The results of the optical measurements indicate that the alkaloid effectively binds to DNA and behaves as a typical intercalating agent. Biochemical experiments indicated that, in contrast to cryptolepine and matadine, usambarensine does not interfere with the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II. Human HL60 leukemia cells were used to assess the cytotoxicity of the alkaloid and its effect on the cell cycle. Usambarensine treatment is associated with a loss of cells in the G1 phase accompanied with a large increase in the sub-G1 region which is characteristic of apoptotic cells. The DNA of usambarensine-treated cells was severely fragmented and the proteolytic activity of DEVD-caspases is enhanced. Usambarensine is thus characterized as DNA intercalator inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells.","['Dassonneville, L', 'Wattez, N', 'Mahieu, C', 'Colson, P', 'Houssier, C', 'Frederich, M', 'Tits, M', 'Angenot, L', 'Bailly, C']","['Dassonneville L', 'Wattez N', 'Mahieu C', 'Colson P', 'Houssier C', 'Frederich M', 'Tits M', 'Angenot L', 'Bailly C']","['INSERM U-524, IRCL, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '36150-14-8 (usambarensine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Plants/chemistry', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 Nov-Dec;19(6B):5245-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These caspases are quite similar to those activated by treatments with other apoptosis-inducers, such as VP16 and camptothecin, suggesting that similar caspases, such as caspases 3 and 6, are activated during apoptosis in U937 cells that is induced by a variety of apoptosis-inducing stimuli. An inhibitor of caspases, Z-Asp-CH2DCB, inhibited DNA fragmentation in response to GGO in vivo by blocking the cleavage of 20-kDa to 17-kDa peptides. This cleavage is catalyzed by caspase 3 itself or by a caspase-3-like protease. In contrast, other inhibitors of caspases such as Z-DEVD-FMK and Z-VAD-FMK, inhibited the processing of the caspase 3 precursor p32 to 20-kDa and 17-kDa peptides, a result which suggests that these inhibitors inhibited other upstream caspases. Treatment of U937 cells with GGO resulted in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria prior to DNA fragmentation and the release of cytochrome c was inhibited by Zn2+ ions and by a chelator of Ca2+ ions but not by inhibitors of caspases such as Z-Asp-CH2DCB or Z-VAD-FMK. These results suggest that intracellular free Ca2+ ions, and some caspases that are inhibited by Zn2+ ions, but not by Z-Asp-CH2DCB or Z-VAD-FMK are necessary for the release of cytochrome c that is caused by the treatment with GGO.","['Nakaya, M', 'Masuda, Y', 'Mihara, S', 'Aiuchi, T', 'Shibayama-Imazu, T', 'Nakajo, S', 'Nakaya, K']","['Nakaya M', 'Masuda Y', 'Mihara S', 'Aiuchi T', 'Shibayama-Imazu T', 'Nakajo S', 'Nakaya K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan. nakaya@pharm.showa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Diterpenes)', 'AIA02AJA3A (geranylgeraniol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels/chemistry', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/pathology', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 Nov-Dec;19(6B):5063-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDIs) play critical roles in check-point functions during the cell cycle and as inhibitors of cell proliferation. Loss of their activities can impair development and differentiation and contribute to the uncontrolled proliferation characteristic of cancer cells. When the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 is induced to differentiate in vitro, by a variety of agents, cellular levels of the CD1 proteins p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 are increased. To further address the roles of these two proteins in differentiation, we have overexpressed either a human p21Cip1 or p27Kip1 construct in HL60 cells. The overexpression of p21Cip1 accelerated both the monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells triggered by TPA or DMSO, respectively. The accelerated and more dramatic induction of differentiation seen in the p21Cip1 overexpressors was associated with a more rapid reduction of CDK2 kinase-associated activity, increased levels and more rapid dephosphorylation of the Rb protein, and increased levels of the cyclin D3 protein. Stable overexpression of p27Kip1 also enhanced TPA-induced differentiation of HL60 cells. These studies provide direct evidence that the increased expression of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 play a causal role in the process of terminal differentiation of HL60 cells. Therefore, agents that enhance the expression of one or both of these proteins might be useful in therapy by enhancing the terminal differentiation of leukemia cells.","['Zhou, P', 'Yao, Y', 'Soh, J W', 'Weinstein, I B']","['Zhou P', 'Yao Y', 'Soh JW', 'Weinstein IB']","['Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'Cyclins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 Nov-Dec;19(6B):4935-45.,,,,['R01CA63467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The classification includes lymphoid, myeloid, histiocytic, and mast cell neoplasms. The WHO project involves 10 committees of pathologists, who have developed lists and definitions of disease entities. A Clinical Advisory Committee of international hematologists and oncologists was formed to ensure that the classification will be useful to clinicians. A meeting was held in November 1997 to discuss clinical issues related to the classification. The WHO has adopted the Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms, published in 1994 by the International Lymphoma Study Group, as the classification of lymphoid neoplasms. This approach to classification is based on the principle that a classification is a list of ""real"" disease entities, which are defined by a combination of morphology, immunophenotype, genetic features, and clinical features. The relative importance of each of these features varies among diseases, and there is no one ""gold standard."" The WHO classification has applied the principles of the Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms to myeloid and histiocytic neoplasms. The classification of myeloid neoplasms recognizes distinct entities defined by a combination of morphology and cytogenetic abnormalities. The Clinical Advisory Committee meeting, which was organized around a series of clinical questions, was able to reach a consensus on most of the questions posed. The questions and the consensus are discussed in detail in this article. Among other things, the Clinical Advisory Committee concluded that clinical grouping of lymphoid neoplasms was neither necessary nor desirable. Patient treatment is determined by the specific type of lymphoma, with the addition of grade within the tumor type, if applicable, and clinical prognostic factors such as the international prognostic index. The experience of developing the WHO classification has produced a new and exciting degree of cooperation and communication between oncologists and pathologists from around the world. This should facilitate progress in the understanding and treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Harris, N L', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Diebold, J', 'Flandrin, G', 'Muller-Hermelink, H K', 'Vardiman, J', 'Lister, T A', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Harris NL', 'Jaffe ES', 'Diebold J', 'Flandrin G', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Vardiman J', 'Lister TA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston 02114, USA. nlharris@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Congress', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*classification/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*classification/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*classification/pathology', '*World Health Organization']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2000 Feb;13(2):193-207. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3880035.,,['10.1038/modpathol.3880035 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lentiviral vectors can therefore expand the spectrum of target cells susceptible to retroviral gene transfer. To analyze whether vectors based on simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) could be used for gene transfer, a three-plasmid vector-packaging system was developed, in which Gag-Pol and the vector itself are of SIV origin, while Env is derived either from SIV, amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV), or the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). To increase the safety of the SIV vector system, a self-inactivating SIV vector was constructed. After optimization of the SIV gag-pol expression plasmid, a minimal SIV vector, which contained only SIV sequences present on the multiply spliced nef transcript, could still be produced at titers of 2 x 10(5) infectious units/ml. Growth-arrested cells could be transduced with this vector even if vif, vpr, vpx, and nef had been deleted from the packaging construct and the vector.","['Schnell, T', 'Foley, P', 'Wirth, M', 'Munch, J', 'Uberla, K']","['Schnell T', 'Foley P', 'Wirth M', 'Munch J', 'Uberla K']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2000 Feb 10;11(3):439-47. doi: 10.1089/10430340050015905.,,['10.1089/10430340050015905 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R187 has been cloned and expressed in the form of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that shows the same binding specificity as the parental antibody. When expressed intracellularly, the R187 scFv favors the production of viral particles showing reduced infectivity. It, however, exerts no detectable protective effect against infection. This was observed both when using replication-incompetent MuLV-derived vector and replication-competent wild-type MuLV.

These agents produce remissions in most patients, but relapses occur with all three drugs. The optimal means to follow patients for relapse after treatment has not been determined. METHODS: We retrospectively examined serial serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels (sIL-2R) and absolute granulocyte counts in eight patients with relapsed hairy cell leukemia. All were treated with 2-CdA at the time of relapse. Serum samples were available at 3- to 6-month intervals from 5 to 9 years before relapse and 2-CdA treatment RESULTS: sIL-2R levels increase only in patients who go on to relapse. sIL-2R levels doubled a mean of 17.1 months (range, 4-36 months) before absolute granulocyte count decreased by 50%. DISCUSSION: Demonstration of a rising serum sIL-2R level in patients with hairy cell leukemia identified those with an increased risk of relapse who need more frequent observation than patients who maintain a stable sIL-2R level. Early intervention may ameliorate the toxicity of salvage therapy because disease-related neutropenia may be anticipated.","['Arun, B', 'Curti, B D', 'Longo, D L', 'Stevens, D', 'Alvord, W G', 'Gause, B L', 'Watson, T', 'Kopp, W C', 'Janik, J E']","['Arun B', 'Curti BD', 'Longo DL', 'Stevens D', 'Alvord WG', 'Gause BL', 'Watson T', 'Kopp WC', 'Janik JE']","['Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington DC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer J Sci Am,The cancer journal from Scientific American,9513568,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*blood', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenectomy', 'Time Factors']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer J Sci Am. 2000 Jan-Feb;6(1):21-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We identified episodes of pancreatitis related to the intramuscular administration of pegaspargase 2,500 IU/m(2) for the treatment of childhood hematological malignancies during a 2-year period (May 1996-April 1998). Patients were evaluated clinically and by sequential serum amylase and lipase determinations and radiographic examinations. For comparison, episodes of pancreatitis in patients who only received native Escherichia coli L-asparaginase were examined during the same time period. RESULTS: Nine children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of 50 (18%) patients who received pegaspargase were diagnosed to have pancreatitis. All had prior therapy with native L-asparaginase. These children developed symptoms consisting of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite within a median of 15 days from the onset of pegaspargase administration. Six patients became symptomatic after their initial dose. Seven patients developed severe or unacceptable toxicity (grades 3 and 4), measured by increased amylase (>2 times normal) and lipase levels or radiographic evidence of pancreatic inflammation or pseudocyst. One patient also developed hyperammonemia and encephalopathy. In contrast, only one out of 52 (1.9%) ALL patients who received native E. coli L-asparaginase during the same time period developed pancreatitis (P= 0.007). CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of a possible higher incidence of pancreatitis associated with pegaspargase.","['Alvarez, O A', 'Zimmerman, G']","['Alvarez OA', 'Zimmerman G']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, California 92350, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzymes, Immobilized)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzymes, Immobilized/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Male', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/enzymology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Radiography']",,2000/03/01 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/01 09:00'],"['2000/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2000 Mar;34(3):200-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(200003)34:3<200::aid-mpo7>3.0.co;2-t.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(200003)34:3<200::AID-MPO7>3.0.CO;2-T [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(200003)34:3<200::aid-mpo7>3.0.co;2-t [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the ability of RA to induce the expression of gp130, the signal-transducing receptor component for IL-6, in HL-60 and a RA-supersensitive cell line HL-60/S4. We found that RA induced the expression of gp130, at both the mRNA and protein levels, in HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cells. Interestingly, the induction of gp 130 expression observed in the RA-supersensitive HL-60/S4 cells was much more pronounced than that observed in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, activation of the RA-induced gp130 by exogenous IL-6 potentiated the differentiating effects of RA. The synergistic effects observed for IL-6 and RA was also much stronger in HL-60/S4 cells than in HL-60 cells. Our findings suggest that the differentiating effects of RA may partially be mediated by the up-regulation of IL-6/gp130 signaling in HL-60 and HL-60/S4 cells.","['Xie, P', 'Chan, F S', 'Ip, N Y', 'Leung, M F']","['Xie P', 'Chan FS', 'Ip NY', 'Leung MF']","['Department of Biology, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Isotretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2000/03/01 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/01 09:00'],"['2000/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2000 Feb 1;148(2):207-13. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(99)00339-0.,,"['S0304383599003390 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(99)00339-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hepatotoxicity is the most widely recognized toxicity. With the use of higher drug levels to achieve adequate seizure control, hematologic toxicity is being increasingly encountered, and the pediatric hematologist is consulted for these problems in the pre- or perioperative setting. The purpose of this article is to characterize the various hematologic toxicities encountered in a clinical setting and to provide guidelines to assist in the management of these patients. METHODS: A literature review was undertaken to identify the hematologic toxicities of valproate used as monotherapy or polytherapy. Key words used in the search were valproate, hematology, and bleeding. RESULTS: Valproate can cause direct bone marrow suppression leading to aplastic anemia or peripheral cytopenia affecting one or more cell lines. Occasional fatal bone marrow failure, myelodysplasia, and a clinical picture resembling acute promyelocytic leukemia have also been seen. Thrombocytopenia, macrocytosis, neutropenia, and pure red cell aplasia can occur but are not reported to be life-threatening. A bleeding diathesis associated with valproate use may include thrombocytopenia, abnormal platelet function, and acquired von Willebrand disease type I. CONCLUSIONS: Hematologic toxicities of valproate are common, vary in onset and severity, are recurrent, transient, or persistent, and usually occur with a serum valproate level greater than 100 microg/mL. In most situations, even when highly clinically significant, they can be reversed with dosage reduction; drug discontinuation is rarely required. Potential adverse effects such as thrombocytopenia and leukopenia are easily detected by laboratory monitoring, which should be continued indefinitely at least on a quarterly basis. Caution for elective surgery is advised; preoperative coagulation studies should be done, including platelet function studies and von Willebrand factor levels. Perioperative use of DDAVP to increase von Willebrand factor levels and improve platelet function is appropriate in some cases.","['Acharya, S', 'Bussel, J B']","['Acharya S', 'Bussel JB']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, New York Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Child', 'Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Valproic Acid/*adverse effects']",31,2000/03/01 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/01 09:00'],"['2000/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Jan-Feb;22(1):62-5. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200001000-00012.,,['10.1097/00043426-200001000-00012 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed that MRP and LRP, but not MDR1, mRNAs are overexpressed, particularly in children with pre-B ALL compared with T-cell ALL and ANLL tested. In addition, the MRP and LRP mRNA expression levels in initial diagnosis and first relapse samples of one patient with pre-B ALL were similar.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred children, median age 6 years, who received their primary treatment for acute myeloid leukemia at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, from 1983 to 1997 were studied. EMT at diagnosis occurred in 18 (18%) patients at 25 sites. Meningeal leukemia, hepatosplenomegaly, lymph node enlargement, gingival hypertrophy, and cutaneous infiltration were not included in the definition of EMT. With these exclusions, children with EMT were younger than those without EMT (median age, 3.5 v. 7.5 years) and were more likely to have meningeal leukemia at diagnosis (33% v. 10%). The t(8;21) translocation was associated with a 47% EMT incidence compared with 23% without the translocation. Local radiation treatment was given to 16 of 25 (64%) EMT sites. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival rate for all patients was 28%, and this was not significantly influenced by the drug regimen used, meningeal leukemia at diagnosis, the presence of the (8;21) translocation, M4 and M5 morphology combined, or EMT at diagnosis. Significant differences were observed in the 5-year survival rates for patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (52%; N = 37) and those who attained complete remission (CR) but did not undergo transplantation (21%; N = 44) and those who did not achieve complete remission with initial therapy (5%; N = 19). Systemic and local EMT CR was achieved in 17 of 18 patients with EMT, including 12 patients who underwent radiation treatment and 5 of 6 of those who did not. Isolated relapse was not seen at an EMT site and was not noted at any later stage of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Permanent local control at sites of EMT was achieved in all patients who attained a bone marrow CR, whether or not the site was irradiated. Local radiation treatment of an EMT site did not appear to contribute to overall CR and survival rates. The use of radiation treatment should be conservative and limited to patients in whom there is a real and immediate threat to vision or renal function or when the spinal cord is compromised.","['Jenkin, R D', 'Al-Shabanah, M', 'Al-Nasser, A', 'El-Solh, H', 'Aur, R', 'Al Sudairy, R', 'Mustafa, M M', 'Al Fawaz, I', 'Gray, A', 'da Cunha, M', 'Ayas, M', 'Al Mahr, M', 'Kofide, A', 'Mahgoub, A N', 'Rifai, S', 'Belgaumi, A', 'Al Jefri, A', 'Al Musa, A', 'Sabbah, R']","['Jenkin RD', 'Al-Shabanah M', 'Al-Nasser A', 'El-Solh H', 'Aur R', 'Al Sudairy R', 'Mustafa MM', 'Al Fawaz I', 'Gray A', 'da Cunha M', 'Ayas M', 'Al Mahr M', 'Kofide A', 'Mahgoub AN', 'Rifai S', 'Belgaumi A', 'Al Jefri A', 'Al Musa A', 'Sabbah R']","['Section of Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, The King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate']",,2000/03/01 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/01 09:00'],"['2000/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Jan-Feb;22(1):34-40. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200001000-00006.,,['10.1097/00043426-200001000-00006 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To limit curative, but sterilizing, testicular irradiation to those with testicular disease, testicular biopsies were performed to detect occult testicular disease within the first 6 months of treatment. Testicular irradiation then was provided to those with occult disease to increase disease-free survival. Identification of those with occult disease was believed to be a factor that would influence ultimate survival in such patients in that era. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-nine patients had bilateral testicular wedge biopsies performed during the first maintenance therapy phase of the four different chemotherapy regimens. Patients with positive biopsy results were treated with testicular irradiation and continued on therapy. RESULTS: Eleven of 199 biopsy results (5.5%) were judged positive. Patients with positive biopsy results given testicular radiation had a 45% subsequent adverse event rate, compared with 36% for those with a negative biopsy results (P = 0.4). The survival rates for the two groups were similar. The low rate of positive biopsy specimens resulted in discontinuation of the procedure before closure of the study. CONCLUSION: Positive testicular biopsy results early in remission identified patients at a slightly higher risk of subsequent adverse events but did not influence survival. However, because negative biopsy results (94.5%) did not alter the prescribed treatment, the small number of positive biopsy results did not warrant undertaking the procedure in most male patients with ALL, and this procedure was abandoned.","['Trigg, M E', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Chappell, R', 'Johnstone, H S', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Kersey, J H', 'Cherlow, J M', 'Grossman, N J', 'Sather, H N', 'Hammond, G D']","['Trigg ME', 'Steinherz PG', 'Chappell R', 'Johnstone HS', 'Gaynon PS', 'Kersey JH', 'Cherlow JM', 'Grossman NJ', 'Sather HN', 'Hammond GD']","['DuPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Testis/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",,2000/03/01 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/01 09:00'],"['2000/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Jan-Feb;22(1):27-33. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200001000-00005.,,['10.1097/00043426-200001000-00005 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with neuroblastoma received high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation, and patients with AML received chemotherapy alone. Marrows were purged ex vivo with either antineuroblastoma monoclonal antibodies (neuroblastoma) or 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (AML). Lymphocyte subsets, mitogen stimulation studies, and immunoglobulin levels were studied every 4 months. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups of patients in lymphocyte number or subsets over time. In both groups, CD2+ and CD4+ cells were below normal in 33% of patients at 12 months. CD4+/CD8+ ratios were below normal for up to 8 months after transplantation and natural killer cells were elevated for up to 2 years in most patients. Median IgG and IgA levels were below the age mean even at 2 years after transplantation, although patients with AML had significantly higher IgG levels at 12 months compared with those with neuroblastoma. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogens were markedly reduced at 4 months but returned to normal at 8 months. Despite the delay in immune reconstitution, there were no life-threatening infections. CONCLUSIONS: There appeared to be little difference in the overall kinetics of immune reconstitution between the children with neuroblastoma, who received total body irradiation and high-dose chemotherapy, and those with AML, who received high-dose chemotherapy alone as their pretransplant preparative regimen.","['Kamani, N', 'Kattamis, A', 'Carroll, A', 'Campbell, D', 'Bunin, N']","['Kamani N', 'Kattamis A', 'Carroll A', 'Campbell D', 'Bunin N']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bacteremia/etiology', '*Bone Marrow Purging/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Chickenpox/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/classification/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology']",,2000/03/01 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/01 09:00'],"['2000/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Jan-Feb;22(1):13-9. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200001000-00003.,,['10.1097/00043426-200001000-00003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Professional moderators conducted three focus groups with 22 parents of children with cancer who were eligible for enrollment in a Children's Cancer Group clinical trial research protocol. Each focus group consisted of seven to nine parents and was audiotaped and transcribed. RESULTS: Parents' descriptions of the early phase of their child's illness yielded the following themes: dialogues regarding the diagnosis and treatment options occurred amidst tremendous stress; a sense of constraint and lack of control were common; parents experienced variable degrees of choice regarding their child's participation in a clinical trial; and parents provided suggestions about how to improve the informed consent process. Overall, parents did not verbalize distinctions between their understanding of their child's medical treatment, research participation, and other aspects of their child's cancer experience. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, the authors conclude with practical recommendations for health care professionals caring for children with cancer and call for future research about parents' understanding of treatment options, the nature of clinical trials, and experience with the diagnostic and early treatment phase of childhood cancer with larger samples of parents from multiple sites.","['Levi, R B', 'Marsick, R', 'Drotar, D', 'Kodish, E D']","['Levi RB', 'Marsick R', 'Drotar D', 'Kodish ED']","[""Department of Psychology, Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital of University Hospitals of Cleveland and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, OH 44106, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/psychology', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*psychology', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/psychology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Social Support', '*Truth Disclosure']",,2000/03/01 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/01 09:00'],"['2000/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Jan-Feb;22(1):3-12. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200001000-00002.,,['10.1097/00043426-200001000-00002 [doi]'],,"['18830/PHS HHS/United States', '1R01 CA83267-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2001 Jan;23(1):74.

OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the frequency, demographics, and predisposing factors for P. aeruginosa bacteremia in patients with cancer and to determine the efficacy of various therapeutic regimens. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patient records of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, The University of Texas, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, were reviewed. From January 1, 1991, through December 31, 1995, 245 eligible cases of P. aeruginosa bacteremia were identified. We examined the patient records for the underlying malignant neoplasm and its management, symptoms and signs of infection, culture results of appropriate specimens, antibiotic therapy, and outcome. We also compared our present experience with a previous analysis from this institution covering the period from January 1, 1972, to December 31, 1981. RESULTS: The incidence of P. aeruginosa bacteremia has decreased compared with the previous study (2.8 vs 4.7 cases per 1000 admissions). It was most common in patients with acute leukemia (55 of 1000 registrations), and the frequency in this disease has not changed. Half of the patients were not in the hospital when they developed their infection. The overall cure rate was 80%, which was a significant (P<.001) increase compared with the 62% cure rate in the previous study. In this study, no significant difference in the cure rates was observed between monotherapy with a beta-lactam and combination therapy overall (P = .72), and in patients with shock (P = 1.0) and those with pneumonia (P = .60). The patients' initial neutrophil counts were not of prognostic value; however, the cure rate depended on subsequent changes in neutrophil count during therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency rate of P. aeruginosa bacteremia has decreased in patients with solid tumors but has remained unchanged in patients with acute leukemia. Antibiotic regimens for empirical therapy of neutropenic patients and especially patients with acute leukemia should still provide coverage against P. aeruginosa.","['Chatzinikolaou, I', 'Abi-Said, D', 'Bodey, G P', 'Rolston, K V', 'Tarrand, J J', 'Samonis, G']","['Chatzinikolaou I', 'Abi-Said D', 'Bodey GP', 'Rolston KV', 'Tarrand JJ', 'Samonis G']","['Department of Medical Specialities, The University of Texas, 77030, USA. ichatzin@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lactams)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Lactams', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Pseudomonas Infections/*drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology', '*Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/03/01 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/03/01 09:00'],"['2000/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 2000 Feb 28;160(4):501-9. doi: 10.1001/archinte.160.4.501.,,['10.1001/archinte.160.4.501 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, 23 of 69 samples were concluded to be MDR1-positive in leukemic cells per se. The MDR1 expression rate was significantly correlated with factors such as a history of preceding chemotherapy, elder age of the patient, and certain disease types (eg, leukemia progressed from myelodysplastic syndrome). Moreover, the complete response rate after chemotherapy was significantly higher in MDR1-negative patients than in MDR1-positive patients (52% vs 17%, respectively; P = .01).

Treatment with combined chemotherapy achieved a complete remission (CR). In May 1997, the patient received an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) from an HLA-identical sibling donor. Cyclosporine (CsA) and short-term methotrexate were given for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Successful engraftment was obtained and signs of acute or chronic GVHD never developed. Five months after BMT, the patient experienced low-grade fever and blurred vision. Retinal examination demonstrated intraretinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and retinal detachments, which were presumably attributable to multiple thrombosis of retinal microvessels. The patient also exhibited hemolytic anemia with red cell fragmentation, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and renal impairment, and was thus given a diagnosis of BMT-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (BMT-TM). Discontinuation of CsA and administration of ticlopidine and prednisolone induced successful recovery from BMT-TM. Three months after the onset of BMT-TM, however, the patient experienced generalized clonic-tonic seizures with consciousness loss. Single-photon-emission computed tomography revealed blood-flow disturbances in the brain, suggesting the recurrence of microthrombosis. Accordingly, multiple transfusions of fresh frozen plasma were administered together with dipyridamole and aspirin. The patient gradually recovered and remained asymptomatic through the following 13 months. Currently, early diagnosis of BMT-TM is considered to be difficult. We suggest that careful examination of the ocular base may be useful for the early detection of BMT-TM.","['Nakai, K', 'Tajima, K', 'Kishimoto, Y', 'Katsura, K', 'Kawamura, M', 'Yamamoto, Y', 'Hanada, M', 'Zen, K', 'Amakawa, R', 'Fujimoto, M', 'Fukuhara, S']","['Nakai K', 'Tajima K', 'Kishimoto Y', 'Katsura K', 'Kawamura M', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Hanada M', 'Zen K', 'Amakawa R', 'Fujimoto M', 'Fukuhara S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aspirin/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Dipyridamole/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Microcirculation', 'Plasma', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', '*Retinal Vessels', 'Thrombosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vision Disorders/drug therapy/*etiology']",,2000/03/01 00:00,2000/03/01 00:01,['2000/03/01 00:00'],"['2000/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2000 Jan;41(1):25-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end we tested a mammalian expression vector carrying a human beta globin antisense cDNA (pZeobetaAS) fragment in a mouse erythroleukemia cell line expressing the human gamma and beta globin genes. We observed a relative reduction in beta globin mRNA levels compared with gamma mRNA levels in the presence of pZeobetaAS. Moreover, analysis at the protein level showed an average 76% decrease in beta chains and a 517% increase in gamma chain biosynthesis. The inhibitory effect of the antisense vector on globin expression was maintained long term in culture. The expression vector pZeobetaAS was also transfected into primary erythroid progenitors to test its effects on globin genes undergoing normal developmental switching during differentiation. We observed a relative reduction of beta globin mRNA levels compared with gamma mRNA levels.

We compared the relative susceptibility of CD34+ marrow progenitors from four nonhuman primate species and humans to transduction with amphotropic pseudotyped retrovirus vectors containing the Neo gene. The rate of functional gene transfer was measured by colony formation under G418 selection. Marrow progenitors from pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina) were transduced at about twice the rate (19.1 +/- 4.3%) as those from rhesus (11.2 +/- 3.7%) and cynomolgus (7.6 +/- 1.9%) macaques, baboons (7.8 +/- 1.8%), and humans (9.6 +/- 1.7%). Semiquantitative RT/PCR analysis suggests this difference may be due to elevated expression of the amphotropic receptor Pit2 in pigtailed macaque CD34+ cells. Further, transduction rates increased an average 1.6 +/- 0.4-fold when the culture temperature was lowered to 33 degrees C, and 2.1 +/- 0.3-fold when the culture dishes were coated with the fibronectin fragment CH-296. The data presented here point to important differences among nonhuman primate models as well as transduction culture conditions, and suggest that pigtailed macaques may be particularly useful for assessing expression and function of therapeutic retrovirus vectors.

The biochemical defect of this disorder primarily affects cells derived from bone marrow. To understand better the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease and to evaluate the possibility of correcting the genetic defects in hematopoietic cells, a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)- based retroviral vector carrying a functional Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) cDNA driven by an SV40 promoter (LNS-WASp) was constructed. A packaging cell line containing this vector produced a stable level of WAS protein and maintained a high titer of viral output. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) from WAS patients, which lack expression of the WAS protein, were transduced by the LNS-WASp retroviral vector and showed expression of WASp by Western blot. Analysis of the O-glycan pattern on cell surface glycoproteins from WAS patients' B-LCL showed an altered glycosylation pattern, due to increased activity of beta-1, 6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT). Transduction by the retroviral vector carrying the functional WASp cDNA partially restored the abnormal glycosylation pattern, and was accompanied by a decreasing C2GnT activity. These findings imply a functional linkage between the WAS protein and the expression of the glycosyltransferase involved in the O-glycosylation, and also suggest a potential gene therapy via transferring a functional WASp cDNA into hematopoietic cells for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1986 and October 1994, 160 patients with various hematologic malignancies were randomized to receive either a 10-Gy dose of STBI or 14.85-Gy dose of HTBI. RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven patients were assessable. The 8-year overall survival rate and cause-specific survival rate in the STBI group was 38% and 63.5%, respectively. Overall survival rate and cause-specific survival rate in the HTBI group was 45% and 77%, respectively. The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis was similar in both groups. However, the incidence of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver was significantly higher in the STBI group. In the multivariate analysis with overall survival as the end point, the female sex was an independent favorable prognostic factor.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A two-stage design was implemented in a phase II study involving 47 patients with bulky mediastinal stage I/II or stage III/IV Hodgkin's disease. Twelve weeks of the Stanford V chemotherapy regimen were given with consolidative radiotherapy (36 Gy) to lymph nodes >/= 5 cm and/or macroscopic splenic disease. Treatment was administered in one of five institutions participating in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 45 patients are alive and 40 have been continuously disease-free. The estimated freedom from progression was 87% at 2 years and 85% at 5 years. Overall survival was 96% at 2 and 5 years. There was one death from Hodgkin's disease and one death from an M5 acute leukemia. Six of seven relapsed patients received high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1980 to 1998, 70 patients underwent allogeneic BMT for t-MDS (n = 31) or t-AML (n = 39) after prior cytotoxic exposure. Thirty-three patients had received induction-type chemotherapy before BMT. At the time of transplantation, there were 24 patients in complete remission (CR) and 46 with active disease. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.9 years (range, 1.1 to 18.8 years) after BMT, 16 patients are alive, whereas 19 died of relapse, 34 of TRM, and one of relapse of the primary disease. The estimated 2-year overall survival, event-free survival, relapse, and TRM rates were 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19% to 40%), 28% (95% CI, 18% to 39%), 42% (95% CI, 26% to 57%), and 49% (95% CI, 36% to 62%), respectively. In multivariable analysis, age greater than 37 years, male sex, positive recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology, absence of CR at BMT, and intensive schedules used for conditioning were associated with poor outcome. CONCLUSION: BMT is an effective treatment for patients with t-MDS or t-AML who have responsive disease and, in particular, who have no poor-risk cytogenetic features. The poor results of the other patients, especially those with active disease at BMT, emphasize the need to delineate indications and perform prospective protocols.","['Yakoub-Agha, I', 'de La Salmoniere, P', 'Ribaud, P', 'Sutton, L', 'Wattel, E', 'Kuentz, M', 'Jouet, J P', 'Marit, G', 'Milpied, N', 'Deconinck, E', 'Gratecos, N', 'Leporrier, M', 'Chabbert, I', 'Caillot, D', 'Damaj, G', 'Dauriac, C', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Francois, S', 'Molina, L', 'Tanguy, M L', 'Chevret, S', 'Gluckman, E']","['Yakoub-Agha I', 'de La Salmoniere P', 'Ribaud P', 'Sutton L', 'Wattel E', 'Kuentz M', 'Jouet JP', 'Marit G', 'Milpied N', 'Deconinck E', 'Gratecos N', 'Leporrier M', 'Chabbert I', 'Caillot D', 'Damaj G', 'Dauriac C', 'Dreyfus F', 'Francois S', 'Molina L', 'Tanguy ML', 'Chevret S', 'Gluckman E']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Greffe de Moelle Osseuse and Departement de Biostatistique et Informatique Medicale, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/03/01 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/03/01 09:00'],"['2000/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Mar;18(5):963-71. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.5.963.,,['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.5.963 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1985 and November 1996, 230 patients underwent HDT comprising cyclophosphamide therapy and total-body irradiation, with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support, as consolidation of remission. With a median follow-up of 6 years, 27 (12%) developed tMDS or sAML. RESULTS: Median time to development of tMDS or sAML was 4.4 years (range, 11 months to 8.8 years) after HDT. Karyotyping (performed in 24 cases) at diagnosis of tMDS or sAML revealed complex karyotypes in 18 patients. Seventeen patients had monosomy 5/5q-, 15 had -7/7q-, seven had -18/18q-, seven had -13/13q-, and four had -20/20q-. Twenty-one patients died from complications of tMDS or sAML or treatment for tMDS or sAML, at a median of 10 months (range, 0 to 26 months). Sixteen died without evidence of recurrent lymphoma. Six patients were alive at a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 2 to 22 months) after diagnosis of tMDS or sAML. On multivariate analysis, prior fludarabine therapy (P =.009) and older age (P =.02) were associated with the development of tMDS or sAML. Increased interval from diagnosis to HDT and bone marrow involvement at diagnosis were of borderline significance (P =.05 and.07, respectively). CONCLUSION: tMDS and sAML are serious complications of HDT for NHL and are associated with very poor prognosis. Alternative strategies for reducing their incidence and for treatment are needed.","['Micallef, I N', 'Lillington, D M', 'Apostolidis, J', 'Amess, J A', 'Neat, M', 'Matthews, J', 'Clark, T', 'Foran, J M', 'Salam, A', 'Lister, T A', 'Rohatiner, A Z']","['Micallef IN', 'Lillington DM', 'Apostolidis J', 'Amess JA', 'Neat M', 'Matthews J', 'Clark T', 'Foran JM', 'Salam A', 'Lister TA', 'Rohatiner AZ']","[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund Medical Oncology Unit, Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/genetics', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects']",,2000/03/01 00:00,2000/04/01 00:00,['2000/03/01 00:00'],"['2000/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 00:00 [medline]', '2000/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Mar;18(5):947-55. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.5.947.,,['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.5.947 [doi]'],,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2000 Oct 1;18(19):3446-7.

Previously, conditioned medium P48 has been shown to induce differentiation of HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia) cells. Recently our laboratory isolated cDNA clones for P48 from Reh cells and genomic clones from Mycoplasma fermentans and expressed the recombinant protein as a maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion protein in E. coli. In this report we present the initial characterization of this recombinant P48 fusion protein (rP48-MBP). We show that rP48-MBP induces differentiation of HL-60, U937 (human histiocytic lymphoma), and M1 (mouse myeloid leukemia) cell lines. Interestingly, rP48-MBP also induces apoptosis of U937 and HL-60 cells as assessed by terminal transferase (TUNEL) assays. This is the first report of induction of apoptosis by a Mycoplasma gene product. P48 is a Mycoplasma-derived immunomodulatory molecule which has differentiation and apoptosis-inducing activities and may be important in the pathophysiology of Mycoplasma infections. The recombinant protein may be useful in studying the mechanisms of differentiation, cytokine production, and apoptosis in malignant and nonmalignant hematopoietic cells.","['Hall, R E', 'Agarwal, S', 'Kestler, D P']","['Hall RE', 'Agarwal S', 'Kestler DP']","['Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Medical Center/ Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville, Tennessee 37920, USA. rhall@utkux.utcc.utk.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (polypeptide 48)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/genetics/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mycoplasma fermentans/*chemistry/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/03/01 00:00,2000/03/01 00:01,['2000/03/01 00:00'],"['2000/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 Mar 5;269(1):284-9. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.2282.,,"['10.1006/bbrc.2000.2282 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(00)92282-4 [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],"['CA-58205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-72591/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most potent DNA polymerase beta inhibitors were bis(dihydroxyalkylbenzenes) 5 and 6; compounds 3 and 4 were also reasonably potent. The length of the alkyl substituent was found to be a critical element for DNA polymerase beta inhibition, since compounds 1 and 2 had shorter substituents than 3 and were completely inactive. Lineweaver-Burk plots revealed that 3, 4, and 6 exhibited mixed inhibition of DNA polymerase beta with respect to both activated DNA and dTTP. Unsaturated bis(dihydroxyalkylbenzene) 5 was a pure noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to both substrates and associated avidly with the enzyme whether or not it was in complex with its substrate(s). Copper(II)-mediated DNA cleavage was the most pronounced for the trihydroxyalkylbenzene 3, consistent with an earlier report [Singh, U. S., Scannell, R. T., An, H., Carter, B. J., and Hecht, S. M. (1995) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117, 12691-12699]. Unsaturated bis(dihydroxyalkylbenzene) 5 was the next most active DNA cleaving agent, followed by the dihydroxyalkylbenzene 4. The saturated bis(dihydroxyalkylbenzene) (6) did not cleave DNA well in a cell-free system under the conditions studied but nonetheless potentiated the effects of bleomycin to the greatest extent in cell culture studies. Interestingly, compound 5 produced a reduction in the numbers of viable cells when incubated in the presence of bleomycin and a further reduction in the numbers of viable cells in the presence of both bleomycin and Cu(2+). The same effect was noted to a lesser extent for compound 3 but not for 4 or 6.","['Starck, S R', 'Deng, J Z', 'Hecht, S M']","['Starck SR', 'Deng JZ', 'Hecht SM']","['Departments of Chemistry and Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Resorcinols)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Bleomycin/toxicity', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Copper/chemistry', '*DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Polymerase beta/antagonists & inhibitors', '*DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA, Bacterial/*antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/toxicity', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Resorcinols/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/01 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/01 09:00'],"['2000/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2000 Mar 7;39(9):2413-9. doi: 10.1021/bi991509d.,,"['bi991509d [pii]', '10.1021/bi991509d [doi]']",,['CA50771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They play a vital role in the differentiation of neural precursor cells into astrocytes and can prevent or promote neuronal differentiation. One of the conundrums regarding signalling through the LIF receptor is how it can have multiple, often conflicting roles in different cell types, such as enhancing the differentiation of astrocytes while inhibiting the differentiation of some neuronal cells. Factors that can modulate signal transduction downstream of cytokine signalling, such as ""suppressor of cytokine signalling"" proteins, which inhibit the JAK/STAT but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, may therefore play an important role in determining how a given cell will respond to cytokine signalling. This review discusses the general effects of cytokine signalling within the nervous system.

To explore the role of apoptosis in hematological disorders, we examined the frequency of apoptotic cells by the in situ end labeling method in bone marrow specimens from 37 patients with MDS [refractory anemia (RA) 10 cases, RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) 27 cases including 12 cases with leukemic transformation], 12 patients with MDS-derived acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 13 patients with de novo AML. In addition, we investigated the relationship of apoptosis to the immunohistochemical expression of bcl-2 and p53 in these cases, and the association of apoptosis, bcl-2, and p53 with the leukemic evolution of MDS by examining sequential bone marrow samples of the same patient from the time of initial diagnosis to the time of overt leukemia. The percentage frequency of apoptotic cells was significantly greater in MDS (RA: 9.46 +/- 2.99%, m +/- SD; RAEB: 5. 60 +/- 3.09) as compared with those in MDS-derived AML (0.62 +/- 0. 37), de novo AML (0.28 +/- 0.11) and controls (1.00 +/- 0.59). On the other hand, the cases of RAEB with leukemic transformation exhibited a lower frequency of apoptotic cells and a higher frequency of bcl-2- and p53-positive cells than those without transformation. When the RAEB cases transformed to AML, the frequency of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced (2.96 +/- 1. 54 --> 0.62 +/- 0.37), while the frequencies of bcl-2-positive cells and p53-positive cells were greater (10.88 +/- 3.66 --> 30.54 +/- 7. 14, and 20.21 +/- 6.21 --> 32.34 +/- 14.71, respectively). In contrast to MDS-derived AML, over a half of de novo AML cases showed few p53-positive cells. These findings corroborate the earlier notion that apoptosis may play a substantial role in dysplastic and ineffective hematopoiesis in MDS. It is also suggested that the suppression of apoptosis associated with enhanced bcl-2 expression and p53 accumulation increases the probability of developing leukemia in MDS, and that oncogenetic development might be different between MDS-derived AML and de novo AML.","['Kurotaki, H', 'Tsushima, Y', 'Nagai, K', 'Yagihashi, S']","['Kurotaki H', 'Tsushima Y', 'Nagai K', 'Yagihashi S']","['Department of Pathology, Hirosaki University School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan. pathohem@cc.hirosaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",,2000/02/29 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/29 09:00'],"['2000/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;102(3):115-23. doi: 10.1159/000040984.,,"['40984 [pii]', '10.1159/000040984 [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 S.

IL-6 and IL-11 induce gp130 homodimerization whereas the others lead to the formation of heterodimers with LIFR or OSMR. Binding epitopes for IL-6 and IL-11 are located in the immunoglobulin-like domain and the cytokine binding module (CBM). Here we show that a gp130 mutant lacking domain 1, although unresponsive to IL-6 and IL-11, can still activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factors in response to LIF or OSM. Moreover, point mutations in the CBM of gp130 (F191E and V252D) that severely impair signal transduction in response to IL-6 and IL-11 differentially interfere with gp130 activation in response to LIF and OSM. Thus, epitopes involved in gp130 homodimerization are distinct from those leading to the formation of gp130/LIFR or gp130/OSMR heterodimers. These findings may serve as the base for rational design of gp130 antagonists that specifically interfere with bioactivity of distinct IL-6-type cytokines.","['Timmermann, A', 'Pflanz, S', 'Grotzinger, J', 'Kuster, A', 'Kurth, I', 'Pitard, V', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Muller-Newen, G']","['Timmermann A', 'Pflanz S', 'Grotzinger J', 'Kuster A', 'Kurth I', 'Pitard V', 'Heinrich PC', 'Muller-Newen G']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 30, D-52057, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Dimerization', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection']",,2000/02/29 00:00,2000/02/29 00:01,['2000/02/29 00:00'],"['2000/02/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/29 00:01 [medline]', '2000/02/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2000 Feb 25;468(2-3):120-4. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(00)01205-9.,,"['S0014-5793(00)01205-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(00)01205-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an analogous manner, Triapine was similarly active against the wild-type and a hydroxyurea-resistant subline of the human KB nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Triapine was active in vivo against the L1210 leukemia over a broad range of dosages and was curative for some mice. This agent also caused pronounced inhibition of the growth of the murine M109 lung carcinoma and human A2780 ovarian carcinoma xenografts in mice. Optimum anticancer activity required twice daily dosing due to the duration of inhibition of DNA synthesis which lasted about 10 hr in L1210 cells treated with Triapine in vivo. DNA synthesis in normal mouse tissues (i.e. duodenum and bone marrow) uniformly recovered faster than that in L1210 leukemia cells, demonstrating a pharmacological basis for the therapeutic index of this agent. Triapine was more potent than hydroxyurea in inhibiting DNA synthesis in L1210 cells in vivo, and the effects of Triapine were more pronounced. In addition, the duration of the inhibition of DNA synthesis in leukemia cells from mice treated with Triapine was considerably longer than in those from animals treated with hydroxyurea. Combination of Triapine with various classes of agents that damage DNA (e.g. etoposide, cisplatin, doxorubicin, and 1-acetyl-1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-2-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazine) resulted in synergistic inhibition of the L1210 leukemia, producing long-term survivors of tumor-bearing mice treated with several dosage levels of the combinations, whereas no enhancement of survival was found when Triapine was combined with gemcitabine or cytosine arabinoside. The findings demonstrate the superiority of Triapine over hydroxyurea as an anticancer agent and further suggest that prevention by Triapine of repair of DNA lesions created by agents that damage DNA may result in efficacious drug combinations for the treatment of cancer.","['Finch, R A', 'Liu, M', 'Grill, S P', 'Rose, W C', 'Loomis, R', 'Vasquez, K M', 'Cheng, Y', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Finch RA', 'Liu M', 'Grill SP', 'Rose WC', 'Loomis R', 'Vasquez KM', 'Cheng Y', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)', '143621-35-6 (3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'KB Cells', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Pyridines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thiosemicarbazones/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/29 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/02/29 09:00'],"['2000/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Apr 15;59(8):983-91. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00419-0.,,"['S0006295299004190 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00419-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When A549 lung cancer cells or K562 leukemia cells were treated with 62.5 microM 6AN for 21 h and then pulse-labeled with [(35)S]methionine for 1 h, increased labeling of five polypeptides, one of which corresponded to a M(r) approximately 78,000 glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), was observed. Two subsequent observations, however, suggested that up-regulation of these polypeptides was unlikely to explain the interaction between 6AN and cisplatin: 1) the concentration of 6AN required to induce GRP78 was 4-fold higher than the dose required to sensitize cells to cisplatin; and 2) simultaneous treatment of cells with 6AN and cycloheximide prevented the increase in GRP78 but not the sensitizing effect of 6AN. On the contrary, treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide, anisomycin, or puromycin as well as prolonged exposure to the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D mimicked the biochemical modulating effects of 6AN on cisplatin action. Conversely, 6AN inhibited protein synthesis, whereas 18 6AN analogs that failed to enhance Pt-DNA adducts and cisplatin cytotoxicity failed to inhibit protein synthesis. These observations are consistent with a model in which 6AN and other inhibitors of protein synthesis act as modulating agents by increasing cisplatin accumulation, thereby enhancing the formation of Pt-DNA adducts and subsequent cisplatin-induced cell death.","['Budihardjo, I I', 'Boerner, S A', 'Eckdahl, S', 'Svingen, P A', 'Rios, R', 'Ames, M M', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Budihardjo II', 'Boerner SA', 'Eckdahl S', 'Svingen PA', 'Rios R', 'Ames MM', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Medical School, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '329-89-5 (6-Aminonicotinamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['6-Aminonicotinamide/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Adducts/*drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', '*Organoplatinum Compounds', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2000/02/29 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/02/29 09:00'],"['2000/02/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2000 Mar;57(3):529-38. doi: 10.1124/mol.57.3.529.,,['10.1124/mol.57.3.529 [doi]'],,"['N01-CM57200/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA67818/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PAF was found to induce intracellular calcium mobilization and chemotactic responses in both murine and human mast cells. PAF induced transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations with a 50% effective dose of 1 nM and induced significant migratory responses at PAF concentrations of 1 nM to 1 microM in the human leukaemia mast cell line (HMC-1). Using signal transduction inhibitors, both PAF-induced calcium mobilization and migration of mast cells were shown to require activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. PAF-induced calcium and chemotactic responses were cross-desensitized by C5a. Together, these data demonstrate that PAF is capable of activating distinct signalling pathways in mast cells associated with calcium mobilization and cell migration; and that PAF may thus contribute to the regulation of mast cell responses and hyperplasia at sites of inflammation.","['Nilsson, G', 'Metcalfe, D D', 'Taub, D D']","['Nilsson G', 'Metcalfe DD', 'Taub DD']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', '*Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Complement C5a/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2000 Feb;99(2):314-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.2000.00972.x.,,"['imm972 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2567.2000.00972.x [doi]']",,,,,,PMC2327160,,,,,,,,,,,

The best candidates for a second transplant are likely to be patients with acute leukaemia in remission before transplant, in whom the HLA-identical donor was female and who relapsed more than 1 year after the first transplant.","['Michallet, M', 'Tanguy, M L', 'Socie, G', 'Thiebaut, A', 'Belhabri, A', 'Milpied, N', 'Reiffers, J', 'Kuentz, M', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Blaise, D', 'Demeocq, F', 'Jouet, J P', 'Michallet, A S', 'Ifrah, N', 'Vilmer, E', 'Molina, L', 'Michel, G', 'Lioure, B', 'Cavazzana-Calvo, M', 'Pico, J L', 'Sadoun, A', 'Guyotat, D', 'Attal, M', 'Cure, H', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Sutton, L', 'Buzyn-Veil, A', 'Tilly, M', 'Keoirruer, N', 'Feguex, N']","['Michallet M', 'Tanguy ML', 'Socie G', 'Thiebaut A', 'Belhabri A', 'Milpied N', 'Reiffers J', 'Kuentz M', 'Cahn JY', 'Blaise D', 'Demeocq F', 'Jouet JP', 'Michallet AS', 'Ifrah N', 'Vilmer E', 'Molina L', 'Michel G', 'Lioure B', 'Cavazzana-Calvo M', 'Pico JL', 'Sadoun A', 'Guyotat D', 'Attal M', 'Cure H', 'Bordigoni P', 'Sutton L', 'Buzyn-Veil A', 'Tilly M', 'Keoirruer N', 'Feguex N']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Feb;108(2):400-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01851.x.,,"['bjh1851 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01851.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In univariate analyses, cases with single 1q abnormalities experienced poor survival, whereas those with trisomy 8 had a higher risk of acute leukaemic transformation than the remaining patients (P = 0.004 and P = 0.009 respectively). Patients with single del(12p) had a similar survival to patients with a normal karyotype and showed some trend for a better survival than other cases belonging to the IPSS intermediate-risk cytogenetic subgroup (P = 0.045). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that IPSS cytogenetic prognostic subgroup, proportion of bone marrow blasts and haemoglobin level were the main prognostic factors for survival, and the first two characteristics and platelet count were the best predictors of acute leukaemic transformation risk.

Non-transformed confluent Flow 2000 human fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were also five- and 15-fold resistant to VP-16 respectively. The transition from log to plateau phase was accompanied by a drastic decrease in topoisomerase (topo) IIalpha content in CHO cells and human fibroblasts, while the leukaemic cells maintained constant cellular levels of topo IIalpha and topo IIbeta. However, the nuclear topo IIalpha content was found to decrease as a result of translocation of the enzyme to the cytoplasmic compartment in the leukaemic cells. This was confirmed by subcellular fractionation experiments, Western blotting analyses and immunocytochemistry studies. The quantity of topo IIalpha in plateau phase cytoplasmic fractions ranged from 18% in L1210 cells to 50% in HL-60 and 8226 cells, as measured by both immunoblotting and quantification of the label in immunofluorescent images. The cytoplasmic fraction from plateau phase cells retained topo II catalytic activity, as measured by the decatenation of kinetoplast DNA. The nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio of topo IIalpha may be critical in determining the sensitivity of leukaemic cells to topo II inhibitors. Cytoplasmic trafficking of topo IIalpha was observed in plasma cells obtained from patients with multiple myeloma, and perhaps contributes to drug resistance in this disease.","['Valkov, N I', 'Gump, J L', 'Engel, R', 'Sullivan, D M']","['Valkov NI', 'Gump JL', 'Engel R', 'Sullivan DM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, H.

In order to evaluate the presence and significance of constitutive activation of Flt3 for leukaemogenesis, we (1) analysed the expression and activation status of the receptor in AML blasts; and (2) evaluated the functional consequences of constitutively active Flt3 in a myeloid progenitor cell line. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed Flt3 expression in a high proportion of AML cases (27/32) with ligand-dependent Flt3 autophosphorylation in 18, constitutive autophosphorylation in three and no autophosphorylation in six cases. Only one out of three samples with constitutively active Flt3 but 3/18 samples with ligand-dependent autophosphorylated Flt3 contained the recently described internal tandem repeat (ITR) mutations. To test the significance of Flt3 activation in myeloid cell function, we also characterized the biochemical and biological effects of the activating mutation D838V of Flt3 (FLt3D838V) on the factor-dependent myeloid progenitor cell line 32Dcl3: cells transfected with wild-type Flt3 (32D/Flt3) grew FLt3 ligand (FL) dependent, and the receptor was ligand dependently autophosphorylated. In contrast, the receptor was constitutively autophosphorylated in 32D/Flt3D838V cells, which grew independently of FL. We conclude that, in some AML samples, Flt3 is constitutively activated and that this does not correlate with ITR mutations in the juxtamembrane domain. Furthermore, constitutively active Flt3 confers factor independence to the myeloid progenitor cell line 32D. It remains to be determined whether activation of Flt3 is leukaemogenic in vivo and whether strategies aimed at inhibition of Flt3 activation could inhibit leukaemogenesis.","['Fenski, R', 'Flesch, K', 'Serve, S', 'Mizuki, M', 'Oelmann, E', 'Kratz-Albers, K', 'Kienast, J', 'Leo, R', 'Schwartz, S', 'Berdel, W E', 'Serve, H']","['Fenski R', 'Flesch K', 'Serve S', 'Mizuki M', 'Oelmann E', 'Kratz-Albers K', 'Kienast J', 'Leo R', 'Schwartz S', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H']","['University of Munster, Department of Haematology/Oncology; Benjamin Franklin Hospital, Department of Haematology/Oncology, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Feb;108(2):322-30. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01831.x.,,"['bjh1831 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01831.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of the fragments were novel, a third was MYC and the fourth was the FUS proto-oncogene. Northern analysis showed that FUS was downregulated within 1 h only during induced neutrophil differentiation but not at all during induced monocyte differentiation. Unlike the sensitive cell lines, ATRA-resistant cell lines did not show a downregulation of FUS over a 24 h period of exposure to ATRA. Using a semiquantitative PCR analysis, no difference in FUS levels was observed between ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. A similar analysis was carried out on primary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), peripheral stem cell harvests (PBSC) and cord blood samples.

It has been shown previously that DNA intercalators can inhibit the action of amsacrine and several other topoisomerase II poisons, presumably as a result of interference with the DNA binding sites for the enzyme. We show here that drug molecules such as N-phenylmethanesulfonamide, which mimic the anilino side chain of amsacrine, inhibit the cytotoxicity against cultured Lewis lung murine carcinoma of amsacrine, amsacrine analogues including asulacrine and DACA (N-[2-(dimethylamino)-ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide dihydrochloride), and etoposide. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin was slightly increased by co-incubation with N-phenylmethanesulfonamide. The cytotoxicity of amsacrine was also modulated in human Jurkat leukemia, HCT-8 colon, and HT-29 colon cell lines. Because o-AMSA, an amsacrine analogue containing a methoxy group in the ortho rather than in the meta position, is known to be inactive as an antitumor drug, the abilities of the ortho and meta methoxy-substituted derivatives of methyl-N-phenylcarbamate to reverse the cytotoxicity of amsacrine, asulacrine, and DACA were compared. The ortho substitution decreased activity while meta substitution slightly increased it, suggesting that the side chains were binding to a similar site to that occupied by amsacrine. To determine whether the side chain variants actively inhibited the formation of DNA-topoisomerase II covalent complexes, cultured cells were treated with amsacrine or asulacrine, harvested, and lysed directly on acrylamide gels before electrophoresis and Western blotting to identify non-DNA-bound topoisomerase II. Extractable topoisomerase II was depleted in cells incubated with amsacrine but partially restored by coculture with methyl-N-phenylcarbamate. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low molecular weight molecules can modulate the effects of topoisomerase II poisons by directly interacting with the enzyme.","['Finlay, G J', 'Atwell, G J', 'Baguley, B C']","['Finlay GJ', 'Atwell GJ', 'Baguley BC']","['Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, University of Auckland School of Medicine, New Zealand. g.finlay@auckland.ac.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/analogs & derivatives/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aniline Compounds/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2000/02/26 00:00,2000/02/26 00:01,['2000/02/26 00:00'],"['2000/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '2000/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Res. 1999;11(6):249-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors screened 104 patients with ALS and 338 control subjects for mutations in the LIF gene.

T cells, macrophages and a population of phenotypically unusual large granular lymphocytes (LGL) are commonly present, although B cells are absent. Relative T cell numbers decrease significantly in first trimester decidua, and hence are unlikely to play an important role in maintenance of human pregnancy, but T cells could be important in implantation where their relative numbers are greater. In addition to producing cytokines, local tissue macrophages may provide an immediate antigen non-specific host defence to infection. Most attention has, nevertheless, focused on a role for LGL in implantation and maintenance of pregnancy since, at the time of implantation, LGL comprise 70-80% of the total endometrial leukocyte population. Although endometrial LGL have been shown to express natural killer (NK) cell-type cytotoxicity against classical NK cell targets, such cytotoxicity against trophoblast is induced only after activation by interleukin (IL)-2. Selective expression of the unusual class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecule, HLA-G, by extravillous cytotrophoblast may assist in protecting invasive cytotrophoblast from potential maternal NK cell attack, probably via interactions with killer inhibitory receptor molecules on LGL. Many cytokines have been demonstrated to be expressed at the maternal-fetal interface although, currently, in mice only two (IL-11 and leukaemia inhibitory factor) appear to be absolutely essential for successful pregnancy outcome. Immune effector cells and cytokines may also play a role in human pregnancy pathologies, such as recurrent early pregnancy loss.","['Johnson, P M', 'Christmas, S E', 'Vince, G S']","['Johnson PM', 'Christmas SE', 'Vince GS']","['Department of Immunology, University of Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Decidua/cytology', 'Embryo Implantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Genitalia, Female/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/physiology', 'Mucous Membrane/immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",94,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 1999 Dec;14 Suppl 2:26-36. doi: 10.1093/humrep/14.suppl_2.26.,,['10.1093/humrep/14.suppl_2.26 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor topotecan is active in patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndromes. DX-8951f is a novel topo I inhibitor with more potent antitumor effects than topotecan or CPT-11 in vitro. To study the in vivo activity of DX-8951f, 6-week-old female SCID mice received injections into the tail vein with 2 x 10(7) exponentially growing KBM-3 cells. In each experiment, three to five sets of five mice were treated with DX-8951f doses ranging from 7.5 to 80 mg/kg and at schedules of 1, 3, and 5 days; a control set of five mice was treated with the drug vehicle alone. One group received DX-8951f on day 7 of the inoculation with KBM-3 (early-treatment group). To study the activity of DX-8951f in advanced disease, a second group was treated 1 month after the inoculation, when the animals were developing symptoms (late-treatment group). The study end point was the duration of survival until death from leukemia, which was assessed clinically and by the presence of the human DQ alpha gene in tissue samples by PCR. Six experiments were conducted with 170 animals. Survival was higher in both the early- and late-treatment groups than in untreated controls, and the treated groups had significantly less central nervous system disease. Significantly improved survival was observed in animals treated early with 60 and 80 mg/kg as a single injection, with 15 and 20 mg/kg over 3 days, and with 7.5 and 10 mg/kg over 5 days. In the late-disease model (treatment starting on days 28-35), improved survival was observed with a single dose of 80 or 20 mg/kg over 5 days. Dose escalation was limited by dilution problems at the 1-day schedule and by toxicity (mainly gastrointestinal) of the prolonged schedules. Both efficacy and toxicity were dose schedule dependent, increasing with higher doses and prolonged exposure. By establishing the antileukemic activity of DX-8951f against human AML transplanted into SCID mice at doses below the LD10, our data provide a rationale for clinical evaluation of the drug in patients with AML and favor the use of prolonged administration.","['Vey, N', 'Giles, F J', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Smith, T L', 'Beran, M', 'Jeha, S']","['Vey N', 'Giles FJ', 'Kantarjian H', 'Smith TL', 'Beran M', 'Jeha S']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Until now, this agent has been reported to be very cytotoxic toward T-cell but not B-cell leukemic cells freshly obtained from patients and is being tested clinically in patients with CD25+ malignancies of both B- and T-cell origin. Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a B-cell malignancy in which the cells are usually CD25+ and their ex vivo sensitivity to LMB-2 was unknown. Malignant cells from the first HCL patient to be tested were very sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of LMB-2 in vitro (IC50, 1.1 ng/ml), and this patient responded clinically to LMB-2 administered systemically. Therefore, we decided to assess the potential clinical utility of LMB-2 in other patients with HCL. We tested fresh leukemic cells from nine additional CD25+ HCL patients. LMB-2 was very cytotoxic ex vivo in all patients with IC50s as low as 0.5 ng/ml. Malignant cells freshly obtained from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were also sensitive to LMB-2 but not as sensitive as cells from HCL patients. These results indicate that CD25+ HCL is a B-cell neoplasm that is particularly sensitive to LMB-2, and this agent may be useful in patients who have failed standard therapies.","['Robbins, D H', 'Margulies, I', 'Stetler-Stevenson, M', 'Kreitman, R J']","['Robbins DH', 'Margulies I', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Kreitman RJ']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B3(Fv)-PE38KDEL recombinant immunotoxin)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Exotoxins', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotoxins/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/blood/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Feb;6(2):693-700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, PA and PB cause differentiation or growth inhibition of malignant cells. Clinical trials of these drugs as single agents indicate that they are not myelosuppressive; therefore, combinations with other chemotherapy agents may be possible. The goals of this study were to determine whether PA and PB (a) are cytotoxic to malignant B cells from patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and (b) exhibit additive or synergistic induction of apoptosis when administered to myeloma cell lines in combination with conventional drugs. In the clinical specimens, cytotoxicity was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and percent apoptosis was measured using 7-aminoactinomycin D and flow cytometry. Viability was decreased by > 50% in 7% (1/15) of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma samples treated with 5 mM PA, 27% treated with 1 mM PB, and 60% treated with 2 mM PB. Likewise, viability was decreased by > 50% in 44% (4/9) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples treated with 5 mM PA, 67% treated with 1 mM PB, and 100% treated with 2 mM PB. Studies in the myeloma cell lines demonstrated that PB treatment induced activation of caspases 3, 7, and 9 accompanied by cleavage of their substrates and internucleosomal DNA degradation. Combinations of PA or PB with conventional drugs (cytarabine, topotecan, doxorubicin, etoposide, chlorambucil, melphalan, fludarabine, carboplatin, and cisplatin) were examined for synergism (combination index < 1 in median effect analysis) in inducing apoptosis of both the MY5 and 8226 human myeloma cell lines. At concentrations that killed > 50% of cells, most combinations were additive; however, PB was synergistic with cytarabine, etoposide, and topotecan, with the combination index < 1 at each of the 50, 75, and 95% apoptosis levels. These observations indicate that PA and PB can induce apoptosis in malignant B cells and enhance the cytotoxicity of agents used in the treatment of these malignancies.","['Witzig, T E', 'Timm, M', 'Stenson, M', 'Svingen, P A', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Witzig TE', 'Timm M', 'Stenson M', 'Svingen PA', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenylacetates)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', 'ER5I1W795A (phenylacetic acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Phenylacetates/*toxicity', 'Phenylbutyrates/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Feb;6(2):681-92.,,,,"['R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analysis shows that for most MM patients, circulating clonotypic B cells in MM are also hyperdiploid. Although all normal B cells and some malignant B cells are diploid, hyperdiploidy is likely to be exclusive to those that are malignant. Hyperdiploid MM B cells express CD34 and have clonotypic IgH transcripts, confirming them as part of the malignant clone. For MM, 92% (70/76) of patients had a DNA hyperdiploid subset [5-30% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)] of CD19+ B cells. All CD19+ PBMCs in MM expressed CD19 and IgH variable diversity joining (VDJ) transcripts, confirming them as B cells. DNA aneuploid cells were undetectable in T or B lymphocytes from normal blood, spleen or thymus, or in blood from patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In MM, untreated patients had the highest DNA index (1.12). DNA hyperdiploid PBMCs were most frequent among untreated patients and were significantly reduced after chemotherapy. Diploid B cells were significantly more frequent after chemotherapy than at diagnosis. Of the hyperdiploid PBMCs, 81 +/- 3% expressed CD34 and CD19. In contrast to circulating CD34+ B cells, CD34- B cells in MM are diploid. In MM, unlike hyperdiploid PBMC B cells, hyperdiploid BM plasma cells lack both CD34 and CD19, suggesting that loss of CD34 correlates with differentiation and BM anchoring. In situ reverse transcription-PCR of the CD34+ (hyperdiploid) and CD34- (diploid) PBMC B-cell subsets was performed using patient-specific primers to amplify clonotypic IgH VDJ transcripts. Confirming previous work, CD34+ hyperdiploid MM PBMCs were clonotypic (86 +/- 5%). In contrast, CD34- diploid MM PBMCs had few monoclonal cells (4.8 +/- 2%). The lack of hyperdiploidy, together with the relative absence of cells having clonotypic transcripts, suggests these polyclonal CD34- B cells are normal. After culture in colchicine to arrest mitosis, hyperdiploid B cells were reduced and MM B cells accumulated in a diploid G2-M, suggesting that hyperdiploid in MM may represent a transient S-phase arrest rather than an aneuploid G0 phase. The DNA hyperdiploidy of CD34+ clonotypic B cells suggests these cells may be clinically important constituents of the myeloma clone and that they may play a direct role in the spread of myeloma.","['Pilarski, L M', 'Giannakopoulos, N V', 'Szczepek, A J', 'Masellis, A M', 'Mant, M J', 'Belch, A R']","['Pilarski LM', 'Giannakopoulos NV', 'Szczepek AJ', 'Masellis AM', 'Mant MJ', 'Belch AR']","['Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. lpilarsk@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Diploidy', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Feb;6(2):585-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the cell type of origin for ES remains controversial, characterizing gene expression in ES can provide diagnostic markers and lead to better understanding of tumor biology. We studied RNA expression of the neuronal genes protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) by Northern analysis in cell lines and tissue from small round cell tumors. PGP 9.5 showed strong expression in 17 of 17 neuroblastoma cell lines, 9 of 9 pPNET cell lines, and 11 of 11 ES cell lines. PGP 9.5 was weakly expressed in 1 of 1 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines but not in 1 of 1 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, and weak expression was seen in 1 of 7 leukemia cell lines. In tumor tissue, all 12 neuroblastomas expressed PGP 9.5, as did all 7 pPNET and all 7 ES. PGP 9.5 was very weakly expressed in 6 of 9 rhabdomyosarcomas and 1 of 9 lymphomas. TH was expressed only in neuroblastomas, and no TH expression was seen in cell lines or tissue from other tumors. As high expression of PGP 9.5 was only found in neural tumors; PGP 9.5 expression by ES provides further evidence for a neural origin of this tumor, whereas TH expression is highly specific for neuroblastomas. PGP 9.5 expression should allow sensitive detection of minimal residual disease for ES and pPNET using reverse transcription-PCR, and the variability in TH and PGP 9.5 expression levels in neuroblastomas indicates that expression of both genes should be used for monitoring minimal residual disease by reverse transcription-PCR.","['Wang, Y', 'Einhorn, P', 'Triche, T J', 'Seeger, R C', 'Reynolds, C P']","['Wang Y', 'Einhorn P', 'Triche TJ', 'Seeger RC', 'Reynolds CP']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, California 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (Thiolester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/genetics/*pathology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Thiolester Hydrolases/analysis/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/analysis/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Feb;6(2):551-8.,,,,"['CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60104/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HuM195, a humanized monoclonal antibody reactive with the cell surface antigen CD33, specifically targets and kills myeloid leukemia cells. We studied whether HuM195 could eliminate minimal residual disease in patients with APL by using RT-PCR. After attaining clinical complete remission with RA and/or chemotherapy, patients received HuM195 twice weekly for 3 weeks. Patients in first remission were given consolidation chemotherapy, generally with three cycles of idarubicin and cytarabine. Patients in second or greater remission did not receive chemotherapy. All patients received six monthly courses of maintenance with two doses of HuM195. Twenty-five of 27 patients treated in first remission had positive RT-PCR determinations before HuM195 treatment. Of the 22 patients evaluable for conversion of positive RT-PCR assays, 11 (50%) became RT-PCR negative after HuM195 treatment without additional therapy. Within the subset of patients who received RA alone as induction, 8 of 18 evaluable patients (44%) had negative RT-PCR determinations after HuM195 treatment but before chemotherapy. Among similar patients treated on earlier studies, 7 of 34 patients (21%) induced into remission with RA and then maintained on the drug for 1 month were RT-PCR negative before chemotherapy (P = 0.07). Twenty-five of 27 patients with newly diagnosed APL (93%) remain in clinical complete remission for 7+ to 58+ months, with median follow-up of 29 months. Seven patients in second or third remission and one patient in molecular relapse were also treated. Only one of these patients became RT-PCR negative after treatment with HuM195.

Liposomal vincristine (Onco-TCS) has prolonged half-life, reaches higher concentration in tumors and lymph nodes than in nerves, and administered at full doses appears to be less neurotoxic, and more active then free vincristine in mice bearing L-1210 and P-388 leukemias. We therefore explored its activity in relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had histologically proven relapse, age > or = 16 years, normal renal function, neutrophils > 500/microliter, platelets > 50,000/microliter, and no HIV infection, central nervous system disease, or serious neuropathy. Patients were treated with 2.0 mg/m2 of liposomal vincristine i.v. over 60 minutes q 14 days. Responders received up to 12 injections. RESULTS: Of the 51 registered patients, 35 are currently evaluable for response. Median age was 62 years (range 19-86), and 21 were male. The median number of prior regimens was 3 (range 1-10) and had included vincristine in all patients, of whom 51% were refractory to their last regimen. Serum LDH was high in 46%, and beta 2-microglobulin > 3.0 mg/l in 63% of patients. Of the 155 administered injections, 138 (89%) were at the 2.0 mg/m2 level. The median injected dose was 3.8 mg (range 2.6-4.8 mg), and median number of injections was 4 (range 1-12). Responses were seen in 14 of 34 (41%) patients with NHL (95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 25%-59%). Response rates were 10% for indolent, 71% for transformed, and 47% for aggressive NHL, but the 95% confidence intervals overlapped. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months for responders. Grade 3-4 motor or sensory neuropathy was seen in 11, and caused termination of therapy in five patients. All five had prior neuropathy, two had previously received paclitaxel, one platinum, and two paclitaxel and platinum. Fever was detected in three patients, but there were no toxic deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal vincristine is active and well tolerated in this heavily pretreated population with relapsed NHL, but can be neurotoxic in a fraction of patients heavily exposed to prior neurotoxic agents. These data, if confirmed, would suggest a potential role for liposomal vincristine in the combination therapy of previously untreated patients with NHL.","['Sarris, A H', 'Hagemeister, F', 'Romaguera, J', 'Rodriguez, M A', 'McLaughlin, P', 'Tsimberidou, A M', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Samuels, B', 'Pate, O', 'Oholendt, M', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Burge, C', 'Cabanillas, F']","['Sarris AH', 'Hagemeister F', 'Romaguera J', 'Rodriguez MA', 'McLaughlin P', 'Tsimberidou AM', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Samuels B', 'Pate O', 'Oholendt M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Burge C', 'Cabanillas F']","['Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA. asarris@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2000 Jan;11(1):69-72. doi: 10.1023/a:1008348010437.,,"['10.1023/a:1008348010437 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)55097-9 [pii]']",,['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite improved surgical techniques as many as 20% of women with early stage disease will eventually relapse and die from their disease. The post-operative management of these women remains controversial. Here we present the long term follow-up data of our previously published study, as well as the incidence of second primary malignancies in these women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred fifty-seven eligible patients with stage I, IIA 'high risk' ovarian carcinoma and IIB, IIIO (disease confined to pelvis) were randomized to either whole abdominal radiotherapy 2.250 rads in ten fractions (107 patients), melphalan 8 mg/m2/d x 4 weeks x 18 courses (106 patients) or intraperitoneal chromic phosphate 10-20 mCi (44 patients). All patients were initially treated with pelvic radiotherapy. RESULTS: Overall survival estimates at 10 years were: 45% in the whole abdominal radiotherapy arm; 49% in the melphalan arm and 50% in the intraperitoneal chromic phosphate arm (P = 0.30). Relapse-free survival estimates at 10 years were: 50% in the whole abdominal radiotherapy arm, 62% in the melphalan arm and 51% in the chromic phosphate arm (P = 0.147). Long term follow-up has not demonstrated a significant difference between treatment arms. Second primary malignancies developed in 29 women (11%) after 2,229 person years of follow-up. This compares to 18.7 second primary malignancies which would have been expected in this group of age-matched controls and was statistically significant (P = 0.018). There was no significant difference in the total number of second primary malignancies between treatment arms. Melphalan appeared to be associated with an increased risk of developing leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome compared to the whole abdominal radiotherapy arm (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up has not demonstrated a significant difference in overall or disease free survival between treatment arms. An excess of second primary malignancies (35%) was observed suggesting that lifelong surveillance is required in this population. Further research with newer treatment programs are needed to improve the cure rates in this population.","['Dent, S F', 'Klaassen, D', 'Pater, J L', 'Zee, B', 'Whitehead, M']","['Dent SF', 'Klaassen D', 'Pater JL', 'Zee B', 'Whitehead M']","['Northwestern Ontario Regional Cancer Center, Thunder Bay, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Chromium Compounds)', '0 (Phosphates)', 'AQ86ZJ9U98 (chromic phosphate)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Brachytherapy', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Chromium Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Melphalan/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/classification/*epidemiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Phosphates/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2000 Jan;11(1):65-8. doi: 10.1023/a:1008356806417.,,"['10.1023/a:1008356806417 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)55096-7 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Classification criteria were evaluated in the international protocol FAB LMB 96 Treatment of Mature B-cell Lymphoma/Leukemia: A SFOP LMB 96/CCG-5961/UKCCSG NHL 9600 Cooperative Study. This includes B-lineage lymphomas: Burkitt's lymphoma (including ALL-L3); high-grade B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt-like; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (excluding anaplastic large cell Ki-1 lymphoma). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases were independently reviewed by eight hematopathologists from the three cooperative national groups (two SFOP, two CCG, four UKCCSG), without prior discussion of classification criteria or guidelines for case rejection. Consensus diagnosis was determined by each national cooperative group, and final consensus diagnosis established when at least two national consensus diagnoses were in agreement, or following group agreement at a multiheaded microscope. RESULTS: Two hundred eight cases were reviewed, with final consensus diagnosis established in two hundred three. The percent agreement of each group's national consensus diagnosis with final consensus diagnosis was 86%, 86% and 71%. The percent agreement of the group's national consensus diagnosis with final consensus diagnosis for Burkitt's and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were 88% and 80%, respectively, but only 42% for Burkitt-like lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: International panel review of mature B-cell lymphoma/leukemia in children and adolescents highlighted difficulties in subclassification, particularly with Burkitt-like, which is a 'provisional entity' in the R.E.A.L. Classification. The absence of previous discussion of classification and guidelines for case rejection may in part explain the discrepancy between pathologists. These results underline that morphology may need to be complemented by other studies, such as molecular genetic and cytogenetics, to discriminate between the mature B-cell lymphomas.","['Lones, M A', 'Auperin, A', 'Raphael, M', 'McCarthy, K', 'Perkins, S L', 'MacLennan, K A', 'Ramsay, A', 'Wotherspoon, A', 'Gerrard, M', 'Cairo, M S', 'Patte, C']","['Lones MA', 'Auperin A', 'Raphael M', 'McCarthy K', 'Perkins SL', 'MacLennan KA', 'Ramsay A', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Gerrard M', 'Cairo MS', 'Patte C']","[""Children's Cancer Group (CCG), Operations Center, Arcadia, California, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/classification/pathology', 'Child', 'Consensus Development Conferences as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*classification/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*classification/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/pathology']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2000 Jan;11(1):47-51. doi: 10.1023/a:1008304329943.,,"['10.1023/a:1008304329943 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)55092-X [pii]']",,['CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This interpretation underlines the apparently natural chemoresistance of cells which compose the myeloid leukemia progenitor compartment. Over the past few years, several studies have shown that similar cellular damage can lead to divers effects such as rapid apoptotic death, differed mitotic death, or a transitory cytostatic effect. Cell response to damage is regulated by a complex and highly regulated network of intracellular signals including cell death signals mediated by ceramide and cell survival signals mediated (at least in part) by diacylglycerol and phosphoinositide-3 phosphates. Cellular fate relies on the balance between these two signaling pathways. This hypothesis opens several prospects on pharmacological manipulation aimed at either favoring cell death or at conferring resistance to anti-cancer agents.","['Jaffrezou, J P', 'Laurent, G']","['Jaffrezou JP', 'Laurent G']","['E9910 INSERM, Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse. jaffrezou@icr.fnclcc.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,J Soc Biol,Journal de la Societe de biologie,100890617,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lipids)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Lipids/*physiology', 'Second Messenger Systems/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",68,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Soc Biol. 1999;193(4-5):429-37.,Role des seconds messagers lipidiques impliques dans la reponse des cellules leucemiques aux medicaments anticancereux.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Screening of a genomic library led to the isolation of two overlapping lambda clones containing 7kb of 5' flanking region, as well as the 10 exons of the mouse Pit1 gene corresponding to the published cDNA. The translation start site is located within exon I and the stop codon within exon X. The overall structure of the mouse gene is very similar to that of its human homolog, except for the presence of an additional 5' untranslated exon in human. The structure of the 5' untranslated region of the mouse gene was thus further investigated using rapid amplification of cDNA ends in murine ATDC5, MC3T3-E1 and Swiss 3T3 cells.

The glycosylated drug molecules bound to the cell membranes can be extracted upon washing with buffer or by adding an excess of DNA. In contrast, the indolocarbazole drug lacking the carbohydrate domain remains tightly bound to the membranes with very little or no exchange upon the addition of DNA. The membrane transport and binding properties of indolocarbazole drugs related to rebeccamycin are reminiscent to those of other DNA-intercalating antitumor agents. The uptake most likely occurs via a passive diffusion through the plasma membranes and the glycosyl residue of the drug plays an essential role for the translocation of the drug from the membranes to the internal cell components, such as DNA.","['Goossens, J F', 'Henichart, J P', 'Anizon, F', 'Prudhomme, M', 'Dugave, C', 'Riou, J', 'Bailly, C']","['Goossens JF', 'Henichart JP', 'Anizon F', 'Prudhomme M', 'Dugave C', 'Riou J', 'Bailly C']","['Laboratoire de Chimie Analytique, Faculte de Pharmacie, 59006, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '93908-02-2 (rebeccamycin)']",IM,"['*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', '*Carbazoles', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Indoles', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2000 Feb 18;389(2-3):141-6. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(99)00895-x.,,"['S001429999900895X [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(99)00895-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we examined the effect of expression of MLL-AF9 on differentiation of the monoblastic U937 cell line by using a tetracycline-inducible expression system. MLL-AF9 arrested growth of U937 cells and induced these cells to differentiate into macrophages; induction was accompanied by expression of CD11b and CD14 and ultimately cell death. Deletion mutants of MLL-AF9 were used to map the sequences responsible for this effect. The amino-terminal half of MLL was sufficient for both cell cycle arrest and macrophage differentiation, whereas the carboxyl terminus of MLL or AF9 was found to be dispensable for this effect. Further deletions showed that a 35-kDa amino-terminal fragment spanning two AT hook motifs was sufficient for cell cycle arrest, up-regulation of p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1), and partial differentiation toward macrophages. These findings suggest a possible role for the MLL AT hook-containing region in regulating myelomonocytic differentiation.","['Caslini, C', 'Shilatifard, A', 'Yang, L', 'Hess, J L']","['Caslini C', 'Shilatifard A', 'Yang L', 'Hess JL']","[""Department of Experimental Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology/physiology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription Factors', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Mar 14;97(6):2797-802. doi: 10.1073/pnas.040574897.,,"['10.1073/pnas.040574897 [doi]', '040574897 [pii]']",,"['R01 CA078815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092251/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA78815-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC16009,,,,,,,,,,,

Viruses were vital, first, to the discovery and analysis of cellular growth control pathways and the synthesis of current concepts of cancer biology and, second, to the recognition of the etiology of some human cancers. Transforming retroviruses carry oncogenes derived from cellular genes that are involved in mitogenic signalling and growth control. DNA tumor viruses encode oncogenes of viral origin that are essential for viral replication and cell transformation; viral oncoproteins complex with cellular proteins to stimulate cell cycle progression and led to the discovery of tumor suppressors. Viral systems support the concept that cancer development occurs by the accumulation of multiple cooperating events. Viruses are now accepted as bona fide etiologic factors of human cancer; these include hepatitis B virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomaviruses, human T-cell leukemia virus type I and hepatitis C virus, plus several candidate human cancer viruses. It is estimated that 15% of all human tumors worldwide are caused by viruses. The infectious nature of viruses distinguishes them from all other cancer-causing factors; tumor viruses establish long-term persistent infections in humans, with cancer an accidental side effect of viral replication strategies. Viruses are usually not complete carcinogens, and the known human cancer viruses display different roles in transformation. Many years may pass between initial infection and tumor appearance and most infected individuals do not develop cancer, although immunocompromised individuals are at elevated risk of viral-associated cancers. Variable factors that influence viral carcinogenesis are reviewed, including possible synergy between viruses and environmental cofactors. The difficulties in establishing an etiologic role for a virus in human cancer are discussed, as well as the different approaches that proved viral links to cancer. Future directions for tumor virus studies are considered.","['Butel, J S']",['Butel JS'],"['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Mail Stop BCM-385, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA. jbutel@bcm.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Forecasting', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*virology', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic Viruses/*pathogenicity']",169,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2000 Mar;21(3):405-26. doi: 10.1093/carcin/21.3.405.,,['10.1093/carcin/21.3.405 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,['NASA'],"['NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology', 'NASA Program Biomedical Research and Countermeasures', 'Non-NASA Center']",,['Butel JS'],"['Butel, J S']","['Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX']"

CML is characterized by the t(9;22) that results in the bcr-abl fusion oncogene and in the expression of a chimeric protein product p210. Previously we have shown that peptides derived from amino acid sequences crossing the b3a2 fusion breakpoint in p210 elicit class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes and class II responses, respectively, in vitro. Such sequences may thus comprise absolutely tumor-specific antigens in a peptide-based vaccine. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a multidose, bcr-abl breakpoint peptide vaccine in 12 adults with chronic-phase CML. Cohorts of 3 patients each received either 50 microg, 150 microg, 500 microg, or 1500 microg total peptide mixed with 100 microg QS-21 as an immunological adjuvant. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), humoral responses, and unprimed ex vivo autologous proliferation ((3)H-thymidine incorporation) and cytotoxicity (chromium-51 release) responses were measured. All 68 vaccinations were well tolerated without significant adverse effects. In 3 of the 6 patients treated at the 2 highest dose levels of vaccine, peptide-specific, T-cell proliferative responses (n = 3) and/or DTH responses (n = 2) were generated that lasted up to 5 months after vaccination. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes have not been identified. In conclusion, a tumor-specific, bcr-abl derived peptide vaccine can be safely administered to patients with chronic-phase CML and can elicit a bcr-abl peptide-specific immune response despite the presence of active disease in these patients and approximately 10(12) leukemia cells.

Hence, there is the realization that mitochondrial-specific drugs could have potential for use as chemotherapeutic agents to trigger apoptosis in tumor cells. Recently, we showed that photoproducts of merocyanine 540 (pMC540) induced tumor cell apoptosis. In this study, we focused on identifying mitochondrial-specific compounds from pMC540 and studied their apoptotic potential. One purified fraction, C5, induced a drop in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cytosolic translocation of cytochrome C in HL60 human leukemia cells. Moreover, the addition of C5 to purified rat liver mitochondria induced MPT as indicated by mitochondrial matrix swelling, which was completely inhibited by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the inner-membrane pore. Supernatant of C5-treated mitochondria showed a dose-dependent increase in cytochrome C, which was also inhibited in the presence of cyclosporin A, strongly indicating a direct effect on the inner-membrane pore. Despite the strong mitochondrial reactivity, C5 elicited minimal cytotoxicity (less than 25%) against HL60 leukemia and M14 melanoma cells because of inefficient caspase activation. However, prior exposure to C5 significantly enhanced the apoptotic response to etoposide or the CD95 receptor. Thus, we demonstrate that MPT induction and cytochrome C release by the novel compound C5, in the absence of effective caspase activation, is insufficient for triggering efficient apoptosis in tumor cells. However, when used in combination with known apoptosis inducers, such compounds could enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to apoptosis.

The activity of this inhibitor has been demonstrated so far both in vitro with bcr/abl expressing cells derived from leukemic patients, and in vivo on nude mice inoculated with bcr/abl positive cells. Yet, no information is available on whether leukemic cells can develop resistance to bcr/abl inhibition. The human bcr/abl expressing cell line LAMA84 was cultured with increasing concentrations of STI571. After approximately 6 months of culture, a new cell line was obtained and named LAMA84R. This newly selected cell line showed an IC50 for the STI571 (1.0 microM) 10-fold higher than the IC50 (0.1 microM) of the parental sensitive cell line. Treatment with STI571 was shown to increase both the early and late apoptotic fraction in LAMA84 but not in LAMA84R. The induction of apoptosis in LAMA84 was associated with the activation of caspase 3-like activity, which did not develop in the resistant LAMA84R cell line. LAMA84R cells showed increased levels of bcr/abl protein and mRNA when compared to LAMA84 cells. FISH analysis with BCR- and ABL-specific probes in LAMA84R cells revealed the presence of a marker chromosome containing approximately 13 to 14 copies of the BCR/ABL gene. Thus, overexpression of the Bcr/Abl protein mediated through gene amplification is associated with and probably determines resistance of human leukemic cells to STI571 in vitro.

Although some of the immediate upstream activators of Akt have been defined, the roles of tyrosine kinases in the activation of Akt are not well delineated. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) regulates the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neutrophilic granulocytes. G-CSF exerts its actions by stimulating several signaling cascades after binding its cell surface receptor. Both Jak (Janus) and Src families of tyrosine kinases are stimulated by incubation of cells with G-CSF. In this report, we show that G-CSF stimulation of cells leads to activation of Akt. The membrane-proximal 55 amino acids of the G-CSF receptor cytoplasmic domain are sufficient for mediating Akt activation. However, activation of Akt appears to be downregulated by the receptor's carboxy-terminal region of 98 amino acids, a region that has been shown to be truncated in some patients with acute myeloid leukemia associated with severe congenital neutropenia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that G-CSF-induced activation of Akt requires the activities of Src family kinases but can be clearly dissociated from G-CSF-stimulated activation of Stats (signal transducers and activators of transcription) by the Jak kinases. Thus, cytokine activation of the Jak/Stat and other signaling cascades can be functionally separated.

Twenty-two patients developed morphologic evidence of t-MDS/t-AML. The estimated cumulative probability of developing morphologic t-MDS/t-AML was 8.6% +/- 2.1% at 6 years. Multivariate analysis of the entire cohort revealed stem cell priming with VP-16 (RR = 7.7, P = 0.002) to be independently associated with an increased risk of t-MDS/t-AML. The influence of pretransplant therapy on subsequent t-MDS/t-AML risk was determined by a case-control study. Multivariate analysis revealed an association between pretransplant radiation and the risk of t-MDS/t-AML, but failed to reveal any association with pretransplant chemotherapy or conditioning regimens. However, patients who had been primed with VP-16 for stem cell mobilization were at a 12. 3-fold increased risk of developing t-AML with 11q23/21q22 abnormalities (P = 0.006).

Five had secondary MDS. No differences were noted in response rates among the 3 dose levels. Seven patients did not respond at all, and 22 showed an improvement in cytopenias (76%). Three had a triple lineage response, 10 had a double lineage response, and 9 had a single lineage response (8 of 9 in absolute neutrophil count [ANC] and 1 had more than a 50% reduction in packed red blood cell transfusions). Fifteen patients responded only after the addition of dexamethasone, whereas 7 responded before.

This study evaluated whether a reduction of the dosage of cyclosporine-A (Cs-A) used for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis could reduce relapse rate (RR) in children with acute leukemia given BMT. Fifty-nine children who had transplantation from HLA-identical siblings were randomized to receive Cs-A intravenously at a dosage of 1 mg/kg/d (Cs-A1) or of 3 mg/kg/d (Cs-A3) until patients were able to tolerate oral intake. Subsequently, both groups received Cs-A orally at a dosage of 6 mg/kg/d, with discontinuation 5 months after BMT. The probability of developing grade II-IV acute GVHD was 57% for the Cs-A1 group versus 38% for the Cs-A3 group (P =.06); the probability of developing chronic GVHD was 30% for the Cs-A1 group and 26% for the Cs-A3 group (P = NS). Three patients died of grade IV acute GVHD: 2 were in the Cs-A1 and the third in the Cs-A3 group. The RR was 15% for the Cs-A1 group and 41% for the Cs-A3 group (P =.034); 1-year transplant-related mortality estimates were 17% and 7%, respectively (P = NS). With a median observation time of 44 months from BMT, the 5-year event-free survival for children belonging to Cs-A1 and Cs-A3 groups was 70% and 51%, respectively (P =.15). Our data demonstrate that the use of low Cs-A doses is associated with a statistically significant reduction of leukemia relapse, probably due to an increased graft versus leukemia effect.

We previously developed a mouse model of APL by expressing PMLRARalpha in murine myeloid cells. In order to examine the mechanisms by which PMLRARalpha can initiate leukemia, we have now generated transgenic mice expressing PMLRARalpham4 and RARalpham4, proteins that are unable to activate transcription in response to retinoic acid. PMLRARalpham4 transgenic mice developed myeloid leukemia, demonstrating that transcriptional activation by PMLRARalpha is not required for leukemic transformation. The characteristics of the leukemias arising in the PMLRARalpham4 transgenic mice varied from those previously observed in our PMLRARalpha transgenic mice, indicating that ligand responsiveness may influence the phenotype of the leukemic cells. The leukemias that arose in PMLRARalpham4 transgenic mice did not differentiate in response to retinoic acid therapy. This result supports the hypothesis that a major therapeutic effect of retinoic acid is mediated directly through the PMLRARalpha protein. However, a variable effect on survival suggested that this agent may be of some benefit in APL even when leukemic cells are resistant to its differentiative effects. Transgenic mice expressing high levels of RARalpham4 have not developed leukemia, providing evidence that the PML domain of PMLRARalpha plays a specific and critical role in the pathogenesis of APL.

TAL1 belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of transcription factors that bind as heterodimers with the E2A and HEB/HTF4 gene products to a nucleotide sequence motif termed the E-box. Reported to act both as an activator and as a repressor of transcription, the mechanisms underlying TAL1-regulated gene expression are poorly understood. We report here that the corepressor mSin3A is associated with TAL1 in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) and human T-ALL cells. Interaction mapping showed that the basic-HLH domain of TAL1 was both necessary and sufficient for TAL1-mSin3A interaction. TAL1 was found, in addition, to interact with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 in vitro and in vivo, and a specific histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), relieved TAL1-mediated repression of an E-box-containing promoter and a GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kinase minimal promoter. Further, TAL1 association with mSin3A and HDAC1 declined during dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of MEL cells in parallel with a decrease in mSin3A abundance. Finally, TSA had a synergistic effect with enforced TAL1 expression in stimulating MEL cells to differentiate, while constitutive expression of mSin3A inhibited MEL cell differentiation. These results demonstrate that a corepressor complex containing mSin3A and HDAC1 interacts with TAL1 and restricts its function in erythroid differentiation. This also has implications for this transcription factor's actions in leukemogenesis.","['Huang, S', 'Brandt, S J']","['Huang S', 'Brandt SJ']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Mar;20(6):2248-59. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.6.2248-2259.2000.,,['10.1128/MCB.20.6.2248-2259.2000 [doi]'],,"['R01 HL049118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL49118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK020593/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK20593/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC110841,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting AML-1-ETO fusion is an aberrant transcriptional regulator due to the ability of ETO, which does not bind DNA itself, to recruit the transcriptional corepressors N-CoR, SMRT, and Sin3A and histone deacetylases. The promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional factor fused to retinoic acid receptor alpha in acute promyelocytic leukemia associated with the (11;17)(q23;q21) translocation. PLZF also mediates transcriptional repression through the actions of corepressors and histone deacetylases. We found that ETO is one of the corepressors recruited by PLZF. The PLZF and ETO proteins associate in vivo and in vitro, and ETO can potentiate transcriptional repression by PLZF. The N-terminal portion of ETO forms complexes with PLZF, while the C-terminal region, which was shown to bind to N-CoR and SMRT, is required for the ability of ETO to augment transcriptional repression by PLZF. The second repression domain (RD2) of PLZF, not the POZ/BTB domain, is necessary to bind to ETO. Corepression by ETO was completely abrogated by histone deacetylase inhibitors. This identifies ETO as a cofactor for a sequence-specific transcription factor and indicates that, like other corepressors, it functions through the action of histone deactylase.","['Melnick, A M', 'Westendorf, J J', 'Polinger, A', 'Carlile, G W', 'Arai, S', 'Ball, H J', 'Lutterbach, B', 'Hiebert, S W', 'Licht, J D']","['Melnick AM', 'Westendorf JJ', 'Polinger A', 'Carlile GW', 'Arai S', 'Ball HJ', 'Lutterbach B', 'Hiebert SW', 'Licht JD']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Mar;20(6):2075-86. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.6.2075-2086.2000.,,['10.1128/MCB.20.6.2075-2086.2000 [doi]'],,"['R01 CA059936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA077167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA73762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA064140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC110824,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of the leukemogenic phenotype is generally associated with inappropriate expression of this transcriptional regulator. Despite intensive investigations, the target genes of c-myb that are specifically involved in development of these myeloid lineage neoplasms are still unknown. In vitro assays have indicated that c-myc may be a target gene of c-Myb; however, regulation of the resident chromosomal gene has not yet been demonstrated. To address this question further, we analyzed the expression of c-myc in a myeloblastic cell line, M1, expressing a conditionally active c-Myb-estrogen receptor fusion protein (MybER). Activation of MybER both prevented the growth arrest induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) and rapidly restored c-myc expression in nearly terminal differentiated cells that had been exposed to IL-6 for 3 days. Restoration occurred in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor but not after a transcriptional block, indicating that c-myc is a direct, transcriptionally regulated target of c-Myb. c-myc is a major target that transduces Myb's proliferative signal, as shown by the ability of a c-Myc-estrogen receptor fusion protein alone to also reverse growth arrest in this system. To investigate the possibility that this regulatory connection contributes to Myb's oncogenicity, we expressed a dominant negative Myb in the myeloid leukemic cell line RI-4-11. In this cell line, c-myb is activated by insertional mutagenesis and cannot be effectively down regulated by cytokine. Myb's ability to regulate c-myc's expression was also demonstrated in these cells, showing a mechanism through which the proto-oncogene c-myb can exert its oncogenic potential in myeloid lineage hematopoietic cells.","['Schmidt, M', 'Nazarov, V', 'Stevens, L', 'Watson, R', 'Wolff, L']","['Schmidt M', 'Nazarov V', 'Stevens L', 'Watson R', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, myb', '*Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Mar;20(6):1970-81. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.6.1970-1981.2000.,,['10.1128/MCB.20.6.1970-1981.2000 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC110814,,,,,,,,,,,

Ketoconazole is used for complete androgen deprivation, and recent data suggest it has direct activity against prostate cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 cells, human prostate cancer cell lines, and HL60, a human leukemia cell line, were lysed and soluble proteins were harvested. Cells were plated in 96-well flat bottom plates and then exposed to the pharmacological agents, ketoconazole, vinblastine and paclitaxel. DNA synthesis was monitored by 3H-thymidine incorporation. RESULTS: We demonstrate that ketoconazole exerts a cytostatic effect on a panel of human prostate cancer cell lines, with IC50 of 4 to 5 microg./ml., 12 microg./ml., and 25 microg./ml. for LNCaP, PC3/PC3M, and DU145 cells, respectively. On the other hand, using microtubule-active drugs, vinblastine and paclitaxel, we found that PC3M and PC3 cells were more resistant than either DU145 or LNCaP cells. This resistance was associated with a lesser degree of Raf-1 and Bcl-2 phosphorylation following exposure to microtubule-active drugs. Combinations of microtubule-active drugs with ketoconazole were a beneficial treatment in DU145 cancer cells. Furthermore, ketoconazole blocked recovery of all the prostate cancer cell lines following 24 hours-pulse treatment with vinblastine. CONCLUSION: Pulse-administration of vinblastine followed by continuous administration of ketoconazole warrants investigation in the treatment of hormone-independent metastatic prostate cancer.","['Blagosklonny, M V', 'Dixon, S C', 'Figg, W D']","['Blagosklonny MV', 'Dixon SC', 'Figg WD']","['Medicine Branch, Division of Clinical Sciences, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Ketoconazole/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Paclitaxel/*therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*secondary', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*therapeutic use']",,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2000 Mar;163(3):1022-6.,,['S0022-5347(05)67875-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins that target antigens on leukemic blasts are being explored for their antileukemic effects and as a means of delivering chemotherapy or radiation directly to malignant cells. This approach might be safer and more effective than current non-specific chemotherapeutic agents. The cell surface antigens CD33 and CD45 are attractive targets. Although CD33 is expressed on acute myelocytic leukemic blast cells from about 90% of patients, normal hematopoietic stem cells lack this antigen, as do essentially all non-hematopoietic tissues. Anti-CD33 antibodies have been engineered to selectively target malignant myeloid and immature normal cells while sparing normal stem cells. Recently, anti-CD33 antibodies have also been used to deliver radiation or a cytotoxic agent directly to leukemic cells. The strategy for using CD45 as a target differs from CD33 in that it is expressed not only by the vast majority of leukemias, but also by normal stem cells. Therefore, 131I-labeled anti-CD45 antibody has been used in combination with conventional preparative regimens for patients receiving marrow transplantation for acute leukemia. Because the receptor for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is expressed by most myeloid leukemias, fusion proteins consisting of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ligand associated with diphtheria toxin have been proposed as a means of delivering a toxic agent directly to leukemic cells.

The knowledge that B-CLL is the final consequence of many different molecular perturbations may allow the development of chemotherapies, immunotherapies, and gene therapies that target the specific molecular defect in a given case of B-CLL.","['Bannerji, R', 'Byrd, J C']","['Bannerji R', 'Byrd JC']","['Hematology Oncology Service, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Prognosis']",76,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2000 Jan;12(1):22-9. doi: 10.1097/00001622-200001000-00004.,,['10.1097/00001622-200001000-00004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has become apparent that a risk assignment system based on primary genetic abnormalities is inadequate by itself. For example, leukemias with the MLL-AF4 or BCR-ABL fusion gene are, in fact, heterogeneous diseases. Many require allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation; some, if the patient is of favorable age and has a low presenting leukocyte count, can be cured with chemotherapy alone. Measurement of early responses to therapy and extent of minimal residual disease can greatly improve the accuracy of risk assessment. Consideration of the variable effects of therapy on the prognostic significance of specific genetic abnormalities is also important. Therefore, TEL-AML1 fusion confers a favorable prognosis in some protocols of chemotherapy but not in others. Studies to identify genetic polymorphisms with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic significance promise to guide further refinement of treatment strategies. This will allow maximization of anticancer effects without induction of unacceptable toxicity in individual patients.","['Pui, C H']",['Pui CH'],"[""Department of Hematology/Oncology and Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment']",136,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2000 Jan;12(1):3-12. doi: 10.1097/00001622-200001000-00002.,,['10.1097/00001622-200001000-00002 [doi]'],,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article shares recent research findings on an Australian educational support course, appropriately named Taking Control, designed specifically for patients with leukemia and associated disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The material presented in this article represents the findings from the retrospective arm of a descriptive study designed to evaluate this course. Participants in the course during the calendar year of 1997 were surveyed with an author-designed, self-report questionnaire requesting feedback on their experience of the course. RESULTS: Although the majority of participants were seeking information, there was strong evidence that the provision of information needs to be coupled with an understanding of the psychosocial reasons that motivated individuals to attend the course. The findings indicate that the course is perceived by participants to be an effective psychosocial intervention for assisting patients and their families cope with the serious diagnosis of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Even though information seeking was an important reason for attending this educational course, there were many other significant emotional concerns that individuals brought to the experience. When exposed to the stress of leukemia and its treatment, patients and their significant others may become preoccupied with information gathering. Therefore, it is important to not only explore the issue of the informational needs of participants, but also to examine the emotional needs they associate with this information gathering. The hope and expectation about sharing the findings of this program is that it will assist with the development of similar programs elsewhere and will stimulate further research on the importance of educational support groups in oncology.","['McGrath, P']",['McGrath P'],"['Centre for Public Health Research, Queensland University of Technology, Red Hill, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Pract,Cancer practice,9312355,,,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Attitude to Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Needs Assessment', 'Patient Education as Topic/*organization & administration', 'Program Evaluation', 'Queensland', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self-Help Groups/*organization & administration', '*Social Support', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Pract. 1999 Jul-Aug;7(4):198-204. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-5394.1999.74006.x.,,['10.1046/j.1523-5394.1999.74006.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Before being released from The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, 84 recipients of BMT were interviewed regarding their quality of life and psychosocial adaptation. Survivors were reinterviewed at 6 months, and at 1 year post-BMT, producing considerable qualitative data regarding their problems in living. Eighty-four patients who had received BMT completed qualitative interviews and standardized measures before treatment, before the return home, and at 6 and 12 months post-BMT. The interviews were subjected to a content analysis methodology to establish units and categories to examine the body of material. RESULTS: Content analysis of these interviews from the first year after BMT identified three areas of psychosocial morbidity; 1) physical problems, which included fatigue, appearance, troubles in eating, and physical restrictions; 2) psychological problems, which included fears about the future, sense of loss of control, anxiety, and depression; and 3) community reintegration problems, which included difficulty in returning to former social roles, separation from home, family, and friends, difficulty in resuming social relations, dealing with stigmatization, problems with family and children, and financial and employment difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of these problems for BMT survivors can be used to guide the development of specific materials and services to prepare recipients of BMTs and their families for life after the transplant. These qualitative results can also be used to direct the development of assessment tools to identify potential patient and family problems.","['Baker, F', 'Zabora, J', 'Polland, A', 'Wingard, J']","['Baker F', 'Zabora J', 'Polland A', 'Wingard J']","['Behavioral Research Center, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Pract,Cancer practice,9312355,,,"['*Activities of Daily Living', '*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nursing Methodology Research', 'Prospective Studies', '*Social Adjustment', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology']",,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Pract. 1999 Jul-Aug;7(4):190-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-5394.1999.74005.x.,,['10.1046/j.1523-5394.1999.74005.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study of 8 cases].,785-9,"BACKGROUND: The RS3PE syndrome is a recently described uncommon disorder in the elderly patient; in the initial reports, it was characterized by an excellent prognosis with total remission. In contrast with rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatic, it has been related to HLA B7. Further works have questioned its benign nature and even that it is a new entity. Our objective was to study the clinico-biological characteristics, therapy, and clinical course in patients with RS3PE attended at our clinic. METHODS: Retrospective descriptional study of patients with RS3PE attended in our clinic from January 1992 to December 1998 following the inclusion criteria proposed by Olive et al. For all patients, the following determinations and studies were performed: complete blood count, ESR, serum biochemistry, two measurements of rheumatoid factor (RF), and X-ray. Class I HLA typing was determined in five cases. RESULTS: Eight patients were found (6 men and 2 women), with a mean age of 68.7 years. The arthritis was more common at MCP, wrists, shoulder, and PIF in hands. Four patients had tenosynovitis of the hand flexors. ESR (mean: 69.3) and RCP (mean: 49.7) were increased in most cases. Seven patients had leukocytosis. HLA B7 was positive for 4 out of five patients. All patients were treated with low-dose corticosteroids, with a mean length of 9.5 months. Three patients had relapses. During follow-up after therapy had been completed, none of the patients had other diseases. CONCLUSIONS: RS3PE syndrome involves elderly patients and its clinical course is characterized by sudden onset seronegative symmetrical polysynovitis, with pitting edema over the hand dorsum and less commonly over the pretibial region. In most cases, a marked acute-phase reaction and leukocytosis were observed. Therapy with low-dose corticosteroids is effective; sometimes however, it is necessary to add antimalarial agents. The three patients who relapsed had underlying diseases: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Sjogren's syndrome, and liver cirrhosis, respectively. The diagnosis of RS3PE should be obtained a posteriori, after a prolonged follow-up of the patient. Atypical cases, with evolution towards other rheumatic or hematological disorders or as paraneoplastic manifestation, have been reported.","['Cobeta Garcia, J C', 'Martinez Burgui, J']","['Cobeta Garcia JC', 'Martinez Burgui J']","['FEA de Reumatologia, Hospital General Obispo Polanco, Teruel. cobeta@lettera.net']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Rev Clin Esp,Revista clinica espanola,8608576,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Edema/blood/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Syndrome', 'Synovitis/blood/*diagnosis/*therapy']",,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Clin Esp. 1999 Dec;199(12):785-9.,Sindrome RS3PE o polisinovitis edematosa benigna del anciano.

Similar effects were observed in the murine hepatoma 1c1c7 cell line. Immunofluorescence techniques employing 1c1c7 cells demonstrated the immediate release of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B following lysosomal photodamage. These studies suggest that the cytotoxic effects of lysosomal photodamage are initiated by released lysosomal proteases that either directly and/or indirectly activate caspases as a consequence of the induction of mitochondrial damage.","['Kessel, D', 'Luo, Y', 'Mathieu, P', 'Reiners, J J Jr']","['Kessel D', 'Luo Y', 'Mathieu P', 'Reiners JJ Jr']","['Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA. dhkessel@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cathepsin B/analysis', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Light', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects/enzymology/radiation effects', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2000 Feb;71(2):196-200. doi: 10.1562/0031-8655(2000)071<0196:dotart>2.0.co;2.,,['10.1562/0031-8655(2000)071<0196:dotart>2.0.co;2 [doi]'],,"['CA 23378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 65561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES09392/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WT1 gene is encoded by 10 exons, resulting in messenger RNA subject to a complex pattern of alternative splicing. WT1 gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, which binds to GC-rich sequences and functions as a transcriptional activator or repressor for many growth factor genes. WT 1 protein is mainly expressed in developing kidney, testis, and ovary, indicating that it is involved in the differentiation of genitourinary tissues, all thought to be the sites of origin of Wilms' tumor. The point mutation of WT1 results in Denys-Drash syndrome. The other Wilms' tumor gene, WT2 at 11p15.5, is linked to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The possibility that WT1 is involved in the etiology of rhabdoid tumor of the kidney was discussed. WT1 is expressed in immortalized hematologic cells such as EBV-LCL and hematologic malignancies, but not in PBL or IL-2L. High level WT1 expression in leukemia cells and a poor prognosis are linked in patients with leukemia, making the gene a novel marker for leukemia cells. A correlated expression between WT1 and mdr-1 in vincristine resistant cells indicates a close relation with multi-drug resistance and is a promising diagnostic marker for chemoresistance in hematologic malignancies.","['Hirose, M']",['Hirose M'],"['Division of Transfusion Medicine, University of Tokushima School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,J Med Invest,The journal of medical investigation : JMI,9716841,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'WT1 Proteins', 'Wilms Tumor/*genetics']",82,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Invest. 1999 Aug;46(3-4):130-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective multicentric analysis was made of 121 patients treated for breast cancer and who later developed leukemia or a preleukemic state. Initially, 44 patients had undergone mastectomy, 72 had conservative surgery and 119 had locoregional irradiation. At least one chemotherapy session was performed in 90 patients and 48 had received tamoxifen. The risk of relapse of breast cancer was high, moderate or low for 44, 46 and 24 patients respectively (data not available for 7 patients). RESULTS: By class, the hematology diseases found were: myelodysplasia (n = 9), refractory anemia with blast excess (n = 7), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), acute myoblastic leukemia (n = 93 including a majority of type 2 and type 4). For acute myeloblastic leukemia, mean delay to onset was 65 and 37 months respectively without and after chemotherapy. The prognosis of these cases of leukemia and preleukemic states was poor with an overall death rate of 86%. CONCLUSION: In light of the recent development of indications for adjuvant chemotherapy even for subgroups of patients at moderate risk, it is important to more precisely assess the absolute benefit in terms of survival compared with the risk of severe complications, particular secondary leukemia.

METHODS: Pig articular cartilage explants were cultured in the presence of either 20% v/v rheumatoid (RA) or osteoarthritic (OA) SF and varying concentrations of either mLBP and/or IL-1ra. The catabolic activity of the SF and the relative effects of mLBP and/or IL-1ra were assessed by determining the percentage release of sulfated glycosaminoglycans from cartilage explants. LIF concentrations were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: RA SF but not OA SF stimulated release of proteoglycans from pig cartilage explants in vitro (47.3 +/- 2.2% vs 24.6 +/- 2.0%; p < 0.0001). Murine LBP at 100 ng/ml and recombinant human (rh) IL-1ra at 5000 ng/ml produced a dose dependent inhibition of this proteoglycan release (p < 0.0067 and p < 0.0111, respectively). The RA SF stimulated proteoglycan release was attenuated by mLBP and rhIL-1ra independently. No additive effect of this attenuation was observed when maximal inhibitory doses were used in combination. The decrease in proteoglycan release produced by mLBP correlated significantly with LIF concentrations in RA SF. CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with the concept that IL-1 stimulates cartilage proteoglycan resorption in RA. They also support the hypothesis that LIF, too, contributes to cartilage proteoglycan resorption in RA. The residual stimulation not accounted for by IL-1 or LIF suggests other cytokines may contribute.

ANIMALS: 85 client-owned cats; 24 seropositive for FIV, 10 seropositive for FeLV, 1 seropositive for both viruses, and 50 seronegative for both viruses. PROCEDURE: Cutaneous specimens were obtained from the coat and external acoustic meatus (ear canal) and mucosal specimens from the oropharynx and rectum. Fungi were isolated from specimens, using Sabouraud dextrose agar incubated at 27 or 37 C for cutaneous and mucosal specimens, respectively. RESULTS: Fungal colonies were cultured from at least 1 specimen from 83 of 85 (97.6%) cats. The most common fungal isolates were Aspergillus spp (cultured from 59.3% of all specimens), Penicillium spp (50.0%), Cladosporium spp (44.2%), Scopulariopsis spp (41.8%), and lipophilic yeasts of the genus Malassezia (31.4%). A greater diversity of fungal genera was isolated from retrovirus-infected cats, and Malassezia spp were more commonly recovered from these cats, compared with noninfected cats. Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and dermatophytes (eg, Microsporum canis) were rarely isolated from any cat. Significant differences in frequency of isolation of C. neoformans and dermatophytes were not found between infected and noninfected cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cats infected with FIV or FeLV may have a greater diversity of cutaneous and mucosal mycoflora than noninfected cats. However, infected cats may be no more likely than noninfected cats to expose humans to zoonotic fungi such as C. albicans, C. neoformans, and M. canis.","['Sierra, P', 'Guillot, J', 'Jacob, H', 'Bussieras, S', 'Chermette, R']","['Sierra P', 'Guillot J', 'Jacob H', 'Bussieras S', 'Chermette R']","['Equipe de Parasitologie-Mycologie, UMR INRA-AFSSA-ENVA Biologie Moleculaire et Immunologie Parasitaires et Fongiques, Ecole Nationale Veterinaire dAlfort, Maisons-Alfort, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,,IM,"['Animals', 'Aspergillus/isolation & purification', 'Candida albicans/isolation & purification', 'Cat Diseases/etiology/*microbiology', 'Cats', 'Cladosporium/isolation & purification', 'Cryptococcus neoformans/isolation & purification', 'Dermatomycoses/etiology/*veterinary', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Fungi/*classification/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Feline/complications/*microbiology', 'Malassezia/isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Microsporum/isolation & purification', 'Mycoses/etiology/*veterinary', 'Penicillium/isolation & purification', 'Skin/*microbiology']",,2000/02/24 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/02/24 09:00'],"['2000/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2000 Feb;61(2):158-61. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.2000.61.158.,,['10.2460/ajvr.2000.61.158 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because interleukin (IL)-2 can induce remission in patients with overt evidence of acute myelogenous leukemia, we hypothesized that it might prevent relapse when administered to patients in first remission after intensive consolidation chemotherapy. A pilot Children's Cancer Group (CCG) trial (CCG-0941) demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, and we initiated a prospective randomized trial (CCG-2961) to further evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of IL-2 therapy in preventing relapse of acute myelogenous leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In trial CCG-0941, 21 pediatric patients in complete remission following induction and consolidation chemotherapy on protocol CCG-2941 received IL-2 therapy. In CCG-2961, 79 patients in complete remission were randomized as of February 1999 to receive either IL-2 (n = 39) or no further therapy. In both trials, recombinant IL-2 was given at a dose of 9 million IU/m2/d by continuous intravenous infusion for 4 days. After 4 days of rest, IL-2 was resumed at a dose of 1.6 million IU/m2/d for 10 days by continuous infusion. We monitored patients for toxicity and relapse. RESULTS: The majority of patients treated with IL-2 in these two trials experienced some degree of fever. Seven of 60 patients (12%) had clinically significant rashes, and grade 3 vascular leak syndrome and hypotension have each been observed in five patients (8%). Hypotension resolved promptly after treatment with intravenous fluids. No patients have experienced renal toxicity or required cardiac vasopressors or transfer to an intensive care unit; there have been no treatment-related deaths. Overall, the incidence and severity of adverse events remain similar in the two trials. Total projected accrual to the IL-2 randomization is anticipated to be 326 patients, and relapse and survival data remain blinded. CONCLUSION: The dose and schedule of IL-2 used in these two trials continue to be reasonably well tolerated by children with acute myelogenous leukemia in first remission. Any conclusions with regard to efficacy must await completion of the randomized trial.","['Sievers, E L', 'Lange, B J', 'Sondel, P M', 'Krailo, M D', 'Gan, J', 'Tjoa, T', 'Liu-Mares, W', 'Feig, S A']","['Sievers EL', 'Lange BJ', 'Sondel PM', 'Krailo MD', 'Gan J', 'Tjoa T', 'Liu-Mares W', 'Feig SA']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer J Sci Am,The cancer journal from Scientific American,9513568,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence']",,2000/02/24 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/24 09:00'],"['2000/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer J Sci Am. 2000 Feb;6 Suppl 1:S39-44.,,,,"['R25 CA092049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 14489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MO1-RR00240/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of immunotherapy in the autologous transplant setting is modeled in part on the well-characterized immunotherapeutic effect of the graft-versus-tumor response in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation. The graft-versus-tumor response, mediated by donor cells, contributes to the higher cure rates seen in patients undergoing allogeneic transplant for the treatment of a variety of hematologic malignancies, including acute and chronic myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma PATIENTS AND METHODS: The literature was reviewed, and we relate our own clinical experience with IL-2 therapy in this setting. RESULTS: Preclinical in vitro and animal data show a variety of leukemia cells are sensitive to autologous IL-2-activated effector cells. In addition, laboratory studies show that IL-2 can be used to activate antitumor cellular responses from bone marrow and peripheral blood without compromising hematopoiesis. Most importantly, in vitro studies show that chemoresistant malignant hematopoietic cells are sensitive to IL-2-induced cell death, thus emphasizing the lack of cross resistance to immunologic-based therapeutics. The results of phase I and II studies conducted in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in first or subsequent remission suggest that autologous IL-2-activated cells may mediate an antitumor response and aid in preventing relapse after autologous transplantation. Clinical trials to determine the role of IL-2 after transplantation for the treatment of acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma are ongoing. CONCLUSION: These studies will help define the optimal dose and schedule of IL-2 and its role in augmenting therapeutic immune-mediated autologous responses.","['Margolin, K', 'Forman, S J']","['Margolin K', 'Forman SJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Therapeutics Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer J Sci Am,The cancer journal from Scientific American,9513568,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2000/02/24 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/24 09:00'],"['2000/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer J Sci Am. 2000 Feb;6 Suppl 1:S33-8.,,,,"['CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'PPG CA 30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined immunohistochemically 4 apoptosis-regulating bcl-2 familial proteins (bcl-2, mcl-1, bcl-X, and bax) in the biliary epithelium in 19 cases of primary biliary cirrhosis. Ten cases of chronic hepatitis C, 9 cases of extrahepatic biliary obstruction, and 10 cases of normal liver were used as a control. Bcl-2 and mcl-1 are inhibitors of apoptosis, bcl-X, probably bcl-XL in biliary epithelial cells, an inhibitor, and bax, a promoter of apoptosis. First, we clarified the distribution of bcl-2 familial proteins on the intrahepatic biliary tree in normal livers. Bcl-2 was detected in the interlobular bile ducts and bile ductules, but not in the large and septal bile ducts in all cases examined. Mcl-1, bcl-X, and bax were diffusely detectable at the any level of the intrahepatic biliary tree, with a staining pattern that was diffuse and cytoplasmic. This distribution pattern was preserved in extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Bcl-2 expression was lost or markedly reduced in the damaged interlobular bile ducts in primary biliary cirrhosis, whereas the reduction was only focal or mild in the bile ducts with hepatitis-associated damage in chronic hepatitis C. Expression levels of mcl-1, bcl-X, and bax were similarly reduced to that of bcl-2 in these 2 diseases. These findings suggest that bax is not important as a proapoptotic factor in the damaged bile ducts and that downregulation of bcl-2 and mcl-1, and probably that of bcl-XL, leads to a decrease in the threshold of apoptosis and increase in the vulnerability to apoptotic stimuli in these bile ducts, followed by the progressive apoptotic loss of interlobular bile ducts, in primary biliary cirrhosis.","['Iwata, M', 'Harada, K', 'Kono, N', 'Kaneko, S', 'Kobayashi, K', 'Nakanuma, Y']","['Iwata M', 'Harada K', 'Kono N', 'Kaneko S', 'Kobayashi K', 'Nakanuma Y']","['Second Department of Pathology, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bile Ducts/*chemistry', 'Cholestasis, Extrahepatic/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Epithelium/chemistry', 'Female', 'Hepatitis C/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2000/02/24 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/24 09:00'],"['2000/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2000 Feb;31(2):179-84. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(00)80217-8.,,"['S0046-8177(00)80217-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(00)80217-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The usual bone marrow findings in acute parvovirus infections are marked erythroid hypoplasia and occasional giant erythroblasts. Intranuclear inclusions in developing erythroid precursors are rarely described in children or adults with parvovirus infection, although abundant intranuclear inclusions are commonly observed in the placenta and other tissues in infected fetuses. In this study, 8 patients are reported in whom the first evidence of parvovirus infection was the recognition of numerous intranuclear inclusions in erythroid precursors on bone marrow biopsy sections. Six of the 8 patients had documented immunodeficiencies; 4 had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 2 were on chemotherapy. Five of 7 patients were negative for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antiparvovirus antibodies, including all 4 with AIDS. Unlike the typical pattern in parvovirus infection, the bone marrow was hypercellular in most of the patients, and erythroid precursors were usually increased with the entire spectrum of normoblast maturation represented; abundant intranuclear inclusions were observed similar to the finding in fetuses. The inclusions were variably eosinophilic and compressed the chromatin against the nuclear membrane. In situ hybridization showed parvovirus B19 DNA in numerous erythroid precursors in all cases. The findings of erythroid maturation and abundant viral inclusions in these immunocompromised patients is consistent with the hypothesis that failure to produce effective IgG parvovirus neutralizing antibodies may lead to persistent infection through viral tolerance that allows erythroid development of infected cells past the pronormoblast stage. Identification of parvovirus inclusions in marrow biopsies and subsequent confirmation of infection by in situ hybridization can be important in the assessment of anemia in immunodeficient patients because serological studies for parvovirus B19 are frequently negative.","['Crook, T W', 'Rogers, B B', 'McFarland, R D', 'Kroft, S H', 'Muretto, P', 'Hernandez, J A', 'Latimer, M J', 'McKenna, R W']","['Crook TW', 'Rogers BB', 'McFarland RD', 'Kroft SH', 'Muretto P', 'Hernandez JA', 'Latimer MJ', 'McKenna RW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9072, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/virology', 'Adult', 'Anemia/virology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Child', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Erythrocytes/ultrastructure', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Inclusion Bodies/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Parvoviridae Infections/blood/*pathology', '*Parvovirus B19, Human/genetics']",,2000/02/24 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/24 09:00'],"['2000/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2000 Feb;31(2):161-8. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(00)80215-4.,,"['S0046-8177(00)80215-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(00)80215-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported that they act as growth factor antagonists, growth factor receptor blockers, interfere with mitogenic signal transduction or exert direct cytotoxic effects. Chlorambucil (4-[p-(bis[2-chloroethyl]amino)phenyl]butyric acid) is an alkylating agent widely used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Contradictory reports have been published concerning its interaction with cell membranes. Whereas a decrease in the fluidity of Ehrlich ascite tumor cells has been adduced, no evidences were found that chlorambucil changes membrane lipid fluidity and alkylating agents had effects in these systems even at highly toxic concentrations. Our results showed that chlorambucil at a dose equivalent to its therapeutical concentration in the plasma (3.6 microM) caused the human erythrocyte membrane to develop cup-shaped forms (stomatocytes). Accordingly to the bilayer couple hypothesis, this means that the drug is inserted into the inner monolayer of the erythrocyte membrane, a conclusion supported by X-ray diffraction performed on multilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE), representative of phospholipid classes located in the outer and inner monolayers of the erythrocyte membrane, respectively. It is concluded that the cytotoxic effect of chlorambucil might be due to alteration of the structure and therefore of the physiological properties of cell membranes such as fluidity, permeability, receptor and channel functions.","['Suwalsky, M', 'Hernandez, P', 'Villena, F', 'Sotomayor, C P']","['Suwalsky M', 'Hernandez P', 'Villena F', 'Sotomayor CP']","['Faculty of Chemical Sciences, University of Concepcion, Chile. msuwalsk@udec.cl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Z Naturforsch C J Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

Only rocaglamide type compounds showed significant inhibition of [3H-]thymidine incorporation and the most active compound didesmethylrocaglamide inhibited cell growth in a similar concentration range as the well-known anticancer drug vinblastine sulfate. Detailed structure-activity analysis indicated that the OH-group at C-8b which is a common structural feature of most naturally occurring rocaglamide compounds is essential for the described antiproliferative activity since replacement of this group by methylation led to a complete loss of the inhibitory activity for the resulting derivative. Rocaglamide derivatives rapidly inhibited DNA as well as protein biosynthesis of MONO-MAC-6 cells at concentrations well below those of actinomycin D or cycloheximide which were used as positive controls in the respective experiments. Didesmethylrocaglamide was furthermore able to induce growth arrest of MONO-MAC-1 cells in the G2/M and probably G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle with no morphological indication of cellular damage.

The three-dimensional solution structure of the human p8MTCP1 protein encoded by the MTCP1 oncogene has been previously determined by homonuclear proton two-dimensional NMR methods at 600 MHz: it consists of an original scaffold comprising three alpha-helices, associated with a new cysteine motif. Two of the helices are covalently paired by two disulfide bridges, forming an alpha-hairpin which resembles an antiparallel coiled-coil. The third helix is orientated roughly parallel to the plane defined by the alpha-antiparallel motif and appears less well defined. In order to gain more insight into the details of this new scaffold, we uniformly labeled with nitrogen-15 a mutant of this protein (C12A-p8MTCP1) in which the unbound cysteine at position 12 has been replaced by an alanine residue, thus allowing reproducibly high yields of recombinant protein. The refined structure benefits from 211 additional NOEs, extracted from 15N-edited 3D experiments, and from a nearly complete set of phi angular restraints allowing the estimation of the helical content of the structured part of the protein. Moreover, measurements of 15N spin relaxation times and heteronuclear 15N inverted question mark1H inverted question markNOEs provided additional insights into the dynamics of the protein backbone. The analysis of the linear correlation between J(0) and J(omega) was used to interpret relaxation parameters. It appears that the apparent relative disorder seen in helix III is not simply due to a lack of experimental constraints, but associated with substantial contributions of sub-nanosecond motions in this segment.","['Barthe, P', 'Chiche, L', 'Declerck, N', 'Delsuc, M A', 'Lefevre, J F', 'Malliavin, T', 'Mispelter, J', 'Stern, M H', 'Lhoste, J M', 'Roumestand, C']","['Barthe P', 'Chiche L', 'Declerck N', 'Delsuc MA', 'Lefevre JF', 'Malliavin T', 'Mispelter J', 'Stern MH', 'Lhoste JM', 'Roumestand C']","['Centre de Biochimie Structurale, CNRS-UMR 9955, INSERM-U414, Universite de Montpellier I, Faculte de Pharmacie, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Biomol NMR,Journal of biomolecular NMR,9110829,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (TCL1B protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Diffusion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Models, Molecular', 'Motion', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular/*methods', 'Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Solutions', '*Transcription Factors']",,2000/02/24 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/02/24 09:00'],"['2000/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biomol NMR. 1999 Dec;15(4):271-88. doi: 10.1023/a:1008336418418.,,['10.1023/a:1008336418418 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some reports show that FK506 (tacrolimus hydrate) inhibited histamine release and cytokine production by mast cells and basophils. However, as the effects of FK506 has not been compared with those of clinically used drugs in those reports, the clinical relevancy of FK506 inhibition remained unclear. In this paper, we compared the actions of FK506 with those of steroids or disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) which has been clinically used. FK506 inhibited histamine release by Brown-Norway rat peritoneal mast cells more potently than steroids and especially DSCG. FK506 also inhibited histamine release by a mast rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-1 cell line and human peripheral blood basophils, whereas steroids failed to inhibit histamine release by human basophils. FK506 as well as steroids inhibited TNF-alpha and IL-4 production by RBL-1 cells. FK506 was therefore more effective than steroids and DSCG in inhibiting histamine release, and it also had the ability of inhibiting cytokine production by mast cells as steroids do. We concluded that FK506 might regulate allergic diseases via these actions, judging from the viewpoint of clinical relevancy.","['Sengoku, T', 'Kishi, S', 'Sakuma, S', 'Ohkubo, Y', 'Goto, T']","['Sengoku T', 'Kishi S', 'Sakuma S', 'Ohkubo Y', 'Goto T']","['Medicinal Biology Research Laboratories, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., 1-6, 2-chome, Kashima, Yodogawa-ku, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Tacrolimus/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",,2000/02/24 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/02/24 09:00'],"['2000/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 2000 Mar;22(3):189-201. doi: 10.1016/s0192-0561(99)00076-4.,,"['S0192-0561(99)00076-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0192-0561(99)00076-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As responder T-cells were used T-lymphocyte clones derived from acute leukemia patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia, and the accessory cells were highly enriched acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts. The effects of imipenem and cilastatin on phytohemagglutinin (PHA), anti-CD3 and anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulated activation were assayed, and in addition drug effects on cytokine-dependent proliferation of activated T-lymphocytes were investigated. Imipenem inhibited IL2-dependent proliferation of activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell clones, and an inhibition was also detected for IL7-, IL12-, IL15-, IL16- and IL17-dependent clonal proliferation. Imipenem caused a weak inhibition of anti-CD3- and PHA-stimulated T-cell proliferation when using 50 Gy irradiated AML blast accessory cells derived from various patients, whereas no effect was observed for anti-CD3+anti-CD28 stimulated and allostimulated activation. Imipenem decreased the release of IL4 and Interferon-gamma by T-cell clones stimulated with anti-CD3 and PHA in the presence of native (nonirradiated) AML blasts. The imipenem effects were observed at concentrations corresponding to levels reached in vivo, whereas even high concentrations of cilastatin did not alter T-cell responses. The T-lymphocyte inhibition is probably caused by a direct effect of imipenem on the T-cells.","['Bruserud, O']",['Bruserud O'],"['Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and the University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '141A6AMN38 (Cilastatin)', '71OTZ9ZE0A (Imipenem)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cilastatin/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imipenem/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",,2000/02/24 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/02/24 09:00'],"['2000/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 2000 Jan;22(1):69-81. doi: 10.1016/s0192-0561(99)00070-3.,,"['S0192-0561(99)00070-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0192-0561(99)00070-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML inactivation results in the complete abrogation of the Daxx proapoptotic ability. In APL cells, Daxx is delocalized from the NB.

The aspirates were obtained from skin or subcutaneous tissue (four cases), testis (one case), posterior ileum (one case), lymph node (one case), and abdominal washing (one case). Morphology of the aspirates varied from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated cells showing little or no evidence of myeloid differentiation. Thorough search for evidence of myeloid differentiation and a high index of suspicion of granulocytic sarcoma are of paramount importance. In three cases, flow cytometric and immunocytochemical studies were applied to the FNA materials to confirm the myeloid lineage of the cells and the diagnosis. In the other four cases more than one site was involved by the tumor; once the diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma was established with a biopsy, the FNA sufficed to confirm the diagnosis at another location. This study demonstrates that FNA cytology in conjunction with appropriate immunophenotyping can provide an accurate diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma. Fine-needle aspiration can reduce the need for surgical intervention when combined with immunophenotypic studies and when additional anatomic sites are involved.","['Tao, J', 'Wu, M', 'Fuchs, A', 'Wasserman, P']","['Tao J', 'Wu M', 'Fuchs A', 'Wasserman P']","['Department of Pathology, The Long Island Campus for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New Hyde Park, NY 11040, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Diagn Pathol,Annals of diagnostic pathology,9800503,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2000/02/23 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/23 09:00'],"['2000/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Diagn Pathol. 2000 Feb;4(1):17-22. doi: 10.1016/s1092-9134(00)90005-4.,,"['10.1016/s1092-9134(00)90005-4 [doi]', 'S1092-9134(00)90005-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that SU and TM of BLV do, indeed, associate through disulfide bonds, whether the envelope proteins are overexpressed in transfected cells, are produced in virus-infected cells, or are present in newly produced virions.","['Johnston, E R', 'Radke, K']","['Johnston ER', 'Radke K']","['Department of Animal Science and Graduate Group in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of California, Davis, California 95616-8521, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cattle', 'Disulfides/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virion']",,2000/02/23 00:00,2000/02/23 00:01,['2000/02/23 00:00'],"['2000/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '2000/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Mar;74(6):2930-5. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.6.2930-2935.2000.,,['10.1128/jvi.74.6.2930-2935.2000 [doi]'],,"['T32 GM007377/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07377/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC111788,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the presence of Pit1 region A did not confer receptor function for FeLV-B upon Pit2, while it did so for GALV. We have here shown that the presence of two Pit1-specific loop 4 residues (tyrosine 546 and valine 548) in addition to Pit1 region A is sufficient to make Pit2 an efficient FeLV-B receptor; that is, a stretch of 13 amino acids encompassing all loop 4 amino acid differences between Pit1 and Pit2 comprises a C-terminal determinant for FeLV-B receptor function.

Previous studies established that infection of cells with A-MuLV resulted in the specific down-modulation of phosphate uptake mediated by Pit-2 and in resistance to superinfection with A-MuLV. To study the mechanisms underlying these phenomena, we constructed plasmids capable of efficiently expressing epsilon epitope- and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged human Pit-2 proteins in mammalian cells. Overexpression of epsilon-epitope-tagged Pit-2 transporters in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in a marked increase in sodium-dependent P(i) uptake. This increase in P(i) uptake was specifically blocked by A-MuLV infection but not by infection with ecotropic MuLV (E-MuLV) (which utilizes a cationic amino acid transporter, not Pit-2, as a cell surface receptor). These data, together with the finding that the tagged Pit-2 transporters retained their A-MuLV receptor function, indicate that the insertion of epitope tags does not affect either retrovirus receptor or P(i) transporter function. The overexpressed epitope-tagged transporters were detected in cell lysates, by Western blot analysis using both epsilon-epitope- and GFP-specific antibodies as well as with Pit-2 antiserum. Both the epitope- and GFP-tagged transporters showed almost exclusive plasma membrane localization when expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, as determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Importantly, when NIH 3T3 cells expressing these proteins were productively infected with A-MuLV, the tagged transporters and receptors were no longer detected in the plasma membrane but rather were localized to a punctate structure within the cytosolic compartment distinct from Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria. The intracellular Pit-2 pool colocalized with the virus in A-MuLV-infected cells. A similar redistribution of the tagged Pit-2 proteins was not observed following infection with E-MuLV, indicating that the redistribution of Pit-2 is not directly attributable to general effects associated with retroviral infection but rather is a specific consequence of A-MuLV-Pit-2 interactions.","['Jobbagy, Z', 'Garfield, S', 'Baptiste, L', 'Eiden, M V', 'Anderson, W B']","['Jobbagy Z', 'Garfield S', 'Baptiste L', 'Eiden MV', 'Anderson WB']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Phosphate Transport Proteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (SLC20A2 protein, human)', '0 (Slc20a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc20a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Prkce protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-epsilon)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Blotting, Western', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Phosphate Transport Proteins', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics', 'Protein Kinase C-epsilon', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', 'Subcellular Fractions', '*Symporters', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism']",,2000/02/23 00:00,2000/02/23 00:01,['2000/02/23 00:00'],"['2000/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '2000/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Mar;74(6):2847-54. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.6.2847-2854.2000.,,['10.1128/jvi.74.6.2847-2854.2000 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC111775,,,,,,,,,,,

This notion of a retroviral ""headful"" was tested by examining the ability of Moloney murine leukemia virus genomes lengthened by 4, 8, or 11 kb to participate in a single replication cycle. Overall, replication of these lengthened genomes was 5- to 10-fold less efficient than that of native-length genomes. When RNA expression and virion formation, RNA packaging, and early stages of replication were compared, long genomes were found to complete each step less efficiently than did normal-length genomes. To test whether short RNAs might facilitate the packaging of lengthy RNAs by heterodimerization, some experiments involved coexpression of a short packageable RNA. However, enhancement of neither long vector RNA packaging nor long vector DNA synthesis was observed in the presence of the short RNA. Most of the proviruses templated by 12 and 16 kb vectors appeared to be full length. Most products of a 19. 2-kb vector contained deletions, but some integrated proviruses were around twice the native genome length. These results demonstrate that lengthy retroviral genomes can be packaged and that genome length is not strictly limited at any individual replication step. These observations also suggest that the lengthy read-through RNAs postulated to be intermediates in retroviral transduction can be packaged directly without further processing.","['Shin, N H', ""Hartigan-O'Connor, D"", 'Pfeiffer, J K', 'Telesnitsky, A']","['Shin NH', ""Hartigan-O'Connor D"", 'Pfeiffer JK', 'Telesnitsky A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0620, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'DNA, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Viral', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Virus Assembly/physiology', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",,2000/02/23 00:00,2000/02/23 00:01,['2000/02/23 00:00'],"['2000/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '2000/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Mar;74(6):2694-702. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.6.2694-2702.2000.,,['10.1128/jvi.74.6.2694-2702.2000 [doi]'],,"['R01 CA069300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA069300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC111759,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when the human beta interferon scaffold attachment region (IFN-SAR) was inserted into the vector immediately upstream of the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR), expression was maintained for the length of the study (4 months). Clonal analysis of the retrovirus vector-infected CEMSS cells showed that SAR-containing retroviral vector expression levels were positively correlated with the proviral copy numbers (P < 0.0001), while there was no correlation between the proviral copy numbers and expression levels in control vector-infected clones. Thirty-three percent of the CEMSS cell clones infected with the control vector showed evidence of partial or complete methylation in the 5' LTR region. In sharp contrast, we detected no methylation in the clones infected with the SAR-containing vector. To demonstrate a direct inhibitory effect of methylation on retroviral vector expression, we have transfected 293 cells with in vitro-methylated proviral DNA. In transiently transfected cells, expression of methylated LTR was reduced but not completely inhibited, irrespective of the presence of the IFN-SAR sequence. In stably transfected cells, however, methylation completely abolished expression of the control vector but not of the SAR-containing vector. Furthermore, the expression of the SAR-containing vector was stable over time, indicating the ability of the SAR sequence to alleviate methylation-mediated transcriptional repression of a vector. This study extends our understanding of the mechanisms of retroviral vector inactivation by methylation and provides insight into a functional role for the SAR elements.","['Dang, Q', 'Auten, J', 'Plavec, I']","['Dang Q', 'Auten J', 'Plavec I']","['SyStemix Inc., Palo Alto, California 94304, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",,2000/02/23 00:00,2000/02/23 00:01,['2000/02/23 00:00'],"['2000/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/23 00:01 [medline]', '2000/02/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Mar;74(6):2671-8. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.6.2671-2678.2000.,,['10.1128/jvi.74.6.2671-2678.2000 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC111756,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, several approaches attempting to correlate Tax activation of the CREB/activating transcription factor (ATF) or NFkappaB/Rel transcriptional activation pathway to cellular transformation have yielded conflicting results. In this study, we use a unique HTLV-2 provirus (HTLV(c-enh)) that replicates by a Tax-independent mechanism to directly assess the role of Tax transactivation in HTLV-mediated T-lymphocyte transformation. A panel of well-characterized tax-2 mutations is utilized to correlate the respective roles of the CREB/ATF or NFkappaB/Rel signaling pathway. Our results demonstrate that viruses expressing tax-2 mutations that selectively abrogate NFkappaB/Rel or CREB/ATF activation display distinct phenotypes but ultimately fail to transform primary human T lymphocytes. One conclusion consistent with our results is that the activation of NFkappaB/Rel provides a critical proliferative signal early in the cellular transformation process, whereas CREB/ATF activation is required to promote the fully transformed state.

In transplanted animals, tyrosines 579/581 proved critical for the development of myeloproliferative phenotype. F-mutants with these residues mutated showed no sign of myeloproliferation but instead developed T-cell lymphomas. In summary, TEL/PDGFbetaR is necessary and sufficient to induce a myeloproliferative disease in a murine BMT model, and PDGFbetaR residues Y579/581 are required for this phenotype.","['Tomasson, M H', 'Sternberg, D W', 'Williams, I R', 'Carroll, M', 'Cain, D', 'Aster, J C', 'Ilaria, R L Jr', 'Van Etten, R A', 'Gilliland, D G']","['Tomasson MH', 'Sternberg DW', 'Williams IR', 'Carroll M', 'Cain D', 'Aster JC', 'Ilaria RL Jr', 'Van Etten RA', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TEL-PDGFRbeta fusion protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/genetics/*metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syndrome', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'Virus Integration']",,2000/02/23 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/23 09:00'],"['2000/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2000 Feb;105(4):423-32. doi: 10.1172/JCI8902.,,['10.1172/JCI8902 [doi]'],,"['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08CA81197-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA66996-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01OK50654/PHS HHS/United States']",,['J Clin Invest. 2000 Feb;105(4):419-22.

Like all mammalian species they all harbor endogenous retroviruses in their genome. These porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are produced from several primary cells and cell lines and are able to infect human cells. Here we demonstrate that different pig strains and different animals of one strain differ in their ability to produce PERVs from normal blood cells. We report that purified PERV particles show a protein pattern typical for type C retroviruses and are antigenically related to mammalian leukemia viruses. Like most retroviruses, purified PERVs and peptides derived from the highly conserved immunosuppressive domain of their transmembrane envelope protein inhibit human immune cell functions. This indicates that high titer replication of PERVs in the transplant recipient could therefore lead to an immunodeficiency disease.","['Tacke, S J', 'Kurth, R', 'Denner, J']","['Tacke SJ', 'Kurth R', 'Denner J']","['Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse, 51-59, Langen, D-63225, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/chemistry/genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Risk Factors', 'Species Specificity', 'Swine/*virology', '*Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Virion/physiology']",,2000/02/23 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/02/23 09:00'],"['2000/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2000 Mar 1;268(1):87-93. doi: 10.1006/viro.1999.0149.,,"['10.1006/viro.1999.0149 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(99)90149-6 [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative determination by ELISA revealed a significant constitutive production of both chemokines in the cell lines HL-60 and NB-4 (>1000 pg/ml IL-8 and >400 pg/ml MCP-1 per million cells), while in the cell lines EOL-1, KASUMI-1 and KG-1 only 10-100 pg/ml IL-8 and MCP-1 were detected. Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) strongly increased the IL-8 and MCP-1 amounts in the culture supernatants of all five cell lines. The TPA-induced NB-4 produced the largest amounts of both chemokines (>40,000 pg/ml). The strongest induction was seen in EOL-1 (>100-fold increase). Besides TPA, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) also distinctively enhanced IL-8 and MCP-1 production. The calcium ionophore A-23187 and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, differentially induced IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion in the cell lines investigated, suggesting that, at least in some cell lines, intracellular free Ca(2+) might be important for chemokine secretion. Dexamethasone significantly prevented the IL-8 and MCP-1 production of stimulated cells, emphasizing the potent anti-inflammatory property of glucocorticoids. Similarly, the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine clearly decreased the TPA-induced chemokine secretion in NB-4 cells, indicating the involvement of protein kinases in the signal transduction pathway which leads to enhanced chemokine secretion.","['Steube, K G', 'Meyer, C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Steube KG', 'Meyer C', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. kst@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol Res Commun,Molecular cell biology research communications : MCBRC,100889076,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Carcinogens', 'Chemokine CCL2/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Chemokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,2000/02/23 09:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/02/23 09:00'],"['2000/02/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/02/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol Res Commun. 2000 Jan;3(1):60-5. doi: 10.1006/mcbr.2000.0190.,,"['10.1006/mcbr.2000.0190 [doi]', 'S1522472400901909 [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SR alpha, an association of SV40 early gene promoter and of the R region plus the first 39 nucleotides of the U5 region (designated as R) from the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) is currently used to stimulate expression of various coding regions. Its effect is considered to take place at the translational level. In all studies published so far, the R region was associated with the promoter and 5'UTR from SV40 early genes. In the present work, the role of SV40 5'UTR and HTLV-1R region was evaluated separately using different promoters, reporter genes and cells. Both SV40 5'UTR (SU) and R region (R) from HTLV-1 stimulated separately the expression of adjacent reporter genes. When associated, the SV40 5'UTR and the R region from HTLV-1 (SUR) were a more potent stimulator of gene expression and their effects were more than additive. This effect was very potent in HeLa and HC11 cells and almost inexistent in CHO and COS 7 cells. It was of various intensity in other cell types including bird and fish cells. The presence of SUR in gene constructs favoured the accumulation of the mRNAs. SUR stimulated gene expression when added between the cap and the initiation codon. Unexpectedly, SUR was never inhibitory. SUR can therefore be considered essentially as potent and specific stimulator of gene expression favoring mRNA accumulation.","['Attal, J', 'Theron, M C', 'Kann, G', 'Bolifraud, P', 'Puissant, C', 'Houdebine, L M']","['Attal J', 'Theron MC', 'Kann G', 'Bolifraud P', 'Puissant C', 'Houdebine LM']","['Unite de Differenciation Cellulaire, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Jouy-en-Josas, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Biotechnol,Journal of biotechnology,8411927,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'COS Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Transfection']",,2000/02/22 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/22 09:00'],"['2000/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biotechnol. 2000 Feb 17;77(2-3):179-89. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1656(99)00221-7.,,"['S0168-1656(99)00221-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1656(99)00221-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular pathophysiology of indolent lymphoma is characterized by distinct genetic pathways which selectively associate with different clinico-pathologic categories of the disease. At diagnosis, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia frequently display deletions of 13q14, trisomy 12 and alterations of the ATM gene, whereas evolution to Richter's syndrome is associated with disruption of p53. Lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma carries t(9;14) (p13;q32) in approximately 50% of cases, leading to the deregulated expression of the PAX-5 gene. Follicular lymphoma consistently harbors rearrangement of BCL-2. With time, a fraction of follicular lymphoma accumulates mutations of p53 and of p16 and evolves into a high grade lymphoma. MALT-lymphoma frequently associates with alterations of API2/MLT and, in some cases, of p53, BCL-6 and BCL-10. Studies of genotypic and phenotypic markers of histogenesis have shown that mantle cell lymphoma and a fraction of B-CLL/SLL derive from naive B-cells, whereas follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma and MALT-lymphoma originate from germinal center (GC) or post-GC B-cells. The identification of distinct genetic categories of indolent lymphoma may help in the therapeutic stratification of these disorders. In addition, genetic lesions of indolent lymphoma provide useful molecular markers for disease monitoring by high sensitivity techniques.","['Capello, D', 'Gaidano, G']","['Capello D', 'Gaidano G']","['Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Medical Sciences, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy. gaidano@med.unipmn.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma/etiology/genetics/pathology/physiopathology']",66,2000/02/22 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/02/22 09:00'],"['2000/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Feb;85(2):195-201.,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2000 Feb;85(2):113-4.

A questionnaire submitted to Italian pediatric oncologists and hematologists.,189-94,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Over the last 2-3 years in particular, the so-called Di Bella therapy (DBT) become the most famous of alternative treatments applied to pediatric oncology and hematology in Italy. Many Italian oncologists and hematologists had to cope with the problems that it introduced and the treatment also elicited heated reactions all over Europe. We attempted to evaluate the impact of this treatment on children with cancer. DESIGN AND METHODS: A questionnaire prepared with the aim of addressing the use of alternative therapies in pediatric hematology and oncology was circulated to the 48 centers (or divisions) belonging to AIEOP (Associazione Italiana di Oncoematologia Pediatrica) [Italian Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Association] and FONOP (Forza Operativa Nazionale di Oncologia Pediatrica) [National Pediatric Oncology Task Force]. The questionnaire consisted of 9 questions elaborated to give credit to the case-related and professional experiences of the colleagues we contacted. RESULTS: Forty-three centers replied to the questionnaire. Request to switch to DBT represented a considerable problem, involving the vast majority of centers participating into this study; however, case quantification varied greatly from center to center. One of the most significant aspects is that children switched to DBT, abandoning conventional therapies, were often relapsing or had had multiple relapses (from solid tumor or leukemia), but some children abandoned conventional therapies at an early stage and/or without fully exploiting the curative potential of these therapies. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study allowed us to obtain an evaluation of the impact of DBT in children with oncologic or hematologic disorders. It also highlights the importance of cultivating physician-parent dialogue and provides an opportunity for a few pedagogic thoughts on the attitude and opinions of pediatricians on this problem.","['Burgio, G R', 'Locatelli, F']","['Burgio GR', 'Locatelli F']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Pediatriche, Universita di Pavia, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, p.le Golgi 2, 27100 Pavia, Italy. f. locatelli@smatteo.pv.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Complementary Therapies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2000/02/22 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/02/22 09:00'],"['2000/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Feb;85(2):189-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To define the clinical outcome of bcr-abl positive patients after unmanipulated BMT better, we sought the origin of hematopoiesis and traced its evolution over time. DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients received allogeneic BMT for CML (39 in chronic phase and 10 in accelerated phase/blast crisis). Median follow-up was 61 months (range 4-92). mRNA and DNA were used to assess bcr-abl and chimerism status respectively. Quantitative VNTR-PCR on total cells and lymphoid or myeloid population allowed us to assign and measure the origin of hematopoiesis. RESULTS: Both bcr-abl positivity and the presence of mixed chimerism (MC) were significantly associated with relapse (p = 0.0009 and p < 0.0001 respectively). Relapse was observed in one of 39 patients with complete donor chimerism and in 6 of 9 patients with MC. These six cases showed increasing levels of host hemopoiesis and bcr-abl positivity in the CD15-positive population prior to relapse. The other three cases had decreasing or stable low-level MC which was restricted to the T-cells as well as bcr-abl negativity.

The International Prognostic Index (IPI), originally proposed for aggressive NHL, has been demonstrated to be of prognostic relevance also in follicular NHL. The main aim of the study was to validate the IPI in this histologic category; in addition, the specific prognostic classification, currently employed in the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio dei Linfomi (GISL) prospective therapeutic trials and based on different features, more similar to those applied to chronic lymphocytic leukemia, was analyzed. DESIGN AND METHODS: The present series consists of 137 evaluable patients affected by Working Formulation group A NHL out of 256 cases referred to the GISL Registry. The retrospective prognostic study included the evaluation by both univariate and multivariate analyses of overall survival, response to therapy and response duration. The IPI was applied as originally proposed. The GISL definition of indolent and aggressive disease at diagnosis was based on the presence of B symptoms, bulky disease, anemia and thrombocytopenia. RESULTS: The distribution of patients in IPI risk groups was rather unbalanced with 18%, 47%, 28% and 7% of cases classified as low (L), intermediate-low (IL), intermediate-high (IH) and high (H) risk, respectively. The median overall survival was not reached in either L or IL risk groups, and was 84.1 and 7.4 months for IH and H risk groups, respectively (p=0. 0005). A simplified IPI model was designed merging patients in both intermediate risk groups and the statistical difference of survival retained its significance. GISL prognostic stratification was demonstrated to have a significant association with survival, with a median survival of 71.3 months in aggressive disease and a median survival not reached at 152 months in indolent disease. Both the simplified IPI model and the GISL risk definition retained their significance in multivariate analysis for overall survival, while for response to therapy only the simplified IPI model resulted to be of statistical significance. In addition, the GISL prognostic stratification identified patients with different outcomes within the IPI intermediate risk group, with a median survival of 70.2 months for patients with aggressive disease wheras the median survival for those with indolent disease was not reached. Finally, a prognostic score resulting from the integration of the simplified IPI and the GISL system was statistically validated. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The retrospective analysis of this series demonstrates the validity of the IPI in non-follicular indolent NHL and the usefulness of integrating the IPI parameters with disease specific prognostic variables.","['Stelitano, C', 'Baldini, L', 'Pieresca, C', 'Callea, V', 'Angrilli, F', 'Clo, V', 'Partesotti, G', 'Merli, F', 'Cavanna, L', 'Morabito, F', 'Federico, M', 'Brugiatelli, M', 'Silingardi, V']","['Stelitano C', 'Baldini L', 'Pieresca C', 'Callea V', 'Angrilli F', 'Clo V', 'Partesotti G', 'Merli F', 'Cavanna L', 'Morabito F', 'Federico M', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Silingardi V']","['Dipartimento di Emato-Oncologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli, 89100 Reggio Calabria, Italy. morctmo@tin. it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",,2000/02/22 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/02/22 09:00'],"['2000/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Feb;85(2):154-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of CML with interferon-a (IFN-a) re-establishes normal hemopoiesis in some patients in part by restoring normal adhesive interactions between CML progenitors and BM microenvironment, which may in turn be mediated by correcting CAM expression on progenitors. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the expression of CAMs (L-selectin, b((2))-integrin, LFA-3, ICAM-1, ICAM-3, NCAM) on purified BM CD34(+) cells from CML patients (n= 34) and healthy adults (n= 15) by flow cytometry. Modulation of L-selectin expression on CD34(+) cells from CML after in vitro treatment with IFN-a was also investigated. RESULTS: The mean percentage of CD34(+ )cells expressing L-selectin was significantly lower in CML patients (25.4+/-12.8%) than in normal controls (68.7+/-8.3%, n=15). CD34(+)/HLA-DR(&endash;/low) and CD34(+)/ CD38(&endash;/low) co-expressing L-selectin were also significantly lower in untreated CML (27.4+/-21.5% and 39.8+/-26.7%, respectively, n=8) than in controls (61+/-17% and 83.7+/-10%, respectively, n=7). In vitro treatment with IFN-a of purified CD34(+) BM cells from untreated CML patients (n=8) induced a significant, dose and time-dependent increase in the L-selectin expression as indicated by FACS analysis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that this L-selectin deficiency reflects a cell surface adhesion defect of progenitors from CML that is partially restored by in vitro IFN-a treatment. These data may help to explain the adhesive abnormalities of CML progenitors to the BM microenvironment and the in vitro restoration of adhesion capacity after IFN-a treatment.","['Martin-Henao, G A', 'Quiroga, R', 'Sureda, A', 'Gonzalez, J R', 'Moreno, V', 'Garcia, J']","['Martin-Henao GA', 'Quiroga R', 'Sureda A', 'Gonzalez JR', 'Moreno V', 'Garcia J']","[""Department of Cryobiology and Cell Therapy, Cancer Research Institute, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Av.

Thereby, cellular drug accumulation and efflux are determined as mean values of the entire cell population. The objective of the present study was to characterize the heterogeneity in the accumulation and efflux of daunorubicin in various subpopulations of mononuclear cells isolated from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: Mononuclear cells from 33 patients with AML were isolated from peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation on Lymphoprep (1. 077 g/mL). Cellular accumulation of fluorescent daunorubicin was determined by flow cytometry after incubation of the cells at +37C for 1 hour. Thereafter, the cells were washed and reincubated in drug-free medium. Kinetics of drug efflux were determined by frequent determination of cellular fluorescence during 30 min. Daunorubicin accumulation and efflux were compared in the total isolated mononuclear cell population and in the various blast cell populations gated on FSC/SSC according to the results of immunophenotyping. RESULTS: In 8 of these 33 (24%) patient samples, two distinct blast cell populations could be identified. In 7 out of 8 these cases the more immature blasts had a lower drug accumulation and in 6 out of the 8 cases also a higher efflux rate than the differentiating cell population. Cyclosporin A increased daunorubicin accumulation and reduced efflux in the immature blast population. In the differentiating cell population cyclosporin A increased both the accumulation and the efflux. In patients with a single blast cell population, the gated blast cells had a significantly lower drug accumulation but also a lower drug efflux rate than the total cell population. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that drug transport studies on cells isolated from patients with AML give somewhat different results depending on the cell population studied. Some, but not all, of these differences in daunorubicin accumulation and efflux as well as in the effect of cyclo-sporin A can be explained by a heterogenous expression of the mdr1-gene. The observed heterogeneity may be of special relevance with regard to drug resistance. The presence of even a small resistant cell clone may jeopardize the effect of the chemotherapy due to expansion resulting in relapse of disease.","['Knaust, E', 'Porwit-MacDonald, A', 'Gruber, A', 'Xu, D', 'Peterson, C']","['Knaust E', 'Porwit-MacDonald A', 'Gruber A', 'Xu D', 'Peterson C']","['Department of Medicine and Care, Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, SE-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden. eva.knaust@imv.liu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2000/02/22 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/02/22 09:00'],"['2000/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Feb;85(2):124-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As no complete PPARgamma antagonists have been described hitherto, we have constructed a dominant-negative mutant receptor to inhibit wild-type PPARgamma action. Highly conserved hydrophobic and charged residues (Leu(468) and Glu(471)) in helix 12 of the ligand-binding domain were mutated to alanine. This compound PPARgamma mutant retains ligand and DNA binding, but exhibits markedly reduced transactivation due to impaired coactivator (cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein and steroid receptor coactivator-1) recruitment. Unexpectedly, the mutant receptor silences basal gene transcription, recruits corepressors (the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors and the nuclear corepressor) more avidly than wild-type PPARgamma, and exhibits delayed ligand-dependent corepressor release. It is a powerful dominant-negative inhibitor of cotransfected wild-type receptor action. Furthermore, when expressed in primary human preadipocytes using a recombinant adenovirus, this PPARgamma mutant blocks thiazolidinedione-induced differentiation, providing direct evidence that PPARgamma mediates adipogenesis. Our observations suggest that, as in other mutant nuclear receptor contexts (acute promyelocytic leukemia, resistance to thyroid hormone), dominant-negative inhibition by PPARgamma is linked to aberrant corepressor interaction. Adenoviral expression of this mutant receptor is a valuable means to antagonize PPARgamma signaling.","['Gurnell, M', 'Wentworth, J M', 'Agostini, M', 'Adams, M', 'Collingwood, T N', 'Provenzano, C', 'Browne, P O', 'Rajanayagam, O', 'Burris, T P', 'Schwabe, J W', 'Lazar, M A', 'Chatterjee, V K']","['Gurnell M', 'Wentworth JM', 'Agostini M', 'Adams M', 'Collingwood TN', 'Provenzano C', 'Browne PO', 'Rajanayagam O', 'Burris TP', 'Schwabe JW', 'Lazar MA', 'Chatterjee VK']","[""Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '05V02F2KDG (Rosiglitazone)', 'AA68LXK93C (2,4-thiazolidinedione)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/metabolism', 'Adipocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Plasmids', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', '*Thiazolidinediones', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",,2000/02/22 09:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['2000/02/22 09:00'],"['2000/02/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Feb 25;275(8):5754-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.8.5754.,,"['10.1074/jbc.275.8.5754 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)30608-2 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cloning of the epitope recognized by an OSM-neutralizing anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody identified a portion of gp130 receptor localized in the EF loop of the cytokine binding domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding region was carried out by alanine substitution of residues 186-198. To generate type 1 or type 2 OSM receptors, gp130 mutants were expressed together with either LIF receptor beta or OSM receptor beta. When positions Val-189/Tyr-190 and Phe-191/Val-192 were alanine-substituted, Scatchard analyses indicated a complete abrogation of OSM binding to both type receptors. Interestingly, binding of LIF to type 1 receptor was not affected, corroborating the notion that in this case gp130 mostly behaves as a converter protein rather than a binding receptor.

Using murine retroviruses, the best able to drive gene expression in T cells was the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter enhancer element; however, transduction efficiency was low. To achieve efficient, high-level gene expression we tested lentiviral gene delivery vectors. At a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (0.5-2) a large fraction of target cells was transduced by lentiviral vectors (40-93%), and the strength of gene expression was high, as determined by flow cytometric analysis. We monitored the expression of eGFP or human CD40L on T cell lines and untransformed primary human T cells from normal and CD40L-deficient patients. We achieved efficient gene expression without an extended exposure to virus, and without the need for selection. These results are encouraging for efficient lentivirus-mediated transduction of refractory human cells to achieve therapeutic gene delivery.","['Barry, S C', 'Seppen, J', 'Ramesh, N', 'Foster, J L', 'Seyama, K', 'Ochs, H D', 'Garcia, J V', 'Osborne, W R']","['Barry SC', 'Seppen J', 'Ramesh N', 'Foster JL', 'Seyama K', 'Ochs HD', 'Garcia JV', 'Osborne WR']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",,2000/02/19 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/19 09:00'],"['2000/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2000 Jan 20;11(2):323-32. doi: 10.1089/10430340050016058.,,['10.1089/10430340050016058 [doi]'],,"['AI39146/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI40102/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK43727/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to investigate the expression of complement regulatory proteins on leukemic blasts which may be susceptible to the lytic effects of the complement system in the circulation. The surface expressions of complement regulatory proteins, complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35), decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55), and homologous restriction factor 20 (HRF20, CD59), on peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts were evaluated by using flow cytometry in 16 acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), 16 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 4 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 3 chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) patients and control granulocytes and lymphocytes obtained from 15 healthy volunteers. mRNA expression was investigated by Northern blot analysis. mRNA abundances were calculated after normalization according to 28s rRNA. Surface expressions of CRI and DAF were marginally (p = 0.08 and p = 0.08, respectively) lower in AML, and DAF expression was significantly lower (p=0.0008) in ALL patients in comparison to their normal counterparts. Except from a slight increase that is detected for CD59 in CML patients (p=0.06), there was no significant difference between the surface expressions of CD59 in any of the groups studied. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographs obtained from Northern blots revealed that in AML patients, CR1 mRNA expression were 5.5-fold lower than controls (p=0.06), while DAF mRNA expression was significantly higher (p=0.0046). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of CRI in ALL patients was found significantly lower than in the control group (p = 0.0419). None of the values obtained from the other groups were significantly different from each other. These results suggest that leukemic blasts are protected from the lytic attack of the complement system at all levels, since all of the complement membrane regulatory proteins were expressed in all leukemia types (although at lower amounts in some cases), and it is also possible to use CRI and DAF as differentiation markers in acute leukemias.","['Guc, D', 'Canpinar, H', 'Kucukaksu, C', 'Kansu, E']","['Guc D', 'Canpinar H', 'Kucukaksu C', 'Kansu E']","['Basic Oncology Department, Oncology Institute, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD46 protein, human)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Cofactor Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood/*genetics', 'Blast Crisis/blood/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'CD55 Antigens/blood/*genetics', 'CD59 Antigens/blood/*genetics', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Membrane Cofactor Protein', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Complement 3b/blood/*genetics', 'Reference Values', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,2000/02/19 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/19 09:00'],"['2000/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2000 Jan;64(1):3-9. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.80097.x.,,['10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.80097.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concentrations of benzene from motor vehicle exhaust could be elevated along highly trafficked streets. Several studies have reported significant associations between proximity to highly trafficked streets and the occurrence of childhood cancers and childhood leukemia. These associations may be due to chronic exposure to benzene or other carcinogenic components of vehicle exhaust from these nearby streets or to some other factor (e.g., noise, increased light exposure, or some unaccounted--for socioeconomic variable). We used data for homes studied in an earlier childhood cancer study conducted in Denver, CO, in the 1980s. No air pollution measurements were made in the original study.

Traffic density was weighted for the distance from the street to the home using 3 different widths of Gaussian curves to approximate the decay of the emissions into the surrounding neighborhoods. The associations between the 750-ft-wide distance-weighted traffic density metrics and all childhood cancers and childhood leukemia are strongest in the highest traffic density category (> or = 20,000 vehicles per day [VPD]). The odds ratio is 5.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.69-20.56) for all cancers and 8.28 (95% CI 2.09-32.80) for leukemia. The results are suggestive of an association between proximal high traffic streets with traffic counts > or = 20,000 VPD and childhood cancer, including leukemia.","['Pearson, R L', 'Wachtel, H', 'Ebi, K L']","['Pearson RL', 'Wachtel H', 'Ebi KL']","['Radian International LLC, Denver, Colorado, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Air Waste Manag Assoc,Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995),9503111,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Vehicle Emissions)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'United States', '*Vehicle Emissions']",,2000/02/19 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/19 09:00'],"['2000/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Air Waste Manag Assoc. 2000 Feb;50(2):175-80. doi: 10.1080/10473289.2000.10463998.,,['10.1080/10473289.2000.10463998 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical significance of the residual BCR-ABL-positive clones after BMT is still controversial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The BCR-ABL gene (p210 and p190) was prospectively studied by nested RT-PCR in 8 ALL-Ph' positive patients undergoing BMT. RESULTS: All patients received BMT at the time of clinical remission (CR). However, minimal residual disease (MRD) was detected in 7 of them. MRD detected just before BMT seems to be eradicated by BMT protocol. Four patients remained in CR and did not show BCR-ABL transcripts. Other 4 patients, relapsed, demonstrating MRD, which preceded recurrence by a median time of 6 weeks. Three relapsed patients showed p190 transcript and only one, p210 type. CONCLUSIONS: The RT-PCR assay appears to be a useful test for predicting at high risk of relapse after BMT and may identify patients who might benefit from therapeutic interventions. The finding that the expression of p190 BCR-ABL may carry an especially high risk of relapse suggests a different clinical and biologic behaviour between p190 and p210 BCR-ABL.","['Roman, J', 'Castillejo, J A', 'Jimenez, A', 'Maldonado, J', 'Torres, A']","['Roman J', 'Castillejo JA', 'Jimenez A', 'Maldonado J', 'Torres A']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Reina Sofia, Cordoba. peperosa@teleline.es']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/02/19 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/19 09:00'],"['2000/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1999 Dec 11;113(20):779-82.,Monitorizacion del ARNm BCR-ABL mediante retrotranscripcion PCR en pacientes sometidos a trasplante alogenico de medula osea por leucemia aguda linfoblastica con cromosoma Filadelfia positivo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical interactions.,251-67,"Effective treatment of the elderly patient with AML remains a challenging task. Acute myelogenous leukemia is clearly a different disease in the elderly than in the young, for many reasons, both clinical and biologic, which contribute to the worse prognosis in the elderly. The elderly, as a group, have been underrepresented in clinical trials. Several important prognostic variables have been identified and described, however, that can help the physician select the appropriate treatment for any individual patient. Age itself should not preclude an attempt at therapy, especially for AML, which progresses very rapidly in the absence of treatment. After careful analysis of prognostic factors, in any individual patient, however, the outlook may be so poor that it may be desirable to withhold treatment. With a better understanding of the pathophysiology of AML in the elderly, more targeted and less toxic treatment regimens will become available. At present, however, clinicians must use an improved understanding of the disease to predict its behavior in an individual patient, so that the currently available treatment modalities are used most prudently.","['Lancet, J E', 'Willman, C L', 'Bennett, J M']","['Lancet JE', 'Willman CL', 'Bennett JM']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Rochester Medical Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aging', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/etiology/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",65,2000/02/19 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/19 09:00'],"['2000/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2000 Feb;14(1):251-67. doi: 10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70287-2.,,"['S0889-8588(05)70287-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70287-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work we present an alternative molecular method for the detection of TPMT alleles. It is an adaptation for horizontal conditions of a conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis technique. The method has proven to be very efficient as a rapid screening approach for the study of TPMT genetic variability. The method was applied to analyse eight TPMT exons and the corresponding flanking intronic regions in a sample of unrelated healthy individuals from North Portugal. Here we report the allelic frequencies concerning TPMT-deficient alleles and several silent and intronic mutations, including two newly detected intronic polymorphisms: an A (-101) T substitution in intron 3 and a variation involving the number of T nucleotides in a DNA stretch in intron 5. Additionally, we also present data from a sample of 43 children undergoing therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this clinical sample we have registered a statistically significant higher frequency for the TPMT*3C allele.

It becomes excluded from ventroanterior structures at late gastrula stages and is detected within the forming central nervous system during segmentation stages. pbx4 expression overlaps with that of two other homeobox genes, hoxb1b and meis3, in the region of the presumptive caudal hindbrain during gastrula stages. In vitro binding experiments revealed that protein complexes containing Pbx4/Meis3 and Pbx4/Hoxb1b, but not Meis3/Hoxb1b could be generated. A novel trimeric complex containing Pbx4, Meis3, and Hoxb1b was also formed.

We analyzed 39 t(11;14)-positive MCLs by either comparative genomic hybridization (CGH; n = 8), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a set of DNA probes detecting the most frequent aberrations in B-cell neoplasms (n = 12), or both techniques (n = 19). The t(11;14) was present in all cases. In 37 of 39 cases, chromosomal imbalances were found. In 27 cases, complex karyotypes, i.e., >/= 3 aberrations, were identified. The most frequent aberrations were losses of 13q14-21 or 13q32-34 (27 cases), 9p21 (16 cases), and 11q22-23 (12 cases) and gains of 3q26-29 (19 cases), 8q22-24 (11 cases), and 18q21-22 (9 cases). In 26% of cases (7 of 27) analyzed by CGH, a total of 10 high-level DNA amplifications were identified. Although in comparison with B-cell chronic lymphopcytic leukemia (B-CLL) MCL is characterized by a much higher complexity of chromosomal aberrations, there are striking similarities: 13q14 deletions were identified in more than 50% of both MCL and B-CLL cases. In contrast, in our CGH database containing 293 B-cell lymphomas, this aberration was found in only 11% of other nodal lymphomas. Even more strikingly, 11q deletions, which are present in 20%-30 % of MCL and B-CLL, were found very rarely in other nodal B-cell lymphomas (CGH: 1 of 208 cases; FISH: 1 of 69 cases).

We have examined the additional cytogenetic changes found in Ph+ve cells after BMT in 47 CML patients. Forty patients showed clonal changes. The involvement of each chromosome was compared statistically with expected values assuming that further chromosome changes are random and related to chromosome size. In clones that comprised 50% or more of the Ph+ve metaphases, chromosome 13 was involved in 12 of 22 clones (55%); this was highly significant when compared with the theoretical expected value of 3.2 (14.5%) (P < 0.001).

A common region of deletion was identified at 13q12-14, suggesting the presence of one or more tumor suppressor genes.

As yet no molecular genetic analyses of the t(1;3) have been reported. In four patients with t(1;3), all of whom had AML-M4, which evolved from MDS, the breakpoints at 3q21 clustered within a 60-kb region centromeric to the breakpoint of the inv(3)(q21q26), whereas the breakpoints at 1p36 clustered within a 90-kb region at 1p36.3. The presence of novel clusters in both the 3q21 and 1p36 breakpoints (BCRs) suggests a common, underlying molecular mechanism for the development of t(1;3)-positive MDS/AML. The Ribophorin I (RPN1) gene close to the BCR at 3q21 was highly expressed without gross structural changes, whereas the GR6 gene located within the BCR at 3q21 was not expressed. No other highly expressed genes were isolated in a 150-kb region at 3q21.

Assessing HRQL in childhood cancer survivors, in particular, is a new field of research. Studies of survivors of leukemia and brain tumors are of special interest since these are the commonest groups of survivors of cancer in childhood. Initial reports suggest that most of the survivors of childhood cancer are in good health with a normal psychosocial status, social life and capacity to cope with activities of daily living. More discriminative evaluations identify a number of subtle problems, such as cognitive deficits in brain tumor survivors or anxiety about a recurrence (especially) in children who have had megatherapy and autologous bone marrow rescue. In this group, pain is also a lasting problem in about one-third of patients. The main problem in these studies is comparability as the study designs vary widely. Little information is available with respect to inter-observer agreement, which is important since it is known that proxy respondents will under- or over-estimate components of the HRQL of the child. The most important base for further development of HRQL research is communication between researchers, in order to exchange experience and to avoid duplication of effort. Communication is necessary also for combining interests and forces in developing a standardized methodology as well as for conducting collaborative studies using equivalent measures.","['Calaminus, G', 'Kiebert, G']","['Calaminus G', 'Kiebert G']","['EORTC Data Center, QoL Unit, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer Suppl,International journal of cancer.

The mean global utility score was 0.85 (on a 0 = dead to 1. 0 = perfect health scale), a figure less than that in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but comparable to that in survivors of brain tumors (0.84) or extremely low birthweight (ELBW 0.82).

The objective of this ground-based study was to evaluate stress gene regulation in cells exposed to altered gravity and environmentally suboptimal conditions. We designed primers to detect message for both the constitutive and inducible forms of the heat shock protein, HSP-70. Applying the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we probed for HSP-70 message in human acute T-cell leukemia cells, Jurkat, subjected to three types of environmental stressors: (1) altered gravity achieved by centrifugation (hypergravity) and randomization of the gravity vector in rotating bioreactors, (2) serum starvation by culture in medium containing 0.05% serum, and (3) temperature elevation (42 degrees C). Temperature elevation, as the positive control, significantly increased HSP-70 message, while centrifugation and culture in rotating bioreactors did not upregulate heat shock gene expression. We found a fourfold increase in heat shock message in serum-starved cells. Message for the housekeeping genes, actin and cyclophilin, were constant and comparable to unstressed controls for all treatments. We conclude that gravitational perturbations incurred by centrifugal forces, exceeding those characteristic of a Space Shuttle launch (3g), and culture in rotating bioreactors do not upregulate HSP-70 gene expression.

In order to identify novel targets for VD, that may be involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, a differential display PCR (ddPCR) approach was applied to the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, which provided the gene for cyclin C as an interesting candidate. Quantitative assessment of cyclin C expression showed that the gene was significantly upregulated by VD and its analogues, EB1089 and CB1093 both on the level of mRNA expression and more so on the level of protein expression in MCF-7 cells. Upregulation of cyclin C protein expression could also be confirmed in MeWo human melanoma and in U937 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. This observation adds a new gene candidate to the list of primary VD responding genes.

Spatial modifications in the representation and/or organization of regulatory factors may be functionally linked to perturbations of gene expression in acute leukemic cells. Using in situ immunofluorescence microscopy, we addressed the interrelationships of modifications in nuclear morphology with the intranuclear distribution of leukemia-related regulatory factors (including ALL-1, PML, and AF-9) in cells from patients with acute leukemia. We compared the localization of leukemia-associated proteins with various factors involved in gene transcription and RNA processing (e.g., RNA polymerase II and SC-35).

Oligodendroglial progenitors, identified by their bipolar morphology and expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRalpha), emerged from spheres as early as 1 DIV; O4+ cells with bipolar to multipolar processes were observed at 3 DIV whereas O1+ multiprocess-bearing oligodendroglia did not appear until 5-7 DIV. They further differentiated to myelin basic protein-expressing oligodendrocytes after 2-3 weeks in culture. Thus, human oligodendroglial maturation in vitro follows the same pathway as rat cells but takes twice as long as their rodent counterparts. Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation indicated that PDGFRalpha-expressing cells but not O4+ oligodendroglia proliferated. More oligodendroglial progenitors incorporated BrdU and more O4+ cells survived when they were in contact with neurons and astrocytes than when they developed beyond the astrocyte layer.

The lack of response to LIF-induced astrocytic differentiation is maintained in cocultures with LIF responsive cells derived from E15 cortex.

Flow cytometric detection techniques targeting these changes, reduction of DiOC(6)(3) uptake upon the collapse of MTP and annexin V binding to PS have been successfully used to detect apoptotic cells. These methods have given comparable results when cell lines were used. We compared the two different techniques, DiOC(6)(3) uptake and Annexin V-propidium iodide co-labeling in the quantification of cytarabine, vincristine and daunorubicin induced apoptosis on three leukemia cell lines (HL-60, CEM, U937), and bone marrow blasts from 26 children with acute myeloid leukemia, 14 with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in culture-grown peripheral blood T lymphocytes on 18 samples from 9 children with non-malignant conditions were also studied by these techniques. Our results showed that there is a correlation (P < 0. 05) between the apoptosis rates measured by these two techniques for drug-induced apoptosis in myeloid and lymphoid blasts, and for anti-Fas mAb-induced apoptosis in T lymphocytes. This data suggests that reduction of the MTP and PS externalization may be common to many apoptotic pathways and techniques targeting either of these changes may be used in quantification of apoptosis in different clinical samples.","['Ozgen, U', 'Savasan, S', 'Buck, S', 'Ravindranath, Y']","['Ozgen U', 'Savasan S', 'Buck S', 'Ravindranath Y']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', ""54501-79-0 (3,3'-dihexyl-2,2'-oxacarbocyanine)"", '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Annexin A5', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Carbocyanines', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Propidium', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,2000/02/19 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/02/19 09:00'],"['2000/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 Feb 15;42(1):74-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000215)42:1<74::aid-cyto11>3.0.co;2-6.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(20000215)42:1<74::AID-CYTO11>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000215)42:1<74::aid-cyto11>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Commonly-used DNA analysis methods cannot study both parameters simultaneously. A new approach described here combines a green fluorescent membrane-intercalating dye (PKH67) with Hoechst 33342 or annexin V and propidium iodide, to allow simultaneous assessment of cell division, cell cycle status, apoptosis, and necrosis, respectively. METHODS: To test this approach, we used cultured K562 leukemic cell lines which are drug-sensitive (K562S) or drug-resistant (K562R) by virtue of whether they lack or exhibit expression, respectively, of the gp-170 (PGP) glycoprotein pump involved in multidrug resistance. RESULTS: We found that: 1) PKH67 fluorescence intensity decreases proportionately to number of cell divisions, 2) labeling with PKH67 does not alter either cell cycle distribution, as assessed by vital DNA staining with Hoechst 33342, or cell growth, and 3) using a simple threshold analysis method suitable for real-time sorting decisions, subpopulations of proliferating cells present at initial levels of >/= 10% can readily be detected after two cell division times, based on decreased PKH67 intensity. Finally, we demonstrated that after treatment of an admixture of K562S and K562R with vincristine, triple-labeling with PKH67, annexin V, and propidium iodide can be used to identify and sort those cells which remain not only viable (nonnecrotic, nonapoptotic) but actively dividing (decreased PKH67 intensity) in the presence of drug. CONCLUSIONS: Although the studies described here were carried out in a model system using cells having known drug resistance phenotypes, we expect that the methods described will be useful in ex vivo studies of clinical leukemic specimens designed to identify the role played by specific chemoresistance proteins and mechanisms in therapeutic outcomes for individual patients.","['Boutonnat, J', 'Barbier, M', 'Muirhead, K', 'Mousseau, M', 'Grunwald, D', 'Ronot, X', 'Seigneurin, D']","['Boutonnat J', 'Barbier M', 'Muirhead K', 'Mousseau M', 'Grunwald D', 'Ronot X', 'Seigneurin D']","['Equipe M.C.I.T., Institut Albert Bonniot, La Tronche, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6T84R30KC1 (Tranexamic Acid)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Annexin A5', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Necrosis', 'Propidium', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/pathology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,2000/02/19 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/02/19 09:00'],"['2000/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 Feb 15;42(1):50-60.,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(20000215)42:1<50::AID-CYTO8>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]'],"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, FCM was used to compare the localization and the kinetic patterns of cyclin B1 expression in Jurkat leukemia cell line and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated normal T lymphocytes. METHODS: Cell synchronization was performed in G(1) with sodium n-butyrate, at the G(1)/S transition with thymidine and at mitosis with colchicine. Cells (leukemic cell line Jurkat or PHA-stimulated human T-lymphocytes) were stained for DNA and cyclin B1 and analyzed by FCM. Western blotting was used to confirm certain results. RESULTS: Under asynchronous growing conditions and for both cell populations, cyclin B1 expression was essentially restricted to the G(2)/M transition, reaching its maximal level at mitosis. When the cells were synchronized at the G(1)/S boundary by thymidine or inside the G(1) phase by sodium n-butyrate, Jurkat cells accumulated cyclin B1 in both situations, whereas T lymphocytes expressed cyclin B1 only during the thymidine block. The cyclin B1 fluorescence kinetics of PHA-stimulated T lymphocytes was strictly similar when considering T lymphocytes blocked at the G(1)/S phase transition by thymidine and in exponentially growing conditions. These FCM results were confirmed by Western blotting. The detection of cyclin B1 by Western blot in cells sorted in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle showed that cyclin B1 was present in the G(1) phase in leukemic T cells but not in normal T lymphocytes. Cyclin B1 degradation was effective at mitosis, thus ruling out a defective cyclin B1 proteolysis. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the leukemic T cells behaved quite differently from the untransformed T lymphocytes. Our data support the notion that human cyclin B1 is present in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle in leukemic T cells but not in normal T lymphocytes. Therefore, the restriction point from which cyclin B1 can be detected is different in the two models studied. We hypothesize that after passage through a restriction point differing in T lymphocytes and in leukemic cells, the rate of cyclin B1 synthesis becomes constant in the S and G(2)/M phases and independent from the DNA replication cycle.","['Viallard, J F', 'Lacombe, F', 'Dupouy, M', 'Ferry, H', 'Belloc, F', 'Reiffers, J']","['Viallard JF', 'Lacombe F', 'Dupouy M', 'Ferry H', 'Belloc F', 'Reiffers J']","['Laboratoire de Greffe de Moelle, UMR-CNRS 5540, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Cyclin B/*metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA Replication', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mitosis', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'S Phase', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Thymidine/pharmacology']",,2000/02/19 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/19 09:00'],"['2000/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 Feb 1;39(2):117-25.,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(20000201)39:2<117::AID-CYTO4>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]'],"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on limited data suggesting a possible dose-response effect, a trial was initiated to compare standard versus moderately high dose MA in HRPC. METHODS: One hundred forty-nine men with hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma were randomized to receive oral MA either at 160 mg/day (low dose) or 640 mg/day (high dose). Patients were stratified by performance status and measurable versus evaluable disease. The primary end point was tumor response. Secondary end points were survival, quality-of-life measures, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) decline. RESULTS: The median survival times of 11.2 months for patients who received the low dose and 12.1 months for patients who received the high dose therapy were not significantly different. Best response was equivalent in the 2 arms: 2 partial responses and 22 patients with stable disease for the 160 mg/day dose, and 1 partial response and 28 patients with stable disease for the 640 mg/day dose. A greater than 50% decline in PSA occurred in 13.8% and 8.8% of patients in the low and high dose treatment arms, respectively. There were no differences in the toxicity or quality-of-life outcomes between the two arms. Poorer performance status (2 vs. 0-1), greater than 5% weight loss, higher baseline PSA, and measurable disease all predicted shorter survival.

By screening with c-kit as bait, we cloned a novel cDNA, designed STAP-1, encoding an adaptor protein with a Pleckstrin homology domain, the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a number of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR analysis revealed that STAP-1 expression is restricted in the bone marrow cell fraction expressing c-kit. The highest expression was observed in the CD34(low/-)Sca-1(+)c-kit(+)Lin(-) stem cell-enriched fraction. The murine myeloid cell line, M1, expressed a high level of STAP-1. However, the expression was strongly repressed in response to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which induced monocytic differentiation of M1 cells, suggesting that STAP-1 is associated with the undifferentiated cell type. A two-hybrid assay indicated that STAP-1 bound not only to c-kit but also to c-fms but not to JAK2 or Pyk2. In 293 cells, STAP-1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by activated c-kit. An in vitro binding assay suggested that the STAP-1 SH2 domain interacted with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins including c-kit and STAT5.

To this end, we have previously used an intracellular anti-c-Myb single-chain antibody (sFv) to achieve the functional knockout of the c-Myb oncoprotein. In this study, we have employed a tetracycline-inducible system to control the expression of the sFv. A nuclear-localizing form of an anti-c-Myb sFv was cloned into a tet-regulated plasmid vector. Using a transient expression system in COS-1 cells, we observed that doxycycline (Dox) induced expression of the sFv in a dose-dependent manner, and that the sFv was localized mainly in the nucleus. The Dox-induced anti-c-Myb sFv also inhibited the transactivating activity of c-Myb in a dose-dependent manner. We subsequently confirmed the Dox-induced expression of the sFv in the leukemia cell line K562. Proliferation of the target leukemia cells was also inhibited.

It is well known that tumor cells that express B7 molecules can elicit antitumor immunity, but little is known regarding which B7 molecule, B7-1 (CD80) or B7-2 (CD86), can do so more efficiently. To address this issue, we have introduced B7-1 or B7-2 into 8709 cells, a radiation-induced mouse myelocytic leukemic cell line, and have compared their potentials regarding the induction of antitumor immunity. Either B7-1- or B7-2-transduced monoclonal sublines, 8709/B7-1 or 8709/B7-2, respectively, diminished tumorigenicity in syngeneic C3H mice. Some reports have indicated that B7-1 is superior to B7-2 in the induction of antitumor immunity. Contrary to these results, the 8709/B7-2 lines are superior to the 8709/B7-1 lines in their capacity to induce antitumor immunity. In vivo depletion of lymphocyte subsets demonstrated that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were indispensable for B7-1- or B7-2-dependent antitumor immunity, whereas natural killer cells were not.

The latter indication derived from numerous experimental reports of p53-mediated suppressing effects on human and murine leukemia cells in vitro. However, few in vivo experiments have been performed, and those that have used a subcutaneous injection of p53-transduced leukemia cells. Thus, we developed an orthotopic leukemia model in adult, syngenic mice to evaluate the feasibility of TP53-mediated therapeutic approaches. We found that among other cells, v-src-transformed 32D myeloid progenitors induce leukemia when injected intravenously in syngenic mice. The resulting malignancy resembles the clinical manifestations of human acute myeloid leukemia because it is characterized by a massive invasion of bone marrow compartments, splenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and a macroscopic or microscopic infiltration of the kidneys, liver, and lungs. When these 32Dv-src cells were infected with a TP53-recombinant retrovirus before intravenous injection, we found a decreased mortality and, in those animals that develop leukemia, a drastic reduction of the generalized organ infiltration, suggesting that exogenous TP53 expression might be used for ex vivo bone marrow purging from leukemia cells.","['Bossi, G', 'Scardigli, R', 'Musiani, P', 'Martinelli, R', 'Gentileschi, M P', 'Soddu, S', 'Sacchi, A']","['Bossi G', 'Scardigli R', 'Musiani P', 'Martinelli R', 'Gentileschi MP', 'Soddu S', 'Sacchi A']","['Molecular Oncogenesis Laboratory, Regina Elena Cancer Institute--Centro Richerche Sperimentali, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Feasibility Studies', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism/therapeutic use']",,2000/03/04 00:00,2000/03/04 00:01,['2000/03/04 00:00'],"['2000/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2000 Jan;7(1):135-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700101.,,['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700101 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Susceptible murine cells exposed to virus-containing supernatants from ecotropic retroviral helper cells occasionally fused to neighboring cells, resulting in syncytia (giant cells with multiple nuclei). Polycationic molecules dramatically enhanced the effect, leading to widespread cell death. The degree of cell fusion was dependent upon the retroviral envelope subtype (ecotropic-->amphotropic, gibbon ape leukemia virus was negative) as well as on the polycationic reagent used (G9 dendrimer-->Lipofectamine-->polybrene). Cell fusion effects were not mediated by the retroviral vector backbone, because virus-containing supernatants from helper cells (without vector) and vector producer cells had a similar effect. Human target cells were not fused by any type of murine retrovirus; in addition, amphotropic virus from human helper cells was not fusogenic toward murine cells. Thus, fusogenic effects were important during the propagation of vectors using murine helper cells but were not a significant factor during the transduction of human cells.","['Xu, G', 'Solaiman, F', 'Zink, M A', 'Hodgson, C P']","['Xu G', 'Solaiman F', 'Zink MA', 'Hodgson CP']","['Creighton Cancer Center/Department of Biomedical Sciences, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, Nebraska 68178, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cations)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blood Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cations/*pharmacology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross Infection/physiopathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Giant Cells/virology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Transduction, Genetic/genetics', 'Virion/drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Virus Assembly']",,2000/03/04 00:00,2000/03/04 00:01,['2000/03/04 00:00'],"['2000/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '2000/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2000 Jan;7(1):53-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700095.,,['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700095 [doi]'],,"['1R43 GM58361/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '2R55 GM41314-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: After treatment with GP-1 and GP-1-H, the inhibitory effects on the growth of mouse transplantable tumors were determined; MTT formazan formation, [3H]deoxythymidine ([3H]TdR) incorporation, cell cycle progression, and mitotic index of SGC-7901 or L1210 cells were measured; the acute toxicity and immune function of mice were assayed. RESULTS: At doses of 1/6 and 1/12 LD50, the inhibitory rates against Lewis lung carcinoma were 60.3% and 42.1% (GP-1), 38.9% and 10.3% (GP-1-H), respectively; more effective antitumor activity of GP-1 against P388, HePS, and S-180 than that of GP-1-H were found. In vitro, GP-1 exhibited more powerful inhibitory effects on the proliferation and DNA synthesis of SGC-7901 and L1210 cells than GP-1-H. GP-1 and GP-1-H arrested the L1210 cells at G2/M phase with a corresponding decrease of the cells in G1 phase, and increased the mitotic index of the cells; but the effects of GP-1-H were weaker than those of GP-1. After treatment with doses of 1/4 and 1/8 LD50 for 5 d, no significant difference on immune function of mice between GP-1 and GP-1-H was found.

All the diastereomers of both analogues exhibited unique biological activity profiles depending upon the configurations of the C-1 and C-3 hydroxyl groups, the C-2 methyl group in ring A, and the C-20 methyl group in the side chain. Of the eight possible diastereomers of the 2-methyl analogues, 2alpha-methyl-1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) was the most potent and exhibited comparable or even greater biological potency than 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). Of the eight possible diastereomers of the 2-methyl-20-epi analogues, 2alpha-methyl-20-epi-1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) was the most potent and exhibited 100- to 200-fold higher transcriptional potencies than 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and exceptionally high cell regulatory activities. 2beta-methyl-20-epi-1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) was nearly as potent as its 2-epimer, 2alpha-methyl-20-epi-1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), whereas its 20-epimer, 2beta-methyl-1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), was almost completely biologically inactive. In these respects, it can be postulated that the double modification of 2-methyl substitution and 20-epimerization to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) induces remarkable changes in a VDR/RXRalpha/VDRE-mediated signaling response and greatly enhances biological activity. The other striking finding was that 2beta-methyl-20-epi-3-epi-1beta,25(OH)(2)D(3) is transcriptionally more active than 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) despite lacking the 1alpha-hydroxyl group, which was believed to be essential for expressing VDR-mediated gene transcription. Since the C-20 natural counterpart, 2beta-methyl-3-epi-1beta,25(OH)(2)D(3), was almost completely biologically inactive, 20-epimerization is probably responsible for activation of gene expression. Although earlier extensive structure-activity studies of vitamin D analogues showed stereochemistry at the C-1, C-3, and C-20 of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) to be the key structural motif for vitamin D action, our results clearly demonstrated that stereochemistry at the C-2 is also an important structural motif for vitamin D action and imply that 2-methyl substitution possibly induces conformational changes in ring A depending upon the combinations of configurations of the C-1 and C-3 hydroxyl groups with C-20 stereochemistry. Consequently, several of these analogues exhibit exceptionally high or unexpected biological activities at the molecular and cellular levels. These results suggest that 2-methyl substitution together with alterations of stereochemistry in both ring A and the side chain of 1alpha, 25(OH)(2)D(3) will provide useful analogues for structure-activity studies and development of therapeutic agents with unique biological activity profiles.","['Nakagawa, K', 'Kurobe, M', 'Ozono, K', 'Konno, K', 'Fujishima, T', 'Takayama, H', 'Okano, T']","['Nakagawa K', 'Kurobe M', 'Ozono K', 'Konno K', 'Fujishima T', 'Takayama H', 'Okano T']","['Department of Hygienic Sciences, Kobe Pharmaceutical University, Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (2-methyl-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology']",,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Mar 15;59(6):691-702. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00357-3.,,"['S0006-2952(99)00357-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00357-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This assay is a modification of the assay for DNA-topoisomerase II (topo II) cleavable complexes (Willmore et al., Mol Pharmacol 53: 78-85, 1998). Drug-stabilised topo I-DNA complexes were detected in situ by topo I-specific primary antibodies and then visualised using fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated second antibodies. Immunofluorescence was then quantified using a cooled slow-scan coupled device camera and image analysis procedures. Camptothecin (CPT) was shown to stabilise topo I-DNA cleavable complexes in whole cells in a dose-dependent manner in both CCRF-CEM and K562 cells and in lymphoblasts from an adult with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia treated ex vivo with CPT. In K562 cells, cleavable complexes were found to be maximal between 30 and 90 minutes continuous exposure of CPT, and approximately 78% of cleavable complexes formed in these cells were found to be reversed within 5 minutes of drug removal. It has also been shown that the immunofluorescence detected by the TARDIS assay was specific for topo I-targeting agents. Hence, the TARDIS assay provides a powerful tool to determine the levels of drug-stabilised cleavable complexes in whole cells and thereby aid in the understanding of the mechanism of interaction between topo I-targeting drugs and their target.","['Padget, K', 'Carr, R', 'Pearson, A D', 'Tilby, M J', 'Austin, C A']","['Padget K', 'Carr R', 'Pearson AD', 'Tilby MJ', 'Austin CA']","['School of Biochemistry and Genetics, The Medical School, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*analysis/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*analysis/drug effects', '*Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/25 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/25 09:00'],"['2000/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Mar 15;59(6):629-38. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00372-x.,,"['S0006-2952(99)00372-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00372-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ara-C inhibits DNA polymerases and can be incorporated into DNA. Its mechanism of cytotoxicity is not fully understood. Using oligonucleotides and purified human topoisomerase I (top1), we found a 4- to 6-fold enhancement of top1 cleavage complexes when ara-C was incorporated at the +1 position (immediately 3') relative to a unique top1 cleavage site. This enhancement was primarily due to a reversible inhibition of top1-mediated DNA religation. Because ara-C incorporation is known to alter base stacking and sugar puckering at the misincorporation site and at the neighboring base pairs, the observed inhibition of religation at the ara-C site suggests the importance of the alignment of the 5'-hydroxyl end for religation with the phosphate group of the top1 phosphotyrosine bond. This study also demonstrates that ara-C treatment and DNA incorporation trap top1 cleavage complexes in human leukemia cells. Finally, we report that camptothecin-resistant mouse P388/CPT45 cells with no detectable top1 are crossresistant to ara-C, which suggests that top1 poisoning is a potential mechanism for ara-C cytotoxicity.","['Pourquier, P', 'Takebayashi, Y', 'Urasaki, Y', 'Gioffre, C', 'Kohlhagen, G', 'Pommier, Y']","['Pourquier P', 'Takebayashi Y', 'Urasaki Y', 'Gioffre C', 'Kohlhagen G', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Induction/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Feb 15;97(4):1885-90. doi: 10.1073/pnas.97.4.1885.,,"['97/4/1885 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.97.4.1885 [doi]']",,,,,,PMC26531,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we analyzed the effect of the AME fusion gene in vivo by expressing it in mouse bone marrow cells via retroviral transduction.

Morphological analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears demonstrated the presence of myeloid blast cells and differentiated but immature cells of both myelocytic and monocytic lineages.

Retroviral gene transfer and transgenic expression in rodents have demonstrated the ability of Bcr-Abl to induce various types of leukemia. However, study of human CML or rodent models has not determined the direct and immediate effects of Bcr-Abl on hematopoietic cells from those requiring secondary genetic or epigenetic changes selected during the pathogenic process. We utilized tetracycline-regulated expression of Bcr-Abl from a promoter engineered for robust expression in primitive stem cells through multilineage blood cell development in combination with the in vitro differentiation of embryonal stem cells into hematopoietic elements. Our results demonstrate that Bcr-Abl expression alone is sufficient to increase the number of multipotent and myeloid lineage committed progenitors in a dose-dependent manner while suppressing the development of committed erythroid progenitors. These effects are reversible upon extinguishing Bcr-Abl expression. These findings are consistent with Bcr-Abl being the sole genetic change needed for the establishment of the chronic phase of CML and provide a powerful system for the analysis of any genetic change that alters cell growth and lineage choices of the hematopoietic stem cell.","['Era, T', 'Witte, O N']","['Era T', 'Witte ON']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Microbiology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1662, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tetracycline/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",,2000/03/04 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/03/04 09:00'],"['2000/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Feb 15;97(4):1737-42. doi: 10.1073/pnas.97.4.1737.,,"['97/4/1737 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.97.4.1737 [doi]']",,['CA 76204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC26505,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results point to MBN as a G-CSF responsive gene critical to factor-independent growth and indicate that expression of the G-CSF receptor is a prerequisite to this process. A 91-bp MBN promoter region containing PU.1, C/EBP, and c-Myb binding sites is responsive to G-CSF treatment. Although PU.1, C/EBP, and c-Myb transcription factors all were critical for expression of MBN, its up-regulation by G-CSF was associated mainly with PU.1.

In the presence of sodium butyrate, these cells differentiate to erythroblasts and acquire the capability to synthesize haemoglobin. We used this cell system to study alterations in the levels of several G-protein subunits during the cell differentiation programme and to assess the involvement of G(i)alpha2 in this process. Western immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of G(s)alpha1, G(s)alpha2, G(i)alpha2, G(q)alpha, Galpha(12), Gbeta1 and Gbeta2 in K562 cells. G(o)alpha, G(z)alpha, Galpha(13) and Galpha(16) were not detected. Although the levels of several G-protein subunits were altered after treatment with sodium butyrate, the most striking change was the robust increase in the levels of G(i)alpha2, which was accompanied by an increase in the mRNA for G(i)alpha2. Inactivation of G(i)alpha2 by adding Bordetella pertussis toxin to the cultures inhibited erythroblastic differentiation by as much as 62%, as measured by haemoglobin accumulation. Furthermore, the addition of an oligonucleotide anti-sense to G(i)alpha2 inhibited the sodium butyrate-induced robust increase in G(i)alpha2 levels, decreasing it to the basal levels seen in control cells; this treatment decreased the erythroblastic differentiation of the cells (as measured by haemoglobin expression) by 50%. Taken together, these findings imply that increased levels of G(i)alpha2 contribute to the sodium butyrate-induced erythroblastic differentiation of K562 cells.","['Davis, M G', 'Kawai, Y', 'Arinze, I J']","['Davis MG', 'Kawai Y', 'Arinze IJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN 37208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go)']",IM,"['Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Erythroblasts/*metabolism/*pathology', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2000/03/24 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/24 09:00'],"['2000/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2000 Mar 1;346 Pt 2:455-61.,,,,"['5T32 HL07735/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 HL09727/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1220873,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple selected anti-sense sequences were placed in a single molecule. The anti-sense oligonucleotide (oligo) was covalently closed to avoid exonuclease activities and was designated CMAS (covalently closed multiple anti-sense)-oligo. CMAS-oligo was found to be stable, largely preserving its structural integrity after 24 h of incubation in the presence of either exonuclease III or serum. When human c-myb mRNA was targeted by the c-myb CMAS-oligo, expression of the gene was completely abolished. Further, tumour cell growth was inhibited by 82+/-3% as determined by an MTT [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay and by 90+/-1% by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. When a leukaemic cell line K562 was treated with CMAS-oligo, colony formation on soft agarose was also decreased by 93%. In contrast, treatment with a scrambled control oligo did not significantly inhibit leukaemic cell growth. These results suggest that a rational target site search is possible for an anti-sense oligo and that CMAS-oligo can be employed as an effective anti-sense agent with enhanced stability.","['Moon, I J', 'Lee, Y', 'Kwak, C S', 'Lee, J H', 'Choi, K', 'Schreiber, A D', 'Park, J G']","['Moon IJ', 'Lee Y', 'Kwak CS', 'Lee JH', 'Choi K', 'Schreiber AD', 'Park JG']","['Institute for Medical Science, Dongsan Medical Center, Keimyung University, Dongsandong 194, Chunggu, Taegu 700-310, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell Division/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Targeting', '*Genes, myb', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*genetics/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/03/24 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/24 09:00'],"['2000/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2000 Mar 1;346 Pt 2:295-303.,,,,,,,,PMC1220853,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein contains two copies of a conserved zinc-coordinating ""CCHC array"" or ""zinc knuckle"" motif common to the nucleocapsid proteins of nearly all known retroviruses. The residues comprising and adjacent to the zinc knuckles were assigned by standard two-dimensional (1)H and three-dimensional (1)H-(15)N NMR methods; the rotational dynamic properties of the protein were determined from (15)N relaxation experiments, and distance restraints derived from the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) data were used to calculate the three-dimensional structure. The (1)H-(1)H NOE and (15)N relaxation data indicate that the two zinc knuckles do not interact with each other, but instead behave as independently folded domains connected by a flexible 13-residue linker segment. The proximal zinc knuckle folds in a manner that is essentially identical to that observed previously for the two zinc knuckles of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nucleocapsid protein and for the moloney murine leukemia virus nucleocapsid zinc knuckle domain. However, the distal zinc knuckle of MMTV NC exhibits a rare three-dimensional fold that includes an additional C-terminal beta-hairpin. A similar C-terminal reverse turn-like structure was observed recently in the distal zinc knuckle of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus nucleocapsid protein [Gao, Y., et al. (1998) Protein Sci. 7, 2265-2280]. However, despite a high degree of sequence homology, the conformation and orientation of the beta-hairpin in MMTV NC is significantly different from that of the reverse turn in MPMV NC. The results support the conclusion that structural features of NC zinc knuckle domains can vary significantly among the different genera of retroviridae, and are discussed in terms of the recent and surprising discovery that MMTV NC can facilitate packaging of the HIV-1 genome in chimeric MMTV mutants.","['Klein, D J', 'Johnson, P E', 'Zollars, E S', 'De Guzman, R N', 'Summers, M F']","['Klein DJ', 'Johnson PE', 'Zollars ES', 'De Guzman RN', 'Summers MF']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland 21250, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Nitrogen Isotopes)', '0 (Nucleocapsid Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nitrogen Isotopes', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins/*chemistry', 'Peptide Fragments/*chemistry', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein Folding', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Thermodynamics', '*Zinc Fingers']",,2000/02/26 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/26 09:00'],"['2000/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2000 Feb 22;39(7):1604-12. doi: 10.1021/bi9922493.,,"['bi9922493 [pii]', '10.1021/bi9922493 [doi]']",,['GM42561/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['PDB/1DSQ', 'PDB/1DSV']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We proposed that this variability in natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity in the tumours. Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a systematic characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies. Here we show that there is diversity in gene expression among the tumours of DLBCL patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour proliferation rate, host response and differentiation state of the tumour. We identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which had gene expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of peripheral blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'). Patients with germinal centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival than those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of tumours on the basis of gene expression can thus identify previously undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer.","['Alizadeh, A A', 'Eisen, M B', 'Davis, R E', 'Ma, C', 'Lossos, I S', 'Rosenwald, A', 'Boldrick, J C', 'Sabet, H', 'Tran, T', 'Yu, X', 'Powell, J I', 'Yang, L', 'Marti, G E', 'Moore, T', 'Hudson, J Jr', 'Lu, L', 'Lewis, D B', 'Tibshirani, R', 'Sherlock, G', 'Chan, W C', 'Greiner, T C', 'Weisenburger, D D', 'Armitage, J O', 'Warnke, R', 'Levy, R', 'Wilson, W', 'Grever, M R', 'Byrd, J C', 'Botstein, D', 'Brown, P O', 'Staudt, L M']","['Alizadeh AA', 'Eisen MB', 'Davis RE', 'Ma C', 'Lossos IS', 'Rosenwald A', 'Boldrick JC', 'Sabet H', 'Tran T', 'Yu X', 'Powell JI', 'Yang L', 'Marti GE', 'Moore T', 'Hudson J Jr', 'Lu L', 'Lewis DB', 'Tibshirani R', 'Sherlock G', 'Chan WC', 'Greiner TC', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Armitage JO', 'Warnke R', 'Levy R', 'Wilson W', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC', 'Botstein D', 'Brown PO', 'Staudt LM']","['Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/17 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/17 09:00'],"['2000/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 2000 Feb 3;403(6769):503-11. doi: 10.1038/35000501.,,['10.1038/35000501 [doi]'],,,,"['Nature. 2000 Feb 3;403(6769):491-2.

Current accepted therapeutic strategies include allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and immunosuppression, both resulting in long-term survival in the majority of patients. Although human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling stem-cell transplantation is highly effective, the 25% probability of finding a suitable sibling donor within a family renders this approach available to only a minority of patients. Transplantation using HLA-matched, unrelated donors carries a high risk of treatment failure along with considerable toxicity. While combined immunosuppression with both antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A (CSA) produces hematologic improvement in most patients, relapse is common. Late evolution of aplastic anemia to other serious hematologic disorders, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplasia, and acute leukemia, is also a significant problem following treatment with ATG/CSA. Recently, results of immunosuppression in SAA with another potent immunosuppressive agent, cyclophosphamide, were reported in a small number of patients. The overall response rate was similar to that seen with ATG/CSA, but relapse and late clonal disease were not observed during a long period of follow-up. A larger randomized trial comparing sustained hematologic response rates to either conventional immunosuppression with ATG/CSA or high-dose cyclophosphamide and CSA is now underway; secondary end points include response duration, event-free survival, and overall survival. Additionally, a number of protocols designed to test the efficacy of alternative immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents are being developed.","['Tisdale, J F', 'Dunn, D E', 'Maciejewski, J']","['Tisdale JF', 'Dunn DE', 'Maciejewski J']","['Molecular and Clinical Hematology Branch, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*drug therapy', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Mycophenolic Acid/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Sirolimus/therapeutic use', 'Tacrolimus/therapeutic use']",75,2000/02/17 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/17 09:00'],"['2000/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2000 Jan;37(1):102-9. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(00)90034-9.,,"['S003719630000010X [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(00)90034-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysplastic changes of erythrocytes, neutrophils, and platelets in the peripheral blood were found in 5, 10 and 8 cats, respectively. Bone marrow examination of the 13 cats revealed that ratios of blast cells to all nucleated cells (ANC) ranged from 0 to 20%. Ratios of erythroid progenitor cells to ANC were more than 50% in 3 cats and less than 50% in 10 cats. Eosinophils accounted for more than 5% of non-erythroid cells in 10 cats. Dysplastic changes in the granurocytic, erythrocytic, and megakaryocytic cells in the bone marrow were found in 11, 7 and 5 cats, respectively. Dysplastic changes in these cats included giant neutrophils, ring-nucleated neutrophils, binuclear myelocytes, hypersegmented and hyposegmented neutrophils, megaloblastoid erythroblasts, multinucleated erythroblasts, micromegakaryocytes, and segmented multinucleated megakaryocytes. Virological examination indicated the presence of feline leukemia virus antigen in the peripheral blood from all of the 13 cats with MDS. The peripheral blood cytopenias and dysplastic changes in each blood cell lineage in the bone marrow were shown to be important for the diagnosis of MDS in cats.","['Shimoda, T', 'Shiranaga, N', 'Mashita, T', 'Hasegawa, A']","['Shimoda T', 'Shiranaga N', 'Mashita T', 'Hasegawa A']","['Sanyo Animal Medical Center, Akaiwa, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cat Diseases/*blood', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Hematocrit/veterinary', 'Leukocyte Count/veterinary', 'Lymphocyte Count/veterinary', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/classification/*veterinary', 'Platelet Count/veterinary', 'Reticulocyte Count/veterinary']",,2000/02/17 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/02/17 09:00'],"['2000/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2000 Jan;62(1):59-64. doi: 10.1292/jvms.62.59.,,['10.1292/jvms.62.59 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have reported conflicting results on the role of the transcription factor STAT5 in erythropoietin (EPO)-induced cellular responses. In this study we focused on the functional importance of STAT5 docking sites in the intracellular EPO receptor (EPOR) domain for the mediation of antiapoptotic activities. We demonstrate that EPO-dependent survival of erythroleukemic cell lines is accompanied by sustained STAT5 DNA-binding activity. The role of single tyrosine residues was dissected by the analysis of myeloid FDCP-1 cells stably expressing mutant EPOR proteins. The data show that receptors having a high potential to mediate antiapoptotic signals also effectively activate STAT5, whereas receptors lacking STAT5 docking sites are diminished in both activities. We conclude that the transcription factor STAT5 is functionally implicated in the EPO-dependent survival of cells.","['Bittorf, T', 'Seiler, J', 'Ludtke, B', 'Buchse, T', 'Jaster, R', 'Brock, J']","['Bittorf T', 'Seiler J', 'Ludtke B', 'Buchse T', 'Jaster R', 'Brock J']","['Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, University of Rostock, Germany. thomas.bittorf@med.uni-rostock.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroblasts/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/17 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/17 09:00'],"['2000/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2000 Jan;12(1):23-30. doi: 10.1016/s0898-6568(99)00063-7.,,"['S0898-6568(99)00063-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0898-6568(99)00063-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the expression and phosphorylation of Src-homology-2 and collagen-homology domains (SHC) [corrected] proteins in subpopulations of CML primary cells. Shc polypeptides are tyrosine kinase substrates that are constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in continuous cell lines of CML origin.

In this report, we hypothesized that bile acids may exert a positive cooperativity with two known inducers of leukemic cell differentiation, all-trans retinoic acid and 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3. Our results provide evidence that bile acids induced the monocytic differentiation of HL60 and THP-1 human leukemia cells exposed to ineffective concentrations of these inducers. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors H-7 (10 and 20 microM) and staurosporine (5 and 20 nM) modulated the effects of bile acids on HL60 cell differentiation. Most interestingly, bile acids are shown herein to down-regulate the expression of the serine protease myeloblastin gene involved in the differentiation of myeloid hematopoietic cells. In agreement with the recent identification of nuclear receptors for bile acids, our data suggest that functional interactions between nuclear bile acid signaling pathways, PKC, and nuclear receptors for retinoic acid and vitamin D3 are involved in the down-regulation of the myeloblastin gene and the induction of cell differentiation in human leukemic cells.","['Zimber, A', 'Chedeville, A', 'Abita, J P', 'Barbu, V', 'Gespach, C']","['Zimber A', 'Chedeville A', 'Abita JP', 'Barbu V', 'Gespach C']","['The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Animal Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Bile Acids and Salts)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/pharmacology', 'Bile Acids and Salts/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Myeloblastin', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,2000/02/17 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/17 09:00'],"['2000/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Feb 1;60(3):672-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD34+ cells from a total of 93 patients with either acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 25), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 21), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 18), polycythemia vera (PV; n = 16), or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS; n = 13) were analyzed before and in 19 patients after ex vivo expansion in the presence of multiple cytokines (kit ligand, interleukin-3, interleukin-6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus erythropoietin). Compared with hematopoietic progenitor cells from normal donors (n = 108), telomerase activity (TA) was increased 2- to 5-fold in chronic phase (CP)-CML, CLL, PV, and MDS. In AML, accelerated phase (AP) and blastic phase (BP)-CML, basal TA was 10- to 50-fold higher than normal. TA of CP-CML CD34+ cells was up-regulated within 72 h of ex vivo culture, peaked after 1 week, and decreased below detection after 2 weeks. In contrast, TA in AP/BP-CML and AML CD34+ cells was down-regulated after 1 week of culture and decreased further thereafter. The expansion potential of CD34+ cells from patients with leukemia was considerably decreased compared with CD34+ cells from normal donors. The average expansion of cells from leukemic individuals was 6.5-, 2.3-, 0.6-, and 0.2-fold in weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, whereas expansion of normal cells was 5- to 15-fold higher. In serial expansion culture, a median telomeric loss of 0.7 kbp was observed during 3-4 weeks of expansion. Our results demonstrate that up-regulation of telomerase is similar in CD34+ cells from CP-CML, CLL, PV, and MDS patients and in normal hematopoietic cells during the first week of culture, whereas in AML and AP/BP-CML, telomerase is high at baseline and down-regulated during expansion culture. High levels of telomerase in leukemic progenitors at baseline may be a feature of both the malignant phenotype and rapid cycling. Telomerase down-regulation during culture of leukemic cells may be due to the decreased expansion potential or repression of normal hematopoiesis, or in AML it may be due to the partial differentiation of AML cells, shown previously to be associated with loss of TA. Telomere shortening during ex vivo expansion correlated with low levels of TA, particularly in chronic leukemic and MDS progenitors where telomerase was insufficient to protect against telomere bp loss during intense proliferation.","['Engelhardt, M', 'Mackenzie, K', 'Drullinsky, P', 'Silver, R T', 'Moore, M A']","['Engelhardt M', 'Mackenzie K', 'Drullinsky P', 'Silver RT', 'Moore MA']","['James Ewing Laboratory of Developmental Hematopoiesis, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. engelhardtm@mm11.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', '*Telomere', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/17 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/17 09:00'],"['2000/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Feb 1;60(3):610-7.,,,,['U9 CA 67842-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In hematological malignancies, MDR is most often associated with overexpression of P-gp, a 170-kd transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by the human MDRI gene. Indeed, P-gp expression has been correlated with drug sensitivity and clinical outcome in several studies in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), and malignant lymphomas (NHL). A large number of compounds 'off the shelf' have been investigated for their ability to reverse the P-gp mediated MDR. However, most of these agents produced severe toxic effects at doses required to effectively block P-gp function, and modulation of P-gp in normal tissues can affect the pharmacokinetics and, thus, the toxicity of the associated chemotherapeutic agents. Phase I/IIa trials with third generation MDR modulators, such as valspodar, show that these new agents can be safely administered in combination with different chemotherapy regiments after dose adjustments of cytotoxic drugs that a P-gp substrates. Moreover, MDR reversal by valspodar has been demonstrated in the patients with AML, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The definition of the clinical benefits of using MDR modulators in haematological malignancies and their full extent awaits the conclusion of the ongoing randomized phase III trials with valspondar in either newly diagnosed or resistant relapsed AML patients, and in multiple myeloma patients who have failed front-line treatment.","['Covelli, A']",['Covelli A'],"['Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland. alfredo.covelli@pharma.novartis.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genes, MDR/genetics/physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/genetics']",87,2000/02/17 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/17 09:00'],"['2000/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1999;10 Suppl 6:53-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research on the hypothesis that exposure to 50-60-Hz magnetic and electric fields (EMF) increases the risk of cancer has been ongoing for two decades. Epidemiological studies provide a somewhat consistent pattern indicating an increased risk for childhood leukemia and adult chronic lymphatic leukemia and possibly also for other leukemias and brain cancer. However, there is still no good candidate for a mechanism. Epidemiological studies have throughout the two decades been interpreted with great caution, and final evaluations as to carcinogenicity have been deferred. The reason for this carefulness may be the lack of knowledge about a plausible mechanism. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the process of weighing epidemiological data, experimental data, and other background information into a synthesis such that the evaluation can be based on all data combined. A Bayesian approach to this weighing is discussed along with some alternatives. The Bayesian approach provides a structure for the pooling of evidence and points out where subjective judgments come into play.","['Ahlbom, A', 'Feychting, M']","['Ahlbom A', 'Feychting M']","['Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. anders.ahlbom@imm.ki.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Brain Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Design', 'Risk Assessment']",,2000/02/17 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/17 09:00'],"['2000/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1999;895:27-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08075.x.,,['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08075.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although most children in the United States with cancer are treated according to National Cancer Institute-sponsored comprehensive protocols, there is a wide variation in the implementation of protocols by physicians and hospitals. The development of this care path was based on evidence from the literature, review of practice patterns, expert opinion, and group participant consensus building. The resulting 4-day care path was organized into six categories of care (e.g., assessment practices, diagnostic tests, teaching, and discharge planning). Discharge criteria are stated at the beginning of the care path to emphasize the planning process immediately on admission. Clinical outcomes, skill and knowledge outcomes for the parent and child, and home assessment considerations are also included. Strategies to create change and gain support of various stakeholders toward implementation of the care path are presented. The strength of the resulting care path is possible in large part because the multihospital group process brought professionals from around the country together to discuss, analyze, and reach consensus on the practices related to the child with ALL. The group process enabled the development of a care path that goes beyond a traditional care path developed by a single institution.","['McMahon, L W', 'Sealing, P A', 'Mahoney, D H Jr', 'Bowman, W P', 'Sandler, E']","['McMahon LW', 'Sealing PA', 'Mahoney DH Jr', 'Bowman WP', 'Sandler E']","[""National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, Palm Harbor, FL 34685, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,,IM,"['Child', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Critical Pathways/*organization & administration', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Multi-Institutional Systems/*organization & administration', 'Oncology Nursing/organization & administration', 'Patient Care Team/organization & administration', 'Pediatric Nursing/organization & administration', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*nursing', '*Program Development/methods', 'United States']",,2000/02/17 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/17 09:00'],"['2000/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2000 Jan;17(1):33-44. doi: 10.1177/104345420001700105.,,"['S1043454200000072 [pii]', '10.1177/104345420001700105 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A PCR product with expected size, of 546bp, and termed tvLIF, was obtained using cDNA reverse-transcribed from total RNA isolated from possum uterus. A genomic DNA fragment (about 650bp) between the specified primers was also amplified, indicating the similarity in structure and organization of this gene and LIF genes from studied eutherian species, although the full-length of its cDNA and genomic DNA needs to be further clarified. The deduced amino acid sequence of tvLIF shows a high level of sequence identity and similar molecular characteristics to eutherian LIF, which suggests similar biological actions of this molecule in this marsupial. Because the expression of LIF gene in other mammalian species has been found to be at very low levels and its transcripts cannot be detected by Northern hybridization analysis, the expression pattern of tvLIF in adult tissues and reproductive tracts during early development was investigated using the RT-PCR technique. Resultant products of the RT-PCR were further analyzed by Southern hybridization using tvLIF as a probe. tvLIF transcripts were detected in most of the adult tissues and in the reproductive tracts of pregnant females. These results lend support to the idea that LIF contributes to the maintenance of pregnancy in this marsupial.","['Cui, S', 'Selwood, L']","['Cui S', 'Selwood L']","['Department of Zoology, La Trobe University, Plenty Road, Bundoora, Australia.

We show that 30 microM farnesol causes apoptosis of leukaemic cell lines of T- and B-lymphocyte, myeloid or erythroid lineages and primary blasts obtained from patients with AML.

However, leukemias, and especially secondary acute myelogenous leukemias (sAML) are not very well analyzed by this technique, even though such diseases are often characterized by complex karyotypic changes, not resolvable by conventional cytogenetic banding analysis. This lack of CGH-studies might be due to the fact, that in most cases bone marrow aspirate is too limited to do DNA-extraction additionally to the cytogenetic analysis. To circumvent this problem a new CGH technique has been applied to analyze 10 AML cases with complex karyotypic changes. In each case 15 interphase nuclei of the harvested and fixed bone marrow cell-suspension have been microdissected from the coverslip surface and collected in a tube. Subsequently, DNA was amplified by DOP-PCR.

METHODS: We identified 2814 individuals with Down's syndrome from the Danish Cytogenetic Register, and linked the data to the Danish Cancer Registry. The number of person-years at risk was 48453. Standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and 95% CI were calculated of the basis of cancer rates specific for age and sex in the general population. FINDINGS: 60 cases of cancer were found, with 49.8 expected (SIR 1.20 [95% CI 0.92-1.55]). Leukaemia constituted 60% of cases of malignant disease overall and 97% of cases in children. The SIR for leukaemia varied with age, being 56 (38-81) at age 0-4 years and 10 (4-20) at 5-29 years. No cases of leukaemia were seen after the age of 29 years. The SIR for acute myeloid leukaemia was 3.8 (1.7-8.4) times higher than that for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children aged 0-4 years. The cumulative risk for leukaemia by the age of 5 years was 2.1% and that by 30 years was 2.7%. Only 24 solid tumours were seen, with 47.8 expected (0.50 [0.32-0.75]).

We previously showed that ectopically expressed AML1-MTG8 fusion protein is associated with an MTG8-like protein in the mouse myeloid precursor cell line L-G, and this association seemed to be required for AML1-MTG8 to stimulate proliferation. As a candidate cDNA for this MTG8-like protein, a 6.4 kb MTGR1 cDNA encoding human MTGR1b protein of 604 amino acids was isolated. Since this cDNA was shorter than the main mRNA (about 7.5 kb), the 5'-end of the MTGR1 cDNA was extended using Marathon Ready cDNA. When the newly obtained 5'-sequence was combined with the previous cDNA, the resultant MTGR1 cDNA (6995 bp), including exon 3 that the previous cDNA lacked, could encode MTGR1a protein of 575 amino acids. Transcripts of the MTGR1 gene were expressed ubiquitously in the human tissues and cell lines examined. PCR analyses of the cDNAs from human tissues showed the presence of various splicing variants with regard to the 5'-region including exons 1, 2 and 3. The MTGR1 gene consists of 14 exons and spans about 68 kb. The genomic structure of MTGR1 is highly similar to those of other MTG 8-family genes, MTG8 and MTG16.

The labelling of the amplified sequences was done employing biotinylated primers and a second PCR in a semi-nested fashion with a low number of cycles. An enzymatic system based on biotin-streptavidin-chromogen reaction was used for the detection of labeled PCR product, thus producing a coloured product, visible to the eye under a standard light microscope. All samples from patients with cytogenetic and molecular evidence of BCR-ABL rearrangement showed specific cytoplasmic staining at the site of the amplified hybrid transcripts. It allowed definite distinction between positive and negative cells. K562, LAMA-84, BV173 cells were characterized with strong diffuse staining while an interesting finding of the present study was the presence of variable quantities of colour product in patients' samples which might be due to different mRNA expression. Early and intermediate stages of myeloid maturation showed more intense reactivity. Cases with an aggressive course of accelerated or blast phase CML and AL were found to have a considerable subset of cells with strongly expressed signal while cases in chronic phase were characterised with uniform weak to moderate reaction. Our observations support the hypothesis that the amount of BCR-ABL transcript expression within neoplastic cells may play a role in dictating the eventual behaviour of the leukaemic clone.

In the immediate post-transplant period in only 1 patient (HBsAg carrier and affected by breast cancer) was hepatitis documented (at about 1 month from transplant) with an elevation of transaminase levels (x20-40 n.v.). Neither other complications, nor toxic deaths were observed. During the post-transplant follow-up (median 31 months, range 9-83) no hepatic abnormalities were observed. All patients are alive at 56 months (20-122) from diagnosis. Currently 10/11 patients are in complete remission, while 1 patient, affected by follicular centre lymphoma, is alive with disease 52 months from autologous stem cell transplantation. Our study shows that both conventional therapy and high-dose chemotherapy can be performed safely in chronic hepatitis B and C virus carriers.","['Sperotto, A', 'Silvestri, F', 'Fanin, R', 'Damiani, D', 'Geromin, A', 'Cerno, M', 'Stocchi, R', 'Patriarca, F', 'Baccarani, M']","['Sperotto A', 'Silvestri F', 'Fanin R', 'Damiani D', 'Geromin A', 'Cerno M', 'Stocchi R', 'Patriarca F', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Medical and Morphological Research, University Hospital, Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Carrier State', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/*complications', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*complications', 'Humans', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/*therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jan;36(3-4):323-30. doi: 10.3109/10428190009148853.,,"['I308J991123 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009148853 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For identification of megakaryopoiesis we used the monoclonal antibody CD61 and additionally the PAS reaction to determine the subfraction of atypical micromegakaryocytes and precursors. Labelling of erythroid precursors was carried out by a monoclonal antibody directed against glycophorin C. In order to selectively stain macrophages and their activated subset we applied CD68 and the GSA-I lectin. Density of argyrophilic fibers (reticulin plus collagen) was measured following Gomori's silver impregnation method. In accordance with laboratory data morphological variables revealed a comparable amount of congruence in the various groups of CML patients derived from different sources. In about 26% of patients early (reticulin) to advanced (collagen) fibrosis was detectable. Significant correlations were calculated between the extent of myelofibrosis with splenomegaly, anemia and increasing numbers of erythroblasts and myeloblasts in the peripheral blood count. These features were assumed to indicate more advanced stages of the disease process with ensuing transition into myeloid metaplasia and consequently were associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Significant relationships were revealed between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes and more important, also their precursor fraction with the degree of fibrosis. This result extends previous experimental findings regarding the impact of immature elements of this cell lineage for the generation of myelofibrosis. The significant association of erythroid precursors with the number of mature (resident) macrophages including their activated GSA-I subset may shed some light on their functional involvement in iron turnover and hemoglobin synthesis. A modified histological classification of predominant bone marrow features is introduced. This simplified synthesis staging system (Cologne Classification) is not only associated with certain sets of laboratory data, but also with different survival patterns.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Schmitt-Graeff, A', 'Zirbes, T K', 'Birnbaum, F', 'Kressmann, C', 'Melguizo-Grahmann, M', 'Frackenpohl, H', 'Sprungmann, C', 'Leder, L D', 'Diehl, V', 'Zankovich, R', 'Schaefer, H E', 'Niederle, N', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Zirbes TK', 'Birnbaum F', 'Kressmann C', 'Melguizo-Grahmann M', 'Frackenpohl H', 'Sprungmann C', 'Leder LD', 'Diehl V', 'Zankovich R', 'Schaefer HE', 'Niederle N', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology', 'Survival Rate']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jan;36(3-4):295-308. doi: 10.3109/10428190009148850.,,"['I308J991140 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009148850 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early CD34+ hemopoietic progenitors express WT1, whereas no WT1 mRNA transcripts can be found in mature blood cells and differentiation-induced committed CD34- progenitors. As a powerful complementary diagnostic tool, testing for WT1 expression can be helpful to discriminate between eosinophilic leukemia (EoL) patients and patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndromes.

The mean age was 23.3 +/- 17.3 with 10 children and 15 adults. 14 patients were classified as L1, 9 L2 and 2 L3 according to the FAB classification. 17 cases were B-lineage ALL and 8 T-ALL. 23 out of 25 cases (92%) included in this study displayed phenotypic aberrations at diagnosis (15 out of 17 cases of B-lineage ALL and all T-ALL patients). 76% of patients displayed two or more than two aberrancies. The phenotypic aberrations were lineage infidelity, found in 12 patients, asynchronous antigen expression detected in 17 patients, antigen overexpression in 4 patients and ectopic phenotype in 7 patients. In summary our results show that when a large panel of MoAbs is used for the immunophenotypical characterization of ALL, most patients display aberrant phenotypes, the coexistence of more than two aberrant antigen expressions being frequently detected. These results suggest that the use of immunological methods for the detection of MRD in ALL based on the existence of aberrant phenotypes could be of great help for the follow-up of patients in complete remission.","['Garcia Vela, J A', 'Monteserin, M C', 'Delgado, I', 'Benito, L', 'Ona, F']","['Garcia Vela JA', 'Monteserin MC', 'Delgado I', 'Benito L', 'Ona F']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Getafe, Madrid, Spain. javela@ran.es']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*immunology/pathology', 'Prospective Studies']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jan;36(3-4):275-84. doi: 10.3109/10428190009148848.,,"['I308J991118 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009148848 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is found in 15% to 30% of patients, and its incidence increases with age. As in children, prognosis in Ph-positive adult ALL is poor. No therapeutic approach has had substantial impact on its unfavorable course. We analyzed the characteristics and outcome of newly diagnosed adults with Ph-positive ALL treated at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 1997. The diagnosis of patients was based on typical morphological and immunophenotypic criteria of marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens. Cytogenetic and molecular studies were also performed. A total of 67 patients were included in this study. From 1980 until 1991, 38 patients with Ph-positive ALL were treated with vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone (VAD), or with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-like induction protocols. Since 1992 a total of 29 patients received induction therapy with an intensified treatment protocol, called ""hyper-CVAD"". The outcome of patients treated with standard and intensified treatment regimens was compared and results of our institution contrasted with data obtained from other centers. Ph-positive ALL was present in 67 of 498 patients with newly diagnosed ALL (13%). Patients with Ph-positive ALL had a higher median age (44 versus 34, P=0.007), higher median white blood cell (WBC) counts at presentation (25 versus 8, P=0.0002), and higher peripheral median percentage of blast counts (63 versus 40, P=0.023). FAB subtype L2 (70% versus 49%, P=0.001) and CALLA-positive pre-B immunophenotype (75% versus 37%, P<0.001) predominated among Ph-positive ALL. Myeloid marker coexpression was more frequent in Ph-positive ALL when compared with Ph-negative ALL (52% vs. 27% for CD13, P<0.001, and 44% vs. 27% for CD33, P=0.005). Among patients treated with hyper-CVAD, the complete remission (CR) rate was 90% versus 55% (P=0.002) with pre-hyper-CVAD regimens (VAD and AML-like induction protocols), the median CR duration was 43 weeks versus 32 weeks (P>0.5), median disease-free survival (DFS) was 42 weeks versus 29 weeks (P=0.008), and median survival was 66 weeks versus 45 weeks (P>0.5). Patients with hyperdiploid Ph-positive ALL on hyper-CVAD therapy achieved significantly longer CR duration and DFS than hypo- and pseudodiploid cases (59 weeks versus 42 and 31 weeks, P=0.02 and 0.04, respectively). In contrast, patients treated with regimens prior to hyper-CVAD had significantly shorter CR duration (21 weeks versus 33 and 29 weeks, P=0.03) and DFS with hyperdiploid karyotypes when compared to pseudodiploid and hypodiploid cases (16 weeks versus 30 and 13 weeks, P=0.008). In conclusion, our results demonstrate improved response rate and DFS with current intensive regimens (hyper-CVAD) in patients with Ph-positive ALL, but no advantage in overall survival.","['Faderl, S', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Thomas, D A', 'Cortes, J', 'Giles, F', 'Pierce, S', 'Albitar, M', 'Estrov, Z']","['Faderl S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Thomas DA', 'Cortes J', 'Giles F', 'Pierce S', 'Albitar M', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

The European Working Group on MPD (EWG.MPD) extended and modified the PVSG diagnostic criteria of PV by including bone marrow histopathology. From the results of prospective randomized studies in PV it became evident that new clinical trials in previously untreated PV patients should focus on comparing interferon-alpha, a non-leukemogenic approach, versus a potential leukemogenic myelosuppressive treatment modality. Hydroxyurea appears to be the least leukemogenic myelosuppressive agent in long-term prospective clinical PV-studies extending observation periods of more than 10 years. The rational for using IFN-alpha as a first-line treatment option in newly diagnosed PV-patient include its effectiveness to abate constitutional symptoms and to induce a complete remission thereby avoiding phlebotomy, iron deficiency, and macrocytosis associated with hydroxyurea. Moreover IFN-alpha may prevent or delay the development of postpolycythemic myelofibrosis if used early in the course of the disease. Clinicians will be reluctant to postpone the use of hydroxyurea in early stage PV as long as a conservative approach using phlebotomy aiming at a hematocrit below 0.45, plus low-dose aspirin for the control platelet function or anagrelide for the control platelet number is used to keep the patient healthy. Low-dose aspirin will prevent the microvascular thrombotic complications of thrombocythemia associated with PV in remission after phlebotomy, but lacks myelosuppressive activity. Control of megakaryocyte maturation and reduction of platelet production to normal (<400 x 10(9)/l) by relatively low doses of anagrelide will predict a significant reduction of vascular complications in the early stages of PV, may prevent progression to myelofibrosis during follow-up of PV and very probable will postpone the use of hydroxyurea treatment for controlling the platelet count in PV. Large scale randomized clinical trials in PV are proposed, which should aim not only for clinical and hematological response, safety, efficacy, but should also assess toxicity, the need for phlebotomy and whether the development of progressive disease such as splenomegaly, pruritus, myelofibrotic myeloid metaplasia, spent phase, myelodysplasia and acute leukemia can be delayed or prevented by IFN-alpha as compared to a conservative approach of phlebotomy plus low-dose aspirin or anagrelide followed by hydroxyurea when signs of myeloproliferative activity became evident.","['Michiels, J J', 'Barbui, T', 'Finazzi, G', 'Fuchtman, S M', 'Kutti, J', 'Rain, J D', 'Silver, R T', 'Tefferi, A', 'Thiele, J']","['Michiels JJ', 'Barbui T', 'Finazzi G', 'Fuchtman SM', 'Kutti J', 'Rain JD', 'Silver RT', 'Tefferi A', 'Thiele J']","['Goodheart Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. postbus@goodheartcenter.demon.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets/drug effects/metabolism', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia Vera/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quinazolines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",54,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jan;36(3-4):239-53. doi: 10.3109/10428190009148845.,,['10.3109/10428190009148845 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results suggest that clonal diversity plays a role in disease progression as patients with oligoclonal disease showed a significantly shorter disease free survival than patients with monoclonal disease. This trend was of particular importance in the 'standard risk' group of ALL where aggressive disease could not be recognised by other means. In addition, generation of independent subclones from an early, non-rearranged tumour progenitor appears to be a common feature among leukaemias with aggressive clinical behaviour. We speculate on the type of genetic factors which may participate both in the generation of subclones and also in wider genomic instability and which are likely to be required for the aggressive clinical phenotype in children with ALL.","['Stankovic, T', 'Weston, V', 'McConville, C M', 'Green, E', 'Powell, J E', 'Mann, J R', 'Darbyshire, P J', 'Taylor, A M']","['Stankovic T', 'Weston V', 'McConville CM', 'Green E', 'Powell JE', 'Mann JR', 'Darbyshire PJ', 'Taylor AM']","['CRC Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/prevention & control', 'Clone Cells', 'Forecasting', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/prevention & control', 'Stem Cells']",55,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jan;36(3-4):213-24. doi: 10.3109/10428190009148843.,,"['I308J991124 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009148843 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present a comparative study of different normal and malignant cells in respect to the activation of dCK by CdA. G-phase lymphocytes showed a higher sensitivity for dCK stimulation than S-phase cells. Normal and leukaemic peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as the promyelocytic cell line HL60 responded to CdA treatment by a 2-5-fold increase in activity of dCK. However, no significant stimulation was detected either in CCRF-CEM T-lymphoblastoid cells, or in K562 myeloid cells. Thymidine kinase (TK) activity was not stimulated in any cases. Treatment of these cells with several other analogues beside CdA, such as 2-chloro-2'-arabino-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CAFdA), 2-fluoro-1-beta-D-arabinosyladenine (Fludarabine, FaraA) and 1-beta-D-arabinosylcytosine (cytarabine, araC) gave similar results to CdA treatment. Enhancement of dCK activity could also be achieved with the topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide. In contrast, 2-chloro-riboadenosine (CrA) had no effect on the dCK at concentrations of 10 microM or less, while dCyd and 5-aza-dCyd caused slight inhibition. These results indicate that treatment of cells with several inhibitors of DNA synthesis potentiates the dCK activity. The drugs widely differ in their stimulatory effect on dCK, and there are also 'responsive' and 'non-responsive' cells with respect to dCK activation. Thus, enhancement of the dCK activity by specific drugs in 'responsive' cells might give a rationale for combination chemotherapy.","['Spasokoukotskaja, T', 'Sasvari-Szekely, M', 'Keszler, G', 'Albertioni, F', 'Eriksson, S', 'Staub, M']","['Spasokoukotskaja T', 'Sasvari-Szekely M', 'Keszler G', 'Albertioni F', 'Eriksson S', 'Staub M']","['Semmelweis University of Medicine, Department of Medical Chemistry, Molecular Biology and Pathobiochemistry, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Nucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1999 Dec;35(13):1862-7. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(99)00223-3.,,"['S0959-8049(99)00223-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(99)00223-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the effect of structurally related flavonoids on cell viability, DNA fragmentation and caspase activity was assessed. Loss of membrane potential and reactive oxygen species generation were also monitored by flow cytometry. The structurally related flavonoids, such as apigenin, quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol were able to induce apoptosis in human leukaemia HL-60 cells. Treatment with flavonoids (60 microM) caused a rapid induction of caspase-3 activity and stimulated proteolytic cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, these flavonoids induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol, and subsequent induction of procaspase-9 processing. The potency of these flavonoids on these features of apoptosis were in the order of: apigenin > quercetin > myricetin > kaempferol in HL-60 cells treated with 60 microM flavonoids. These results suggest that flavonoid-induced apoptosis is stimulated by the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, by procaspase-9 processing, and through a caspase-3-dependent mechanism. The induction of apoptosis by flavonoids may be attributed to their cancer chemopreventive activity. Furthermore, the potency of flavonoids for inducing apoptosis may be dependent on the numbers of hydroxyl groups in the 2-phenyl group and on the absence of the 3-hydroxyl group. This provides new information on the structure-activity relationship of flavonoids.","['Wang, I K', 'Lin-Shiau, S Y', 'Lin, J K']","['Wang IK', 'Lin-Shiau SY', 'Lin JK']","['Institute of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apigenin', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1999 Oct;35(10):1517-25.,,['S0959-8049(99)00168-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite a more intensive second-line treatment at transplantation centres, the overall outcome remained similar to that of referring centres.","['Keating, S', 'de Witte, T', 'Suciu, S', 'Mandelli, F', 'Damasio, E', 'Willemze, R', 'Morra, E', 'Amadori, S', 'Dardenne, M', 'Vegna, M L', 'Zittoun, R A']","['Keating S', 'de Witte T', 'Suciu S', 'Mandelli F', 'Damasio E', 'Willemze R', 'Morra E', 'Amadori S', 'Dardenne M', 'Vegna ML', 'Zittoun RA']","['EORTC Data Center, Brussels, Belgium. skeating@worldonline.nl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Child', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1999 Oct;35(10):1440-7. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(99)00148-3.,,"['S0959804999001483 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(99)00148-3 [doi]']",,"['2U10 CA11488-25/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10 CA11488-26/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10 CA11488-27/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strategies used in this interdisciplinary effort included collaboration, consultation, education, and evaluation. In the collaboration phase, a core group of nurses talked with staff about current practices, reviewed literature and published standards, examined protocols from other institutions, decided on goals, and developed the standard. Consultation with a dentist, pharmacist, and physician occurred before completion of the standard. The education phase included in-service sessions for nurses and technicians. The evaluation phase, which occurred in two phases, focused on checking to see if the goals had been met, including tolerability and adherence. The first phase allowed identification of problem areas and subsequent revisions, whereas the second phase evaluated adherence at a later time point. Overall, most of the patients adhered to the standard. Future implications include specific recommendations such as an emphasis on oral care, documentation, and patient and staff education. This project is an example of how nurses addressed the challenge of implementing an acceptable oral care standard to decrease patients' oral complications and distress.","['Yeager, K A', 'Webster, J', 'Crain, M', 'Kasow, J', 'McGuire, D B']","['Yeager KA', 'Webster J', 'Crain M', 'Kasow J', 'McGuire DB']","['Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/nursing', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Dental Care/nursing/*standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Health Education, Dental', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*nursing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*nursing', 'Program Evaluation/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Southeastern United States']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2000 Feb;23(1):40-7; quiz 47-8. doi: 10.1097/00002820-200002000-00006.,,['10.1097/00002820-200002000-00006 [doi]'],,['NR03929/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since AML1/MTG8 fusion transcripts remain detectable by RT-PCR in t(8;21) AML patients in long-term hematological remission, quantitative assessment of AML1/MTG8 transcripts is necessary for the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in these patients. Competitive RT-PCR and recently real-time RT-PCR are increasingly used for detection and quantification of leukemia specific fusion transcripts. For the direct comparison of both methods we cloned a 42 bp DNA fragment into the original AML1/MTG8 sequence. The resulting molecule was used as an internal competitor for our novel competitive nested RT-PCR for AML1/MTG8 and as an external standard for the generation of AML1/MTG8 standard curves in a real-time PCR assay. Using this standard molecule for both PCR techniques, we compared their sensitivity, linearity and reproducibility. Both methods were comparable with regard to all parameters tested irrespective of analyzing serial dilutions of plasmids, cell lines or samples from t(8;21) positive AML patients at different stages of the disease. Therefore, both techniques can be recommended for the monitoring of MRD in these particular AML patients.

Indeed, although quantitation of minimal residual disease has proved to be useful in predicting clinical outcome in other leukemias such as chronic myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, no quantitative data have been provided in the case of APL. We present here a method for quantitation of the most frequent subtypes of t(15;17) transcripts (namely bcr1 and bcr3). One specific forward primer is used for each subtype in order to keep amplicon length under 200 bp. The expression of PML-RARalpha transcripts is normalized using the housekeeping porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) gene. This technique allows detection of 10 copies of PML-RARalpha or PBGD plasmids, and quantitation was efficient up to 100 copies. One t(15;17)-positive NB4 cell could be detected among 106 HL60 cells, although quantitation was efficient up to one cell among 105. Repeatability and reproducibility of the method were satisfying as intra- and inter-assay variation coefficients were not higher than 15%.

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with TaqMan technology. Here, we present for the first time the potential of LightCycler real-time PCR technology to quantify MRD. We compare and assess different approaches for real-time PCR quantification of leukemic cells, based either on clone-specific primers and general fluorescence detection with SYBR Green, TaqMan probe or hybridization probes, or based on general PCR amplification and clone-specific detection with hybridization probes. MRD quantification with LightCycler real-time PCR technology is a sensitive, specific and incomparably rapid method that needs no post-PCR handling, hence eliminating contamination risk and saving time.

We hypothesized that combining agents that improve virus-target cell interaction via different mechanisms will increase transduction efficiency. We examined the transduction efficiency of leukemic K562 cells, primary normal and chronic myelogenous leukemia CD34+ cells with the amphotropic retroviral vector, G1Na, packaged in PA317 by enumerating G418-resistant colonies in semisolid media. We evaluated the ability of the recombinant fibronectin fragment, CH296, cationic lipids, or a transwell flow-through system, alone or in combination to improve retroviral transduction. Transduction of K562 cells improved 1.5 to two-fold with lipids or CH296, while their combination improved transduction 2.5-fold. Transduction of K562 cells in the transwell flow-through system improved transduction three-fold. Transduction of normal (NL) CD34+ CFC improved 10-fold with lipids and 20-fold with CH296. Lipid and CH296 had synergistic effects. The transwell flow-through system improved transduction of normal CD34+ CFC 30-fold. Finally, similar to what was seen for K562 cells, transduction of CML CFC improved two- to three-fold with either CH296 or lipids, whereas the combination had synergistic effects. We conclude that any physical means that enhances contact between viral particles and target cells improves transduction. Two such methods that have different action mechanisms have additive or synergistic effects on transduction.","['Liu, H', 'Hung, Y', 'Wissink, S D', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Liu H', 'Hung Y', 'Wissink SD', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fibronectins/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lipids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Feb;14(2):307-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401672.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401672 [doi]'],,"['R01-CA-74887/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-79955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK-54037/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These apoptotic phenomena induced by 2CdA were inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX; a protein synthesis inhibitor), deoxycytidine (dC; a substrate of deoxycytidine kinase), acetyl Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp aldehyde (Ac-IETD-CHO; a caspase-8 inhibitor) and acetyl Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-CHO; a caspase-3 inhibitor).

Histogenetic analysis has suggested that PEL originates from post-germinal center, pre-terminally differentiated B cells sharing phenotypic features with plasma cells. Here we have investigated the expression status and functional integrity of the Met tyrosine kinase receptor and of its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Thirteen PEL (nine cell lines and four primary specimens) were analyzed for Met and HGF expression and function by multiple assays. For comparison, a panel of 34 high grade B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) other than PEL was also investigated. Co-expression of Met and HGF was found in all PEL analyzed, whereas it was restricted to 1/34 B cell NHL other than PEL (P < 0.001; chi2 test). The Met protein expressed by PEL displays biochemical characteristics typical of Met expressed by other cell types and is capable of tyrosine autophosphorylation. By using a combination of immunological and biological assays, production and secretion of a functional HGF species was identified in all PEL cell lines analyzed. HGF stimulation of PEL cells rapidly induces Met tyrosine phosphorylation, demonstrating the functional integrity of the Met/HGF loop. Because of the well known mitogenic and motogenic properties of Met/HGF interactions, these data may bear implications for PEL growth and dissemination. Among B cell neoplasms, Met/HGF co-expression selectively clusters with PEL and, as demonstrated by previous studies, with multiple myeloma plasma cells, thus reinforcing the notion that PEL displays biologic similarities with tumors derived from late stages of B cell differentiation.","['Capello, D', 'Gaidano, G', 'Gallicchio, M', 'Gloghini, A', 'Medico, E', 'Vivenza, D', 'Buonaiuto, D', 'Fassone, L', 'Avanzi, G C', 'Saglio, G', 'Prat, M', 'Carbone, A']","['Capello D', 'Gaidano G', 'Gallicchio M', 'Gloghini A', 'Medico E', 'Vivenza D', 'Buonaiuto D', 'Fassone L', 'Avanzi GC', 'Saglio G', 'Prat M', 'Carbone A']","['Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Medical Sciences, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Herpesviridae Infections/complications/*virology', '*Herpesvirus 8, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*chemistry/metabolism/*virology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Feb;14(2):285-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401666.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401666 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The culture study revealed that IgGlambda, at least, was derived from the serum, and IgAkappa was expressed intrinsically. Furthermore, the positive correlation between the densities of both surface light chains on two-color flow cytometry, the rosette formation study and its inhibition test by the Fcgamma fragment suggested that the serum IgGlambda combined with some antigens on the tumor-cell surface via its Fab portion and with the Fcgamma receptor of macrophages via its Fc portion. From these findings, we regarded the present case as an anti-tumor antibody-coated lymphoma. In addition, the phagocytic study disclosed that the serum-derived IgGlambda, at least, might have induced the phagocytosis of circulating lymphoma cells by macrophages.

PEL is also frequently infected by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The precise pathogenetic role of EBV coinfection in PEL is not fully understood. The lymphoma fails to express the EBV transforming proteins EBNA-2 and LMP-1, whereas it expresses EBNA-1 (latency I phenotype). Some studies have hypothesized that other EBV-positive lymphomas expressing the latency I phenotype may associate with specific molecular variants of EBNA-1, although this issue has not been addressed in PEL. On this basis, this study is aimed at a detailed molecular characterization of EBV in PEL. Fifteen EBV positive PEL (12 AIDS-related, one post-transplant, two arising in immunocompetent hosts) were subjected to molecular characterization of the viral genes EBNA-1 and LMP-1, as well as definition of EBV type-1/type-2. The EBNA-1 gene displayed a high degree of heterogeneity in different cases of PEL, with seven distinct recognizable variants and subvariants. A wild-type LMP-1 gene was detected in 10/15 cases, whereas in 5/15 cases the LMP-1 gene harbored a deletion spanning codons 346-355. EBV type-1 occurred in 11/15 PEL whereas EBV type-2 occurred in 4/15 cases. Despite a high degree of genetic variability of the virus in different PEL cases, each single PEL harbored only one EBV variant, consistent with monoclonality of infection and suggesting that infection preceded clonal expansion. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) individual PEL cases consistently harbor a single EBV strain; (2) EBNA-1 displays a high degree of heterogeneity in different PEL cases; (3) no specific EBV genotype preferentially associates with PEL.","['Fassone, L', 'Bhatia, K', 'Gutierrez, M', 'Capello, D', 'Gloghini, A', 'Dolcetti, R', 'Vivenza, D', 'Ascoli, V', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Pagani, L', 'Dotti, G', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Raphael, M', 'Tirelli, U', 'Saglio, G', 'Magrath, I T', 'Carbone, A', 'Gaidano, G']","['Fassone L', 'Bhatia K', 'Gutierrez M', 'Capello D', 'Gloghini A', 'Dolcetti R', 'Vivenza D', 'Ascoli V', 'Lo Coco F', 'Pagani L', 'Dotti G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Raphael M', 'Tirelli U', 'Saglio G', 'Magrath IT', 'Carbone A', 'Gaidano G']","['Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Medical Sciences, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (EBNA-LP protein, Human herpesvirus 4)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*complications', '*Herpesvirus 8, Human/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/chemistry/*virology', 'Mutation', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis/chemistry']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Feb;14(2):271-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401651.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401651 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we addressed the possible mechanisms underlying these two different effects. 1.0 microM As2O3-induced apoptosis was associated with condensation of the mitochondrial matrix, disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potentials (DeltaPsim) and activation of caspase-3 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells regardless of their sensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). All these effects were inhibited by dithiothreitol (DTT) and enhanced by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Furthermore, BSO could also render HL60 and U937 cells, which had the higher cellular catalase activity, sensitive to As2O3-induced apoptosis. Surprisingly, 1.0 microM As2O3 did not induce the DeltaPsim collapse and apoptosis, while 0.1 microM As2O3 induced partial differentiation of fresh BM cells from a de novo APL patient. In this study, we also showed that 0.2 mM DTT did not block low-dose As2O3-induced NB4 cell differentiation, and 0. 10.5 microM As2O3 did not induce differentiation of ATRA-resistant NB4-derived sublines, which were confirmed by cytomorphology, expression of CD11b, CD33 and CD14 as well as NBT reduction. Another interesting finding was that 0.10.5 microM As2O3 could also induce differentiation-related changes in ATRA-sensitive HL60 cells. However, the differentiation-inducing effect could not be seen in ATRA-resistant HL60 sublines with RARalpha mutation. Moreover, low-dose As2O3 and ATRA yielded similar gene expression profiles in APL cells. These results encouraged us to hypothesize that As2O3 induces APL cell differentiation through direct or indirect activation of retinoic acid receptor-related signaling pathway(s), while DeltaPsim collapse is the common mechanism of As2O3-induced apoptosis.","['Cai, X', 'Shen, Y L', 'Zhu, Q', 'Jia, P M', 'Yu, Y', 'Zhou, L', 'Huang, Y', 'Zhang, J W', 'Xiong, S M', 'Chen, S J', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Chen, Z', 'Chen, G Q']","['Cai X', 'Shen YL', 'Zhu Q', 'Jia PM', 'Yu Y', 'Zhou L', 'Huang Y', 'Zhang JW', 'Xiong SM', 'Chen SJ', 'Wang ZY', 'Chen Z', 'Chen GQ']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, 197 Rui-Jin Road II, Shanghai, 200025, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Feb;14(2):262-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401650.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401650 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been supported by works reporting that in vitro ATRA resistance is characterized by defects in the RARA/E-domain of PML/RARA. In the present report, we identified a new mutation in the E domain of PML/RARA which is associated with a RA-resistant subline of NB4 cells; NB4-R2. This mutation, identical to the Gln411 mutation found in HL60-R, changes the amino acid Gln903 to an in-phase stop codon, generating a truncated form of PML/RARA which has lost 52 amino acids at its C-terminal end. We have studied the effect of the truncated PML/RARA protein on PML NB formation and RARA and PML/RARA transcriptional activity. We show here that the fusion mutant exerts a dominant negative effect on wild-type PML, PML/RARA and RARA transcription activity. These findings highlight the important role of the RARA E-domain of PML/RARA in mediating RA sensitivity in APL cells.","['Duprez, E', 'Benoit, G', 'Flexor, M', 'Lillehaug, J R', 'Lanotte, M']","['Duprez E', 'Benoit G', 'Flexor M', 'Lillehaug JR', 'Lanotte M']","['INSERM U-496, Centre G Hayem, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Codon/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Luciferases/analysis', 'Microscopy, Confocal', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Feb;14(2):255-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401683.,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401683 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, five of six patients are alive with a median follow-up time of 24 months (range 15-60) post-SCT. All patients experienced acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease and responded clinically to SCT. All patients were MRD positive after SCT, which correlated to mixed chimerism within the CD19+ cell fraction in all samples except one (25/26). High levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) indicated advanced disease, and patients with increased levels pre- and post-SCT were also those with the most long-lasting PCR-detectable MRD post-SCT. Hence, a high tumor burden pre-SCT may reflect the long duration of detectable MRD in patients with B-CLL after SCT.

The risk factors for treatment-related myeloid leukemia remain incompletely defined. Genetic deficiencies in glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities have been linked to higher frequencies of a number of human malignancies. Our objective was to determine whether the null genotype for GSTM1, GSTT1, or both, was more frequent in children with ALL who developed treatment-related myeloid malignancies as compared to those who did not. A PCR technique was used to assay for the null genotype for GSTM1 and GSTT1 in 302 children with ALL, 57 of whom also subsequently developed treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Among children with ALL who did not develop treatment-related myeloid malignancies, the frequencies of GSTM1 and GSTT1 wild-type, GSTM1 null-GSTT1 wild-type, GSTM1 wild-type-GSTT1 null, and GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes were 40%, 42%, 9% and 9%, respectively. The corresponding frequencies for patients who developed acute myeloid malignancies were 42%, 32%, 11% and 16%, respectively (P = 0.26). A statistically significant increase in the frequency of the GST null genotype was observed in male patients who developed myeloid malignancies as compared to male ALL control patients (P = 0.036), but was not observed in female patients (P = 0.51). Moreover, a logistic regression analysis of possible predictors for myeloid malignancies, controlling for gender and race, did not reveal an association of GSTM1 or GSTT1 null genotypes (P = 0.62 and 0.11, respectively) with treatment-related malignancies.

In addition, IL-10 is a strong endogenous anti-inflammatory cytokine. To investigate the role of IL-10 in the induction of acute GVHD following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) we performed a prospective study on spontaneous IL-10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) in 84 patients admitted for allogeneic BMT. High spontaneous IL-10 production by PBMNC at the time of admission and prior to any preparative treatment correlated with a subsequent low incidence of GVHD and transplant-related mortality (8%), as compared to patients with low or intermediate IL-10 production (50%, P < 0. 01). Our data demonstrate the prognostic significance of increased IL-10 production in BMT patients and suggest a major role of IL-10 in maintaining immunobalance in the setting of allogeneic BMT.

Results were compared with local data on 463 healthy controls and 95 survivors of childhood ALL treated without BMT. Adjusted for sex and age, the mean whole-body bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral areal density were significantly less than in healthy controls (0.8 and 0.5 s.d. less than predicted). The reduced BMC was caused by a significantly reduced height for age, whereas bone area for height and BMC for bone area were similar to controls. Less bone mass tended to be related to additional cranial irradiation and age above 20 years at follow-up. Controlled for this, the whole-body bone mass seemed to be unrelated to previous chemotherapy and endocrine status at follow-up and tended to be only marginally less in BMT patients than in ALL survivors treated without BMT. In conclusion, 8 years after allogeneic BMT for childhood leukaemia or lymphoma, the whole-body bone mass was only slightly reduced and the size-adjusted bone mass (BMC for bone area) was normal.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1981 to 1994, 4,061 white, 518 AA, and 507 SS children aged 1 to 20 years were treated on three successive Pediatric Oncology Group multicenter randomized clinical trials. RESULTS: AA and SS patients were more likely to have adverse prognostic features at diagnosis and lower survival than were white patients. The 5-year cumulative survival rates were (probability +/- SE) 81.9% +/- 0.6%, 68.6% +/- 2.1%, and 74.9% +/- 2.0% for white, AA, and SS children, respectively. Adjusting for age, leukocyte count, sex, era of treatment, and leukemia blast cell ploidy, we found that AA children had a 42% excess mortality rate compared with white children (proportional hazards ratio [PHR] = 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12 to 1. 80), and SS children had a 33% excess mortality rate compared with white children (PHR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.49). CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation, tumor biology, and deviations from prescribed therapy did not explain the differences in survival and event-free survival that we observed, although differences seem to be diminishing over time with improvements in therapy. The disparity in outcome for AA and SS children is most likely related to variations in chemotherapeutic response to therapy and not to compliance. Further improvements in outcome may require individualized dosing based on specific pharmacogenetic profiles, especially for AA and SS children.","['Pollock, B H', 'DeBaun, M R', 'Camitta, B M', 'Shuster, J J', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Pullen, D J', 'Land, V J', 'Mahoney, D H Jr', 'Lauer, S J', 'Murphy, S B']","['Pollock BH', 'DeBaun MR', 'Camitta BM', 'Shuster JJ', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Pullen DJ', 'Land VJ', 'Mahoney DH Jr', 'Lauer SJ', 'Murphy SB']","['University of Florida, and Pediatric Oncology Group Statistical Office, Gainesville, FL, USA. brad@pog.ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans', 'Age Factors', '*Blacks', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology', '*Whites']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Feb;18(4):813-23. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.4.813.,,['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.4.813 [doi]'],,"['CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['J Clin Oncol. 2000 Jun;18(11):2349-51.

However, larger prospective studies with interlaboratory quality control may be important to investigate more precisely the clinical usefulness of studying minimal residual disease with RT-PCR in t(8;21) AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 223 marrow samples from 51 patients with t(8;21) AML diagnosed in five centers and tested all samples by two different RT-PCR techniques (a nested technique and a one-step technique, with a sensitivity of 10(-6) and 10(-5), respectively) in two different laboratories. RESULTS: Samples from 14 patients in long persistent CR (median follow-up duration, 112 months) were taken at least twice, and all were PCR-negative by both techniques. Samples were prospectively taken from 37 patients after achievement of first CR and/or second CR, before intensive consolidation treatment, and every 3 to 6 months after completion of therapy. Patients who converted to PCR negativity with the one-step technique (60%) or both techniques (48%) after CR achievement had a longer CR duration than those with persistently positive PCR results (two-sided log-rank test, P =.0001). Patients who became PCR-negative with the one-step technique before intensive consolidation (23%) had a lower relapse rate (11% v 72%) and a longer CR duration than those who remained persistently PCR-positive at that point (two-sided log-rank test, P =.0015). CONCLUSION: Patients with AML with t(8;21) in long-term remission were all PCR-negative. In prospectively studied patients, a good correlation was found between negative PCR results and absence of relapse. Early negative results with the one-step RT-PCR technique, before consolidation treatment, seemed to carry an especially good prognosis, suggesting that RT-PCR analysis could help in choosing the type of consolidation therapy in patients with t(8;21) AML.","['Morschhauser, F', 'Cayuela, J M', 'Martini, S', 'Baruchel, A', 'Rousselot, P', 'Socie, G', 'Berthou, P', 'Jouet, J P', 'Straetmans, N', 'Sigaux, F', 'Fenaux, P', 'Preudhomme, C']","['Morschhauser F', 'Cayuela JM', 'Martini S', 'Baruchel A', 'Rousselot P', 'Socie G', 'Berthou P', 'Jouet JP', 'Straetmans N', 'Sigaux F', 'Fenaux P', 'Preudhomme C']","[""Service des Maladies du Sang and Laboratoire d'H inverted question markematologie A, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, and Unite L'Institut National de la Sant inverted question marke et de la Recherche M inverted question markedicale (INSERM) U524, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/therapy', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Feb;18(4):788-94. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.4.788.,,['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.4.788 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-four patients who were in CR after induction treatment were randomly assigned to receive G-CSF (100 patients) or no G-CSF (94 patients) after two courses of ICC (ICC 1, high-dose cytarabine plus mitoxantrone; ICC 2, amsacrine plus etoposide). G-CSF (filgrastim) was administered from the day after chemotherapy until granulocyte recovery at a daily dose of 5 microg/kg. RESULTS: In the G-CSF group, the median duration of neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10(9)/L) was dramatically reduced, both after ICC 1 (12 v 19 days, P <.001) and after ICC 2 (20 v 28 days, P <.001). The median duration of hospitalization was also significantly shorter in the G-CSF group (24 v 27 days after ICC 1, P <.001; 29 v 34 days after ICC 2, P <. 001). The median duration of intravenous antibiotics was significantly reduced after ICC 1 and ICC 2, and the median duration of antifungal therapy was significantly reduced after ICC 1. However, the incidence of microbiologically documented infections, the toxic death rate, the 2-year disease-free survival, and the 2-year overall survival were not affected by G-CSF administration. Moreover, the median interval between ICC1 and ICC2 was reduced by only 2 days, and the number of patients undergoing ICC2 was not increased in the G-CSF arm. CONCLUSION: G-CSF should be administered routinely after ICC to reduce the duration of neutropenia and hospitalization. However, G-CSF did not seem to significantly increase the feasibility of this two-course program or modify overall outcome.","['Harousseau, J L', 'Witz, B', 'Lioure, B', 'Hunault-Berger, M', 'Desablens, B', 'Delain, M', 'Guilhot, F', 'Le Prise, P Y', 'Abgrall, J F', 'Deconinck, E', 'Guyotat, D', 'Vilque, J P', 'Casassus, P', 'Tournilhac, O', 'Audhuy, B', 'Solary, E']","['Harousseau JL', 'Witz B', 'Lioure B', 'Hunault-Berger M', 'Desablens B', 'Delain M', 'Guilhot F', 'Le Prise PY', 'Abgrall JF', 'Deconinck E', 'Guyotat D', 'Vilque JP', 'Casassus P', 'Tournilhac O', 'Audhuy B', 'Solary E']","['Departments of Hematology of University Hospital, Nantes, France. jlharousseau@sante.univ_nantes.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neutropenia/prevention & control', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Feb;18(4):780-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.4.780.,,['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.4.780 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 1995 to July 1998, 199 patients aged 25 to 65 years (median, 54 years) with newly diagnosed stages II to IV indolent or mantle-cell lymphomas (standard risk according to the International Prognostic Index) were enrolled onto a multicenter, 1:1 randomized study. Of the 199 patients who were able to be assessed, 101 were assigned to the FLU group (six monthly cycles of FLU 25 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 through 5) and 98 to the FLU-ID group (six monthly cycles of FLU 25 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 through 3 and idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) on day 1). RESULTS: In the FLU group, complete response (CR) and partial response rates were 47% and 37%, respectively, whereas in the FLU-ID group, they were 39% and 42%, respectively. In-depth analysis of the CR rate with respect to histologic type showed that FLU seemed to be superior to FLU-ID in treating follicular lymphomas (60% v 40%, respectively), whereas FLU-ID seemed to be more effective than FLU in treating nonfollicular lymphomas (small lymphocytic, 43% v 29%, respectively; immunocytoma, 38% v 23%, respectively; P = not significant), excluding the mantle-cell subset (in which there was no difference between the two groups). No striking differences were observed between the two protocols in terms of overall response or toxicity, which was generally mild. However, with a median follow-up of 19 months, only 29 patients (62%) who received FLU alone have maintained their initial CR, compared with 32 (84%) of those who received FLU-ID therapy (P =.021). CONCLUSION: Although the FLU-ID regimen may not significantly improve the induction of CR in most indolent-lymphoma patients, our preliminary data do suggest that, with respect to FLU alone, it may be capable of conferring a longer-lasting CR and that it might be superior in terms of CR rate in small lymphocytic and immunocytoma subtypes.","['Zinzani, P L', 'Magagnoli, M', 'Moretti, L', 'De Renzo, A', 'Battista, R', 'Zaccaria, A', 'Guardigni, L', 'Mazza, P', 'Marra, R', 'Ronconi, F', 'Lauta, V M', 'Bendandi, M', 'Gherlinzoni, F', 'Gentilini, P', 'Ciccone, F', 'Cellini, C', 'Stefoni, V', 'Ricciuti, F', 'Gobbi, M', 'Tura, S']","['Zinzani PL', 'Magagnoli M', 'Moretti L', 'De Renzo A', 'Battista R', 'Zaccaria A', 'Guardigni L', 'Mazza P', 'Marra R', 'Ronconi F', 'Lauta VM', 'Bendandi M', 'Gherlinzoni F', 'Gentilini P', 'Ciccone F', 'Cellini C', 'Stefoni V', 'Ricciuti F', 'Gobbi M', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology and University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. plzinzo@med.unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Linear Models', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Feb;18(4):773-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.4.773.,,['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.4.773 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, rapid gene repression is either less common or less well studied. To study rapid gene repression during cytokine-initiated differentiation programs, we used the mRNA subtractive hybridization technique of representational difference analysis to isolate repressed genes. Cultures of the myeloid leukemia cell line M1 were induced to terminally differentiate by treatment with interleukin-6 (IL-6). The repressed genes identified in our subtraction products include the genes encoding the growth factor receptor Flt3/Flk2/STK-1 (CD135) and the costimulatory protein CD24 [heat-stable antigen] and the c-myb oncogene. Following 4 h of IL-6 treatment, mRNA levels of these genes are decreased by 45-65% relative to controls and after 8 h by 65-80%. Lipopolysaccharide also triggers the repression of these genes. Protein synthesis inhibitors do not block the IL-6-stimulated repression of c-myb, or c-myc, mRNA, yet they do block the repression of flt3 and CD24 mRNA, demonstrating the existence of both protein synthesis-independent and -dependent mechanisms of cytokine-triggered rapid gene repression during differentiation.","['Graeber, T G', 'Shuai, K']","['Graeber TG', 'Shuai K']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California, 90095-1678, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics', 'CD24 Antigen', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', '*Genes, myb', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2000/02/16 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/16 09:00'],"['2000/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 Jan 27;267(3):863-9. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.2041.,,"['10.1006/bbrc.1999.2041 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(99)92041-7 [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],"['2 T32 CA09120-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI39612/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI43438/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genomic clones from the interval were used to isolate candidate transcripts. One novel transcript had strong homology to a septin family of GTPase genes involved in cytokinesis. This gene was recently identified as a myeloid/lymphoid leukemia (MLL) fusion protein partner in acute myeloid leukemia and was named MSF (MLL septin-like fusion). As this gene may play roles in both leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis, it is essential to understand its structure and normal expression. We cloned two human alternative transcripts and identified a third database variant of MSF. RNA expression studies with a probe common to the three novel sequences showed differential expression of 4.0- and 3.0-kb transcripts in all adult and fetal tissues tested. A probe spanning sequence unique to one MSF variant detected specific expression of the 4.0-kb transcript in all tissues. Another probe unique to a different MSF variant detected a 4.0-kb transcript only in skeletal muscle. Proteins of 422 and 586 amino acids were predicted from the novel alternate transcripts and included both a xylose isomerase 1 domain and a GTPase domain.

This important physiological event is reflected in vitro by homotypic cell aggregation. We have previously reported that a 120 kDa cell surface glycoprotein, JL1, is a unique protein specifically expressed by immature double positive (DP) human thymocytes which are in the process of positive and negative selections through the interaction between thymocyte and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The function of the JL1 molecule, however, is yet to be identified. We show here that anti-JL1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) induced the homotypic aggregation of human thymocytes in a temperature- and Mg2+-dependent manner. It required an intact cytoskeleton and the interaction between leucocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) since it was blocked by cytochalasin B and D, and mAb against LFA-1 and ICAM-1 which are known to be involved in the aggregation of thymocytes. Translocation of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) through the cell membrane was not detected, implying that the molecular mechanism of JL-1-induced homotypic aggregation is different from that of CD99-induced homotypic aggregation.

We have used cell-free extracts prepared from undifferentiated and differentiated U937 cells to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this inhibitory process. Our analysis indicates that the activity of the TATA binding protein (TBP)/TBP-associated factor (TAF) complex selectivity factor 1 (SL1), one of the factors required for accurate and promoter-specific transcription by RNA pol I, is severely repressed in differentiated U937 cells. Moreover, the reduction in SL1 activity is not a consequence of a decrease in SL1, because there is no detectable difference in the abundance of TBP or TAFs before and after U937 cell differentiation. In conclusion, our results indicate that the selectivity factor SL1 is an important target for the regulation of pol I transcription during cell differentiation.","['Comai, L', 'Song, Y', 'Tan, C', 'Bui, T']","['Comai L', 'Song Y', 'Tan C', 'Bui T']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology and K.

Analysis of the abundance of sequence motifs significant for eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication origin (ori) regions (and their initiation zones) has shown that these DNAs are reminiscent of cell DNA fragments enriched in ori sequences (Rao et al., 1990) and/or sequence features of several eukaryotic chromosomal oris containing clusters of modular sequence elements (Dobbs et al., 1994). Accordingly, these DNAs, with an (A + T) content prevalently higher than that of the total cell DNA, revealed the presence of asymmetrically distributed (A + T)-rich stretches, scaffold attachment region (SAR) T consensuses, polypyrimidine nucleotide (poly(Py)) tracts and minimal Saccharomyces cerevisiae autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) consensus, in abundance comparable with that of these sequences of DNA fragments enriched in oris. All these DNAs were found to be enriched also in sequence elements held as primase (Pr) attachment sites. Moreover, DNAs of POMS component B and those of AMV DNA were found to be enriched in the asymmetric pyrimidine (Py) heptanucleotide motif of Waltz et al. (1996) occurring in the initiation zones of ori region. Consequently, these extrachromosomal DNAs, portion of which represents a precursor of AMV DNA, seem to descent from initiation zones of various ori regions of an early replicating chromosomal myeloblast DNA. In addition, a possible explanation of the inclination of these DNAs to form multimers is presented.","['Pajer, P', 'Riman, J', 'Dvorak, M']","['Pajer P', 'Riman J', 'Dvorak M']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Acta Virol,Acta virologica,0370401,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/*genetics', 'Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Chickens', 'Chromosomes/chemistry/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/*genetics', 'Deoxyadenosines/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleoproteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Replication Origin/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Thymidine/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Core Proteins/chemistry/*genetics']",,2000/02/15 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/02/15 09:00'],"['2000/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Virol. 1999 Feb;43(1):5-18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: For each antibody synthetic recombinant protein and conventional murine hybridoma technology was employed. Monoclonal antibodies effective in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were successfully generated, designated NCL-CD5-4C7, NCL-CD10-270 and NCL-CD23-1B12, respectively. A series of 58 cases of small B-cell lymphoma including examples of each subtype (lymphocytic, follicle centre cell, mantle cell, marginal zone and lymphoplasmacytoid) was assembled and immunostaining for the respective antigens carried out using the monoclonal antibodies produced.

AF-4 breakpoints occur in introns, but most AF-4 introns are uncharacterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: We cloned AF-4 intron 4 and examined the frequency of breakpoints in this intron. The 5.8-kb intron is rich in repeat sequences and was the site of translocation in 3 of 17 leukemias with t(4;11). We cloned the der (11) and der (4) breakpoints and isolated the fusion transcripts in the cell line MV4-11 and in a de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Both translocations joined MLL intron 6 and AF-4 intron 4. In MV4-11, 249 bases from AF-4 were present in both derivative chromosomes, indicating duplication. In the de novo ALL, duplication of 446 bases from MLL and AF-4 occurred. Reciprocal fusion transcripts were expressed. CONCLUSIONS: Intronic sequence of AF-4 is useful for molecular diagnosis of t(4;11). Duplicated intronic regions suggest staggered chromosomal breakage.","['Felix, C A', 'Hosler, M R', 'Slater, D J', 'Megonigal, M D', 'Lovett, B D', 'Williams, T M', 'Nowell, P C', 'Spinner, N B', 'Owens, N L', 'Hoxie, J', 'Croce, C M', 'Lange, B J', 'Rappaport, E F']","['Felix CA', 'Hosler MR', 'Slater DJ', 'Megonigal MD', 'Lovett BD', 'Williams TM', 'Nowell PC', 'Spinner NB', 'Owens NL', 'Hoxie J', 'Croce CM', 'Lange BJ', 'Rappaport EF']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-4318, USA. felix@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Diagn,Molecular diagnosis : a journal devoted to the understanding of human disease through the clinical application of molecular biology,9614965,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alu Elements', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*genetics', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Introns', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/15 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/02/15 09:00'],"['2000/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn. 1999 Dec;4(4):269-83. doi: 10.1016/s1084-8592(99)80002-2.,,"['10.1016/s1084-8592(99)80002-2 [doi]', '00400269 [pii]']",,"['1R29CA66140-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1CA77683-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1CA80175-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,"['GENBANK/AF177230', 'GENBANK/AF177239']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here the characterization of a novel cellular factor sharing homology with the specific cysteine-rich C-terminal domain of the basic helix-loop-helix repressor protein I-mfa. The synthesis of this new factor, called HIC for Human I-mfa domain-Containing protein, is controlled at the translational level by two different codons, an ATG and an upstream non-ATG translational initiator, allowing the production of two protein isoforms, p32 and p40, respectively. We show that the HIC protein isoforms present different subcellular localizations, p32 being mainly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, whereas p40 is targeted to the nucleolus. Moreover, in trying to understand the function of HIC, we have found that both isoforms stimulate in T-cells the expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the human T-cell leukemia virus type I-long terminal repeat in the presence of the viral transactivator Tax. We demonstrate by mutagenesis that the I-mfa-like domain of HIC is involved in this regulation. Finally, we also show that HIC is able to down-regulate the luciferase expression from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1-long terminal repeat induced by the viral transactivator Tat. From these results, we propose that HIC and I-mfa represent two members of a new family of proteins regulating gene expression and characterized by a particular cysteine-rich C-terminal domain.","['Thebault, S', 'Gachon, F', 'Lemasson, I', 'Devaux, C', 'Mesnard, J M']","['Thebault S', 'Gachon F', 'Lemasson I', 'Devaux C', 'Mesnard JM']","['Institut de Biologie, Laboratoire Infections Retrovirales et Signalisation Cellulaire, CRBM-CNRS UPR 1086, 4 Boulevard Henri IV, 34060 Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '183511-66-2 (MDFI protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*genetics', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,2000/02/15 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/02/15 09:00'],"['2000/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Feb 18;275(7):4848-57. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.7.4848.,,"['10.1074/jbc.275.7.4848 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)30697-5 [pii]']",,,,,['GENBANK/AF054589'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The AS oligos were covalently closed to avoid exonuclease activities by enzymatic ligation of two identical molecules. The AS oligos of a ribbon type (RiAS oligos) consist of two loops containing multiple antisense sequences and a stem connecting the two loops. Three antisense sequences targeting different binding sites were placed in a loop that was designed to form a minimal secondary structure by itself. RiAS oligos were found to be stable because they largely preserved their structural integrity after 24 h incubation in the presence of either exonuclease III or serums. When a human promyelocytic cell line, HL-60, was treated with RiAS oligos to c-myb, c-myb expression was effectively ablated. Cell growth was inhibited by >90% determined by both the 3-[4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. Further, when the leukemic cell line K562 was treated with c-myb RiAS oligos, colony formation on soft agarose was reduced by 92 +/- 2%.

The two cytokines bind with high affinity to the same receptor (LIF/OSM receptor), which consists of the LIF receptor alpha chain (LIFRalpha) and the signal transduction unit gp130. A soluble form of the beta chain of the receptor complex called soluble gp130 (sgp130) has been cloned. In this study, we sought to determine whether recombinant sgp130 or anti-gp130 Ab could attenuate the resorption of proteoglycans induced by OSM and LIF in articular cartilage explants. The results show that at high concentrations sgp130 is capable of attenuating both LIF and OSM mediated resorption. In contrast, anti-gp130 Ab selectively inhibited the stimulation of proteoglycan (PG) release by OSM, albeit minimally. The failure of anti-gp130 to attenuate LIF stimulated PG resorption may be due to the normal interaction of LIF with LIFRalpha and unfettered heterodimerization of LIFRalpha with gp130 in the presence of the antibody. The results indicate that sgp130 and anti-gp130 can modulate cartilage PG metabolism in vitro. Whether sgp130 may have therapeutic activity in models of arthritis or indeed in arthritic diseases remains to be determined.","['Hui, W', 'Bell, M', 'Carroll, G']","['Hui W', 'Bell M', 'Carroll G']","['University Department of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*pharmacology', 'Cartilage, Articular/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Proteoglycans/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Swine']",,2000/02/15 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/02/15 09:00'],"['2000/02/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2000 Feb;12(2):151-5. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1999.0550.,,"['10.1006/cyto.1999.0550 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(99)90550-1 [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their differentiation and proliferation processes are under the influence of cytokines, including one of utmost importance known as stem cell factor (SCF). SCF receptor is encoded by the protooncogene c-kit, belongs to the type III receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily, and is also expressed on other hematopoietic or non-hematopoietic cells. Ligation of c-kit receptor by SCF induces its dimerization, followed by induction of multiple intracellular signaling pathways leading to cell proliferation and activation. Mastocytosis, a relatively rare group of diseases characterized by accumulation of MC in various tissues, are found isolated or sometimes associated with other hematological malignancies in humans. Although the initial events leading to mastocytosis are not yet unraveled, alterations of the c-kit gene have been described. Particularly interesting are acquired mutations resulting in a constitutively activated receptor, possibly involved in the increased numbers of MC in tissues.

A small, but significant, increase in the risk for AML was seen, however, among offspring of veterans who had served in Vietnam or Cambodia (odds ratio (OR) = 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 2.9), after adjustment for paternal education, race, income, smoking, X-ray exposure, and marijuana use. The risk was predominantly present in children diagnosed before the age of 2 (OR = 4.6; 95% CI: 1.3, 16.1), although there were inconsistencies in the risks associated with length of time served and interval between service and diagnosis of leukemia.

A lymphoid malignancy similar to Human T-PLL occurred in to independent transgenic lines with a high level of expression of the transgene. The cumulative incidence of the disease at 20 months was 100% and 50% respectively, and null in the control group. The oncogenic role of MTCP1 is demonstrated, and the p13(MTCP1) and p14(TCL1) proteins form a new oncoprotein family.

In addition to localizing diffusely throughout the nucleoplasm, PML mainly resides in discrete nuclear structures known as PML oncogenic domains (PODs), which are disrupted in APL and spinocellular ataxia cells. We isolated the Fas-binding protein Daxx as a PML-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses reveal that Daxx is a nuclear protein that interacts and colocalizes with PML in the PODs. Reporter gene assay shows that Daxx drastically represses basal transcription, likely by recruiting histone deacetylases. PML, but not its oncogenic fusion PML-RARalpha, inhibits the repressor function of Daxx. In addition, SUMO-1 modification of PML is required for sequestration of Daxx to the PODs and for efficient inhibition of Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression. Consistently, Daxx is found at condensed chromatin in cells that lack PML. These data suggest that Daxx is a novel nuclear protein bearing transcriptional repressor activity that may be regulated by interaction with PML.","['Li, H', 'Leo, C', 'Zhu, J', 'Wu, X', ""O'Neil, J"", 'Park, E J', 'Chen, J D']","['Li H', 'Leo C', 'Zhu J', 'Wu X', ""O'Neil J"", 'Park EJ', 'Chen JD']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Molecular Toxicology and Cell Biology, Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01655, USA. don.chen@umassmed.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/02/12 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/12 09:00'],"['2000/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Mar;20(5):1784-96. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.5.1784-1796.2000.,,['10.1128/MCB.20.5.1784-1796.2000 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC85360,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is known to induce a variety of genes whose function is relevant to activated macrophages. Flt-1, a receptor tyrosine kinase for vascular endothelial growth factor, is expressed in macrophages as well as in endothelial cells and mediates the biological response to vascular endothelial growth factor. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inducible expression of the flt-1 gene during the activation of THP-1 cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that exposure of THP-1 cells to PMA increases flt-1 mRNA and protein levels. A transfected reporter gene, consisting of the human flt-1 promoter region coupled to the luciferase gene, indicated a direct effect of PMA on transcriptional activity. Transfection analysis of a series of 5'-deletion constructs and site-directed mutants localized the PMA-responsive region to a DNA stretch from -174 to -166, which represents overlapping Egr-1/Sp1 transcription factor-binding sites. Competitive gel mobility shift assays and supershift assays showed that PMA induces the binding of Egr-1 to this site. Consistent with these findings, the Egr-1 expression plasmid strongly induced flt-1 promoter activity in a sequence-specific manner. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PMA induces flt-1 gene transcription through an induction of Egr-1 in THP-1 cells, thus providing new evidence that the flt-1 gene is a direct target of Egr-1, the transcription factor primarily induced on macrophage differentiation.","['Akuzawa, N', 'Kurabayashi, M', 'Ohyama, Y', 'Arai, M', 'Nagai, R']","['Akuzawa N', 'Kurabayashi M', 'Ohyama Y', 'Arai M', 'Nagai R']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Gunma University School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Macrophages/*cytology/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1']",,2000/02/17 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/17 09:00'],"['2000/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2000 Feb;20(2):377-84. doi: 10.1161/01.atv.20.2.377.,,['10.1161/01.atv.20.2.377 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monomeric protein consists of independently folded N- and C-terminal domains that comprise residues Leu14-Leu146 and Ala150-Gln226, respectively. The domains exhibit different rotational correlation times (16.6(+/-0.1) ns and 12.6(+/-0.1) ns, respectively), are connected by a flexible linker (Ala147-Pro149), and do not give rise to inter-domain NOE values, indicating that they are dynamically independent. Despite limited sequence similarity, the structure of the Rous sarcoma virus capsid protein is similar to the structures determined recently for the capsid proteins of retroviruses belonging to the lentivirus and human T-cell leukemia virus/bovine leukemia virus genera. Structural differences that exist in the C-terminal domain of Rous sarcoma virus capsid relative to the other capsid proteins appear to be related to the occurrence of conserved cysteine residues. Whereas most genera of retroviruses contain a pair of conserved and essential cysteine residues in the C-terminal domain that appear to function by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond during assembly, the Rous sarcoma virus capsid protein does not. Instead, the Rous sarcoma virus capsid protein contains a single cysteine residue that appears to be conserved among the avian C-type retroviruses and is positioned in a manner that might allow the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond during capsid assembly.","['Campos-Olivas, R', 'Newman, J L', 'Summers, M F']","['Campos-Olivas R', 'Newman JL', 'Summers MF']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Chemistry, University of Maryland Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD, 21250, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/*chemistry', 'Capsid/*chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics', 'Cysteine/genetics/metabolism', 'Diffusion', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*chemistry', 'Rotation', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Solutions']",,2000/02/12 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/02/12 09:00'],"['2000/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/12 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2000 Feb 18;296(2):633-49. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1999.3475.,,"['10.1006/jmbi.1999.3475 [doi]', 'S0022-2836(99)93475-7 [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],['AI30917/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,['PDB/1D1D'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have also determined the crystal structure at 3.0 A resolution of the fragment complexed to DNA with a single-stranded template overhang resembling a template-primer substrate. Protein-DNA interactions, which are nearly identical in each of the three lattices, involve four conserved residues in the fingers domain, Asp114, Arg116, Asn119 and Gly191. DNA atoms involved in the interactions include the 3'-OH group from the primer strand and minor groove base atoms and sugar atoms from the n-2 and n-3 positions of the template strand, where n is the template base that would pair with an incoming nucleotide. The single-stranded template overhang adopts two different conformations in the asymmetric unit interacting with residues in the beta4-beta5 loop (beta3-beta4 in HIV-1 RT). Our fragment-DNA complexes are distinct from previously reported complexes of DNA bound to HIV-1 RT but related in the types of interactions formed between protein and DNA. In addition, the DNA in all of these complexes is bound in the same cleft of the enzyme. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we have substituted residues that are involved in binding DNA in our crystal structures and have characterized the resulting enzymes.

TTI Study Group.,403-6,"OBJECTIVES: To follow up recipients of 20 000 units of blood to identify any transmissions of infections through blood transfusion. DESIGN: Follow up study of recipients of transfusion. SETTING: 22 hospitals in north London. PARTICIPANT: Adult patients who had recently been transfused. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients had further blood samples taken at 9 months that were tested for markers of hepatitis B and C and HIV and human T cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus type I or II (HTLV) infections. Recent infections were distinguished from pre-existing infections by comparison with blood samples taken before transfusion. RESULTS: 9220 patients were recruited, and 5579 recipients of 21 923 units of blood were followed up. No transfusion transmitted infections were identified. The incidence of transfusion transmitted infections was 0 in 21 043 units (95% confidence interval for risk 0 to 1 in 5706 recipients) for hepatitis B; 0 in 21 800 units (0 to 1 in 5911 recipients) for hepatitis C; 0 in 21 923 units (0 to 1 in 5944 recipients) for HIV; and 0 in 21 902 units (0 to 1 in 5939 recipients) for human T cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus. Three patients acquired hepatitis B during or after hospital admission but not through transfusion; 176 (3%) had pre-existing hepatitis B infection.

It is increased by a long-term survival of functional graft requiring long-term immunosuppressive therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 1972, 620 renal transplantations have been performed for different causes of end stage renal disease. The authors report a group of 18 renal transplant patients (2.9%) who had cancer. Patients with malignancies are reviewed according to their age, sex, type of immunosuppression, interval between transplantation and the diagnosis of cancer, method of treatment and survival. RESULTS: All patients received cadaver kidneys, and secondary transplantation was performed in two patients. Five patients received conventional immunosuppression--azathioprine with prednisone, another 13 patients received cyclosporine with prednisone and/or azathioprine. In 13 males and 5 females (mean age 46.1 years) the malignant disease developed about 62.4 months after renal transplantation. Six patients had epithelial skin cancers (four of them had squamous cell carcinomas and two basal cell carcinomas). Two patients had breast cancer, colorectal carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer, respectively, one patient had gastric cancer, thyroid carcinoma, carcinoma of tonsilla, and monocytic leukaemia with blastic transformation, respectively. The average survival of patients with malignancies was 20.3 months. Of 17 patients with cancer, 13 underwent surgical treatment, four patients with advanced disease received radiotherapy, hormonal treatment or only symptomatic therapy. In one patient the malignant disease was only discovered at autopsy. Five patients died of progressive malignant disease, four of intercurrent disease. Nine (50%) patients are alive, with no evidence of disease (NED), 31.9 months in average following the diagnosis of malignancy. Three patients returned to dialysis treatment, other 6 patients live with well functioning graft. CONCLUSIONS: In patients surviving long time after kidney transplantation the possibility of development of malignant disease should be considered. Preventive evaluation should guarantee early detection of cancer. Appropriate treatment, without cessation of immunosuppressive therapy, is indicated with the intention to prolong the patients' life with a functional graft and without dialysis treatment.","['Ondrus, D', 'Pribylincova, V', 'Breza, J', 'Bujdak, P', 'Miklosi, M', 'Reznicek, J', 'Zvara, V']","['Ondrus D', 'Pribylincova V', 'Breza J', 'Bujdak P', 'Miklosi M', 'Reznicek J', 'Zvara V']","['Department of Urology, Comenius University Medical School, Slovak Postgraduate Academy of Medicine, Derer University Hospital, Bratislava.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Int Urol Nephrol,International urology and nephrology,0262521,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Incidence', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2000/02/11 09:00,2000/02/26 09:00,['2000/02/11 09:00'],"['2000/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Urol Nephrol. 1999;31(4):417-22. doi: 10.1023/a:1007194607496.,,['10.1023/a:1007194607496 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific IgG ELISA was the most sensitive test (83.5%) and the least sensitive tests were specific IgE ELISA (44.3%) and IEP (50.6%). The specificity obtained for all the serologic test was above 97% in all cases. The greatest number of false positives in all tests (except IEP) occurred in patients with Taenia saginata and Taenia solium cysticerci infestations and in patients with lymphoma and leukemia. Specific IgG ELISA demonstrated the highest negative predictive value (93.8%). No statistically significant differences (p > 0.050) were found in the sensitivity of the tests when patients with only one cyst and patients with various cysts were compared. Considering only the patients without relapse, the percentage of seropositive patients increased in all tests at 1 and 3 months after surgery. After that time the percentage of seropositive patients decreased. At 48 months after surgery all patients without relapse became negative in IEP, specific IgE ELISA, and specific IgM ELISA. The antibody titers in all seropositive patients increased during the 3 months after surgery. From these 3 months onward, antibody levels decreased in all serologic tests studied in the group of patients without relapse. The patients who had relapses during the first year after surgery presented persistently elevated antibody titers in all postoperative sera. The antibody titers of the patients who relapsed between the third and fourth years after surgery decreased progressively the third month after surgery, and increased in the serum obtained at the moment of relapse diagnosis. Our results show that persistence of elevated antibody titers in patients with pulmonary hydatidosis in the year after surgery or titer increase after a progressive decrease are indicative of relapse or reinfection.","['Zarzosa, M P', 'Orduna Domingo, A', 'Gutierrez, P', 'Alonso, P', 'Cuervo, M', 'Prado, A', 'Bratos, M A', 'Garcia-Yuste, M', 'Ramos, G', 'Rodriguez Torres, A']","['Zarzosa MP', 'Orduna Domingo A', 'Gutierrez P', 'Alonso P', 'Cuervo M', 'Prado A', 'Bratos MA', 'Garcia-Yuste M', 'Ramos G', 'Rodriguez Torres A']","['Departmento Microbiologia, Hospital Universitario, Facultad de Medicina, Valladolid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,Diagnostic microbiology and infectious disease,8305899,"['0 (Antibodies, Helminth)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Helminth/blood', 'Echinococcosis, Pulmonary/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Hemagglutination Tests', 'Humans', 'Immunoelectrophoresis', 'Latex Fixation Tests', 'Serologic Tests']",,2000/02/11 09:00,2000/02/26 09:00,['2000/02/11 09:00'],"['2000/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 1999 Dec;35(4):255-62. doi: 10.1016/s0732-8893(99)00079-6.,,"['S0732889399000796 [pii]', '10.1016/s0732-8893(99)00079-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antigenic stimulation using DNP-human serum albumin conjugate (DNP-HSA) induced concentration-dependent asynchronous Ca2+ oscillations, or irregular spikes. To achieve a quantitative comparison of the effects of different concentrations of antigen on changes in Ca2+[i, the area under the curve (AUC) of Ca2+ oscillations in each cell was calculated. The dose-response curve of the calculated AUC is consistent with the bell-shaped dose-response curve for antigen-induced mediator release, depolarization and 86Rb(+)-efflux. Ca2+ oscillations induced by antigenic stimulation were abolished by removal of external Ca2+ and the subsequent reintroduction of external Ca2+ caused their resumption. To investigate the role of Ca2+ oscillations in the secretory response, changes in [Ca2+]i induced by concanavalin A (Con-A), A23187, thapsigargin and NECA were also monitored. Con-A mimicked the response induced by antigen, whilst A23187 and thapsigargin induced a large transient non-oscillatory response. NECA, an adenosine receptor agonist, induced only a small transient rise in Ca2+[i without oscillatory behaviour. Since all these stimuli accept NECA-induced degranulation in these cells, it is suggested that, although Ca2+ oscillations are not essential for the initiation of secretion, they probably underlie the in-vivo physiological response of mast cells and basophils to an antigenic challenge. They also seem to enhance the efficacy of the Ca2+ signal.","['Narenjkar, J', 'Marsh, S J', 'Assem, E S']","['Narenjkar J', 'Marsh SJ', 'Assem ES']","['Department of Pharmacology, University College London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Calcium,Cell calcium,8006226,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin conjugate)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', ""35920-39-9 (Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide))"", '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)']",IM,"[""Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)/pharmacology"", 'Animals', 'Antigens/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', '*Calcium Signaling', 'Cell Polarity/drug effects', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/drug effects/metabolism', 'Rubidium/metabolism', 'Serum Albumin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/drug effects/metabolism']",,2000/02/11 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['2000/02/11 09:00'],"['2000/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Calcium. 1999 Dec;26(6):261-9. doi: 10.1054/ceca.1999.0065.,,"['S0143-4160(99)90065-9 [pii]', '10.1054/ceca.1999.0065 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although rare, acute spinal cord compression during childhood is a medical emergency because of the risk of neurological morbidity.

Katoh et al., Cancer Res., 55: 5687-5692, 1995). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibitory effect of VEGF, we attempted to identify a transcription factor involved in the cellular response to VEGF stimulation. We cloned the cDNA of a novel Kruppel-type zinc finger (ZNF) gene, ZK7, from a cDNA library constructed from the human leukemia cell line CMK86 after incubation with VEGF. This cDNA encoded a protein of 289 amino acids, which contained a Kruppel-associated box A-box domain at the NH2 terminus and seven ZNF motifs at the COOH terminus. These ZNF motifs were identical to those of HZF16 (M. Saleh et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet., 52: 192-203, 1993). ZK7 and HZF16 genes appear to be the splice variants transcribed from the same gene. Northern blotting and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that expression of ZK7 mRNA in CMK86 cells and human hematopoietic progenitor cells was increased after VEGF stimulation, whereas that of HZF16 mRNA remained unchanged. To examine the function of ZK7 protein, we generated clones of a human monocytoid leukemia cell line, U937, which were stably transfected with ZK7 or HZF16 cDNA. Importantly, ZK7-overexpressing cells had lower sensitivity to ionizing radiation and the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide than U937 parent cells or HZF16-overexpressing cells. Therefore, ZK7 protein may be involved in the inhibitory effect of VEGF on apoptotic cell death in human hematopoietic cells.","['Kuramoto, K', 'Uesaka, T', 'Kimura, A', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Watanabe, H', 'Katoh, O']","['Kuramoto K', 'Uesaka T', 'Kimura A', 'Kobayashi M', 'Watanabe H', 'Katoh O']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (ZNF136 protein, human)', '148733-47-5 (ZNF124 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Library', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",,2000/02/10 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/10 09:00'],"['2000/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Jan 15;60(2):425-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This region is highly homologous with that of the RB/p105 gene. In addition, we screened four primary Burkitt's lymphomas for genetic alterations in the RB2/p130 gene. Naturally occurring mutations, which disrupt the putative bipartite NLS, were found in lymphoma cell lines and primary tumors, but not in the osteosarcoma cell lines, where normal nuclear localization of the protein was detectable. Site-directed mutagenesis and transfection assay using NLS mutants displayed markedly reduced biological activity as measured by flow cytometric analysis. This study clearly describes RB2/ p130 as an important target for mutations and subsequent inactivation in lymphoma pathogenesis, thus validating that RB2/p130 is a classical tumor suppressor gene.","['Cinti, C', 'Claudio, P P', 'Howard, C M', 'Neri, L M', 'Fu, Y', 'Leoncini, L', 'Tosi, G M', 'Maraldi, N M', 'Giordano, A']","['Cinti C', 'Claudio PP', 'Howard CM', 'Neri LM', 'Fu Y', 'Leoncini L', 'Tosi GM', 'Maraldi NM', 'Giordano A']","['Istituto di Citomorfologia Normale e Patologica, CNR, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/pathology', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Male', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', '*Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2000/02/10 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/10 09:00'],"['2000/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Jan 15;60(2):383-9.,,,,"['P01 NS36466/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA60999-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent immunohistochemical studies of the retinoblastoma family of proteins in 235 specimens of lung cancer show the tightest inverse association between the histological grading in the most aggressive tumor types and pRb2/p130. This led us to study a panel of human lung cancers for mutations in the RB2/p130 gene. Mutations in the Rb-related gene RB2/p130 were detected in 11 of 14 (78.5%) primary lung tumors by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. A Moloney leukemia virus-based retroviral system was set up, and a comparable viral concentration of 1 x 10(7) infectious units/ml was obtained. Retrovirus-mediated delivery of wild-type RB2/p130 to the lung tumor cell line H23 potently inhibited tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo, as shown by the dramatic growth arrest observed in a colony assay and the suppression of anchorage-independent growth potential and tumor formation in nude mice. The tumors transduced with the RB2/p130 retrovirus diminished in size after a single injection, and a 12-fold reduction in tumor growth after RB2/p130 transduction compared with the Pac-transduced tumors (92% reduction, P = 0.003) and lacZ-transduced tumors (93% reduction, P < 0.001) was found to be statistically significant.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is one noninfectious pulmonary complication of BMT. Presenting clinical findings include nonproductive cough usually without hemoptysis, dyspnea, hypoxemia, a decrease in hematocrit, and diffuse infiltrates on chest radiograph. PATIENT: We report a case of DAH after allogeneic BMT in a 6-yr-old female patient. Although a chest radiograph revealed patchy bilateral alveolar densities and large volumes of bright red blood were suctioned from the endotracheal tube, there was no evidence of coagulopathy and no infectious agent was identified on examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, blood, and urine. INTERVENTION: The child was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and experienced a complete clinical recovery from her pulmonary disease. RESULTS: The definition, presenting symptoms, findings and timing, and associated risk factors of DAH after BMT are reviewed. Prospective hypotheses for the pathogenesis of DAH after BMT are presented. Evidence for the role of high-dose corticosteroids for treatment of DAH after BMT and the role of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation for treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in children with diffuse alveolar disease is also reviewed. CONCLUSION: This case supports the contention that early treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is warranted in children with DAH after BMT.","['Haselton, D J', 'Klekamp, J G', 'Christman, B W', 'Barr, F E']","['Haselton DJ', 'Klekamp JG', 'Christman BW', 'Barr FE']","['Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', '*Critical Care/methods', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*administration & dosage', 'Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', '*High-Frequency Ventilation', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Lung Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Methylprednisolone/*administration & dosage', 'Postoperative Complications/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/diagnostic imaging', 'Radiography', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/diagnostic imaging/therapy']",,2000/02/10 09:00,2000/02/26 09:00,['2000/02/10 09:00'],"['2000/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2000 Jan;28(1):245-8. doi: 10.1097/00003246-200001000-00042.,,['10.1097/00003246-200001000-00042 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present 12 cases of plasmacytic tumors with prominent crystal formation, including myeloma (5 cases), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (6 cases), and a nonneoplastic plasma cell proliferation. In all cases, crystal formation was associated with the proliferation of variable numbers of histiocytes containing similar inclusions. These cases showed a variety of appearances, sometimes obscuring the underlying plasma cell tumor and raising the differential diagnosis of a storage disorder, hemophagocytosis, or a mesenchymal lesion. In cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, patients typically presented with marked paraproteinemia and symptoms of hyperviscosity. Crystal-storing histiocytosis was not associated with other immunoglobulin deposition disorders, including amyloidosis, Mott cell tumors, or kappa-light chain deposition. In our cases and those previously reported, we found an overwhelming association of crystal-storing histiocytosis (CSH) with tumors expressing immunoglobulin kappa light chain with no consistent association with a particular heavy chain. These results suggest that CSH results from the ingestion of crystals produced by plasma cell tumors that either overproduce kappa light chain or express a structurally aberrant molecule. CSH persists in the marrow and other sites throughout the course of the disease and in our series was not highly associated with development of the adult Fanconi syndrome or rapid clinical deterioration.","['Jones, D', 'Bhatia, V K', 'Krausz, T', 'Pinkus, G S']","['Jones D', 'Bhatia VK', 'Krausz T', 'Pinkus GS']","['Department of Pathology, UT-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,['0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Crystallization', 'Female', 'Granuloma, Plasma Cell/immunology', 'Histiocytosis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*chemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Paraproteinemias/immunology', 'Plasma Cells/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Plasmacytoma/*immunology']",,2000/02/10 09:00,2000/02/26 09:00,['2000/02/10 09:00'],"['2000/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1999 Dec;30(12):1441-8. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(99)90166-1.,,"['S0046-8177(99)90166-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(99)90166-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE: A 46-year-old male who had two courses of chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia was found to have refractory thrombocytopenia. After IVIG (Sandoglobulin 12%, Novartis) administration (1 g/kg) for five consecutive days, the patient became oliguric and eventually anuric on the fifth dose. Hemodialysis was initiated, and urine production was noted on day 2 of hospitalization. Routine cytologic examination of fresh, voided urine showed numerous macrophagelike, bland epithelial cells with abundant, multivacuolated cytoplasm. Cytokeratin immunostain revealed positivity, thus confirming the epithelial origin of these cells. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first such case reported in the English-language cytology literature. Awareness of a patient's clinical history may be helpful in avoiding an incorrect diagnosis. Urine cytology may be useful in obtaining an early diagnosis of osmotic nephrosis in patients receiving high-dose IVIG therapy that may eliminate the need for a renal biopsy.","['Khalil, M', 'Shin, H J', 'Tan, A', 'DuBose, T D Jr', 'Ordonez, N', 'Katz, R L']","['Khalil M', 'Shin HJ', 'Tan A', 'DuBose TD Jr', 'Ordonez N', 'Katz RL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas M.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this suppression of apoptosis we investigated the activities and protein expression of antioxidant materials in the cell under serum deprivation. In the parental F-MEL cells enzyme activities of catalase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) increased to reach the maximum at 24-72 h after removal of serum and then decreased to initial levels or a little less. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) maintained the initial level for 72 h and increased 1.5- to 2-fold at 96 h. Glutathione (GSH) levels increased at 24 h and then dropped significantly to one-third the initial level. On the other hand, in c-junAS (+) cells, in which antisense c-jun was expressed and c-Jun protein expression was reduced to undetectable level. We found 1.9-, 2.7-, 4.8-, and 15. 8-fold increase in the activities of catalase, GST, SOD, and GPx, respectively, at 96 h. GSH maintained almost the same level as the initial. Enhancement of these enzyme activities in c-junAS (+) cells was induced under serum deprivation. Western blottings for catalase, GST, and SOD also showed enhanced increase in protein expression, supporting the increase in enzyme activities. Cellular peroxide level under serum deprivation was monitored by flow cytometry using DCFH-DA as a probe. We found that the peroxide level increased at 24 h and then decreased at 72 and 96 h in c-junAS (+) cells, and reduction of the peroxide level coincided with an increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. These results indicate that antioxidant materials such as catalase, GST, SOD, GPx, and GSH are induced by serum deprivation when c-jun expression is inhibited in F-MEL cells.

These findings indicate that the Myc homology boxes and the rest of the transcription regulatory domain (the first 144 amino acids) are dispensable for ubiquitylation and rapid destruction of c-MycS and c-Myc by the proteasome.","['Chen, L', 'Smith, L', 'Accavitti-Loper, M A', 'Omura, S', 'Bingham Smith, J']","['Chen L', 'Smith L', 'Accavitti-Loper MA', 'Omura S', 'Bingham Smith J']","['Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genes, myc', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",,2000/02/10 09:00,2000/03/18 09:00,['2000/02/10 09:00'],"['2000/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2000 Feb 15;374(2):306-12. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1999.1603.,,"['10.1006/abbi.1999.1603 [doi]', 'S0003-9861(99)91603-X [pii]']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],"['2P60AR20614-20/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL4408/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently demonstrated that Tax localizes to a multicomponent nuclear speckled structure (Tax speckled structure [TSS]). Here, we examine these structures further and identify a partial overlap of TSS with transcription hot spots. We used a strategy of directed expression via fusion proteins to determine if these transcription sites are the subtargets within TSS required for Tax function. When fused to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat, the resulting Tat-Tax fusion protein displayed neither a Tat-like nor a Tax-like pattern but rather was targeted specifically to the transcription subsites. The Tat-Tax fusion was able to activate both the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and the HTVL-1 LTR at the same level as the individual component; thus, targeting proteins to transcription hot spots was compatible with both Tax and Tat transcription function. In contrast, the fusion with HIV-1 Rev, Rev-Tax, resulted in a pattern of expression that was largely Rev-like (nucleolar and cytoplasmic). The reduced localization of Rev-Tax to transcription sites was reflected in a 10-fold drop in activation of the HTLV-1 LTR. However, there was no loss in the ability of Tax to activate via NF-kappaB. Thus, NF-kappaB-dependent Tax function does not require targeting of Tax to these transcription sites and suggests that activation via NF-kappaB is a cytoplasmic function. Selective mutation of the nuclear localization signal site in the Rev portion resulted in retargeting of Rev-Tax to TSS and subsequent restoration of transcription function, demonstrating that inappropriate localization preceded loss of function. Mutation of the nuclear export signal site in the Rev portion had no effect on transcription, although the relative amount of Rev-Tax in the cytoplasm was reduced. Finally, in explaining how Tax can occupy multiple subcellular sites, we show that Tax shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in a heterokaryon fusion assay. Thus, pleiotropic functionality by Tax is regulatable via shuttling between discrete subcellular compartments.","['Burton, M', 'Upadhyaya, C D', 'Maier, B', 'Hope, T J', 'Semmes, O J']","['Burton M', 'Upadhyaya CD', 'Maier B', 'Hope TJ', 'Semmes OJ']","['The Myles H.

The present study was conducted in order to assess the characteristics of cellular sequences targeted for human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) integration in vivo. Sequencing integration sites from >/=200 proviruses (19 kb of sequence) isolated from 29 infected individuals revealed that HTLV-1 integration is not random at the level of the nucleotide sequence. The virus was found to integrate in A/T-rich regions with a weak consensus sequence at positions within and without of the hexameric repeat generated during integration. These features were not associated with a preference for integration near active regions or repeat elements of the host chromosomes. Most or all of the regions of the genome appear to be accessible to HTLV-1 integration. As with integration in vitro, integration specificity in vivo seems to be determined by local features rather than by the accessibility of specific regions.","['Leclercq, I', 'Mortreux, F', 'Cavrois, M', 'Leroy, A', 'Gessain, A', 'Wain-Hobson, S', 'Wattel, E']","['Leclercq I', 'Mortreux F', 'Cavrois M', 'Leroy A', 'Gessain A', 'Wain-Hobson S', 'Wattel E']","['Unite 524 INSERM, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['AT Rich Sequence', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/virology', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Virus Integration']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Mar;74(5):2305-12. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.5.2305-2312.2000.,,['10.1128/jvi.74.5.2305-2312.2000 [doi]'],,,,,,PMC111712,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether Tax could function directly through the general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II or if other intermediary factors or coactivators were required. Our results show that a system consisting of purified recombinant TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, CREB, and Tax, along with highly purified RNA polymerase II, affinity-purified epitope-tagged TFIID, and semipurified TFIIH, supports basal transcription of the HTLV-1 promoter but is not responsive to Tax. Two additional activities were required for Tax to stimulate transcription. We demonstrate that one of these activities is poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a molecule that has been previously identified to be the transcriptional coactivator PC1. PARP functions as a coactivator in our assays at molar concentrations approximately equal to those of the DNA and equal to or less than those of the transcription factors in the assay.

This region has now been isolated and characterized. The region, named SL3-3 integration site 1 (Sint1), maps to the distal end of mouse chromosome 11, corresponding to human chromosome 17q25, and may be identical to a mouse mammary tumor virus integration site in a T-cell lymphoma, Pad3. Two overlapping genomic lambda clones spanning about 35 kb were isolated and used as a starting point for a search for genes in the neighborhood of the virus integration sites. A genomic fragment was used as a hybridization probe to isolate a 3-kb cDNA clone, the expression of which was upregulated in one of two tumors harboring a provirus in Sint1. The cDNA clone is predicted to encode a protein which shows 97.0% identity to a human septin-like protein encoded by a gene which has been found as a fusion partner gene of MLL in an acute myeloid leukemia with a t(11;17)(q23;q25).

There are at least 8 complementation groups (A through H). Extensive analyses of the FA group C gene FANCC in Western countries revealed that 10% to 15% of FA patients have mutations of this gene. The most common mutation is IVS4 + 4 A to T (IVS4), a splice mutation in intron 4, which has been found only in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. When we screened 29 Japanese patients (20 unrelated patients and 4 families) using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism, we found 8 unrelated patients homozygous for IVS4. This is apparently the first non-Ashkenazi-Jewish population for whom this mutation has been detected. The Ashkenazi Jewish patients homozygous for IVS4 have a severe phenotype, in comparison with other FA patients. Our analyses of Japanese patients indicate no significant difference between IVS4 homozygotes and other patients with regard to severity of a clinical phenotype. Thus, ethnic background may have a significant effect on a clinical phenotype in FA patients carrying the same mutation.

Magnetic cell sorting (MACS) with CD16 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which were used to fractionate granulocytes from CML patients and healthy individuals, yielded highly purified suspensions of CD16(+) neutrophils. The purity of these cell fractions was verified by extensive morphologic examination. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses, demonstrating the absence of interleukin-4 messenger RNA (IL-4 mRNA), further confirmed the negligible contamination of eosinophils in these fractions. Notably, purified CML CD16(+) neutrophils from all tested patients transformed exogenous LTA(4) to LTC(4). These cells also produced LTC(4 )after activation with ionophore A23187 or the chemotactic peptide fMet-LeuPhe (N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine). Subcellular fractionation revealed that the enzyme activity was exclusively distributed to the microsomal fraction. Expression of LTC(4) synthase mRNA in CML CD16(+) neutrophils was confirmed by RT-PCR. Furthermore, Western blot analyses consistently demonstrated expression of LTC(4) synthase at the protein level in CML CD16(+) neutrophils, whereas expression of microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2 occurred occasionally. Expectedly, LTC(4) synthase activity or expression of the protein could not be demonstrated in CD16(+) neutrophil suspensions from any of the healthy individuals. Instead, these cells, as well as CML CD16(+) neutrophils, transformed LTA(4) to LTB(4). The results indicate that aberrant expression of LTC(4) synthase is a regular feature of morphologically mature CML CD16(+) neutrophils. This abnormality, possibly associated with malignant transformation, can lead to increased LTC(4) synthesis in vivo. Such overproduction may be of pathophysiological relevance because LTC(4 )has been demonstrated to stimulate proliferation of human bone marrow-derived myeloid progenitor cells.

It is a ubiquitous, amiloride-sensitive, growth factor-activatable exchanger whose role has been implicated in cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, and neoplasia. Here we demonstrate that leukemic cell lines and peripheral blood from primary patient leukemic samples exhibit a constitutively and statistically higher pH(i) than normal hematopoietic tissue. We then show that a direct correlation exists between pH(i) and cell-cycle status of normal hematopoietic and leukemic cells. Advantage was taken of this relationship by treating leukemic cells with the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger inhibitor, 5-(N, N-hexamethylene)-amiloride (HMA), which decreases the pH(i) and induces apoptosis. By incubating patient leukemic cells in vitro with pharmacologic doses of HMA for up to 5 hours, we show, using flow cytometry and fluorescent ratio imaging microscopy, that when the pH(i) decreases, apoptosis-measured by annexin-V and TUNEL methodologies-rapidly increases so that more than 90% of the leukemic cells are killed. The differential sensitivity exhibited between normal and leukemic cells allows consideration of NHE1 inhibitors as potential antileukemic agents.

The viability of B-CLL cells stimulated by these protocols is high, and it has been hypothesized that the overexpression of Bcl-2 found in B-CLL protects the cells from apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we have analyzed the response of cells derived from 12 samples of patients with B-CLL to recombinant human Trx in spontaneous apoptosis, with special reference to the Bcl-2 expression. Long-term cultures of B-CLL clones showed significantly higher viability when supplemented with human Trx (P =.031), also exemplified with clones surviving more than 2 months. Short-term cultures of B-CLL cells exposed to 1 microg/mL of Trx for 1, 5, or 12 days maintained expression or delayed down-regulation of Bcl-2 compared with control cultures containing RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal calf serum only (P =.032,. 002,.026, respectively). All B-CLL cells expressed constitutive Trx at varying but low levels, in contrast to adult T-cell leukemias, which overexpress Trx, as previously reported. We found that Trx added to B-CLL cells increased in a dose-dependent fashion the release of TNF-alpha, which has been suggested to be an autocrine growth factor for these cells. In conclusion, we have found that human recombinant Trx induced TNF-alpha secretion, maintained Bcl-2, and reduced apoptosis in B-CLL cells.

We therefore analyzed the expressed Ig heavy chain genes in 23 cases (11 families) of familial CLL, and compared these results with data previously reported for sporadic CLL. In addition, we assessed the relationship of the occurrence of somatic mutation to several clinical and phenotypic features. The distribution of V genes among these cases was similar to that observed in sporadic CLL: VH3 > VH1 > VH4. Thirteen of the 23 cases (57%) showed germ line VH gene sequences, whereas somatic mutations were detected in 10 cases (43%). The average mutation frequency of these latter 10 cases of was 6.7% (ranging from 1.7% to 8.8%), and evidence of antigen selection was noted in 6. Intraclonal variation, followed by clonal evolution and the appearance of a second clone over a 20-year period was observed in 1 case, suggesting that mutations can continue to accumulate after neoplastic transformation. The presence of somatic mutations correlated with age at presentation, low white blood cell (WBC) count, and low fluorescence intensity of surface CD5, and the potential significance of these relationships is discussed. Our data indicate that familial and sporadic B-CLL display a similar pattern of immunoglobulin gene usage and frequency of somatic mutation, and are consistent with a common ontogeny and immunogenetic origin for these 2 epidemiologically distinct forms of CLL.

A persistently activated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to HTLV-I is found in the majority of infected individuals. However, it remains unclear whether this CTL response is protective or causes tissue damage. In addition, several observations paradoxically suggest that HTLV-I is transcriptionally silent in most infected cells and, therefore, not detectable by virus-specific CTLs. With the use of a new flow cytometric procedure, we show here that a high proportion of naturally infected CD4+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (between 10% and 80%) are capable of expressing Tax, the immunodominant target antigen recognized by virus-specific CTLs. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that autologous CD8+ T cells rapidly kill CD4+ cells naturally infected with HTLV-I and expressing Tax in vitro by a perforin-dependent mechanism. Consistent with these observations, we observed a significant negative correlation between the frequency of Tax(11-19)-specific CD8+ T cells and the percentage of CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood of patients infected with HTLV-I. Those results are in accordance with the view that virus-specific CTLs participate in a highly efficient immune surveillance mechanism that persistently destroys Tax-expressing HTLV-I-infected CD4+ T cells in vivo.

A combination of streptokinase, plasminogen, and antistreptokinase antibodies activated human erythroleukemic cells and was inhibited by pretreatment with IV.3 or pretreating the cells with the PAR-1 agonist SFLLRN, suggesting Fc receptor and PAR-1 interactions are necessary for cell activation in this system also. Streptokinase-induced platelet activation is dependent on both antistreptokinase-Fc receptor interactions and cleavage of PAR-1.

To determine how instinctive cell properties affect biological effects of cytokine, we introduced an erythroid/megakaryocyte lineage-specific transcription factor, GATA-1, into a murine myeloid cell line M1, which is known to undergo macrophage differentiation in response to interleukin 6 (IL-6). Overexpression of GATA-1 changed the phenotype of M1 cells from myeloid to megakaryocytic lineage. Furthermore, GATA-1 blocked both IL-6-induced macrophage differentiation and apoptosis of M1 cells. Although STAT3 is essential for IL-6-induced macrophage differentiation of M1 cells, GATA-1 had little or no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activities of STAT3 in Western blot analysis, electropholic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and luciferase assays. During IL-6-induced macrophage differentiation of M1 cells, IL-6 down-regulated cyclin D1 expression and induced p19(INK4D) expression, leading to reduction in cdk4 activities. In contrast, sustained expression of cyclin D1 and a significantly lesser amount of p19(INK4D) induction were observed in IL-6-treated M1 cells overexpressing GATA-1. Furthermore, although bcl-2 expression was severely reduced by IL-6 in M1 cells, it was sustained in GATA-1-introduced M1 cells during the culture with IL-6. Both IL-6-induced macrophage differentiation and apoptosis were significantly abrogated by coexpression of cyclin D1 and bcl-2, whereas overexpressions of cyclin D1 or bcl-2 inhibited only differentiation or apoptosis, respectively. These results suggested that GATA-1 may not only reprogram the lineage phenotype of M1 cells but also disrupt the biologic effects of IL-6 through the sustained expression of cyclin D1 and bcl-2.

In a case-control study, we investigated the association between polymorphisms within the GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 genes and risk of relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cases were relapsed patients. Controls were successfully treated patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. The null genotype (absence of both alleles) for GSTM1 or GSTT1 conferred a 2-fold (OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0. 23-1.07, P =.078) and 2.8-fold (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.13-0.99, P =. 048) reduction in risk of relapse, respectively, relative to the presence of the GSTM1 or GSTT1 gene.

No particular associations with relapse were observed for the GSTP1 polymorphism at codon 114. The risk of relapse when having 1 of the low-risk genotypes (GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, GSTP1 Val(105)/Val(105)) decreased 1.9-fold (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.24-1.19, P =.123), and the risk when having 2 or 3 low-risk genotypes 3.5-fold (OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.06-1.37, P =.118), compared with individuals having no low-risk genotype (P for trend =.005).

We identified 58 recipients of unrelated DLI (UDLI) for the treatment of relapsed disease from the National Marrow Donor Program database. A retrospective analysis was performed to determine response, toxicity, and survival after UDLI and to identify factors associated with successful therapy. UDLI was administered for relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (n = 25), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (n = 23), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 7), and other diseases (n = 3). Eight patients were in complete remission (CR) before UDLI, and 50 were evaluable for response. Forty-two percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 28%-56%) achieved CR, including 11 of 24 (46%; 95% CI, 26%-66%) with CML, 8 of 19 (42%; 95% CI, 20%-64%) with AML, and 2 of 4 (50%; 95% CI, 1%-99%) with ALL. The estimated probability of disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year after CR was 65% (95% CI, 50%-79%) for CML, 23% (95% CI, 9%-38%) for AML, and 30% (95% CI, 6%-54%) for ALL. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) complicated UDLI in 37% of patients (grade II-IV, 25%). A total of 13 of 32 evaluable patients (41%) developed chronic GVHD. There was no association between cell dose administered and either response or toxicity. In a multivariable analysis, only a longer interval from BMT to relapse and BMT to UDLI was associated with improved survival and DFS, respectively.

The 2 groups differed in their signal-transducing capacities initiated by cross-linking of surface IgM; only in CD38-positive cells was an efficient signal delivered, invariably resulting in cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the effect of surface IgD cross-linking in 10 patients with CD38-positive B-CLL. Exposure of the malignant cells to goat antihuman delta-chain antibodies (Gadelta-ab) caused [Ca(++)]i mobilization and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation in a manner not different from that observed after goat antihuman mu-chain antibody (Gamu-ab) treatment in vitro. However, Gadelta-ab-treated cells failed to undergo apoptosis and instead displayed prolonged survival in culture and differentiated into plasma cells when rIL2 was concomitantly present. Cross-linking of surface IgD failed to induce proliferation of the malignant cells in vitro. Moreover, treatment with Gadelta-ab did not prevent apoptosis of B-CLL cells induced by Gamu-ab. Collectively, these experiments demonstrated that IgM and IgD expressed by the same cell may deliver opposite signals under particular circumstances and provide some clues for the understanding of the pathophysiology of B-CLL.

According to the recently established International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), available for 45 patients, 2 patients were considered low risk; 14, intermediate 1 risk; 19, intermediate 2 risk; and 10, high risk. Conditioning regimens were cyclophosphamide (CY) (120 mg/kg of body weight) plus 12-Gy fractionated total-body irradiation (FTBI) (n = 15), CY plus FTBI with lung and liver shielding (n = 4), busulfan (7 mg/kg) plus FTBI (n = 4), or busulfan (16 mg/kg) plus CY (n = 27).

Although the Philadelphia chromosome, which generates p210(bcr/abl), is a unique chromosomal abnormality in the chronic phase, additional chromosomal abnormalities are frequently detected in the blast crisis, suggesting that superimposed genetic events are responsible for disease progression. To investigate whether loss of p53 plays a role in the evolution of CML, we crossmated p210(bcr/abl)-transgenic (BCR/ABL(tg/-)) mice with p53-heterozygous (p53(+/-)) mice and generated p210(bcr/abl)-transgenic, p53-heterozygous (BCR/ABL(tg/-)p53(+/-)) mice, in which a somatic alteration in the residual normal p53 allele directly abrogates p53 function. The BCR/ABL(tg/-)p53(+/-) mice died in a short period compared with their wild-type (BCR/ABL(-/-)p53(+/+)), p53 heterozygous (BCR/ABL(-/-)p53(+/-)), and p210(bcr/abl) transgenic (BCR/ABL(tg/-)p53(+/+)) litter mates. They had rapid proliferation of blast cells, which was preceded by subclinical or clinical signs of a myeloproliferative disorder resembling human CML. The blast cells were clonal in origin and expressed p210(bcr/abl) with an increased kinase activity. Interestingly, the residual normal p53 allele was frequently and preferentially lost in the tumor tissues, implying that a certain mechanism facilitating the loss of p53 allele exists in p210(bcr/abl)-expressing hematopoietic cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neutron-induced and alpha-track autoradiographs were prepared from femora of the CBA/H mouse that had been injected with 40 kBq kg(-1) radionuclide between 1 and 448 days previously. Computer-based image analysis of the autoradiographs was performed and dosimetric methods applied to obtain radiation dose-rates to different regions of the marrow cavity. RESULTS: Initially each radionuclide deposited on endosteal and periosteal bone surfaces; 241Am was additionally deposited on vascular canal surfaces. Redistribution resulted in 233U being incorporated into bone, while 239Pu and 241Am showed transfer into both bone volume and marrow. Accumulation in the central marrow peaked at 112-224 days post-injection, but subsequently was cleared by 448 days. Cumulative doses to both osteosarcomagenic and myeloid leukaemogenic target cell regions showed the trend 239Pu > 241Am > 233U. CONCLUSIONS: Calculation of cumulative doses to a 10-microm layer of marrow adjacent to bone surfaces appears to be a suitable predictor for risk of osteosarcoma. Risks of myeloid leukaemia in the mouse are better predicted by considering the central marrow as the target region rather than average dose to all marrow.","['Austin, A L', 'Ellender, M', 'Haines, J W', 'Harrison, J D', 'Lord, B I']","['Austin AL', 'Ellender M', 'Haines JW', 'Harrison JD', 'Lord BI']","['CRC Section of Haemopoietic Cell and Gene Therapeutics, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, UK. acartlidge@picr.man.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['4OC371KSTK (Uranium)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)', 'VW92PHU2UY (Americium)']",IM,"['Alpha Particles', 'Americium/*pharmacokinetics', 'Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Female', 'Femur/*metabolism', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neutrons', 'Plutonium/*pharmacokinetics', 'Radiometry', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Uranium/*pharmacokinetics']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/02/19 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2000 Jan;76(1):101-11. doi: 10.1080/095530000139069.,,['10.1080/095530000139069 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: TK6, a lymphoblast cell line with wild-type p53, and U937, a monocytic leukaemia cell line with mutant, inactive, p53 were exposed to gamma ray doses ranging from 0.1 Gy to 3 Gy. Cell-cycle distributions and cyclin B1 were assessed by flow cytometry, and p53 and p21 protein levels were measured by Western blotting. Apoptosis was determined by fluorescence microscopy after staining with Hoechst 33342, and by measurement of the pre-G1 cell population by flow cytometry. Micronuclei were determined in cytokinesis-blocked cells by fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: In TK6 cells, radiation exposure induced elevated p53 and p21 levels and delayed expression of cyclin B1. No changes in these parameters were found in U937 cells. Although both cell lines arrested in G2/M after larger doses of radiation, G2/M-arrest occurred after 0.1 Gy and 0.3 Gy in TK6 cells only. An apoptotic adaptive response was induced in both cell lines by a 0.1 Gy priming dose but an adaptive response with respect to micronuclei was observed only in U937 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The radiation adaptive response can occur in the absence of wild-type p53. A small dose of radiation may not protect cells against both apoptosis and cytogenetic damage caused by a subsequent larger dose of radiation.","['Hendrikse, A S', 'Hunter, A J', 'Keraan, M', 'Blekkenhorst, G H']","['Hendrikse AS', 'Hunter AJ', 'Keraan M', 'Blekkenhorst GH']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)']",IM,"['Adaptation, Biological', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Cell Cycle/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Interphase/radiation effects', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitosis/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/02/19 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2000 Jan;76(1):11-21. doi: 10.1080/095530000138961.,,['10.1080/095530000138961 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MNCs were collected from asthmatic subjects and healthy controls. Conditioned media from the MNC cultures (MNC-CM) were collected after stimulation with various concentrations of phytohemagglutinin (PHA). We treated U937 cells with these MNC-CMs, then assayed their proliferation and differentiation after 5 days of culture. At lower PHA doses (1.25 microg/ml), as well as in absence of PHA, the asthmatic MNC-CMs inhibited U937 cells growth to a slightly greater extent than did the MNC-CMs from controls. In contrast, when higher doses of PHA were used (5, 10 microg/ml), this growth-inhibiting effect was dramatically reversed. The dual effect of MNC-CM in these two groups was also shown in U937 cell differentiation assay, assessed as follows: morphological change by Liu's staining, functional change by NBT reduction test and CD 14 expression by flow cytometric detection. We suggest that the antileukemic effects of MNCs from asthmatic patients result from a slightly immunopotentiated status.

For comparative studies, the combination of immunocytochemistry and enzyme cytochemistry methods was used. T he strong correlation between the CD26 antigen expression and DPP IV positivity in the majority of T-lymphoblasts in T-ALL patients was evident. No CD26 antigen was expressed on DPP IV negative T-cells. The variable CD4 and/or CD8 antigen expression, frequent CD5 and CD7 positivity and absence of surface membrane CD3 antigen were the characteristic immunophenotypic features of CD26/DPP IV positive T-lymphoblasts. Moreover, the clear CD71 and CD26/DPP IV coexpression suggested the association of CD26/DPP IV positive cells with proliferation. The immunophenotype of CD26/DPP IV positive T-lymphoblasts seems to be characteristic for the relative immature cell population. In addition, noteworthy was the slight disassociation between the very high CD26 antigen expression and moderate DPP IV activity in cells of some T-ALL patients. The possible existence of enzymatically inactive structures of CD26 antigen or inactive precursors of DPP IV detectable only by immunocytochemistry was discussed. Our study indicates that CD26 antigen expression is tended to identify cells with DPP IV enzymatic activity in T-ALL patients. The results provide some more information of CD26 antigen involvement in the pathology of leukemic cells via its DPP IV enzyme activity.","['Klobusicka, M', 'Babusikova, O']","['Klobusicka M', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,['EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*analysis/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/02/19 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 1999;46(5):299-303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because a variety of tumor cells also retain pertinent cationic structures for longer periods of time compared with normal cells, mitochondrial targeting has been proposed as a selective therapeutic strategy of relevance for both chemotherapy and photochemotherapy of neoplastic diseases. Here we report that the triarylmethane dye crystal violet stains cell mitochondria with efficiency and selectivity, and is a promising candidate for photochemotherapy applications. Crystal violet exhibits pronounced phototoxicity toward L1210 leukemia cells but comparatively small toxic effects toward normal hematopoietic cells (murine granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, CFU-GM). On the basis of a comparative examination of chemical, photochemical, and phototoxic properties of crystal violet and other triarylmethane dyes, we have identified interdependencies between molecular structure, and selective phototoxicity toward tumor cells. These structure-activity relationships represent useful guidelines for the development of novel purging protocols to promote selective elimination of residual tumor cells from autologous bone marrow grafts with minimum toxicity to normal hematopoietic stem cells.","['Indig, G L', 'Anderson, G S', 'Nichols, M G', 'Bartlett, J A', 'Mellon, W S', 'Sieber, F']","['Indig GL', 'Anderson GS', 'Nichols MG', 'Bartlett JA', 'Mellon WS', 'Sieber F']","['School of Pharmacy, Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA. glindig@facstaff.wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (Rosaniline Dyes)', '2390-60-5 (Victoria blue BO)', '94UZ9RD7TJ (ethyl violet)', 'J4Z741D6O5 (Gentian Violet)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', '*Coloring Agents/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Gentian Violet/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Photochemotherapy', '*Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rosaniline Dyes/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/07/19 11:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 2000 Jan;89(1):88-99. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6017(200001)89:1<88::AID-JPS9>3.0.CO;2-K.,,"['S0022-3549(16)30538-X [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1520-6017(200001)89:1<88::AID-JPS9>3.0.CO;2-K [doi]']","['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association J', 'Pharm Sci 89: 88-99, 2000']","['5F32 CA72225-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P412RR04224-11/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known that the major metabolite of IDA, idarubicinol (IDA-OL), has nearly the same cytotoxicity as IDA, while the cytotoxicity of daunorubicinol (DNR-OL) is about 1/30th of that of DNR. We examined the effect of the MDR modifiers verapamil and dexniguldipine on the efflux of IDA, DNR and their hydroxylated metabolites IDA-OL and DNR-OL in blast populations of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in the MDR-negative cell line CEM-CCRF and in their MDR-positive counterpart (CEM-VBL). All patients with relapsed or persistent AML had been pretreated with IDA and cytosine arabinoside. The efflux of the anthracyclines was estimated by flow cytometry. A total of 36 patients with AML were investigated; 18 out of 36 AML blast populations showed an efflux of DNR, DNR-OL and IDA-OL. The efflux of DNR, DNR-OL and particularly IDA-OL could be reversed by 10 microM verapamil or 1 microM dexniguldipine. For IDA we found an effusion of 40 +/- 11% in all blast populations which could not be significantly inhibited by the modulators. Similar results for IDA were found in the MDR-positive cell line (CEM-VBL 100) and in their MDR-negative counterpart (CEM-CCRF). The incubation of CEM-CCRF cells with DNR, DNR-OL, IDA-OL and especially IDA led to MDR induction as determined by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction analysis with MDR-specific primer and by cellular efflux studies. We conclude that the outcome of chemotherapy with idarubicin is influenced by MDR, although IDA is not essentially MDR-dependent itself, but because IDA-OL is actively involved in multidrug resistance. Further investigations should consider the question of whether the combination of IDA and MDR modifiers can enhance the serum level of the active metabolite IDA-OL and can reverse the MDR pattern in cells treated with IDA.","['Schroder, J K', 'Kasimir-Bauer, S', 'Seeber, S', 'Scheulen, M E']","['Schroder JK', 'Kasimir-Bauer S', 'Seeber S', 'Scheulen ME']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Cancer Research), University of Essen Medical School, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Hufelandstr. 55, D-45122 Essen, Germany. jan.schroeder@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', '86189-66-4 (idarubicinol)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'YDU8YIP30L (daunorubicinol)', 'Z81N45O25Z (niguldipine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Dihydropyridines/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/02/26 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2000 Feb;126(2):111-6. doi: 10.1007/s004320050019.,,"['01260111.432 [pii]', '10.1007/s004320050019 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined levels of interleukin(IL)-4, interferon (IFN)gamma, soluble (s) CD30, and sIL-2 receptor (R) before and after autologous PBSCT, and compared findings for PBSCT with those for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We found significantly higher IL-4 levels 1 and 3 weeks after PBSCT than before PBSCT, while IFNgamma levels remained almost unchanged after PBSCT. IFNgamma levels were increased 3 weeks after BMT, although no increase in IL-4 level was observed. The serum sCD30 level was significantly higher 3 weeks after PBSCT, but not following BMT. For 34 samples on days 0 and 21 from 17 patients undergoing PBSCT, a strong correlation was observed between sCD30 and sIL-2R levels (r = 0.43, P < 0.01). However, no significant correlation between sCD30 and sIL-2R levels was found for BMT patients.

In the present study, we performed nested reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to identify aberrant TSG101 transcripts in 43 human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. We could detect only a single band of the wild-type transcript with the expected size in virtually all cell lines after the first round of PCR. As in the case with various human solid tumors, the smaller TSG101 transcripts appeared in most of these cell lines after the second round of PCR. Thus, the expression level of the variant transcripts was extremely low as compared with that of the wild-type transcript, and this finding was also confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Identification of various truncated transcripts with extensive deletions in the TSG101 coding region was confirmed by means of sequencing analysis, and expression of these transcripts did not appear to be associated with a specific type of hematopoietic malignant disorder. Southern blot analysis did not indicate any gross TSG101 gene rearrangement. The truncated transcripts were also detected in normal peripheral blood leukocytes. Our results suggest that the truncated TSG101 transcripts are definitely detectable in various human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, but do not support the notion that the variant transcripts may have a major functional relevance in the pathogenesis of human hematopoietic malignant disorder.","['Hosokawa, Y', 'Nagai, E', 'Seto, M']","['Hosokawa Y', 'Nagai E', 'Seto M']","['Laboratory of Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanakoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8681, Japan. yhosokaw@aichi-cc.pref.aichi.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsg101 protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukocytes', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/02/26 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2000 Feb;126(2):79-84.,,['01260079.432 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the results of these in vivo experiments, IAP was more cytotoxic against P388 mouse leukaemia cells in vitro than was SUM-IAP.

Using highly susceptible FVB/N mice, neuronal loss was quantitated in the tissue sections of brain stem from infected and noninfected mice at 20 and 35 days post inoculation (dpi). Results indicated that there was no significant neuronal loss at 20 dpi, but significant (P < 0.05) at 35 dpi.

Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) showed an average life expectancy of 5 years, with significantly longer survival times under interferon treatment. In contrast, the ET group did not disclose any relevant reduction in life expectancy. Initial bone marrow fibrosis and a reduction in erythropoiesis were the most important prognostic features in CML. Furthermore, Pseudo-Gaucher cells indicated a favorable outcome in the cohort of patients receiving chemotherapy. On the other hand, peripheral myelo- and erythroblasts were correlated with a worsening in survival. Regarding IMF, a simplified multivariate risk score was constructed, including age, hemoglobin level, platelet and leukocyte counts, and a leuko-erythroblastic blood picture as most important variables. The three risk groups derived showed significantly different survival patterns, but in this calculation bone marrow histology exerted no major influence on survival. On the other hand, initial (prefibrotic) stages of IMF revealed a better prognosis. In conclusion, our results underline the importance of bone marrow morphology in CMPDs, since significant correlations with patients' outcome were calculated. Particularly in CML, myelofibrosis and reduction of erythropoiesis were associated with survival and, thus, must be regarded as important predictive and independent parameters.","['Kvasnicka, H M', 'Thiele, J', 'Schmitt-Graeff, A', 'Schaefer, H E']","['Kvasnicka HM', 'Thiele J', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Schaefer HE']",['Zentrum fur Pathologie der Universitat zu Koln. hm.kvasnicka@uni-koeln.de'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*mortality/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathologe. 2000 Jan;21(1):63-72. doi: 10.1007/s002920050007.,Prognostische Faktoren und Uberlebenszeiten bei chronischen myeloproliferativen Erkrankungen (CMPE).,"['00210063.292 [pii]', '10.1007/s002920050007 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, dynamics of hematopoiesis is mainly defined by these two parameters. However, since only few data are available from previous studies, we performed a retrospective analysis to elucidate some aspects of this complex pathomechanism. A total of 400 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) and corresponding reactive bone marrow lesions were enrolled into this study. Apoptosis was detected in bone marrow tissue by the ISEL-technique and topoisomerase II alpha expression was demonstrated by the monoclonal antibody Ki-S1. Furthermore, by determination of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen labeling (PCNA) index, we were able to calculate the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase, because both nuclear antigens are expressed in different phases of the cell cycle. Patients with IMF, PV, and ET revealed a normal range of apoptosis, whereas in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) a significant increase could be observed. On the other hand, IMF and PV were characterized by a raised proliferative activity. Dynamics of hematopoiesis was assessed by calculation of the so called hematopoietic turnover index. In CML and reactive lesions no alterations of this parameter were detectable, but IMF and PV showed a significant increase. Survival analysis disclosed a relevant worsening of life expectancy for patients with reduced apoptosis and proliferation. In conclusion, our in-situ results confirm and extend previous experimental data on hematopoietic cell kinetics. In this context, a greater regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis may be reflected by an increased rate of apoptosis and/or proliferation and therefore is associated with a more favorable outcome.","['Kvasnicka, H M', 'Thiele, J']","['Kvasnicka HM', 'Thiele J']",['Zentrum fur Pathologie der Universitat zu Koln. hm.kvassnicka@uni-koeln.de'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/analysis', 'G2 Phase', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic Index', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polycythemia/pathology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Thrombocytosis/pathology']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathologe. 2000 Jan;21(1):55-62. doi: 10.1007/s002920050006.,Apoptose und Proliferation im Knochenmark bei chronischen myeloproliferativen Erkrankungen--biologische und prognostische Bedeutung.,"['00210055.292 [pii]', '10.1007/s002920050006 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comparative immunohistochemical-morphometric and clinical study on bone marrow biopsies from 604 patients derived from two institutes of pathology (Cologne/Freiburg)].,39-54,"An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on bone marrow biopsies in 604 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to compare morphological and clinical features and to evaluate effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy. Following morphometry significant correlations were calculated between number of CD61(+) megakaryocytes, including their precursors with fiber density. This finding is in line with the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts regarding the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis. The latter was observed in about 28% of patients already at diagnosis. In a similar way, the frequency of CD68(+) macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f(+) nucleated erythroid precursors, implicating an involvement of this cell lineage in iron turnover, hemoglobin synthesis, and degradation of the expelled nuclei from normoblasts. The (alpha-D-galactosyl residue-expressing) Pseudo-Gaucher cells were detectable in 30% of pretreatment specimens. Moreover, significant associations were calculable between reduction in erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features such as hemoglobin level, percentages of myelo- and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood, and spleen size. These variables are in keeping with more advanced stages of CML. Based on our morphometric evaluations, a classification into three different histological subgroups: granulocytic, megakaryocytic, and myelofibrotic was carried out. This simplified staging system was correlated with corresponding sets of hematological data. Sequential biopsies in 173 patients with monotherapy by IFN, hydroxyurea (HU), or busulfan (BU) revealed a fibrogenic effect of IFN in contrast to a fiber-reducing property of HU. The dynamics of myelofibrosis and changes of major cell lineages during treatment were readily demonstrable by calculating corresponding indices. These included the ratios between quantitative differences of corresponding variables at repeated examinations and time. Thus, in patients with complete hematological remission following IFN administration, regeneration of erythropoiesis was found to be accompanied by an increase in the total number of CD68(+) macrophages, including activated subpopulations. Histological subgroups showed a transition from a (nonfibrotic) granulocytic and megakaryocyte pattern to the myelofibrotic subtype in about 40% of patients. This change was opposed to a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic subtype which occurred in 17 patients (36%), but predominantly in those under HU therapy. In conclusion, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow features in CML warrants a careful morphological evaluation of trephine biopsies and appropriate means of processing to achieve relevant correlations with clinical data and, thus, allows a more elaborate insight into the dynamics of the disease process.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Schmitt-Graeff, A', 'Schaefer, H E']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Schaefer HE']",['Zentrum fur Pathologie der Universitat zu Koln. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de'],['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathologe. 2000 Jan;21(1):39-54. doi: 10.1007/s002920050005.,Histologische und hamatologische Befunde bei der CML.

In addition to clinical findings, the evolution of laboratory data during follow-up and histology of the bone marrow exerts a significant diagnostic impact. Characteristic features are not only expressed by hematopoiesis, but also by the myeloid stromal compartment. While the megakaryocyte-rich subtype of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the 5q(-) syndrome (MDS) are dominated by abnormal micromegakaryocytes, in polycythemia vera (PV) this cell lineage reveals a pleomorphous appearance. In essential thrombocythemia (ET), a prevalence of giant megakaryocytes with deeply lobulated (staghorn-like) nuclei may be encountered. A clear-cut discrimination of ET from early (hypercellular) stages of idiopathic (primary) myelofibrosis (IMF) presenting with thrombocythemia becomes possible, provided the conspicuous atypical features of megakaryopoiesis characterizing the latter entity are taken into account. Moreover, CML displays a predominance of the granulocytic lineage whereas PV shows a panmyelosis or trilineage proliferation, involving erythropoiesis, in particular. In contrast, erythropoiesis is markedly reduced in CML and to a lesser degree also in IMF. In CMPDs extreme values of iron deposits may be found, ranging from a total lack (PV) to minor amounts (CML) and a normal staining reaction (ET). Similar results are exhibited regarding reticulin fibrosis, which is usually not present in ET, rarely observed in PV and detectable to a variable degree in CML and IMF.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM']",['Zentrum fur Pathologie der Universitat zu Koln. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/diagnosis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/diagnosis', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/diagnosis', '*Platelet Count', 'Thrombocytosis/*blood/*diagnosis/pathology']",32,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathologe. 2000 Jan;21(1):31-8. doi: 10.1007/s002920050004.,Thrombozytose versus Thrombozythamie--zur Differentialdiagnose des erhohten Plattchenwertes.,"['00210031.292 [pii]', '10.1007/s002920050004 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aspects of hematopathologic diagnosis].,1-15,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous group of clonal stem cell disorders which generally occur in older adults but may also affect children. Primary MDS should be distinguished from secondary MDS associated with antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapy (t-MDS), exposure to toxic compounds, or genetic disorders. The establishment of a neoplastic clone is reflected by dysplastic features and impaired function which may affect all three hematopoietic cell lineages. The ineffective hematopoiesis which causes bone marrow failure is accompanied by peripheral blood cytopenia and is considered to result from increased apoptosis, at least in the less advanced MDS stages. The elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of MDS has provided evidence that chromosomal abnormalities are present in about 50% of patients with primary MDS. They include numerical aberrations such as monosomy 5 or 7, trisomy 8, loss of the Y-chromosome and structural abnormalities such as deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-syndrome), 7, or 8. Based on the percentage of blasts (<5%, 5-20%, 20-30%) and the presence of >15% ringed sideroblasts for marrows with <5% blasts, the French-American-British (FAB) classifies MDS into 4 morphologic categories: refractory anemia (RA), refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-t), and refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts. The fifth morphologic type is chronic myelomonocytic leukemia characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis (>1x10(9)/l). However, a modification of this classification will be proposed by the World Health Organization, with the intention of lowering the threshold for the diagnosis of AML from 30% to 20% blast cells. In patients presenting with cytopenias suggesting impaired hematopoiesis, the initial diagnosis depends mainly on the cytological evaluation of bone marrow and blood smears and the histological findings of trephine bone marrow biopsy. In a retrospective analysis we evaluated the occurrence of the distinct FAB-categories as percentage of the total number of MDS cases diagnosed at the Institute of Pathology of the University of Freiburg. A total of 63% fullfilled the criteria of RA/RARS, 17% of RAEB, 14% of RAEB-t, and 6% of CMML. A fibrotic variant of MDS was observed in 7.67% of all cases, ranging from 2.34% in RA up to 15. 42-15.84% in the categories which did not show significant differences with regard to myelofibrosis. The histologic evaluation of a trephine bone marrow biopsy is of critical importance for the evaluation of fibrotic or hypocellular MDS since these patterns are not reflected by the cytological examination. The combined cytological and histological diagnosis of bone marrow and peripheral blood is a reliable tool for the initial diagnosis of MDS. In addition, cytogenetic and molecular analysis should be performed. Presently, the risk of leukemic transformation is evaluated using the International Prognostic Scoring System for MDS, which is the sum of the scores of bone marrow blasts, karyotypes and cytopenia. In the context of clinical trials therapeutic modalities should be considerd according to the age and the general performance state and the prognostic scores of individual patients.","['Schmitt-Graeff, A', 'Mattern, D', 'Kohler, H', 'Hezel, J', 'Lubbert, M']","['Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Mattern D', 'Kohler H', 'Hezel J', 'Lubbert M']","['Pathologisches Institut des Universitatsklinikums, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat Freiburg.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Y Chromosome']",57,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathologe. 2000 Jan;21(1):1-15. doi: 10.1007/s002920050001.,Myelodysplastisches Syndrom (MDS).

We, therefore, constructed and examined preclinical models to determine whether prior exposure to M, in fact, adversely affected response to other therapy. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine whether the sequence of AAs, specifically the prior use of M, adversely affected response to subsequent treatment. METHODS: The methods employed were the following: (1) Human tumor cell lines rendered resistant by in vitro sequential exposure to five different AAs were developed. The resistant cell lines were examined for cross-resistance to alkylating and other agents. (2) In vivo studies in the p388 mouse leukemia for resistance and cross-resistance among the AAs. (3) In vivo studies of the effect of sequence of AAs on response in mice bearing EMT6 breast cancer. (4) The double transplant model was developed in the mouse and the sequence of high-dose AAs was studied. (5) Biochemical and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies of the various resistant tumor cell lines. RESULTS: (1) The in vitro human tumor cells resistant to M were cross-resistant in 57% of tests to other AAs. In contrast, resistance for other AAs crossed to other agents in only 10 to 20% of tests. (2) The in vivo studies of p388 indicated that resistance to M commonly crossed to other AAs and many non-AAs. (3) The results for the mouse breast cancer (EMT6) studies of the sequence of AAs again indicated that M employed first markedly reduced responsiveness to subsequent treatment, particularly with AAs. (4) The double transplant model: again, M first markedly reduced response to other agents. (5) The in vitro resistant human tumor cell lines, particularly the breast cancer cell line MCF7, were found to contain high concentrations of glutathione S1 transferase gamma, which is consistent with that mechanism being responsible for resistance. CONCLUSION: The sequence of alkylating agent treatment may substantially influence response. Melphalan, particularly, produces resistance that commonly crosses to the other AAs. Mechanistic studies indicate significant changes in glutathione S1 transferase, a known mechanism for broadly based resistance to AAs.","['Frei, E 3rd', 'Ara, G', 'Teicher, B', 'Bunnell, C', 'Richardson, P', 'Wheeler, C', 'Tew, K', 'Elias, A']","['Frei E 3rd', 'Ara G', 'Teicher B', 'Bunnell C', 'Richardson P', 'Wheeler C', 'Tew K', 'Elias A']","['Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Adult Oncology, 44 Binney Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '1XBF4E50HS (4-hydroxycyclophosphamide)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Carmustine/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Mechlorethamine/pharmacology', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2000;45(3):239-46. doi: 10.1007/s002800050035.,,"['00450239.280 [pii]', '10.1007/s002800050035 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first choice of treatment plan for osteosarcoma is chemotherapy. In particular, preoperative chemotherapy is most important in clinical treatment in orthopedics. In these chemotherapies, multiple anticancer drugs such as Adriamycin (ADM), CDDP, cyclophosphamide (CPM), methotrexate (MTX) and vincristine (VCR) are commonly used in combination. Recently, anticancer drugs have been shown to trigger apoptosis in various cancer cells. However, many studies on this topic have been examined using leukemia cell lines, and many kinds of cancer cells established from solid tumor are resistant to the induction of apoptosis by anticancer drugs. So in this study, we examined the effects of the anticancer drugs ADM, CDDP, CPM, MTX and VCR on osteosarcoma cells in vitro. We also examined the signaling pathways of each anticancer drug by studying the induction of apoptosis and activation of caspases in the osteosarcoma cells. METHODS: We examined the effects of the anticancer drugs ADM, CDDP, CPM, MTX and VCR, which are used clinically for the treatment of osteosarcoma, on cells of the human osteosarcoma (HOS) cell line. The cytotoxic effects of the anticancer drugs were evaluated using the MTT assay. We used both flow cytometry and activation of caspases to confirm the induction of apoptosis in the HOS cells. To dissect the pathway of the caspase cascade in apoptosis in HOS cells, we used the tetrapeptides YVAD-CHO, DMQD-CHO, VEID-CHO and IETD-CHO, which selectively inhibit caspase-1, -3, -6 and -8, respectively. RESULTS: ADM, CDDP, CPM and VCR, but not MTX, induced death of HOS cells in a dose-dependent manner. CDDP at 10 microM, CPM at 7.5 microM, ADM at 20 microM and VCR at 150 microM caused 80% cell death of HOS cells after 12 h. However, the percentages of apoptotic cells were 5.6% (medium alone), 75.9% (CDDP), 20.0% (CPM), 22.2% (ADM), 20.5% (VCR) and 13.1% (MTX). In addition, direct measurement of caspase-3 activity revealed that CDDP but not the other drugs activated caspase-3 in HOS cells. These analyses revealed that only CDDP induced apoptosis of HOS cells via activation of caspases. Furthermore, DMQD-CHO, VEID-CHO and IETD-CHO inhibited CDDP-induced apoptosis of HOS cells, suggesting that caspase-3, -6 and -8 are involved in the signaling pathway of CDDP-induced apoptosis. In contrast, none of the caspase inhibitors inhibited cell death induced by the other anticancer drugs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that CDDP specifically induces apoptosis via activation of caspases and the other anticancer drugs induce death of HOS cells via different signaling pathways. It also demonstrates that caspase-8 is a key molecule in the earliest stage of the signaling pathway of CDDP-induced apoptosis of HOS cells, and caspase-3 works downstream of caspase-8.","['Seki, K', 'Yoshikawa, H', 'Shiiki, K', 'Hamada, Y', 'Akamatsu, N', 'Tasaka, K']","['Seki K', 'Yoshikawa H', 'Shiiki K', 'Hamada Y', 'Akamatsu N', 'Tasaka K']","['Department of Orthopedics, Yamanashi Medical University, Tamaho-cho, Yamanashi 409-3898, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-methionyl-glutaminyl-aspartyl-aldehyde)', '0 (acetyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartyl-aldehyde)', '0 (acetyl-valyl-isoleucyl-aspartyl-aldehyde)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 6', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Osteosarcoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2000;45(3):199-206. doi: 10.1007/s002800050030.,,"['00450199.280 [pii]', '10.1007/s002800050030 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dipyridamole (DP) blocks thymidine salvage (uptake) and potentiates several chemotherapeutic agents in vitro. The purpose of this study was to determine whether DP is capable of potentiating RTX cytotoxicity in the presence of physiologic thymidine concentrations. METHODS: We examined the effect of DP on RTX cytotoxicity in the presence of various physiologic thymidine concentrations in eight colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines by colony formation assay, and in p53-defective HL60 S and p53-competent HL60 SN3 promyelocytic leukemia cells by a tetrazolium reduction-based assay. RESULTS: In WiDr colon adenocarcinoma cells the cytotoxicity of 1.0 microM RTX (4 h) varied from 0% to >99% within the reported range of human serum thymidine concentrations from 500 to <50 nM, respectively. DP potentiated RTX cytotoxicity 2- to >93-fold within this range. Free DP concentrations of 10 to 20 nM, achievable with oral dosing, potentiated RTX at thymidine concentrations up to 100 nM. Potentiation at higher physiologic thymidine concentrations of >/=200 nM required DP concentrations of at least 50 nM, or about twice the steady-state DP concentration obtainable from oral and intravenous dosing, but well within that obtainable by intraperitoneal infusion. Maximal potentiation required 72 to 120 h of DP exposure. DP also potentiated RTX in the absence of exogenous thymidine in six of eight colon cell lines and HL60 S and SN3 cells suggesting a second, nonthymidine salvage-dependent mechanism of potentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically achievable free DP concentrations potentiated RTX cytotoxicity within the range of physiologic serum thymidine concentrations. RTX/DP or DP analogue-based combination therapy should, therefore, be considered for clinical trial. Serum or tumor thymidine concentration determinations may aid in identification of patients likely to respond to TS and nucleoside salvage inhibitors versus alternate, non-TS-directed therapies.","['Lehman, N L', 'Danenberg, P V']","['Lehman NL', 'Danenberg PV']","['Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA. nlehman@pathology.creighton.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*adverse effects', 'Thiophenes/*adverse effects', 'Thymidine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/02/26 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2000;45(2):142-8. doi: 10.1007/s002800050022.,,"['00450142.280 [pii]', '10.1007/s002800050022 [doi]']",,['R01CA60859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, leukemic transformation in untreated ET seems to be a rare event. This is probably due to the fact that, at some time during their clinical course, most ET patients receive chemotherapy and are thereby exposed to leukemogenic challenge. We report on a woman with ET who had not received cytoreductive treatment prior to the development of acute myeloid leukemia, indicating that this transformation was a natural progression of her disorder.","['Andersson, P O', 'Ridell, B', 'Wadenvik, H', 'Kutti, J']","['Andersson PO', 'Ridell B', 'Wadenvik H', 'Kutti J']","['Hematology Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital/Sahlgrenska, S-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden. per-ola.andersson@sahlgrenska.se']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/pharmacology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*complications/*immunology']",,2000/02/09 09:00,2000/03/04 09:00,['2000/02/09 09:00'],"['2000/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2000/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2000 Jan;79(1):40-2. doi: 10.1007/s002770050007.,,"['00790040.277 [pii]', '10.1007/s002770050007 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
