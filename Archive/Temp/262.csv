These cultures show the capacity to induce responsiveness to lectin mitogens in immature thymocytes. Such monolayers induce Thy-1 expression in nude mouse spleen and bone marrow cells. The functional macrophage-lymphocyte depleted TRE monolayers can be cryptically infected by radiation leukemia virus (RadLV). However, RadLV-infected TRE cells lack the capacity to induce neoplastic transformation in normal weanling and newborn thymocytes. Cultures prepared from C57BL/Ka mice treated with a leukemogenic course of irradiation produce a B-fibrotropic nonleukemogenic virus, and normal thymocytes cocultivated with these monolayers do not undergo in vitro transformation. It is concluded that TRE monolayers depleted of macrophages and lymphocytes: (1) exhibit the functional capacity to induce some of the properties of mature T cells; (2) are infectable by RadLV; (3) are one of the sites for expression of ecotropic virus after leukemogenic fractionated irradiation; and (4) are not capable of transforming normal thymocytes in vitro.",,,,,

This observation, coupled with the fact that the p120 protein encoded by this virus has been shown to undergo an apparent autophosphorylation to yield phosphotyrosine in vitro, suggests that Abelson virus encodes a protein kinase that phosphorylates tyrosine in transformed cells. These results are similar to those obtained previously with Rous sarcoma virus and suggest, by analogy, that the modification of cellular polypeptides through the phosphorylation of tyrosine may be involved in cellular transformation by Abelson virus. p120 isolated from transformed cells contains phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. The phosphotyrosine is found at two sites in the protein. p120 therefore may be a protein kinase that undergoes autophosphorylation in vivo.",PMC319169,,,,

We have used recombinant DNA technology to isolate and to characterize the sequences that are essential in the transformation process. Integrated MC29 proviral DNA was isolated from a library of recombinant phage containing DNA from the MC29-transformed nonproducer quail cell line Q5. The cloned DNA was analyzed by Southern blotting of restriction endonuclease digests and by electron microscopic visualization of R loops formed between the cloned DNA and MC29 or helper virus RNA. It was found that the 9.2-kilobase cloned DNA insert contains approximately 4 kilobases of viral sequences and 5.2 kilobases of quail cellular sequences. The viral sequences contain all of the MC29-specific sequences and 5' helper-related sequences as well as part of the envelope region. The size of the cloned EcoRI fragment is the same as that of the major band in EcoRI-cleaved Q5 DNA that hybridizes to viral sequences.

Cells grown for short times in the presence of BrdUrd were fractionated into synchronous populations by centrifugal elutriation. The DNA was cleaved by restriction endonucleases, and fragments containing bromouracil (BrU-DNA) were isolated in density gradients of Cs2SO4. BrU-DNA fractions replicated during selected S-phase intervals were subjected to electrophoresis in agarose gels, transferred to diazobenzyloxymethyl-paper, and hybridized to an alpha-globin probe. Reconstruction experiments using a cloned mouse EcoRI fragment including one alpha-globin gene demonstrated that the extent of hybridization provides an accurate measurement that the extent of hybridization provides an accurate measurement of the concentrations of specific fragments in a DNA sample. The alpha-globin fragments were detected primarily in the BrU-DNA replicated during early S phase (approximately the first quarter of S). This result was confirmed in other synchrony experiments and by Cot analysis. (Cot is the initial concentration of DNA in mol of nucleotide per liter multiplied by the time in sec.) The temporal replication of mouse satellite sequences, already known from previous studies, was used as an internal control for cell synchrony. To show that the globin sequences were not lost from the cells in late S phase during isolation of the DNA, we quantitated th alpha-globin fragments in BrU-DNA prepared from a mixture of cells in early and late S phase. The results demonstrate that the alpha-globin gene regions in these cells are replicated during early S phase.",PMC319938,,,,

The REV genome (5.5 kilobases) had a deletion of 3.69 kilobases in the gag-pol region, confirming the genetic defectiveness of REV. In addition, REV lacked the sequences corresponding to the env gene but contained, instead, a contiguous stretch (1.6 to 1.9 kilobases) of the specific sequences presumably related to viral oncogenicity. Unlike those of other avian acute leukemia viruses, the transformation-specific sequences of REV were not contiguous with the gag-pol deletion. Thus, REV has a genome structure similar to that of a defective mink cell focus-inducing virus or a defective murine sarcoma virus. An additional class of heteroduplex molecules containing the gag-pol deletion and two other smaller deletion loops was observed. These molecules probably represented recombinants between the oncogenic REV and its helper virus.",PMC171086,,,,

We have shown that the presence of 80 to 100 mM NaCl inhibits this cleavage activity in vitro by over 90%. Further, the addition of 80 to 100 mM excess NaCl in vivo to chronically infected cultures of MJD-54 mouse fibroblasts also caused inhibition of Pr65gag cleavage. Specifically, the excess salt added to cells: (i) caused a greater than 90% decrease in virus production; (ii) increased the Pr65gag/p30 ratio in virions produced by more than threefold; and (iii) in pulse-chase experiments, showed a 10-fold decrease in the amount of Pr65gag cleaved after 3 h. In contrast, during this chase interval there was only a slight diminution, i.e., about two fold, in the cleavage of env precursor polyprotein Pr80env, suggesting that cleavages of Pr65gag and Pr80env are differently controlled. Additionally, electron microscopic examination of the excess salt-treated cells showed a twofold increase in the number of associated immature particles, consistent with the observed higher than average Pr65gag/p30 ratio. The inhibitory effects were also found if excess KCl or MgCl2 was used instead of NaCl, suggesting that they are caused by the hypertonic state of the medium and are not dependent on the ionic species used.",PMC171104,,,,

FeLV isolated from the ST virus mixture contained RNA which sedimented in a 70S band like GA-FeSV-FeLV RNA, but F422 FeLV RNA sedimented more slowly, at 50 to 60S. After thermal denaturation, resedimentation revealed three classes of RNA subunits in ST-FeSV-FeLV RNA: the first class, 35 to 37S, was also found in ST-FeLV and other FeLVs (except F422 FeLV), in the endogenous feline virus, RD114 and in GA-FeSV-FeLV; the second class, 32 to 34S, was similar to subunits in F422 FeLV and minor components of GA-FeSV-FeLV and ST-FeLV; the third class, 25S, was detected only in ST-FeSV-FeLV RNA. Electrophoresis of RNA species in buffered formamide provided evidence that the three classes of RNA subunits distinguishable on the basis of sedimentation rates actually represent three size classes of subunits. The ST virus mixture was shown to contain about equal titres of infectious FeLV and transforming FeSV whereas GA-FeSV-FeLV had at least a 10-fold excess fo FeLV over FeSV. These observations are discussed in terms of possible origins of the three sizes of FeSV-FeLV RNA subunits and their relationships to three species of FeSV-FeLV proviral DNA described recently (Sherr et al. 1979).",,,,,

Those viruses that rapidly cause cancer appear to contain an oncogenic gene which resembles genetic sequences present in normal cells. This gene codes for a transforming protein which may be a normal cellular enzyme or a slightly altered cellular product. Its mechanism for transforming a cell is not yet known. Other oncogenic viruses, such as the chronic leukemia viruses, may not produce an oncogenic protein but may affect, by other means, specific target cells so they become malignant. Recent evidence now suggests that the majority of endogenous type C viruses are not transforming agents but inherited in the host to function in other biologic processes. These viruses do not contain transduced cellular genes which are responsible for cancer. Their role probably depends on their expression of other gene products which aid in normal development. These observations suggest that the ultimate control of human cancer may result from the identification of the oncogenic cellular-like genes transduced by some type C viruses even if a true human oncogenic virus is not isolated.",,,,,

The neutrophils were homogenized in isotonic sucrose and subjected to analytical subcellular fractionation. The sucrose density gradient fractions were assayed for ADPase activity and for principal organelle marker enzymes. ADPase activity was distributed between the plasma membrane, specific granule and soluble fractions. The plasma membrane and specific granule activities had similar kinetic and inhibitor properties but the cytosolic enzyme was clearly different. Studies with the non-penetrating inhibitor diazotized sulphanilic acid and measurements of latent activity indicate that plasma membrane ADPase activity is located on the external aspect to the cell. Its possible role in inhibiting platelet aggregation is discussed. Neutrophils were isolated from control subjects, patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia and patients in the third trimester of pregnancy. The specific activities (mU/mg protein) of ADPase activity, in contrast to those of alkaline phosphatase, were similar in all three groups. This result, together with fractionation experiments and inhibition studies strongly suggests that ADPase activity is not attributable to neutrophil alkaline phosphatase.",,,,,

The virus has been identified as the etiological agent responsible for lymphoma and neuromotor paralysis in large numbers of the mice. The majority of other wild mouse populations are generally free of infectious MuLV despite the presence of endogenous cellular DNA sequences homologous to infectious virus isolated from wild mice. Electrophoretic variation in 46 gene-enzyme systems was surveyed using mice from Lake Casitas and from a virus-negative population located in Bouquet Canyon (BC) approximately 40 miles from Lake Casitas. The LC and BC populations are genetically very similar to each other and to feral mouse populations previously studied in California and Europe. In the LC population 24% of the loci are polymorphic compared to 17% in the BC population. The average heterozygosities for the LC and Bc populations are 0.094 and 0.073, respectively. The large amount of genic variation in LC fails to support the concept of the derivation of the colony from a small number of founders.

The data show that the syncytia present in cultures of CC81 cells inoculated with BLV-infected cells are specific and arise through a mechanism similar to that responsible for the phenomenon of ""late"" polykaryocytosis described in other virus systems. The susceptibility of the CC81 cells to the syncytia-inducing effect of BLV-infected cells is comparable with that of early passages of bovine embryonic spleen cells, which were previously used as the indicator system in the SIA. Unlike the bovine embryonic spleen cells, CC81 cells retain their susceptibility to syncytia induction for long periods of cultivation. Furthermore, the syncytia induced in the CC81 cultures are larger and easier to identify. Thus, the CC81 cells can be used advantageously as the indicator system when the SIA is applied to the detection of BLV-infected lymphocytes. The results of the SIA for the detection of infective BLV agreed closely with those of the radioimmunoassay for the detection of BLV antibodies in randomly examined cattle. On the other hand, many cattle in early stages of infection were positive in the radioimmunoassay several months before they reacted in the SIA. The detection of BLV in blood lymphocytes provides a useful method for the diagnosis of BLV infection in cattle when serologic tests cannot be used, eg, calves that may have passively acquired maternal antibodies and cattle given BLV vaccines.",,,,,

The sera that were tested came from cattle in naturally infected commercial dairy herds, cattle that were infected under experimental conditions, and cattle in an isolated BLV-free herd. The tests that were compared included a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIA) with p24 antigen, a RIA with glycoprotein (gp) antigen, an agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test with gp antigen, and a virus-neutralization (VN) test that was based on inhibition of BLV-induced syncytia in cell culture. Results of the 4 serologic tests agreed for 96.8% of the sera from cattle in commercial herds. The gp RIA detected the greatest number of positive sera (188); it was followed in turn by the p24 RIA (187), the VN test (183), and the AGID test (176). The gpd RIA titers of the 12 sera that gave negative AGID results were 175 or less. In RIA, the percentage of precipitation of labeled antigen by positive sera was almost always higher with gp antigen than with p24 antigen. Satisfactory sensitivity in the p24 RIA required the acceptance of a low level of antigen precipitation, 15%, as a positive test. In the gp RIA, however, almost all positive sera precipitated at least 50% of the labeled antigen. Nonspecific precipitation of antigen in the RIA by sera from BLV-free cattle ranged from 4% to 10%. Examination of sequential serum samples from 17 experimentally infected cattle showed that BLV antibody was first detected 2 to 8 weeks after inoculation. In 9 cattle, seroconversion was detected simultaneously by all of the tests. Results from the other 8 cattle indicated that seroconversion could be detected first by p24 RIA, followed by the gp RIA and the VN test. The longest interval between RIA seroconversion and AGID seroconversion was 10 days. Monthly tests of sera from 10 laboratory cattle that were infected by contact exposure showed that 7 animals seroconverted in all tests at the same time. Two cattle were positive first in RIA, but the next month they were also positive in the VN and AGID tests. One animal was positive in the RIA and the VN test for 2 months before antibody was detected by AGID.",,,,,

Oligonucleotide fingerprinting and RNA.cDNA hybridization identified two sets of sequences in OK10 RNA: group-specific sequences, which are related to all nondefective members of the avian tumor virus group, and a sequence closely related to the subgroup-specific sequences (mcv) of the myelocytomatosis virus (MC29) subgroup of avian acute leukemia viruses. Hence, OK10 is classified as a member of the MC29 subgroup of avian tumor viruses, in agreement with classification based on its oncogenic spectrum. The group-specific sequences of OK10 RNA include partial (Delta) pol and env genes, a c-region, and, unlike those of all other members of the MC29 subgroup, a complete gag gene. Oligonucleotide mapping revealed 5'-gag-Deltapol-mcv-Deltaenv-c-3' as the order of the subgroup-specific and group-specific elements of OK10 RNA. The genetic unit gag-Deltapol-mcv, measuring approximately 6.4 kilobases, codes for the nonstructural, presumably transforming, 200,000-dalton OK10-specific protein and also includes the gag gene coding for the internal virion proteins. Because gag is the only intact virion gene shared in addition to regulatory RNA sequences between OK10 and nondefective avian tumor viruses, it is concluded that the gag gene is sufficient for the formation of a defective virus particle. Comparisons among the RNAs and gene products of different viruses of the MC29 subgroup show that they share 5'-terminal gag-related and internal mcv sequences but differ from each other in intervening gag-, pol-, and mcv-related sequences. It follows that the probable transforming genes and their protein products have two essential domains, one consisting of conserved 5' gag-related and the other of 3' mcv-related sequence elements. In the light of this and previous knowledge we can now distinguish two designs among five different transforming onc genes of avian tumor viruses: onc genes with coding sequences unrelated to virion genes, like those of Rous sarcoma virus and avian myeloblastosis virus, and onc genes with coding sequences that are hybrids of virion genes and specific sequences, like those of the MC29 subgroup viruses, of avian erythroblastosis virus, and of Fujinami sarcoma virus.",PMC350457,,,,

MPSV also transforms fibroblasts. Mice congenic for the Fv-2 locus showed marked differences in susceptibility to MPSV according to the Fv-2 genotype. MPSV was injected into C57BL/6 Fvs and C57BL/6 Fv-2r mice congenic except for the Fv-2 locus. C57BL/6 mice with the Fvs genotype were much more susceptible to MPSV than were those with the Fvr genotype. Both DDD Fv-2r mice congenic with DDD Fv-2s mice except for the Fv-2 locus and DDD Fv-2s mice, however, were sensitive to spleen focus formation by MPSV. These data indicate that at least one additional resistance locus to MPSV is present in C57BL/6 mice but not in DDD mice. Both the Fv-2 locus and the putative MSPV resistance locus (loci) Mpsvr appear to be epistatic to either of the sensitivity loci. Fibroblast focus formation by MPSV was obtained well in C57BL/6 Fv-2r and C57BL/6 Fvs fibroblasts, indicating that the genes for MPSV resistance (Fv-2r and Mpsvr) were not operating in fibroblast cells. A model is proposed which may account for the differences in response of genetically different mice to MPSV and Friend spleen focus-forming virus.",PMC171040,,,,

Virol. 34:200-212, 1980). DNA transfection techniques have been utilized to determine the regions of the ST-FeSV genome involved in malignant transformation. I have found that the 3.7-kbp 5'-end fragment of the ST-FeSV provirus (which corresponds to the 3.4-kbp 5'-end fragment of the viral genome) is sufficient to transform NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. Enzymes that cleave the ST-FeSV provirus DNA within the feline leukemia virus gag gene sequences or within the fes gene abolished the transforming activity. Preservation of the proviral large terminal repeats was also required for transformation. Transformed NIH/3T3 cells obtained by transfection of total or subgenomic ST-FeSV DNA expressed normal levels of the ST-FeSV gene product ST P85 and of its associated protein kinase activity. Furthermore, these cells contained high levels of phosphotyrosine residues, a biochemical marker associated with cellular transformation induced by certain retroviruses including ST-FeSV. These results, taken together, strongly support the concept that only those ST-FeSV proviral sequences necessary for ST P85 expression are involved in malignant transformation.",PMC171032,,,,

The PR-RSV-A genome contained two subunits joined by a linkage structure as in the genomes of M-MuLV and other mammalian retroviruses. In both viral genomes, a highly reproducible hairpin occurred at about 70 nucleotides from the 5' end of each subunit and contained 320 +/- 8 nucleotides. The stable point of linkage between the subunits in both viral genomes involved fewer than 50 nucleotides and occurred at 466 +/- 9 nucleotides from the 5' end. This places the linkage about 350 nucleotides further toward the 3' end of the subunit than the binding site of primer tRNA. Another structural feature common to both genomes was a loop in each subunit. In M-MuLV, the loop contained 3.9 +/- 0.10 kilobases (kb) and occurred at a distance of 2.2 +/- 0.05 kb from the 5' end. In PR-RSV-A, the loop was smaller (2.3 +/- 0.10 kb) and further (3.3 +/- 0.10 kb) from the 5' end. When M-MuLV RNA was heated to 70, 85, or 90 degrees C and cooled, the hairpin consistently reformed at the 5' end. No other structures typical of the native molecules reappeared. In RNA samples heated to 70 degrees C, a new loop reproducibly occurred near the 5' end of each subunit, but this loop was not found in samples heated to higher temperatures. Based on all of these findings, we conclude that the genome of PR-RSV-A shares several features with M-MuLV and other mammalian retroviruses and that the primer tRNA molecules are not involved in the linkage of the two subunits in either genome. We also conclude that the dimer linkage and the loops in subunits are typical of the native molecules and that their formation requires a special environment.",PMC171018,,,,

The enzyme makes single-strand breaks in linear or covalently closed circular phage double-stranded DNA molecules. The enzyme was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE- and carboxymethyl-Sepharose columns followed by electrophoresis in DNA-containing polyacrylamide gels. The enzyme was separated from reverse transcriptase (p80pol), and the final endonuclease preparation contained no detectable reverse transcriptase activity. The DEAE-Sepharose column-purified endonuclease activity contained a polypeptide of about 40,000 Mr that we term p40. Peptide mapping experiments demonstrated that p40 shares methionine-labeled tryptic peptides with Pr200gag-pol and Pr135pol. Six major methionine-labeled tryptic peptides derived from p40 were found in Pr200gag-pol, but only five of these were detected in Pr135pol. The four core proteins (p30, p15, pp12, and p10) and p80pol plus p40 account for most, but not all, of the peptide sequences of Pr200gag-pol. The endonuclease-associated p40 is similar in size and precursor origin to the avian retrovirus-coded endonuclease (p32). In view of these similarities to the avian p32 endonuclease and its association with partially purified Rauscher murine leukemia virus-associated endonuclease preparations, we propose that p40 is the Rauscher murine leukemia virus-coded endonuclease.",PMC171005,,,,

The cytotoxic sera from the normal animals showed a much lower activity; again, there was a lack of cytotoxic response at lower serum dilutions. Low dilutions (1 to 64) of sera from tumor-bearing and normal mice were found to inhibit the MTV-specific cytotoxic activity of rabbit anti-MTV serum on the Mm5mt/c1 cell line. Specificity of this phenomenon was deduced from the fact that there was less inhibition by the mouse sera of anti-Rauscher leukemia virus-specific cytotoxic activity to Rauscher leukemia virus-infected cells and of anti-vaccinia virus serum to vaccinia virus-infected cells. Absorption of the mouse sera with rabbit anti-gp52 serum almost completely abolished the inhibition; after absorption with MTV, inhibition was somewhat reduced.

Resistance to these viruses is linked to H-21 in both B10.S and C57BL/10 mice. The resistance of virus-infected mice to transplantation of syngeneic. A- or D-RadLV-induced lymphoma cells was similar to their resistance to leukemogenesis by the same viruses. This resistance could be transferred by lymphoid cells from immune donors to normal recipients, and it was specific for RadLV lymphomas. Virus-primed (responder x sensitive)F1 hybrids rejected only resistant-type parental lymphoma cells. Hence, it appears that H-21-linked resistance to RadLV leukemogenesis is regulated by Ir genes. Resistant mice immunized by A- or D-RadLV rejected syngeneic lymphoma cells, irrespective of whether they were sensitive or resistant to the RadLV variant used for the induction of the lymphoma cells. It follows that resistant and sensitive type lymphomas are antigenically similar for the effector mechanism, and that the Ir genes may be expressed in the sensitization phase of the reaction. In virus-infected mice which are resistant to A- or D-RadLV we were able to demonstrate the presence of preleukemic lymphocytes. Normal mice could be immunized by these preleukemic cells against lymphoma challenge. These data are interpreted to suggest that mice having H-21-linked resistance to RadLV infection may be sensitized by their preleukemic cells, and that these preleukemic cells are then arrested in their development as a result of the immune response.",,,,,

We have analyzed RNA from AMV virions and from AMV-transformed producer and nonproducer cells by gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to chemically activated paper and hybridization to several complementary DNA (cDNA) probes. Using a cDNA probe specific for AMV, we identified two RNA species of 7.2 and 2.3 kb, which were present in all AMV-transformed cells and in all AMV virion preparations examined. The 7.2 kb species, which is presumably the genome of AMV, appears to contain the entire retroviral gag gene and at least part of the pol gene, but lacks much (or all) of the env gene. Thus AMV differs from other acute leukemia viruses described to date, since the latter have genomes of 5.5 to 5.6 kb, have only part of the gag gene and lack pol sequences. The smaller RNA does not contain gag-, pol- or env-specific nucleotide sequences but does carry nucleotide sequences from both the 5' and 3' termini of the genome, suggesting that it may be a subgenomic mRNA. Both the 7.2 and 2.3 kb species were associated with the 70S RNA complex in virions. These results suggest that AMV, unlike other acute leukemia viruses, does not express its transforming gene via a gag-related ""fusion"" protein but rather as a (so far unidentified) protein translated from a subgenomic mRNA.",,,,,

Dithiothreitol reversed the inhibition by CMPS, suggesting that a sulfhydryl residue is involved. This residue is apparently not located at the substrate binding site of the transport protein, since methotrexate failed to protect the system from inactivation by either CMPS or N-ethylmaleimide, and the transport protein retained the ability to bind substrate (at 4 degrees C) after exposure to these inhibitors (at 37 degrees C). Methotrexate efflux was also inhibition by CMPS (50% at 4 microM), indicating that both the uptake and efflux of methotrexate in L1210 cells occur via the same transport system.

Recent Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations have classified benzidine as a carcinogen, which severely restricts its use in the clinical laboratory. Twenty-two specimens from normal control subjects and leukemia patients, previously classified by FAB criteria, were stained with benzidine and two alternate chromogens, diaminobenzidine and Hanker-Yates reagent (p-phenylenediamine and pyrocatechol). In a random, blind fashion, three experienced observers scored the stains from each case according to quality of smear, degree of peroxidase positivity, tinctorial distinction between nucleus and cytoplasm, and overall acceptability of the stain. All three observers rated the substitute chromogens as adequate for routine myeloperoxidase cytochemical staining.

This spectrum is identical to that obtained in acute lymphatic leukemia.

The latters can be avoided by the mechanical dispersion of tumor cells and by their injection through a stereotaxic frame.

In CLL lymphocytes, levels of PGE and PGF2 alpha were normal or low. When normal lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), the level of PGE and PGF2 alpha fluctuated, followed by corresponding changes in the level of cyclic nucleotides. In cultured ALL lymphocytes, the level of PGE remained high, while cyclic 3':5'-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) level was constantly low, and the initial level of PGF2 alpha fluctuated in relation to similar oscillations of cyclic 3':5'-guanosine monophosphate (c-GMP). These values were lower, although not significantly, when ALL lymphocytes were stimulated with PHA. When CLL lymphocytes were stimulated with PHA, the level of PGE remained low (20 pgrams), as did that of c-AMP. The level of PGF2 alpha, after a brief initial increase (130 pgrams), returned to and remained at a lower level (60 pgrams) while the level of c-GMP was persistently high.

The onc elements of different avian and mammalian sarcoma viral isolates are each homologous to subsets of cellular DNA sequences which have no well-defined role in normal cells. Because of the lack of significant homology between helper viral genes and cellular onc sequences, the recombinational mechanisms which facilitate the formation of sarcoma viral genomes remain unclear. In Moloney murine sarcoma virus, viral onc (or v-mos) and cellular onc (or c-mos) sequences exhibit complete and uninterrupted homology as determined by heteroduplex and restriction enzyme analyses of molecularly cloned DNA. By contrast, the cellular counterparts of the onc elements of Rous sarcoma virus (G. Cooper and R. Parker, personal communication), avian erythroblastosis virus (B. Vennstrom, personal communication), Abelson leukaemia virus (D. Baltimore, personal communication), Harvey sarcoma virus (E. Scolnick, personal communication) and simian sarcoma virus (R.

Activation is blocked by the addition of the oligosaccharide chain of the ganglioside GM1, the receptor for the toxin. When the cells are preincubated with choleragen at 4 degrees C and then incubated with oligosaccharide at 37 degrees C, adenylate cyclase is activated less than 10%. When the preincubation phase is above 18 degrees C, adenylate cyclase becomes activated and the amount of activation depends on the time of preincubation. This inhibitory effect of the oligosaccharide is also observed with human lymphocytes and rat glial C6 cells but not with Friend erythroleukemic and mouse neuroblastoma N18 cells. The latter two cell lines have large numbers ot toxin receptors, whereas the former two cell lines have few receptors. When the number of toxin receptors in HeLa and C6 cells is increased by treating the cells with GM1, activation of adenylate cyclase by choleragen is no longer blocked by the oligosaccharide. The oligosaccharide has a corresponding effect on the displacement of bound 125I-choleragen. When bound to cells at 4 degrees C, most of the radiotoxin is displaced from HeLa, C6, and lymphocytes but not from Friend, N18, or HeLa cells pretreated with GM1. In untreated HeLa cells, dissociation of toxin-receptor complexes by the oligosaccharide depends on the time and temperature of complex formation; above 18 degrees C, the toxin rapidly becomes stably bound to the cells. The inhibitory effect of GM1 oligosaccharide us reversible, as, once it is removed, the small amount of toxin that remains bound can activate adenylate cyclase. These results are consistent with a model in which choleragen, which is multivalent, must bind to several GM1 molecules on the cell surface in order to subsequently activate adenylate cyclase. Lateral mobility of toxin-receptor complexes may be required only to achieve multivalent binding in cells with few receptors.",,,,,

Immediately before or after transplant, blood products passively transferred antibodies to EB viral capsid antigen (VCA) and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA). In most recipients, passively-transferred antibodies were replaced by endogenous antibodies regardless of whether donor or recipient had EBV antibodies before transplantation. Commencement or resumption of endogenous EBV antibody production was not associated with signs of infectious mononucleosis or heterophil antibody responses. Antibodies to VCA rose to abnormally high titers, followed successively by antibody to early antigens (EA), and disproportionately low levels of anti-EBNA. Unusually high anti-VCA and anti-EA levels persisted when tests of immune function returned to normal. Antibodies to other herpes group viruses showed no consistent changes. We conclude that (1) EBV does not cause significant clinical problems in marrow transplant recipients; (2) persistent EBV infection can become established or reestablished in the presence of antibodies to EBV; (3) marrow transplant recipients show the same exaggerated immune response to EBV as other immunodeficient patients; and (4) the pattern of EBV-specific antibodies may be a more sensitive measure of defective cell-mediated immunity than most conventional tests of immune function.",,,,,

The only known difference between these two strains is that 129-Gix- mice express no known demonstrable gp70 or p30, whereas 129 mice express both these MuLV-related components as mendelian traits not associated with the production of virions. We infer that MuLV-related components at the cell surface are concerned in effector-target interactions leading to cytolysis under the conditions described. Although the congenic strains B6 (Gix-) and B6-Gix+ differ likewise in expression of the type-variant Gix-gp70, both strains express a second type-variant of gp70. The lytic activity of spleen cells of these two strains for RLmale1 cells was equally high, suggesting that involvement in lytic effector-target interactions is common to gp70 molecules in general. When used as targets rather than as effectors 129 spleen cells were more sensitive to lysis than 129-Gix- spleen cells. Pre-exposure to gp70, purified from R-MuLV, rendered splenic effector cells less lytic. Pre-exposure to gp70 also rendered RLmale1 target cells less sensitive to lysis. One explanation of these findings is that both target cells and effector cells express gp70 and also receptors for gp70 and that this is the basis of mutual cellular recognition leading to lysis in the circumstances described.",,,,,

We have analyzed the virus-related DNA and RNA of avian leukosis virus (ALV)-induced tumors in an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism of ALV oncogenesis. Our results show that viral gene products are not required for maintenance of neoplastic transformation. Primary and metastatic tumors are clonal and thus presumably derived from a single infected cell. Most importantly, tumors from different birds have integration sites in common. Tumor cells synthesize discrete new poly(A) RNAs consisting of viral sequences covalently linked to cellular sequences. These RNA species are expressed at high levels in tumor cells. Our results suggest that in lymphoid tumors, an ALV provirus is integrated adjacent to a specific cellular gene, and the insertion of the viral promoter adjacent to this gene results in its enhanced expression, leading to neoplasia. These results have potentially important implications for the mechanism of non-viral carcinogenesis.",,,,,

Seven of nine RAV-2-induced bursal tumors contained single proviruses, and all seven solitary proviruses had suffered deletions. The detailed structures of four of these proviruses show that major deletions had occurred near or at the 5' ends, spanning sequences potentially important in the production of viral RNA. One provirus also lacked most of the information coding for the replicative functions of the virus. Restriction maps suggest that these four proviruses were inserted in similar regions of the host genome. We have studied virus-specific RNA in four bursal tumors and four cell lines derived from bursal tumors. No normal viral RNA species were detectable in three tumors containing single aberrant proviruses. However, transcripts of 2.2. kb which reacted only with a hybridization probe specific for the 5' end of viral RNA were observed in one of these three tumors. Analogous species, varying in length from 1.5 to 6.0 kb, were observed in a fourth bursal tumor with multiple proviruses and in all four cell lines. (This tumor and the cell lines also contained normal species of ALV mRNA and apparently normal proviral DNA). The structures of the aberrant proviruses and the absence of normal viral RNA in some tumors indicate that expression of viral genes is not required for maintenance of the tumor phenotype. In at least some cases, the mechanism of oncogenesis may involve stimulation of transcription of flanking cellular sequences by a viral promoter.",,,,,

Mean latent periods before detection of viremia were 3.4 +/- 1.8 (S.D.) and 13.0 +/- 5.9 months for kittens and adults, respectively. First detection of FeLV infection was accompanied by a sharp although transient drop in peripheral white blood cell numbers, and infection onset triggered the humoral immune response which was comprised of separate antibodies with virus-neutralizing and tumor lysis activities. High titers of virus-neutralizing antibody appeared in transiently viremic cats immediately following elimination of viremia; this antibody was rarely detected in cats that remained persistently viremic. Lytic complement-dependent antibody to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen appeared in most cats 1 to 2 weeks after FeLV infection was first detected, and subsequently high titers of this antibody remained in both transiently and persistently infected cats. If the rate of FeLV infection was summarized by using viremia and/or antibody appearance, then 95% of the kittens became infected within 1 year and 61% of the adults within 2 years. Adult cats are, therefore, susceptible to FeLV infection following long-term natural exposure, and their apparent resistance cannot be attributed to a protective humoral immune response that developed immediately after exposure commenced.",,,,,

In patients with solid tumors: (a) dosages were escalated from 5 to 50 mg/sq m/day; (b) toxicity (stomatitis, myelosuppression, and phlebitis) occurred at the dosage level of 50 mg/sq m/day; and (c) no oncolytic responses were noted. Serum concentrations of total and free AMSA were assayed by a fluorescence technique and declined in a biphasic manner with free AMSA declining more rapidly than total AMSA. Dosages of greater than 100 mg/sq m/day were required to maintain serum concentrations of total and free AMSA greater than 0.2 microM for the entire five-day schedule. The results suggest that maximum tolerated dosages of AMSA may differ in children with leukemia and solid tumors; however, hematopoietic toxicity could not be fully evaluated in the patients with leukemia. AMSA has clear antileukemic activity that warrants future Phase II trials.",,,,,

Within 2 to 4 days after virus infection, the granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells from the bone marrow and spleen of the infected mice became insensitive to inhibition by LIA, even though colony morphology appeared normal. Shortly after, or simultaneously with, the detection of the colony-forming cell resistance phenomenon, LIA was found in bone marrow, spleen, and thymus cells. The abnormal interactions appeared to be related to induction of lymphoma in BALB/c neonates and to a lymphoproliferative disease in adult BALB/c mice. In contrast, normal cellular interactions were noted in adult C57BL/6 mice which were not susceptible to the Abelson disease after virus inoculation and in untreated neonatal and adult BALB/c and adult C57BL/6 mice. Their colony-forming cells were sensitive to inhibition by LIA, and no LIA was detected in their bone marrow, spleen, and thymus cells. The abnormal cellular interactions are similar to those noted in human leukemia, lymphoma, and ""preleukemia."" This suggests that Abelson virus-infected mice can serve as a model for the study of LIA interactions.",,,,,

The cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels of urine and plasma in normal subjects, in noncancer subjects, and in cancer subjects did not differ significantly. The cGMP levels in the noncancer group were similarly unchanged from those in the normal group. However, mean cGMP levels in the urine and plasma of patients with neoplastic diseases were, respectively, 2- and 3-fold greater than the normal values (p less than 0.005 for urine and p less than 0.05 for plasma). Pharmacokinetic studies with [3H]cGMP in nine healthy controls and 15 patients with neoplasia showed that the mean production rate of this nucleotide in patients with metastatic cancer was elevated when compared to normal patients, but many values fell within the normal range. In acute leukemia, the production rate was seven times normal, with four of five patients having values clearly outside the normal range. The plasma clearance rate in patients with neoplasia was not decreased when compared to that in normal patients. It is proposed that an increased production rate, rather than any change in plasma clearance, accounts for the increased levels of cGMP in the plasma and urine of some patients with neoplastic disease.",,,,,

Cyclic AMP was found to be a concentration dependent inhibitor of colony proliferation in all systems tested. Cyclic GMP was an inconsistent enhancer of colony proliferation in all systems in a manner which was not clearly concentration dependent. The effect of PGE1 in normal systems was highly variable depending on the culture conditions, but it was generally found to be an inhibitor of colony proliferation. Cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP and PGE1 altered the release of colony stimulating activity from adherent bone marrow cells in a manner opposite to the direct effects of these compounds on progenitor cell proliferation. Abnormalities in response to PGE1 were found in progenitors from patients with CML (deficient inhibition), AMoL (stimulation of proliferation in certain concentration ranges), and MF (enhanced proliferation). Studies on one of the patients with MF indicated that a normally responding population could be defined by density-gradient separation. These data confirm the capacity of these compounds to modulate in vitro proliferation of myeloid progenitors, and suggest that aberrations of response to PGE1 may occur in subpopulations of cells from several myeloproliferative disorders.",,,,,

Four fibroblast-transforming strains of Abelson murine leukemia virus were identified, based on the sizes of the Abelson murine leukemia virus-specific phosphoproteins produced by these isolates. Two of these strains, the standard P120- and the P160-producing viruses, transformed lymphoid cells efficiently in vitro and induced Abelson disease in vivo. Two other strains, which synthesized small Abelson murine leukemia virus-specific proteins with molecular weights of 90,000 (P90) and 100,000 (P100), transformed lymphoid cells very poorly both in vitro and in vivo. The reduced oncogenic potentials of these isolates were correlated with a high level of synthesis of fairly unstable P90 and P100. In addition, neither P90 nor P100 functional efficiently in protein kinase assays. The correlation of abnormal metabolism and deficient protein kinase activity with the reduced oncogenic potentials of these virus strains supported a direct role for these proteins and the kinase activity in transformation. Furthermore, these results suggested that the requirements for lymphoid cell transformation and fibroblast transformation are different.",PMC353704,,,,

Restriction endonuclease analyses of the DNAs of RAV-0-infected cells indicated that unique integration sites of RAV-0 DNA were detectable in clones of RAV-0-infected cells but not in mass-infected cell cultures. In addition, the sites of integration of RAV-0 DNA differed in each of the seven clones of RAV-0-infected cells examined. Thus, endogenous RAV-0 proviruses appeared to integrate at multiple sites in cellular DNA, which were distinct from the sites of integration of endogenous RAV-0 genomes. Since exogenous RAV-0 proviruses are expressed at 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold-higher levels and are 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold more infectious in transfection assays than the endogenous RAV-0 genome of uninfected V+ chicken cells, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that transcription of the endogenous RAV-0 genome is regulated by flanking cellular DNA sequences. Although all RAV-0-infected cells contained infectious RAV-0 DNA and produced high titers of RAV-0 compared with uninfected V+ cells, different clones of RAV-0 infected chicken cells differed by as much as 30-fold in their levels of virus production. The infectivity of the DNA of each clone of RAV-0-infected cells correlated with the amount of virus produced by that clone. However, these differences did not appear to be correlated either with the number of exogenous RAV-0 proviruses in different clones or with the infectivity of RAV-0 produced by different clones, indicating that differences either in modification of RAV-0 DNAs or in the cellular sequences flanking exogenous RAV-0 DNAs were responsible for the observed differences in expression and infectivity.",PMC353696,,,,

Macrophages, defined as Thy 1.2-negative, Ia-positive, adherent, phagocytic, radioresistant cells present in the spleen and the peritoneal cavity, are required to obtain primary in vitro anti-FMR responses. In most of our experiments they were not necessary in secondary reactions. In primary responses, macrophages and responder T cells must be compatible at least at the I region of the major histocompatibility complex. Anti-Ia antibodies inhibit the response. A rat soluble factor (Interleukin 2) can replace macrophages in primary anti-FMR CTL-mediated reactions. These results suggest that macrophages function during primary anti-FMR response by interacting with a helper T cell rather than with CTL precursors. In agreement with this hypothesis, it appears that the H-2 restriction of F1 hybrid anti-FMR CTL generated in vitro in primary reaction is not related to the H-2 specificities of the parental macrophages used and depends only on the H-2 antigens of the stimulating tumor cells.",,,,,

This treatment has, however, not produced a higher tumor yield, neither of the skin nor of the internal organs, than that produced by X-irradiation in utero alone. This failure seems partly due to the dysplastic nature of the epidermis of prenatally X-irradiated mice, which also fails to respond to TPA application by way of hyperplasia or by an increased inflammation tendency and ulcer formation.

The availability of pure anhydro-araIC 3'-acetate made possible a comparative study of the antineoplastic, antiviral and biochemical potencies of anhydro-araIC 3'-acetate with the structurally related agents 2,2'-anhydro-1-(3'-O-acetyl-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine (anhydro-araC 3'-acetate) and 2,2'-anhydro-1-(beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodocytosine (anhydro-araIC). The presence of the 5-iodo substituent and/or the 3'-O-acetyl group on 2,2'-anhydro1-(beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine (anhydro-araC) did not alter the capacity of these agents to exert cytotoxic and antineoplastic activity against L1210, P388, L5178Y and human leukemia cells and against human colon and rectal carcinomas, as well as antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus Type 1. All of the compounds caused inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA of L1210 cells in culture, with anhydro-araIC 3'-acetate being significantly less inhibitory than the other derivatives. Little or no interference with RNA and protein synthesis was produced by these pyrimidine nucleosides. Both anhydro-araIC 3'-acetate and anhydro-araIC were potent inhibitors of the activity of DNA polymerase alpha from the L1210 leukemia at the nucleoside level, while anhydro-araC 3'-acetate and anhydroaraC were non-inhibitory; none of the agents caused inactivation of DNA polymerase beta. The findings suggest that the antineoplastic and antiviral activities of the 2,2'-anhydro-arabinosylcytosine nucleosides may be the result of biochemical actions different from those of araC.",,,,,

It was found that the target cells which could be transformed in vitro by AEV were cells of light density (1.060-1.065 g/cm3), having a modal sedimentation velocity at unit gravity between 4.0 and 6.0 mm/hr, expressing an immature antigen at a low level and a brain-related antigen at a high level.

One cell line, CTCL-2, is now independent of added growth factor; the others continue to show absolute dependency on its presence. All lines have been in continuous culture for at least 4 months and some for > 1 year. They are erythrocyte-rosette positive and are negative for Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen. Most of the lines are negative for Fc and complement receptors and for surface immunoglobulin except that CTCL-1 and CTCL-2 have some cells positive for these cell surface markers. Results of histochemical studies on these cell lines are similar to the known patterns for fresh cells from their disease of origin. Cell line CTCL-3 has an abnormal karyotype, but no detectable chromosomal abnormalities were found in the other lines, consistent with the karyologic features of their clinical sources. Because T cells from normal donors do not respond to pp-TCGF unless the cells are first ""activated"" by a lectin mitogen such as phytohemagglutinin or an antigen, the direct response to pp-TCGF of T cells from patients with T-cell neoplasias suggests that the cell lines represent a transformed neoplastic cell population.

In this paper we show that the mutant synthesizes a gag-gene related protein (delta p75) which is about 1000 daltons smaller than the protein, p75, induced by wild-type AEV. The mutant protein lacks 3 of the approximately 53 lysine-arginine tryptic peptides resolved in p75 and also contains an additional peptide. By cleavage of delta p75 with p15 protease and analysis of the fragments for size and peptide composition, the deletion in delta p75 could be located in the non-gag region of the molecule. In contrast, with p40 AEV, a second AEV-specific protein synthesized in in vitro translation experiments, there is no change in size of translation products obtained from td359 AEV RNA.

After hormone stimulation, cells previously responsive become refractory to further stimulation. Diminution in responsiveness correlates with a quantitative reduction in the numbers of specific complementary hormone receptors present. Murine leukemia cells, as one example ""escape"" antibody-mediated destruction through the mechanism of antigenic modulation. Resistance of the cells correlates with a reduction of the numbers of specific antigens present. In both down regulation and modulation, continued cellular metabolism in the absence of ligand leads to a re-expression of the hormone receptor/membrane antigen involved.

Such inhibition is not dependent on the use of infectious virus, and can be documented by using particles whose infectivity has been abolished by irradiation with ultraviolet light. Lymphoid cells that had been preincubated with viruses at concentrations approximating 10 particles per cell and for only 2 hours were inhibited by as much as 83% in ability to respond to the lectins employed.

An important step in this process involves the production by thymocytes of recombinant polytropic retroviruses (MCF viruses). These leukaemogenic agents arise by recombination of genes from the env regions of endogenous precursor viruses. Sequences in these regions encode the envelope glycoprotein gp70 (ref. 6). Thus far, each cloned isolate of recombinant virus from AKR and HRS/J mice has been found to possess unique oligonucleotide sequences in its env region, as well as clone-specific peptides in its gp70 (refs 7,8). Therefore, the polytropic viruses of these leukaemia-susceptible mice are extremely diverse. These findings suggest that random recombination of env genes gives rise to leukaemogenic polytropic viruses. McGrath and Weissman have proposed that thymocytes with cell surface receptors for the gp70 of a particular leukaemogenic virus are the target cells for malignant transformation by that specific virus. In view of the diversity of polytropic viral gp70, their hypothesis would predict extensive phenotypic diversity among spontaneous thymic leukaemias. In contrast, leukaemias induced by a particular leukaemogenic recombinant virus would always have the same phenotype. Here we verify these predictions experimentally.",,,,,

This protein was not precipitated by antisera specific for detergent-disrupted C3H-strain MMTV (C3H-MMTV); C3H-MMTV glycoproteins; C3H-MMTV nonglycosylated proteins; GR-MMTV p25 or p12; RIII strain (milk) MMTV proteins; or Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) proteins; nor was it precipitated by normal rabbit serum. Two-dimensional thin layer analysis of 35S-methionine-containing tryptic peptides revealed that five of nine gp33 peptides and one of seven gp55 peptides are shared by gP130 and gPr76env. The envelope protein precursor, gPr76env, contains all of the gp33 peptides and six of seven gp55 peptides. One peptide in gPr76env, possibly a gp55-gp33 junction peptide, is also apparently present in gP130. Six of ten p25 peptides and four more gag-related peptides are shared by PR78gag and gP130. Protein gP130 also contains several tryptic peptides not found in gPr76env or in the core protein precursors Pr78gag, Pr110gag or Pr180gag-pol. Radioimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that gP130 could be precipitated from extracts of GR-MMTV cells with anti-MMTV serum even after antibodies to the known MMTV structural proteins had been removed from the serum by absorption. Both gP130 and a second protein, p30, were found in immunoprecipitates of detergent-disrupted isotopically labeled GR-MMTV treated with the absorbed anti-MMTV serum. These results suggest that antibodies to gP130 in the anti-MMTV serum are capable of recognizing those protein sequences unique to gP130; that is, those protein sequences which are not related to viral structural proteins. In light of these data and data published previously, gP130 is apparently a polyprotein containing juxtaposed components translated from the 5' and 3' end of the MMTV genome and protein components not previously identified as virus-specific.",,,,,

Continuous cell lines transformed and chronically infected with Moloney murine sarcoma-leukemia virus (M-MSV-MuLV) or Kirsten murine sarcoma-leukemia virus were extensively multinucleated when treated with CB. Similarly, nonproducer Moloney murine sarcoma virus- or Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells multinucleated in response to CB treatment, whereas uninfected or murine leukemia virus-infected cells remained predominately binucleate under comparable conditions. Rat kidney or embryo cell cultures, one to two passages after infection with M-MSV-MuLV, were highly multinucleated following CB treatment and acquired the ability to grow in soft agar. Mouse 3T3 cell lines, newly infected with M-MSV-MuLV, exhibited a moderate degree of CB-induced multinucleation. CB-induced multinucleation was directly correlated with anchorage-independent growth for most of the cell lines tested. An exception was the Moloney murine sarcoma virus-transformed mink cells which multinucleated in response to CB treatment but were unable to proliferate in soft agar. CB-induced multinucleation was directly correlated with the tumorigenicity of M-MSV-MuLV-transformed rat cells in syngeneic animals. These results demonstrate that CB-induced multinucleation is a useful in vitro growth-related marker of cell transformation by RNA tumor viruses and, in addition, show that this parameter of cell transformation is closely correlated with anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo.",,,,,

This enhancement was critically dependent on the vaccine preparation and the administration timing of carrageenan. Carrageenan potentiated Con A-free vaccine to a much lesser extent if at all, than did Con A-bound vaccine, and it was effective only on the day of or one day after vaccine administration. This enhancement was L1210 specific as evidenced by the lethal growth of P388 leukemia cells in animals inoculated with Con A-bound L1210 vaccine and carrageenan. This is explicable by the increase of spleen but not peritoneal exudate effector cells as measured by suppression of in vitro L1210 cell growth. The following findings suggested that potentiation of Con A-bound vaccine by carrageenan was achieved by affecting suppressor macrophages. Silica and trypan blue, other antimacrophage agents, potentiated Con A-bound vaccine. The enhancement was nullified by the macrophage-stabilizing agent, poly-2-vinylpyridine N-oxide. This hypothesis was further evidenced by the following findings. Phagocytic peritoneal cells induced by Con A-bound vaccine and adhering to the plastic vessel suppressed in vitro spleen cell blastogenesis. Antimacrophage agents abrogated not only production but also activity of these suppressor cells. The combined administration of Con A-bound L1210 vaccine and carrageenan produced an enhanced antitumor immune response and prolonged the life span of tumor-bearing animals marginally but significantly.",,,,,

Deoxycytidine prevented 2-F-ara-A-induced inhibition of proliferation of L1210/0 cells in culture and alleviated 2-F-ara-a inhibition of DNA synthesis. After treatment of mice with 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-formate, intracellular levels of the 5'-triphosphate of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylfluoroadenine in leukemia cells were more than 10 times higher in L1210/0 cells than in L1210/ara-C cells. Similar results were obtained in this line of leukemia cells from mice treated with the 5'-monophosphate of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine. Thus, L1210/ara-C cells deficient in deoxycytidine kinase activity were also deficient in capacity to phosphorylate 2-F-ara-A. Kinase activity from L1210/0 cells for deoxycytidine and for 2-F-ara-A coeluted from calcium phosphate cellulose and from diethylaminoethyl cellulose columns and had similar mobility on gel electrophoresis. Deoxyadenosine kinase was clearly separated from deoxycytidine kinase. Deoxycytidine competed with 2-F-ara-A for phosphorylation by the partially purified enzyme from L1210 cells.

Eight cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and three of chronic granulocytic leukaemia in blast crisis were studied. A hitherto unrecognized small lysosomal granule characterized by AP activity and lack of MPO was present in the majority of cells of all six monoblastic leukaemias. These granules ranged from 0.05 to 0.2 micron in size and were distributed throughout the cytoplasm, frequently at the periphery of the cells. A small proportion of monoblasts showed AP reactivity in the Golgi cisternae. Both AP and MPO were positive in the granules of promonocytes; however, MPO positive granules were predominant in late promonocytes. Larger granules (0.2--0.6 micron) with MPO reactivity were characteristic of myeloblasts. In only two out of four cases did these granules show AP positivity, suggesting that, in contrast to monoblasts, AP activity is a late feature of myeloblastic differentiation. This study shows that ultrastructural cytochemistry may be helpful in the recognition and classification of acute leukaemias by demonstrating the early differentiation features of monocytic and granulocytic precursors.",,,,,

Antibodies to the virus proved to be ubiquitous, but pronounced strain differences were found in titer and onset of antibody production. These differences were related to neither release of virus in the milk nor susceptibility to spontaneous mammary tumour development of a given strain. Immunological specificity of the observed reactions was concluded from a) the failure to block the reaction by absorption with fetal calf serum, mouse milk or sheep erythrocytes, while absorption with purified virus abolished the reactivity; b) the lack of reactivity of rat sera with the mouse mammary tumour virus in this system; c) the negative response of mouse sera with Sepharose beads coated with ovalbumin; d) the lack of correlation between antibody titers to Rauscher murine leukemia virus and mammary tumour virus in this system; e) the retaining of activity to highly purified viral polypeptides; f) blocking of the reaction by preincubation with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin serum or Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus. Since germfree mice of various strains also have such antibodies, it is concluded that the reactions are not due to horizontal transmission of the virus. From the lack of correlation between antibody titers and tumour incidences, it is concluded that various systems overshadow the potential immunosurveillance role of such natural antiviral antibodies.",,,,,

The antiglobulin antibody probably represents a nonspecific response to an infective agent.

Antibodies directed against the latter immunoprecipitated a 92,000-dalton phosphoprotein (NCP 92) expressed at low levels in normal feline embryo fibroblasts as well as in feline cells of epithelial or lymphoid origin. Normal cellular proteins crossreactive with ST P85 were also detected in cell lines from various other mammalian species. These results suggest that the ST-FeSV sequences encoding for the sarcoma virus-specific domain of ST P85 originated from an evolutionarily conserved cellular gene expressed in cells of independent differentiation lineage. Immunoprecipitates containing ST-FeSV P85 exhibited a protein kinase activity that specifically phosphorylated tyrosine residues. The physiological significance of this finding is illustrated by the finding that phosphotyrosine is an intrinsic component of ST P85. Furthermore, 5- to-fold higher levels of this unusual phosphorylated amino acid were present in ST-FeSV transformants than in uninfected control cells. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues appears to be associated with cellular transformation caused by Rous sarcoma virus and Abelson murine leukemia virus. Thus, independent transforming virus isolates from birds, mice, and cats may utilize common pathways in exerting their oncogenic potential.",PMC350016,,,,

The most prominent cytoskeletal protein identified on the surface membrane of mitogen-transformed T and B lymphocytes was actin. In Epstein-Barr virus genome-positive Burkitt's lymphoma and lymphoblastoid cell lines and in two leukemia cells, the major iodinated membrane protein components were actin and alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-tubulins. These proteins were firmly connected to the cytoplasmic skeleton and could not be removed by Triton X-100. Concurrent immunofluorescence studies with specific antibodies and F(ab')2 fragments confirmed the appearance of cytoskeletal components on the biochemical data, and indicated that such cytoskeletal proteins formed distinctive patterns on the cell surface, ranging from small patches to large projections.

Enucleated as well as nucleated MGI+D+ cells also desensitized to these hormones, indicating that this desensitization is an extranuclear process. Nucleated or enucleated mutant myeloid leukemic cells that are not induced to differentiate (MGI-D- cells) were not desensitized to these hormones. The antitubulin alkaloids colchicine and vinblastine, but not the antimicrofilament compound cytochalasin B, increased the maximal hormone-induced formation of cyclic AMP in nucleated MGI+D+ cells but not in the MGI-D- cells. These alkaloids also inhibited the development of desensitization to l-isoproterenol and prostaglandin E1 in enucleated MGI+D+ cells. The results indicate that in MGI+D+ cells the cytoskeletal system puts constraints on the cells' ability to respond to these hormones and that these constraints are absent in the mutant MGI-D- cells. Because MGI+D+ but not MGI-D- cells can be induced to differentiate by the macrophage- and granulocyte-inducing protein, cytoskeletal constraints, which are also found in normal myeloid cells, may be necessary for cell competence to differentiate.

After ligation into lambda gtWES . lambda B-Sal I vector molecules, the mutant Ha-MuSV DNAs were cloned.

In vitro infection of bone marrow cells gives rise to colonies of transformed macrophage-like cells, and cloned viruses is also capable of transforming fibroblasts. The genome of MC29 contains cellular sequences which are closely related to those in other defective leukaemia viruses with similar transforming spectra. Consequently, these cellular sequences have been postulated to represent a new oncogene which has been designated mac, for macrophage transformation. MC29-transformed cells contain a gag gene-related protein of a 110,000 molecular weight (MW) (p110), which by tryptic peptide analysis has been shown to be a fusion product comprised of a gag gene-derived sequences and sequences which are presumed to be coded by the adjacent mac gene. These findings suggest that this protein may be implicated in transformation by MC29. We now describe three mutants of MC29 and synthesize smaller gag gene-related proteins.

All naturally occurring oncoviruses replicate in vivo in the tumours they induce or, as with bovine leukaemia virus, can be isolated from tumour cells grown in short-term cell culture. However, we have shown that feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is not present in a significant minority of pet cats that develop LSA. Unlike experimentally induced virus-negative leukaemias and sarcomas of other species, LSA cells from FeLV-negative LSA cats lack any FeLV proteins, including p15 or p12, and complete functional copies of FeLV provirus and thus do not produce FeLV when grown in cell culture. Thus, except for FeLV, the naturally occurring animal leukaemogenic oncoviruses seem to induce only virus-producing lymphoid tumours. Our earlier findings prompted a study to determine the frequency of occurrence of FeLV non-producer (NP) LSA in pet cats and whether NP LSAs develop in cats exposed to FeLV. We report here epidemiological data which indicate that development of NP LSAs in pet cats is associated with exposure to FeLV and suggest that FeLV may be the aetiological agent for FeLV NP feline LSAs. Thus, feline NP LSAs may be suitable for studying the potential viral aetiology and mechanism of leukaemogenesis of human lymphoid tumours in which no oncoviruses have, as yet, been proved to cause the disease.",,,,,

Sarcoma and acute leukaemia viruses transform fibroblasts and/or haematopoietic cells in culture and induce tumours with short latent periods in infected birds. In contrast, LLVs do not transform cells in vitro and require long latent periods before formation of neoplasms in vivo. The most frequent neoplasm induced by LLVs is malignant lymphoma of the bursa of Fabricius, but LLVs also induce other neoplasms, including sarcomas, nephroblastomas and erythroblastosis. The genomes of both sarcoma and acute leukaemai viruses contain specific genes responsible for viral oncogenicity, whereas the genome of LLVs apparently includes only genes required for virus replication. The genetic basis for the low oncogenic potential of LLVs is therefore obscure. The present experiments indicate that LLV-induced tumours contain transforming genes that can be detected by transfection of NH 3T3 mouse cells. These transforming genes are not linked to LLV DNA sequences, suggesting that oncogenesis by LLVs may result from indirect activation of cellular transforming genes.",,,,,

Compared with controls immunized with normal cat fibroblasts, the FL74-vaccinated cats exhibited increased resistance to FeSV-induced progressive primary and disseminated secondary tumors. Maximum protection was achieved by vaccination with live FL74 cells or with a low dose of freeze-thawed cells, but tumor cells inactivated by glutaraldehyde or paraformaldehyde were also effective. Infectious helper feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was detected in the blood of all cats after FeSV challenge, but the duration and magnitude of this viremia were reduced in animals that had been previously vaccinated with live, freeze-thawed, or paraformaldehyde-fixed cells. Although immunized cats were resistant to FeSV-induced tumors and FeLV viremia, no evidence was obtained to suggest that vaccination with dead cells induced detectable circulating antibody prior to challenge with oncogenic virus. After FeSV challenge, complement-dependent antibody to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (CDA-FOCMA) appeared at high titer in cats that were destined either to survive tumor-free or to develop small, localized, and eventually regressing tumors. Cats immunized with live FL74 cells developed CDA-FOCMA prior to challenge, and antibody appeared in these cats following an episode of transient FeLV viremia induced by virus replicating from the injected tumor cells. Therefore, apparently, a state of transient or persistent FeLV viremia regularly preceded detection of CDA-FOCMA activity. Several individually derived feline lymphoma cell lines were used as targets for CDA-FOCMA, and the results suggested that lytic activity is directed to multiple antigen determinants expressed differently by individual feline lymphomas.",,,,,

Cells nonproductively infected with such mutants exhibited a high degree of growth contact inhibition, failed to form colonies in soft agar, lacked rescuable transforming virus, and were as susceptible as uninfected control cells to transformation by wild-type (wt) AbLV pseudotype virus. In addition, each of several td AbLV nonproductively infected cell clones analyzed was found to be nontumorigenic in vivo. Biochemical analysis of td mutant AbLV-infected clones revealed levels of expression of the major AbLV translational product, P120, and a highly related 80,000-Mr AbLV-encoded protein, P80, at concentrations analogous to those in wt AbLV-transformed cells. Although the AbLV-specific 120,000-Mr polyproteins expressed in td mutant AbLV-infected clones were indistinguishable from those in wt AbLV-transformed lines with respect to molecular weight and [35S]methionine tryptic peptide composition, they each differed from wt AbLV P120 in their patterns of post-translational phosphorylation. A previously described AbLV-associated protein kinase activity is shown to recognize as substrate a major tyrosine-specific acceptor site(s) contained within a single well-resolved tryptic peptide common to both AbLV P120 and P80. In vitro [gamma-32P]ATP-mediated labeling of this phosphorylation site was reduced to below detectable levels in td mutant nonproductively infected cell clones. These findings establish that the AbLV-encoded polyprotein P120 and its associated protein kinase activity are involved in AbLV tumorigenesis.",PMC353654,,,,

Cells transformed by intact RSV DNAs contained rescuable RSV genomes that were integrated into cellular DNA and were colinear with unintegrated RSV DNA. NIH-3T3 cells were also transformable by subgenomic fragments of RSV DNA, synthesized in vitro or generated by restriction endonuclease digestion of intracellular RSV DNA. These cells did not contain rescuable RSV genomes but did contain RSV DNA fragments that efficiently induced transformation of NIH-3T3 cells in secondary transfection assays. Further analysis of the RSV DNA sequences present in these cells and transformation assays of defined fragments of RSV DNA may contribute to the elucidation of the sequences required for expression of the src gene of RSV.

By contrast, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphocytes are relatively resistant to deoxynucleosides. Growth inhibition correlates with the development of high deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools following exposure to deoxynucleosides. Leukemic T-lymphocytes are deficient in ecto-5'-nucleotidase (5'-ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.5) activity, and it has been postulated that deficiency of this enzyme decreases the capacity of these cells to degrade deoxyribonucleotides, rendering them sensitive to deoxynucleosides. We find that the sensitivity of cultured null-type leukemic lymphocytes to growth inhibition of deoxynucleosides is similar to that of T-cells. However, the null cells contain normal levels of ecto-5'-nucleotidase. We infer that ecto-5'-nucleotidase deficiency does not have a central role in determining the deoxynucleoside sensitivity of leukemic lymphocytes.",,,,,

Strong protection was obtained against primary leukaemias induced by Friend leukaemia virus (FLV), Moloney leukaemia virus (MLV), Rauscher leukaemia virus (RLV), Precerutti-Law leukaemia virus (PLLV/T2), and H179A leukaemia virus.

At the same time, these antibodies were studied, as occurring in the F1 generation of the progeneis of 51 positive and 38 negative cows. The results demonstrate two important facts: increasing age brings about a higher percentage of animals having precipitating antibodies in the leucosis-affected herd; the other important finding is that the positive reaction of a cow has no significant influence on the occurrence of the antibodies in the progeny. It was found that under the actual conditions of the mentioned herd, the horizontal transmission of enzootic leucosis was predominant and that precipitating antibodies were detected by the immunodiffusion method in animals at the age from 9 to 12 months. It is desirable from the viewpoint of diagnostics and eradication of enzootic bovine leucosis to apply with utmost consistency the serological methods of examination and individual diagnostics. There is no reason for destroying whole families of animals in which the disease occurred, because no genetically conditioned occurrence of enzootic leucosis was demonstrated in the progenies of cows suffering from the disease.

At present, instead of bovine leukemia, the name bovine leukosis is preferentially used to avoid an erroneous association with leucaemia in man. In all European Community Countries the serological diagnosis of EBL has gradually replaced hematology. A number of these serological techniques are available to-date. In the Central Veterinary Institute in Rotterdam the agar gel immunodiffusion technique, the FAT and the ELISA are used as diagnostical tools. Based on own experiments it is provisionally concluded that BLV shedding via faeces and urine does not occur. Saliva has been found infective in three out of fourteen cases (21 per cent). There is no evidence of transmission of BLV in the sperm. Prostate fluid and sperm from seven experimentally infected bulls did not contain neither BLV antigen nor antibodies to BLV. Five calves born from five cows which had been naturally served by the mentioned bulls did not show sero conversion after an observation period of one year. The authors recommend to use in AI only sperm form bulls which are negative for antibodies to BVL. Preferentially other cattle at the same farm-enterprise should be serologically tested with negative results within three months before shipment of the sperm. The humoral and cellular immunological status of leucotic cattle are examined by the application of pig erythrocytes, tetanus toxoid, Bordetella- and Aujeszky vaccine. The seroloical reactions of leucotic cattle did not differ significantly from those of the ""normal' controls. By contrast the cutaneous tuberculine reaction following administration of Mycobacterium microtii was significantly more obvious in the leucotic animals as compared to the controls.",,Transmissie en immunologische respons bij enzootische bovine leukose.,,,

In contrast, murine leukemia virus infection of T-lymphocytes or NIH/3T3 embryo fibroblasts did not stimulate release of GM-CFUc coloney-stimulating factor (CSF). Single Cell suspensions of virus-infected freshly explanted whole bone marrow grown in CSF concentrated from L929 or WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium produced more GM-CFUc colonies and GM clusters/1 X 10(5) cells compared to single cell suspensions of uninfected marrow. This phenomenon suggests that the colonoy-forming cells responding to CSF from virus-infected marrow may have been different from those responding to L929 or WEHI-3 cell CSF. The data indicate that increased granulopoiesis observed following retrovirus infection in vivo or in long-term marrow cultures was attributable in part to virus stimulation of production of CSF by adherent marrow stromal cells including macrophages.",,,,,

In cell culture, F-MuLV has an ecotropic and NB-tropic host range and causes XC cells to fuse. When injected into newborn NIH Swiss mice, F-MuLV produces hepatosplenomegaly, severe anemia, and numerous circulating hematopoietic precursors in the peripheral blood with normal thymus and lymph nodes after 3 to 6 weeks. Recently, we molecularly cloned an 8.5-kilobase pair (kbp) form of F-MuLV DNA from which we could recover the pathogenic F-MuLV virus by DNA transfection of NIH 3T3 cells. From this molecularly cloned F-MuLV DNA, we have now subcloned in pBR322 a 4.1-kbp HindIII fragment which contains in continuity 3.0 kbp from the 3' terminus (env and c region), 0.6 kbp of the terminal repeat sequences, and 0.5 kbp from the 5'terminus of the viral RNA (genome). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with this DNA fragment an then infected with the wild mouse amphotropic retrovirus (cl 1504-A). In cell culture, 1504-A is a helper-independent type C virus which has an N-tropic host range and does not cause fusion of XC cells. When injected into newborn NIH Swiss mice, 1504-A does not produce splenomegaly or thymic enlargement in mice held for up to 8 months. The transfection with the F-MuLV fragment and the infection with 1504-A consistently yielded virus preparations that were XC positive. From such virus stocks we were able to isolate both helper-independent and replication-defective XC-positive viruses. The helper-independent virus was shown to be a recombinant virus since it contains a gp70 molecule derived at least in part from F-MuLV and a specific gag precursor derived from 1504-A as determined by radioactive immune precipitation assays. When injected into newborn Swiss mice, the recombinant helper-independent virus caused hepatosplenomegaly in approximately 50% of the mice in 6 to 8 weeks. The histology of the diseased splenic tissue was indistinguishable from that seen in the disease caused by the whole F-MuLV. The replication-defective virus could be pseudotyped with new 1504-A virus, and this viral complex also caused the F-MuLV disease picture when the complex was injected into newborn Swiss mice. We conclude that the genetic information responsible for the pathogenicity of F-MuLV is contained within the 4.1-kbp DNA fragment, which includes env gene sequences, the terminal repeat sequences, and the c region sequences of the F-MuLV genome.",PMC288886,,,,

Virus-negative strains lacked these fragments in their DNA. Screening DNA from 23 additional mice revealed that, among these mice, only mice from Asia gave rise to the DNA fragments diagnostic of an AKV provirus.

These proviruses appear to derive from the East Asian ancestors of these mouse strains.

Two species of closed circular viral DNA were observed. The larger species has the same size as the linear molecule and appears to be a circularized form of linear DNA. The smaller species contains sequences common to both the linear and the larger circular viral DNA but seems to be deleted from sequences present at either one or both ends of the linear DNA.

Using monospecific antisera for immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we have detected gag gene-related proteins in the myeloblasts.

Comigrating fragments were assumed to be identical or closely related among the different strains. Fragments of different strains migrating differently were isolated, purified, radioactively labeled, and mapped by hybridization against blots of separated viral fragments. The results were as follows. (i) All strains studied were closely related. (ii) The number of internal repeats was variable among and within viral strains. (iii) B95-8 (EBV) was the only strain with a large deletion of about 12,000 base pairs at the right-hand side of the molecule.

(vii) The cleavage patterns of P3HR-1 virus DNA and the results of blot hybridizations with P3HR-1 virus fragments are not conclusive and point to the possibility that in addition to the normal cleavage pattern some viral sequences may be arranged differently.

The ratio of virus infection (ecotropic to dual-tropic) determined the kinetics of genomic masking. Some dual-tropic virus isolates could be masked routinely (i.e., converted to virions containing a dual-tropic genome and possessing the ecotropic host range) at all ratios of initial infection of mixedly infected mouse cells. The masked genomes could be rescued as infectious viruses of dual-tropic genotype and host range by an infectious center assay of the infected mouse cells on mink lung cells. Infectious center rescue of masked dual-tropic MuLV took place readily, even from cells that had been kept in continuous culture for many months after the onset of genomic masking. Some dual-tropic virus clones did not undergo genomic masking at any infection ratio with ecotropic virus. Nevertheless, such mixedly infected cultures also gave rise to phenotypically mixed virions, which contained a dual-tropic genome and had an ecotropic host range. (The phenotypically mixed virions found among the progeny of mixedly infected mouse cells were not pseudotypes, as both types of viruses were genetically nondefective, nor was the process leading to their generation a bona fide phenotypic mixing [Fischinger et al., Science 201:457-459, 1978]. Nevertheless, in this paper we use the terms pseudotype and phenotypic mixing because of the lack of a better description.) The lymphomagenic potential of dual-tropic lymphomagenic MuLV was compared with that of phenotypically mixed virions possessing an ecotropic host range and with that of a simple mixture of dual-tropic and ecotropic viruses. The phenotypically mixed pseudotype virions were more potent lymphoma inducers than were those of dual-tropic, cloned genotype. Inoculation of a simple mixture of the viruses did not increase dual-tropic virus tumorigenicity. The reason for this was probably the highly efficient inactivation of dual-tropic virus by oncovirus-inactivating factor, which is present in normal mouse serum and did not inactivate the phenotypically mixed virions. Simple mixtures of dual-tropic lymphomagenic and ecotropic virus preparations behaved like the cloned, dual-tropic virus in vivo and were equally sensitive to oncovirus-inactivating factor in vitro. Thus, phenotypic mixing of dual-tropic and ecotropic MuLV with or without concomitant genomic masking may be a highly significant phenomenon in naturally occurring lymphomagenesis. It may also be important to use phenotypically mixed viruses in the procedures used for in vivo testing of lymphomagenic dual-tropic MuLV isolates.",PMC288852,,,,

A liver scan showed patchy uptake consistent with the presence of space-occupying lesions. After oxymetholone treatment was stopped, the jaundice resolved, the liver size decreased, and the filling defects were no longer detectable on the liver scan. A year later, 5% of his white blood cells showed a consistent chromosomal abnormality. His leukocyte count increased and 85% of these cells showed the same chromosomal abnormality. The rapid replication of this abnormal clone suggests that it was leukemic. The significance of oxymetholone therapy and the occurrence of hepatic tumors and leukemia is discussed.",,,,,

Elevated expression was also observed in three patients with other hematological disorders at high risk of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, but was not apparent in seven sporadic aplastic anemia patients or four of their relatives. T-antigen expression was elevated in about one-half of patients with thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome and related conditions, with familial aplastic anemia, and in their normal relatives.

Thymuses of SMX-1-injected mice show no change in weight, morphology, or thymocyte size, and quantitative expression of Thy-1 and Lyt-2 differentiation antigens is identical to control mice. The amplified thymic expression of MuLV-related antigens that occurs spontaneously in 6-month-old preleukemic AKR mice or that can be induced in young AKR mice by leukemogenic AKR dualtropic MuLV is prevented by SMX-1.

M-MuLV-specific gene expression and an increase of virus-specific DNA copies in lymphatic target organs are characteristics of the preleukemic phase. Passive immunotherapy of new born BALB/Mo mice with anti-gp70 glycoprotein or anti-M-MuLV serum prevented viremia and delayed significantly the subsequent development of leukemia. Molecular hybridization experiments showed that both virus-specific genome transcription and virus-specific DNA amplification could be completely suppressed by antiserum treatment. Thus virus-specific RNA concentrations in target organs of immunized BALB/Mo mice of 6 months or older were as low as in normal BALB/c mice. This is an age at which untreated BALB/Mo mice have already developed malignant lymphoma. Our experiments demonstrate that treatment with antiserum interferes with the early events of virus expression and thus prevents the subsequent steps leading to leukemia.,PMC349681,,,,

Elevated levels of sarcoma virus-related RNA in normal cells infected with MuLV were indistinguishable from the levels in cells transformed spontaneously or by a carcinogen or a sarcoma virus. Because of previous reports that some carcinomas in rats also contain elevated levels of sarcoma virus-related RNA, we believe these events can be explained by a molecular genetic model which may be generally valid for initiation of carcinogenesis. The basic elements of the model are: transcriptional activation of all the multiple copies of normal rat progenitors of sarcoma virus genes is required before cellular transformation can be initiated, and initiation occurs when a spontaneous or induced mutation in any one active copy of these same genes generates a dominant transforming function.",PMC349634,,,,

This polyprotein designated McDonough FeSV P170, contained feline leukemia virus (FeLV) p15, p12, and p30 immunological determinants and shared two of its five [35S]methionine-labeled tryptic peptides with FeLV Pr180gag-pol.

The remaining McDonough FeSV P170 methionine-containing peptides were not represented within either FeLV Pr180gag-pol or Pr82env. Of interest, of the three peptides specific to the nonstructural component of McDonough FeSV P170, one was also represented in the 115,000-Mr polyproteins encoded by the Gardner and Snyder-Theilen strains of FeSV. These findings raise the possibility that the nonstructural components of polyproteins encoded by each of the three independently derived feline transforming viruses contained both common and unique regions.

The primary colonies included (i) typical feline sarcoma virus (FeSV)-transformed nonproducer clones, one of which segregated revertants, and (ii) FeSV-infected, phenotypically normal clones, three of which spontaneously converted to the transformed phenotype. The revertants and spontaneous transformants were compared with parental and sister clones expressing the opposite phenotype. Transformed subclones formed colonies in agar, were tumorigenic in nude mice, and failed to bind epidermal growth factor, whereas flat sister subclones were indistinguishable from uninfected mink cells in each of these assays. Sister subclones derived from the same infectious event contained FeSV proviruses integrated at the same molecular site, regardless of which phenotype was expressed. One revertant clone, however, lacked most FeSV proviral DNA sequences but retained terminal portions of the FeSV genome which persisted at the original site of proviral DNA insertion. Two flat subclones expressed viral RNA and the phosphorylated ""gag-x"" polyprotein (pp78gag-x) encoded by the gag and src sequences of the FeSV genome. Both of these clones were susceptible to retransformation by FeSV. Although unable to induce foci, the viruses rescued from these cells contained as much FeSV RNA as the focus-forming viruses rescued from transformed sister subclones and could be retransmitted to mink cells, again inducing FeSV gene products without signs of morphological transformation. We conclude that these FeSV genomes represent transformation-defective mutants.",PMC288788,,,,

The presence of two other oligonucleotides was correlated with positive and negative phenotypes of the virus-coded GIX cell surface antigen.

Ecotropic-nononcogenic virus is expressed in all cultures and does not adversely effect stem cell replication. We found, however, that cultures established from mice treated in vivo with lymphomagenic AKR viruses (Gross murine leukemia virus and AKR SL3 murine leukemia virus) showed a more rapid decline in CFUs and CFUc than cultures from ""normal"" AKR mice. Only the former cultures were found to produce lymphomagenic viruses. Furthermore, it was shown that addition of lymphomagenic virus to three-week marrow cultures established from AKR and SJL mice also caused a prompt decline in progenitor cell production and granulopoiesis when compared to medium-treated control cultures. The fate of all cultures was a loss of CFUc and granulocytes with a continuous production of macrophages. The change to macrophage production occurred earlier in the cultures treated with lymphomagenic virus or in those derived from lymphomagenic virus-treated animals. A study of these bone marrow-drived macrophage cultures, as well as cultures of similar morphology but of thymic origin, showed that they could be maintained as continuous lines. Cells from three of the cultures from lymphomagenic virus-treated animals plroduced locally growing sarcoma when inoculated into mice. The macrophages from the declined marrow cultures differed in certain properties from those of the established lines.",,,,,

In the presence of Mg2+, the endonuclease activity was able to convert supercoiled circular DNA duplexes to the relaxed form by introducing single-stranded nicks into the DNA. Most of the nicked DNA duplexes contained only one nick per strand, since unit length DNA was the predominant species obtained when the nicked DNA was analyzed by alkaline sucrose gradient centrifugation. The regions into which the nick could be introduced were evenly distributed around the circular DNA molecule. When Mn2+ was substituted for Mg2+ in the reaction mixture, the number of nicks introduced into circular DNA duplexes by the virus associated endonuclease was greatly increased. In contrast to circular duplexes, linear duplexes and single-stranded DNA functioned poorly as substrates for the virus-associated enzyme. The Friend leukemia virus-associated endonuclease activity is with respect to these characteristics very similar to the endonuclease activity associated with the p32 protein of the avian myeloblastosis virus [1]. The molecular weight of the Friend leukemia virus endonuclease was estimated by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column to be about 45 000.",,,,,

The disorder occurred exclusively in male cats, and all but six of the cats were between 1.5 and 5.0 years of age. There were two forms of the disease as determined by radiographic changes: joint instability and deformity, and clinical course. The most prevalent form of the disease was characterized by osteopenia and periosteal new bone formation surrounding affected joints. Marginal periarticular erosions and collapse of the joint spaces with fibrous ankylosis occurred with time, but joint instability and deformities were not seen. The second form of the disease was characterized by severe subchondral marginal erosions, joint instability, and deformities. The periosteal proliferative form resembled Reiter's arthritis of man, and the deforming type resembled human rheumatoid arthritis. The disease began as tenosynovitis and synovitis, with subsequent changes in the articular cartilage and periosteal bone. Histopathologic changes in these cats were similar to those occurring in both chronic Reiter's and rheumatoid arthritis of man. Chronic progressive polyarthritis of cats was not caused by identifiable bacteria or mycoplasma, but was etiologically linked to feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline syncytia-forming virus (FeSFV) infections. The FeSFV was isolated from the blood or was detected by a serologic test in all of the cats with the disease, whereas FeLV was isolated or identified by immunofluorescence technique in 60% of the cats. The arthritis could not be reproduced by inoculation of cell-free cynovial tissue from diseased cats or with tissue culture fluid containing FeSFV and FeLV isolates. It was postulated that arthritis was an uncommon manifestation of FeSFV infection that occurred in predisposed male cats. Feline leukemia virus may not have been directly involved in the disease, but may have acted in some way to potentiate the pathogenic effects of FeSFV.",,,,,

Although Abelson murine leukaemia virus (AbLV) resembles sarcoma viruses in its ability to transform embryo fibroblasts in cell culture, AbLV induces a rapid B-cell lymphoid leukaemia rather than fibrosarcomas in vivo. The major translational product of AbLV is a highly phosphorylated polyprotein of MW 120,000 which exhibits an associated tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity and probable transforming function. We show here that AbLV transformation resembles transformation by RNA sarcoma viruses with respect to the abolition of EGF-binding sites. EGF binding is restored to control levels following loss of polyprotein expression in morphological revertants of AbLV-transformed clones and remains uninfluenced in cell lines infected with transformation-defective (td) AbLV mutants encoding polyproteins deficient in protein kinase activity. These findings indicate that AbLV transformation involves a polyprotein-associated, tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity which mediates its effect through a mechanism resulting directly or indirectly in the abolition of EGF-binding sites.",,,,,

Both polyproteins contain FeLV structural components (p15, p12) at their amino terminus in addition to nonstructural carboxyl terminal components encoded by acquired sequences within the FeSV genome.

Genetic studies of the common inbred mouse strains showed that susceptibility to the disease was not linked to the major histocompatibility complex but correlated with the FV-1n allele, susceptibility to spontaneous leukaemia, and infection by neuropathogenic strains of LDV. These observations suggested that neuropathogenic strains of LDV elicit the disease only in those strains of mice that carry multiple copies of N-tropic C-type retroviruses in their genomes and that are permissive for retrovirus replication.

The cytotoxic activity appeared to be nonspecific. Various mouse tumor lines as well as allogeneic fibroblasts were sensitive to these effector cells.

In addition to the tumor mass, cytotoxic cells were found in the bone marrow, blood, and spleens of mice bearing M-MuSV-induced tumors.

H-2-associated resistance could be measured within 24 h of leukemia inoculation and was strongest in the spleen and absent from the liver. Although all strains of mice tested were able to resist H-2 non-identical cells, resistance in irradiated (800--900 R) mice was restricted to certain strains and their F1 hybrids, notably those of the C57BL family. Resistance in both non-irradiated and irradiated mice was not due to classical immunological rejection. Mice with either genetic or induced T-cell deficiency showed full resistance, and circulating preformed antibody could not account for the rejection observed. Treatment with silica or with 89Sr abrogated natural resistance in non-irradiated as well as irradiated animals; these treatments had previously been shown to abolish both bone-marrow graft rejection in irradiated mice and in vitro natural killing. Resistance against leukaemia transplantation in irradiated C57BL mice appeared to depend on Hh-1 (H-2D) incompatibility between the host and the graft, again suggesting that bone-marrow graft rejection, and perhaps natural killer activity, is a subset of a more general paraimmune or non-adaptive rejection mechanism.",,,,,

After the definitive demonstration of so-called tumor-specific transplantation antigens in chemically and virally induced tumors in syngeneic rodent and murine species, numerous efforts were then directed toward the demonstration of comparable materials in human tumors. After a number of false starts in an overzealous search for a marker that would serve as a panacea for human cancer diagnosis, more rational approaches have been taken to the problem and valuable information from the points of view of both the cell biologist and clinical oncologist has been forthcoming. The present paper presents an overview of human tumor antigens as biological markers of tumor growth. Reference is made to the fact that normally occurring biological materials of known function that are qualitatively and/or quantitatively altered during the process of malignant transformation may be most useful in the diagnosis and management of the cancer patient. The role of the presently available radioimmunoassays for carcinoembryonic antigen in clinical medicine is outlined.",,,,,

This model was tested because it explains why 10-base (actually 10.4 base) multiple-related fragments are paradoxically generated by both endonucleolytic (DNase I) and exonucleolytic (exonuclease III) mechanisms. This new model also explains the phenomenon of substantial single-stranded DNA production during DNase I digestion of chromatin. The latter phenomenon has been widely observed but is not explained by previous models. The single-stranded gap model to be presented makes testable predictions. Primarily, these are that DNase I produces single-stranded gaps in chromatin DNA and that the termini of 10-base multiple ladder fragments are separated by single-stranded gaps. Single-stranded gap production by DNase I was confirmed by a number of methods. Sensitivity of ladder band components (from DNase I but not staphylococcal nuclease digests) to S1 nuclease suggested that the ladder fragments themselves may compose a significant portion of these gaps. Separation of ladder fragment termini by single-stranded gaps was verified by demonstrating both resistance to the nick-specific NAD+-dependent ligase and sensitivity to T4 ligase which can ligate across gaps. Many single-stranded gaps, occurring both individually and clusters, were observed by electron microscopy using either cytochrome c labeling (where the gaps) are thinner than duplex) or gene 32 protein labeling (gaps thicker than duplex). Gap sizes were estimated by protecting them with gene 32 protein and digesting away unprotected duplexes. By this method, gap sizes fall into a ladder distribution (from 10 or 20 bases up to 120 bases), which, at least in the region of the shorter sizes, clearly indicates the sizes of single-stranded gaps formed in chromatin by DNase I.",,,,,

Ligand-induced adaptation of membrane receptors may be akin to antigenic modulation--the reversible disappearance of membrane-associated determinants stimulated by specific antibodies. Antigenic modulation has been studied extensively in the thymus-leukemia (TL) system of mouse leukemias. Antibody-induced changes in the quantities of TL antigens expressed by ASL-1 and RADA-1 cells, independently arising leukemia cell lines of strain A mice, are outgrowths of their metabolic turnover. After interacting with TL antibodies, the rate of TL antigen disappearance from the membrane increases while the rate of antigen synthesis remains unchanged. Antiserum with specificities for two membrane-associated determinants of ASL-1 cells, TL and a tumor-associated antigen, leads to modulation of TL antigens alone; the tumor antigen persists. Selectivity of modulation is taken as an indication that complex cellular controls govern the affect of antiserum on the expression of membrane antigens. To detect the presence of regulatory controls governing the expression of membrane determinants, stable somatic hybrids of ASL-1 murine leukemia cells and LM(TK)- cells, a sustained mouse cell line, were prepared and antiserum affects on membrane antigen expression were investigated. The metabolic half-lives of each of three antigen determinants investigated was distinct from the others examined. The hybrid cells have lost their capacity to mudulate TL antigens. TL antigens of hybrid cells, unlike those of parental ASL-1 cells, continue to be expressed in the presence of high titers of TL antiserum. Similarities between antigenic modulation and down regulation exist, among which are the fate of receptor-ligand complexes, changes in their metabolism after binding to ligand, and the dependence of the reactions upon continued sources of cellular energy.",,,,,

There was a good correlation between the activity of the two kinases and the level of the corresponding cyclic nucleotides. This was true for cultured phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal lymphocytes and CLL lymphocytes as well. Kinase A activity was low and kinase G activity was high in leukemic cells in the absence of the respective cyclic nucleotides [5 and 8 units (pmol 32P incorporated into histone per min per mg protein) for kinase A and 98 and 51 units for kinase G in ALL and CLL lymphocytes, respectively]. Upon addition of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate in vitro, values for kinase A activity returned to normal (approximately 30 units), whereas those for kinase G increased further (212 units for ALL and 85 units for CLL lymphocytes; 22 units was the kinase activity for normal lymphocytes).

We examined peripheral blood lymphocytes from cows with persistent lymphocytosis for the presence of specific glucocorticoid receptors. Steroid binding in intact cells was determined by a whole cell competitive binding assay using [3H]dexamethasone. The binding of the glucocorticoid to receptor was characterized in terms of affinity, specificity, and kinetics of the reaction. We found that peripheral blood lymphocytes from three cows with persistent lymphocytosis had 5000 to 6600 specific glucocorticoid-binding sites/cell. Compared with that reported for human lymphoid cells, glucocorticoid receptors in the bovine lymphocytes were found to have a greater affinity for the steroid with an association rate that was three times faster and a dissociation rate that was less than one-half of the former. We examined the biological half-life of hydrocortisone in the normal cow and found it to be 69.3 min, which is shorter than that reported for other domestic species and humans. The kinetics and affinity of the steroid binding may explain why in vivo glucocorticoid sensitivity was demonstrated in these animals despite the fact that elevated levels of plasma corticoids were not maintained. These results suggest that glucocorticoid sensitivity may be influenced by the nature of the binding reaction between steroid and receptor.",,,,,

Patients with good clinical response had significantly shorter turnover times and higher labeling indices in the bone marrow than did those who failed to respond to treatment. Cases for which cell kinetics did not correlate with clinical response were explained by variance in the distribution of leukemic blasts between the proliferative cell cycle and the resting pool.

In experiments reported here, injection of 30 or 50 mg silica i.p. increased the severity of the oncogenic effects of the murine sarcoma virus (MSV) and Friend virus (FV) in BALB/c mice. Unlike Herpes simplex and Coxsackie B-3 infections, however, passive transfer of adult macrophages to suckling mice did not protect the latter against MSV. In mice injected with silica, histological evidence of the compensatory proliferation of macrophages suggests that precursors of these cells may act as target cells for the virus and that this may override any immunosuppressive response effected by the silica. In addition, there was a considerable enhancing effect on the erythroproliferative response to both MSV and FV by injection of saline 5 h before the virus, and indeed to FV after only a simple abdominal needle puncture. We attributed this to the lymphopenic immunodepressive effects of stress, and our data may explain previously published findings of augmented oncogenic responses in mice after ""normal"" serum injections. Newborn BALB/c (FV-1b) mice were susceptible to N-tropic FV, but developed resistance by 29 days of age.

Analysis of REV-T high-molecular-weight RNA by electrophoresis in denaturing gels and by electron microscopy revealed the presence of at least two classes of molecules. One class appeared in CH3HgOH gels to have a monomer length of 9.3 kilobases (kb); in electron microscopic spreads under mildly denaturing conditions, it existed as a typical retrovirus dimer, having a monomer length of 8.8 +/- 0.7 kb. The second class also existed as a dimer, with a monomer length of 5.7 kb in CH3HgOH gels. Hybridization with REVA-A 32P-labeled complementary DNA revealed a third size class of molecules (4.7 kb), which were not resolvable from the 5.7-kb class in electron microscope spreads and which comigrated with chicken 28S rRNA in denaturing gels. Only the 9.3-kb class was found in the reportedly nontransforming virus produced after infection of canine thymus cell line with REV-T. Thus, REV-T appears to be similar to the murine and feline sarcoma viruses and the avian acute leukemia viruses in that it consists of a nontransforming helper virus genome and a defective genome responsible for oncogenicity. Our previous results demonstrated the presence in REV-T and in uninfected chicken cellular DNA of some nucleotide sequences not found in virus produced by the canine line (S. Simek and N. Rice, J. Virol. 33:320--329, 1980). In this report we show by hybridization with highly specific 32P-labeled complementary DNAs that REV-T-specific sequences exist within the 5.7-kb genome. Since 32P-labeled complementary DNA synthesized from the canine-derived virus genome hybridized with all three classes of RNAs, we conclude that the 5.7-kb genome is a recombinant between some sequences found in the putative helper and some sequences specific to REV-T. As with the other oncogenic viruses mentioned above, these specific sequences appear to be derived from host DNA.",PMC288762,,,,

In these earlier studies the appearance of breakthrough foci at low dilutions of antiserum in neutralization tests with high-titred anti-SSV(SSAV) serum suggested the presence of another virus, distinct from SSV-(SSAV). We now report the isolation of this component and, by comparative neutralization analysis, demonstrate that it is most closely related to gibbon ape leukaemia virus (GALV). It is distinguished from SSV(SSAV) by kinetics of neutralization and molecular hybridization experiments. This component was readily cloned both from virus produced by HL-23V chronically-infected canine thymus cells established by Teich et al.

BALB/c mice infected as newborns with clonal isolates of F-MuLVA or F-MuLVP become anemic and show splenic enlargement characterized by an increased proportion of cells that resemble immature nucleated erythroid cells. In addition, the spleens of these F-MuLVA- or F-MuLVP-infected mice contain a markedly increased proportion of both erythropoietin-dependent erythroid progenitor cells and spectrin-containing erythroid cells. These results suggest that Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) by itself can induce an erythroleukemic transformation in newborn BALB/c mice similar to that induced by the anemia-inducing spleen focus-forming virus (SFFVA) in newborn or adult mice. Kinetic studies indicated that the alterations in hemopoietic cell populations induced by F-MuLVA or F-MuLVP in newborn BALB/c mice occurred more slowly than the rapid changes observed after infection with FV-A. In addition, adult BALB/c mice were fully susceptible to the erythroleukemic transformation induced by either SFFVA or SFFVP, whereas only newborn mice were susceptible to F-MuLV. Taken together, these results suggest that, although the replication-defective Friend spleen focus-forming viruses appear to be the major determinant of erythroleukemia induction in adults, the replication-competent helper F-MuLV also have erythroleukemic potential when assayed in newborn animals.",PMC2185877,,,,

These antigens were defined by membrane fluorescence with antisera made in rabbits against rabbit cells chronically infected with cloned virus. The antisera were qualitatively absorbed with a group of cells chronically infected with related dualtropic, ecotropic, and xenotropic viruses. The absorbed antisera detected type-specific, virus-related cell-surface antigens that were unique for different dualtropic virus isolates. The unabsorbed sera also reacted with antigens found specifically on ecotropic and xenotropic virus-infected cells. These findings support the contention that T cell lymphoma (TCL)-inducing and B cell lymphoma (BCL)-inducing viruses isolated from x-irradiated C57BL/6 mice are env gene recombinants in which ecotropic gene sequences have been substituted by xenotropic sequences. We found that unique antigenicities are associated with each TCL-inducing and BCL-inducing dualtropic virus, and that the thymotropic TCL-inducing virus isolates (e.g., 136.5 adn 136.7 viruses) represent a separate serologic group, different from the dualtropic TCL-inducing viruses. By using a series of absorbed antisera in microimmunofluorescence tests we could perform serologic virus mapping of dualtropic clones isolated by us or by others and relate them serologically to previously isolated clones. These virus mapping experiments indicated that many serologically different recombinant viruses can be isolated from C57BL/6 mice. It is suggested that many distinct recombinant viruses may exist in lymphomagenic C57BL/6 mice, some of which are associated with specific lymphoma induction.",PMC2185874,,,,

Cloned stocks of FSV caused sarcomas in all chickens inoculated and were found to contain a 4.5-kilobase (kb) and an 8.5-kb RNA species. The 4.5-kb RNA was identified as the genome of defective FSV because it was absent from nondefective FSV-associated helper virus and because the titer of focus-forming units increased with the ratio of 4.5-kb to 8.5-kb RNA in virus preparations. This is, then, the smallest known tumor virus RNA with a transforming function. Comparisons with other viral RNAs, based on oligonucleotide mapping and molecular hybridization, indicated that 4.5-kb FSV RNA contains a 5' gag gene-related sequence of 1 kb, an internal specific sequence of about 3 kb that is unrelated to Rous sarcoma virus, MC29, and erythroblastosis virus, and a 3'-terminal sequence of about 0.5 kb related to the conserved C region of avian tumor viruses. The lack of some or all nucleotide sequences of the essential virion genes, gag, pol, and env, and the isolation of FSV-transformed nonproducer cell clones indicated that FSV is replication defective. A 140,000-dalton, gag-related non-structural protein was found in FSV-transformed producer and nonproducer cells and was translated in vitro from full-length FSV RNA. This protein is expected to have a transforming function both because its intracellular concentration showed a positive correlation with the percentage of transformed cells in a culture and because FSV is unlikely to code for major additional proteins since the genetic complexities of FSV RNA and the FSV protein are almost the same. It is concluded that the transforming onc gene of FSV is distinct from that of Rous sarcoma virus and other avian tumor viruses with sarcomagenic properties. Hence, multiple mechanisms exist for sarcomagenic transformation of avian cells.",PMC348642,,,,

Exogenous viral DNA was more difficult to detect in liver. Using a restriction endonuclease (SacI) which cleaves linear unintegrated ALV DNA in a single site to define integration sites in DNA from the various tissues, we were able to detect ALV DNA only in tumor tissue. We concluded that the proviral DNA detected in the various nontumor tissue must be integrated in multiple sites. The appearance of ALV integration sites uniquely in tumors suggests that they are clonal growths. Furthermore, the data suggested the presence of a single exogenous integration site for the ALV provirus in each of six early neoplastic bursal nodules. This provirus appeared to retain the organization of EcoRI and BamHI recognition sequences present in the genome of virus used to infect the birds.

Ecotropic viruses contain a large glycopeptide size class designated G1 (molecular weight, approximately 5100), and such glycopeptides were not detected in xenotropic viruses grown in mink cells nor in dual-tropic viruses grown in mouse or mink lung cells. Both xenotropic and dual-tropic MuLV had glycopeptide size classes designated G2, G3, and G4 (molecular weights, approximately 2900, 2,200, and 1,500, respectively). G2 glycopeptides of xenotropic and dual-tropic MuLV were shown to be resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, whereas G3 and G4 glycopeptides were susceptible. The relative abudance of glycopeptide G3 was increased in xenotropic and dual-tropic viruses as compared with ecotropic viruses, whereas the relative amount of G4 was decreased in xenotropic viruses.

In contrast, the sera of five animals with the juvenile or thymic forms of bovine lymphosarcoma were completely devoid of precipitating activity against BLV proteins, confirming the absence of relationship between these rare malignant diseases and BLV infection. The sera of non-leukemic cattle from areas of high risk of exposure to BLV were either negative or positive to a lower degree than the sera of lymphosarcomatous cows.

In the rare sera which were positive in the classical anti-gp51 radioimmunoassay (RIA) but negative in the anti-p24 RIA, an anti-p24 activity was, however, detected by the RIPA.

Non-toxic concentrations of 5-methylnicotinamide dramatically potentiate the cytotoxicity of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea as tested by the cloning ability of mouse leukaemia (L1210) cells. A dose-enhancement factor of about 10 is observed. This potentiation is dependent on the concentration of 5-methylnicotinamide. The methylxanthines theobromine, theophylline and caffeine also increase the cytotoxicity of methylnitrosourea. Thymidine, in the presence of sufficient deoxycytidine to overcome the perturbation of deoxynucleotide metabolism, also potentiates the cytotoxicity of methylnitrosourea. Nicotinate, which is not an inhibitor of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, has no effect on methylnitrosourea toxicity. A very small, but consistent, enhancement of the toxicity of gamma-radiation by the same inhibitors has been observed. We suggest that this potentiation of cytotoxicity is mediated by inhibition of (ADP-ribose)n biosynthesis; and that the biosynthesis is stimulated by DNA damage. We therefore propose that (ADP-ribose)n takes part in cellular repair mechanisms, either by modifying chromatin structure or by a specific participation in DNA repair.",,,,,

Absence of cell proliferation in both cell types was indicated by very low [3H]thymidine incorporation rates. Determination of endogenous protein-bound single ADP-ribose residues by a radioimmunoassay revealed that the leukemic cells had 2.5-times lower levels of the NH2OH-sensitive and a 4-fold lower amount of NH2OH-resistant ADP-ribose . protein conjugate subfractions, respectively, than normal lymphocytes. By contrast, ""total"" ADP-ribose transferase activity, as measured in homogenates or permeabilized cells in the presence of DNase, was two-times higher in leukemic cells, whereas activity determined in permeabilized cells in the absence of added DNase was practically identical in both cell types. The apparent discrepancy between ADP-ribose transferase activity and endogenous levels of protein-bound single ADP-ribose residues may be explained in part by an enzyme inhibitor present in normal human lymphocytes. NAD + NADH levels were decreased 2.5-fold in the leukemic cells. This decrease, however, does not explain the reduced levels of mono(ADP-ribose) . protein conjugates since the ratio of protein-bound single ADP-ribose residues to NAD is distinctly different in leukemic lymphocytes compared to normal lymphocytes.",,,,,

Of these parameters, only three were found to be altered significantly in the resistant line: (a) the enzyme required for the phosphorylation of uridine 5'-monophosphate to uridine 5'-diphosphate was present at a significantly lower specific activity in the resistant line than in its sensitive counterpart; (b) the rates of generation and persistance of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate were significantly lower and shorter in the variant; and (c) there was a 1.6- and 3-fold decrease in the incorporation of FUra into polyadenylic acid-containing RNA and polyadenylic acid-lacking RNA, respectively, in resistant versus sensitive cells. Taken together, these findings suggest a dual mechanism for resistance to FUra in these leukemic cells, namely, a depressed capacity to generate di- and triphosphates of the riboside and deoxyriboside of the drug leading to lower pools of the proximate antimetabolite, fluorouridine 5'-triphosphate, and accelerated excretion of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate, so that thymidylate synthetase is perturbed in a less than lethal way.",,,,,

By selection of virus-positive and virus-negative B10.ASgSn [B10.A (H-2a)] mothers and foster-nursing of C57BL/10ScSn [B10 (H-2b)] newborns, four sublines of C57BL mice were obtained: B10.A V+, B10.A V-, B10 V+, and B10 V-. (V+ denotes positive for milk-transmitted B-tropic virus; V- denotes negative for milk-transmitted B-tropic virus). Milk transmission of naturally prevalent B-tropic virus (V+ sublines) led to persistent infection of all offspring over at least 8 generations. Milk transmission of virus was associated with a very high incidence of lymphomas. The H-2 complex influenced the titers of virus after milk transmission, which were higher in B10.A V+ mice than in B10 V+ mice. H-2 control of virus titers, as measured by serum p30 assay, was confirmed in (B10.A V+ X B10 V+)F2 mice. Resistance to the virus was dominant, because serum p30 levels in F1 and H-2a/b F2 animals were similar to those in the B10 V+ subline and lower than those in the B10.A V+ subline. The H-2 complex also influenced the incidence of lymphomas (78 and 42%, respectively, in the B10.A V+ and B10 V+ sublines). Most B10.A V+ lymphomas were of T-cell origin, whereas most B10 V+ lymphomas were classified as non-T/non-B cells. Genetic transmission of virus (V- sublines) led to heterogeneous expression of both N- and B-tropic viruses, which thereby established the mottled trait for expression of genetically transmitted type C viruses in C57BL mice. Genetic transmission was associated with a low incidence of lymphomas that occurred in senescence.",,,,,

Authenticity of the hybrid PUTKO-1 was established by chromosome and isoenzyme studies. A virtually complete hybrid PUTKO-1 carried the EBV genome derived from the lymphoma parent. It averaged 26 EBV DNA copies per cell and was 100% positive for Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA). In most respects, the hybrid resembled the K562 parent: It had a high Fc receptor concentration, high sensitivity to natural killer cells, absence of EBV C3 receptors, and deficiency of membrane-associated beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) and HLA, in parallel with intracellular synthesis and secretion of beta 2M to the medium. Unlike the P3HR-1 parent, the hybrid was completely nonpermissive for antigens of the EBV cycle, early antigen, and viral capsid antigen. None of the 3 inducing agents, 5-lodo-2'-deoxyuridine, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate, or sodium butyrate, caused any viral antigen synthesis in PUTKO-1 in contrast to the good inducibility of the parental P3HR-1 subline. Thus the myeloid parent restricted expression of EBV antigens except EBNA. This exception further supports the concept that EBNA is an autonomous function of the viral genome, independent of host cell control that regulates expression of antigens related to the viral cycle. On the contrary, extinction of viral antigens in this hybrid between 2 cell lineages supports our previous concept that the ability to produce viral antigens is similar to a differentiated B-cell property.",,,,,

Previous work identified a sequence of about 1,500 nucleotides (here denoted onc(MCV)) that apparently derived from a normal cellular sequence and that may encode the oncogenic capacity of MC29V. In an effort to further implicate onc(MCV) in tumorigenesis, we used molecular hybridization to examine the distribution of nucleotide sequences related to onc(MCV) among the genomes of various avian retroviruses. In addition, we characterized further the genetic composition of the remainder of the MC29V genome. Our work exploited the availability of radioactive DNAs (cDNA's) complementary to onc(MCV) (cDNA(MCV)) or to specific portions of the genome of avian sarcoma virus (ASV). We showed that genomic RNAs of avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) and avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) could not hybridize appreciably with cDNA(MCV). By contrast, cDNA(MCV) hybridized extensively (about 75%) and with essentially complete fidelity to the genome of Mill Hill 2 virus (MH2V), whose pathogenicity is very similar to that of MC29V, but different from that of AEV or AMV. Hybridization with the ASV cDNA's demonstrated that the MC29V genome includes about half of the ASV envelope protein gene and that the remainder of the MC29V genome is closely related to nucleotide sequences that are shared among the genomes of many avian leukosis and sarcoma viruses. We conclude that onc(MCV) probably specifies the unique set of pathogenicities displayed by MC29V and MH2V, whereas the oncogenic potentials of AEV and AMV are presumably encoded by a distinct nucleotide sequence unrelated to onc(MCV). The genomes of ASV, MC29V, and other avian oncoviruses thus share a set of common sequences, but apparently owe their various oncogenic potentials to unrelated transforming genes.",PMC288629,,,,

By using this preannealed probe, multiple integrations of M-MuLV DNA have been detected in infected fibroblasts and in an M-MuLV-induced tumor. Integrated viral DNA fragments smaller than the complete viral genome have also been detected. By using this preannealed probe to examine a mass-infected culture of mouse fibroblasts, no evidence for a strongly preferred site for M-MuLV integration could be found.",PMC288640,,,,

The p12 structural component of Gardner FeSV P115, but not Snyder-Theilen FeSV 115, corresponds to feline leukemia virus subgroup A with respect to immunological type specificity, a finding consistent with the independent origin of these viruses. Tryptic peptide analysis revealed five methionine-containing peptides specific to the nonstructural portion of Gardner FeSV 115, three of which were also represented in Snyder-Theilen FeSV P115, three of which were also represented in Snyder-Theilen FeSV P115. None of these [35S]methionine-labeled tryptic peptides were present in translational products representative of the complete feline leukemia virus subgroup A genome, including Pr180gag-pol, Pr65gag, and Pr82env.

Both species of DNA contain the negative (complementary to viral RNA) and positive (same polarity as viral RNA) strands. However, only the negative strand of the 8.5-kb species can be identified if the synthesis of DNA is carried out in the presence of the drug actinomycin D. The 9.1-kb species appears to be slightly larger than the genomic RNA. If the linear double-stranded 9.1-kb species is treated with Escherichia coli exonuclease III and allowed to anneal, circular DNA molecules can be observed. Furthermore, polyadenylate-containing short genomic RNA fragments (0.5 to 1.0 kb) can anneal to both the 5' and the 3' termini of 9.1-kb complementary DNA. The polyadenylate moiety of the RNA fragments can be identified by tagging it with circular polyoma DNA containing polydeoxybromouridylic acid tails. Thus, the 9.1-kb complementary DNA transcript with two circular polyoma DNA molecules at its termini can be observed. However, when similar annealings are performed with 8.5-kb complementary DNA species, only one end of the resulting molecule has circular polyoma DNA.

A physical map of the unintegrated in vivo linear viral DNA was generated for several restriction endonucleases. The supercoiled viral DNA was digested with EcoRI, which cleaved the viral DNA at a unique site. The linearized viral DNA was then inserted into lambda gtWES.lambda B at the EcoRI site and cloned in an approved EK2 host. Eight independent lambda-mouse recombinants were identified as containing F-MuLV DNA inserts by hybridization with F-MuLV 32P-labeled complementary DNA. One of the F-MuLV DNA inserts was 9.1 kilobases (kb) and had the same restriction enzyme sites as the unintegrated linear F-MuLV DNA. Six inserts were 8.5 kb; each lacked a single copy of the terminally redundant sequences of the unintegrated linear viral DNA. One insert was 8.2 kb and contained a 0.9-kb deletion. After digestion with EcoRI, one recombinant DNA preparation containing an 8.5-kb insert was infectious for NIH 3T3 cells. Undigested recombinant DNA was not infectious. The infectivity of the EcoRI-digested DNA followed multihit kinetics, indicating that more than one molecule was required to register as an infectious unit. The virus isolated from this transfection (F-MuLV-57) was NB-ecotropic, helper-independent, and formed XC plaques. Inoculation of this virus into newborn NIH Swiss mice induced leukemia and splenomegaly in greater than 90% of animals within 3 to 4 weeks. The gross and microscopic abnormalities induced by F-MuLV clone 57 were identical to those seen with the original parent stocks of F-MuLV clone 201.

Different forms of viral DNA were sedimented on neutral sucrose or ethidium bromide-cesium chloride density gradients and detected by hybridization with complementary DNA. It was found that the major viral DNA species made in Fv-1 permissive or resistant cells was sedimenting at 20S on neutral sucrose gradient. Levels of this 20S viral DNA species were not significantly different in both systems. However levels of closed circular (form I) viral DNA separated on ethidium bromide-cesium chloride gradients were found to be decreased in Fv-1 resistant cells. Various species of viral DNA were also analyzed by the agarose gel-DNA transfer procedure of Southern. The major viral DNA species was found to migrate as a double-stranded linear DNA of 5.7 x 10(6) daltons. The molecular weight of linear viral DNA molecules extracted from Fv-1 permissive or resistant cells appeared to be the same. Levels of this linear viral DNA were almost identical in both systems except in B-tropic MuLV-infected resistant NIH/3T3 cells in which a moderate decrease has been measured. Two closed circular viral DNA species were observed by this technique. Their levels were markedly decreased in Fv-1 resistant cells. Our results indicate that the Fv-1 restriction does not grossly affect the formation of linear double-stranded viral DNA, but prevents the accumulation of closed circular viral DNA. Therefore the Fv-1 gene product could allow the synthesis of a normal linear viral DNA but interfere with the formation of supercoiled viral DNA. Alternatively, it could promote the synthesis of a faulty linear viral DNA whose defect (yet undetected) would prevent its circularization. In any case, the Fv-1 restriction mechanism appears to occur before the integration event itself.",PMC288535,,,,

This virus is produced by a permanent cell line derived from a radiation leukemia virus-induced thymic lymphoma of C57BL/Ka mice. Two distinct RNA components were found in the virions: a 70S dimer containing two 8 kb RNA subunits and a 54S dimer containing two 5.6 kb RNAs. A nononcogenic retrovirus, BL/Ka(B), endogenous in the same strain of mice, contains only 8 kb viral RNA subunits. The linkages between both RadLV/VL3 dimers have identical thermal stabilities. Both dimers can serve as primer templates for reverse transcriptase and both produce very similar ""strong-stop"" cDNAs 147 +/- 1 bases long. Sequences at the 5' end of the 5.6 kb subunit contain the genes for the viral proteins p15 and p12, but the gene for p30 is either absent or partially deleted. In vitro translation of the 5.6 kb RNA yields a 100,000 molecular weight protein containing antigenic determinants which react with antibody to p15 but not with antibody to p30. In addition, cells producing RadLV/VL3 virus synthesize a novel of 1.6 kb poly(A)-containing cytoplasmic RNA which shows very little if any homology with BL/Ka(B) viral sequences.",,,,,

It does not seem that these two pictures have actually to be distinguished since clinical and haematological aspects are not different, and histopathologic studies show always atypical aspects with difficulty of an accurate diagnosis. Cases of blastic crisis of CLL are very uncommon. They correspond to the transformation of a CLL in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Electron microscopy showed that true solubilization had apparently been achieved; no residual membrane or vesicle structure was found. After removal of deoxycholate and addition of phospholipid, the reprecipitated beta-adrenergic receptor was implanted in the cell membrane of Friend erythroleukemia cells by using a chemical fusion method recently developed. Membranes prepared from the cells demonstrated 30-fold stimulation of the Friend cell adenylate cyclase by the implanted beta-adrenergic receptor. The function of the indigenous prostaglandin E(1) receptor of the Friend cells was not much affected by the implantation of large amounts of the foreign receptor. Activity mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor reached 60% of the activity obtained with fluoride. The implanted receptor is therefore considered to be efficiently coupled to the adenylate cyclase system. The major difficulties hitherto preventing solubilization of hormone receptors and subsequent reconstitution of their function have been overcome by the approach developed in the present work. Conditions of solubilization need preserve only the receptor because all other components, even those unidentified as yet, can be supplied in excess by the adenylate cyclase system of the cell in which the receptor will be implanted. Subsequent recoupling of the receptor to the adenylate cyclase is performed in the native insoluble state of these molecules. Thus, the components need not be subjected to the hazards of solubilization in a common detergent as is usually required in reconstitution procedures. The importance of using implantation as an assay for a functional receptor in the course of purification and the likelihood that the procedure can be adapted to other receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters are discussed.",PMC348360,,,,

A difference in the oligosaccharide composition of gp70 from an ecotropic murine leukemia virus (Akv) and three recombinant dual-tropic viruses [mink cell focus-inducing viruses (MCFs)] derived from Akv was demonstrated. Glycosidase digestion and gel filtration were utilized to identify the two classes of N-asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, high-mannose and complex. The gp70 of the ecotropic virus contained only N-linked oligosaccharides of the complex type. In contrast, the gp70s of the dual-tropic viruses contained both high-mannose and complex oligosaccharides. Analysis of gp70 glycopeptides from an MCF-related xenotropic virus showed an elution profile similar, but not identical, to profiles of the MCFs. The gp70 precursors isolated from cells infected with Akv or MCF virus contained N-linked oligosaccharides that were exclusively of the high-mannose type. Comparison of the high-mannose oligosaccharides of the MCF gp70 precursors with those of the corresponding gp70s indicated that very little further processing of the high-mannose residues in the gp70s had occurred. The presence of the high-mannose oligosaccharides in the envelope glycoprotein of the dual-tropic viruses results from altered carbohydrate processing. The conservation of this altered carbohydrate pattern in a number of hosts and under various conditions of growth suggests that the viral protein structure is the primary factor in determining the different mode of glycosylation of the MCF gp70s. Thus, these viral glycoproteins provide an important model system for studying the relationship between protein structure and patterns of glycosylation.",PMC348209,,,,

Viruses with cell-transforming capacity, as determined by their ability to induce normal murine or mink cells to form progressively growing colonies in soft agar, appeared only transiently (2-4 days) after acute infection of ""spontaneously"" or chemically transformed mouse cells by nontransforming helper viruses.

We describe here three variants of subgroup B and D viruses that infect both cell types equally well. One of these viruses, NTRE-4, was a recombinant between transformation-defective Prague (Pr) strain Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) subgroup B and the endogenous virus RAV-0; the second, SR-DE-1, was a recombinant between Schmidt-Ruppin RSV subgroup D and defective endogenous virus information. T1 oligonucleotide fingerprint analysis of the genomes of these two viruses showed only a small alteration in the portion of the env gene responsible for subgroup specificity, as indicated by the presence of a single subgroup E oligonucleotide in an otherwise purely subgroup B or D gene. The third virus, hrBO1Pr-B, was a variant of Pr-RSV-B that did not appear to be a recombinant and whose altered host range we attribute to mutation. Analysis of the host range of all three viruses by infection of selectively resistant cells and by interference testing indicates that all use the subgroup B receptor on chicken cells and the subgroup E receptor on turkey cells. These viruses may be analogous to the polytropic recombinant viruses recently found to be associated with leukemia in some strains of mice.",PMC348307,,,,

Instead, AEV was found to replicate in macrophages and to induce the expression of p75 AEV, its presumptive transforming protein.

Using histone as a substrate, the average specific activity was 397 pmole/min/mg protein. The Km for ATP was 8 muM and for histone 0.3 mg/ml. The addition of optimal concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (1 muM) or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (10muM) resulted in a 2.2-fold stimulation in activity but had no effect on the Km for ATP or histone. Most of the properties of the CCL protein kinase were similar to those of the normal lymphocyte enzyme. These include the pH response, substrate affinity, as well as rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The phosphorylation pattern of endogenous proteins was determined using intact lymphocytes incubated with 32P and cell-free homogenates with AT32P. These results indicate that: (1) the cyclicnucleotide-protein kinase interactions are unimpaired in CLL lymphocytes; and (2) a sharply defined cyclic nucleotide concentration response occurs for CLL (as well as normal) lymphocytes, which may explain the reports of variable inhibitory (and stimulatory) effects on mitogenesis by these agents.",,,,,

One of these post-synthetic, covalent modifications is effected by the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which uses the coenzyme NAD+ to ADP-ribosylate chromatin proteins. The modification consists largely of mono(ADP-ribose), but long, homopolymer chains of (ADP-ribose) are also present. Various physiological functions have been suggested for (ADP-ribose)n. Here we demonstrate that one function of (ADP-ribose)n is to participate in the cellular recovery from DNA damage. Specific inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase prevent rejoining of DNA strand breaks caused by dimethyl sulphate and cytotoxicity is enhanced thereby. The rejoining of strand breaks is prevented also by nutritionally depleting the cells of NAD.",,,,,

They tend to have older mothers, like Alzheimer's disease patients. The latter tend to have sibs with either Down's Syndrome or lymphoma/leukaemia. Evidence, looking at 28 Down's Syndrome patients, suggests that multiple food allergies, gluten-gliadin sensitivity or intolerance are causing a coeliac disease-like picture with a malabsorption state for essential vitamins, minerals and severe autoimmune disease. It is hoped that missed gluten-gliadin sensitivity or intolerance with or without coeliac disease will be considered as a cause of abnormal oogenesis and spermatogenesis resulting in trisomy 21 and other aneuploidies. The mechanism most likely is low B1 interfering with sufficient release of cAMP for normal meiosis. Alternatively exorphins and peptides from foods may suppress prostaglandin E1 synthesis, or food sensitivities may alter toxic metal absorption mechanisms, which are thought to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Adequate vitamin/mineral supplementation, especially B1, prior to conception and in the first trimester is recommended for mothers at risk for DS, especially older mothers and a gluten free diet for those with coeliac disease or gluten-gliadin sensitivity/intolerance. Hopefully this will prevent conception of a DS child, or prevent heart defects/stigmata if one is conceived. DS children should be investigated for the above and commence a food allergy free diet with relevant supplements to meet their needs as early as maximum development.",,,90,,

Response data were analyzed by two criteria--one based on concentrations obtainable from the elimination phase and the other based on peak concentration--both derived from pharmacokinetic studies in man. The overall correlation between the two criteria was good and only in 5 of 32 occasions were there major discrepancies. A retrospective analysis of the clinical course of the four donor patients showed that although the one set of criteria gave a positive correlation of asparaginase response in vivo, the other positively correlated the daunorubicin response, but not vice versa. No new cut-off line could be drawn to satisfy completely in vitro/in vivo correlation for all the drugs.

We have studied interactions between rat liver macrophages and rat L 5222 leukemia cells. These tumor cells, but not normal leukocytes or erythrocytes, adhere to freshly isolated macrophages in vitro. Binding of tumor cells by macrophages can be inhibited by N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, D-galactose and more potently by glycoproteins with terminal N-acetyl-D-galactosamine or D-galactose residues. Tumor cell adhesion is calcium-dependent. The relevant leukemia cell membrane structures which bear terminal beta-D-galactosyl or related residues have been determined as trypsin- and pronase-sensitive, and hence may presumably be glycoproteins. The tumor cell receptor on liver macrophages appears to be a lectin with the carbohydrate specificity N-acetyl-D-galactosamine greater than D-galactose greater than L-fucose.",,,,,

Substantial inhibition of cell growth (greater than or equal to 90%) was obtained with short duration of exposure (4 h) for MTX (ED90 = 4.3 microM). 5-fluorouracil was a relatively ineffective cytotoxic agent for exposure of short duration (4 h). Only exposure of 24 and 72 h resulted in cell growth inhibition greater than or equal to 90% with this drug. In terms of a ED90, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine was about 190- and 1300-fold more active than 5-fluorouracil for 24 and 72 h exposures, respectively (0.4 vs 75 microM and 0.01 vs 26 microM). Sequential exposure to methotrexate (4 h) and 5-fluorouracil during the last 2 h of methotrexate exposure resulted in synergistic inhibitory effects on cell growth. Antagonistic inhibitory effects on cell growth of methotrexate and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine combinations were observed independently of drug concentrations. Pretreatment (4h) with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the reduced folate to which leucovorin is rapidly converted in vivo, potentiated cell growth inhibitory effects of subsequently administered 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine.

The total intracellular concentrations of dTMP synthase (free plus FdUMP-bound enzyme) in extracts from CCRF-CEM leukemic cells incubated with 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine were determined following dissociation of the covalent dTMP synthase-5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate-FdUMP ternary complex in the presence of the substrate, 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate. The addition of substrate prevented reformation of the ternary complex during the dissociation procedure, and allowed complete recovery of FdUMP binding sites in cells exposed to a high concentration of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine. After removal of the substrate by charcoal adsorption, the concentration of total FdUMP binding sites was determined by titration of the enzyme with a saturating concentration of [6-3H]FdUMP and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. The concentration of FdUMP-bound dTMP synthase was then calculated as the difference between the total and free (without prior ternary complex disruption) enzyme values. The high sensitivity of this assay coupled with its ability to accurately quantitate both free and FdUMP-bound dTMP synthase in cells exposed to a wide range of fluoropyrimidine concentrations should make it useful for a variety of experimental and clinical studies.",,,,,

Our recent results can be summarized as follows: 1) specific binding of phorbol esters to mammalian cells can be inhibited by a human placental factor, which we have partially purified and characterized. 2) Phorbol ester tumor promoters reversibly inhibit intercellular communication, as measured by electrical coupling and dye transfer between cultured cells, suggesting that they inhibit both ionic and molecular transfer between cells. 3) In vitro transformation of Balb/c 3T3 cells results in blockage of intercellular communication between normal and transformed cells, indicating that blocked intercellular communication may play a role in cell transformation. 4) 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) can continuously inhibit differentiation and globin gene expression in Friend erythroleukemia cells, without affecting their growth rate, for about 3 years.

This Ca2+ and phospholipid dependent kinase have been isolated and partially purified from histamine secreting rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3 line). The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate ester (TPA) directly activated this isolated enzyme. In the intact RBL-2H3 cells, TPA did not significantly affect free intracellular Ca2+ ions concentration or induce secretion. However, at low concentrations it synergistically enhanced secretion induced either by antigen or ionophore. Significantly, at TPA concentrations exceeding 25 ng/ml both the increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ and the ensuing degranulation were inhibited. The synergism between TPA and the ionophore reaches saturation. These findings suggest that free cytosolic Ca2+ and kinase C-mediated protein phosphorylation are synergistically involved in the mediation of the cellular response. Moreover, kinase C appears to play a dual role both in the activation and termination of secretion. The latter is most probably achieved by closure of the Ca2+ channels in the cells.",,,,,

Neoglycoproteins were prepared by reaction of glycosidophenylisothiocyanates with bovine serum albumin. The binding of neoglycoproteins to L1210 cells depends on the nature of the carried sugar and on the number of bound sugar residues per neoglycoprotein molecule. The best results were obtained with fucosylated serum albumin containing 25 +/- 5 residues of fucose. The amount of cell-associated fluorescein-labeled neoglycoproteins was several fold higher at 37 degrees C than at 4 degrees C suggesting a specific endocytotic process. The membrane lectin-mediated endocytosis was further demonstrated by showing that the cell-associated fluorescence upon cell incubation in the presence of fluorescein-labeled neoglycoproteins at 37 degrees C increased several fold after addition of monensin, a proton/sodium ionophore known to raise the pH of endosomes and lysosomes. The analysis of fluorescein-labeled neoglycoproteins association to the L1210 cells were achieved by quantitative flow cytofluorometry after standardization with calibrated polystyrene sulfonate beads carrying various amounts of 1-(fluoresceinylthioureido)-4,8-diazalicosane. In addition, the cytotoxicity of neoglycoprotein-bound methotrexate was shown to be related to the presence and to the nature of the carried sugar: fucosylated serum albumin was shown to be the most efficient neoglycoprotein carrier, and to have a cytotoxicity close to that of anti L1210 cell IgM monoclonal antibody carrying methotrexate.",,,,,

P388D1 cells were incubated with heteroaggregates between 2.4G2 and anti-DNP (anti-Fc gamma R X anti-DNP) and washed. The resulting cells lysed 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl chicken erythrocytes (TNP CRBC) in a hapten-specific manner. The lysis was inhibited by free hapten but was resistant to inhibition by immune complexes. Other cells coated with antibody heteroaggregates also mediated lysis of TNP-modified target cells. For example, mouse resident peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) lysed TNP CRBC and bacillus Calmette-Guerin-activated PEC lysed both TNP CRBC and TNP tumor targets. Human neutrophils, when incubated with heteroaggregates containing the anti-human neutrophil Fc gamma R antibody 3G8 and anti-DNP also lysed TNP CRBC and TNP-modified tumor cells. To test whether linkage to Fc gamma R was required for lysis, F(ab')2 fragments from the anti-KdDd monoclonal antibody 34-1-2 were cross-linked to anti-DNP F(ab')2 fragments. P388D1 cells (which express Kd and Dd) were then incubated with these heteroaggregates and washed, and their abilities to form conjugates and lyse TNP CRBC were compared with those of P388D1 cells treated with anti-Fc gamma R X anti-DNP. In both cases, P388D1 cells formed conjugates. However, only the cells treated with anti-Fc gamma R X anti-DNP mediated lysis to a significant extent. We conclude that heteroaggregates containing anti-Fc gamma R and anti-target cell antibodies can be used to create potent effector cells against red cell and tumor targets and that bridging of effectors with target cells directly to Fc gamma R on effector cells is required for lysis.",PMC2187539,,,,

B-cell numbers were normal. Patients whose leukocyte counts had been restored to normal by treatment with cytotoxic drugs had normal T-cell numbers, but B-cell numbers were reduced in comparison with normal persons. We conclude that untreated CGL is usually associated with a T-cell lymphocytosis that can be reversed by chemotherapy.

In three cases the leukemic targets were poorly killed relative to nonleukemic, HLA-identical target cells. The poor killing of the leukemic cells from one of these cases was shown by competitive inhibition to be due to deficient expression of normal class-I HLA antigens rather than resistance to lysis. Furthermore, the leukemic cells from these three patients were also deficient in binding monoclonal antibodies to nonpolymorphic determinants of class-I HLA and B2 microglobulin. Two additional cases were identified as having a less extensive deficit of HLA, and may be representative of a group with relatively subtle changes in these cell surface antigens.

In the present study, various approaches have been used to amplify the induction and expression of cytotoxic responses in vitro toward freshly isolated, autologous, and syngeneic solid neoplasms of spontaneous origin in mice. Cytotoxic lymphocytes were generated in one-way mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell cultures (MLTC) consisting of splenocytes or lymph node cells from normal and from tumor-bearing mice co-cultured with inactivated tumor cells. Optimal culture conditions have been established for the number of responder (R) cells, the method of inactivation of the stimulating (S) tumor cells, the responder/stimulator (R/S) cell ratio, and the duration of sensitization. Under optimal sensitization conditions only weak cytotoxic responses, as measured by the 51Cr-release assay, were generated. The antitumor cytotoxic activity could be augmented 2- to 12-fold by using each of the following procedures: (a) addition of crude or of partially purified interleukin-2 (IL-2) to the sensitization cultures; (b) depletion of nylon-adherent cells from the responding cell population; (c) enrichment of large lymphoblasts from the sensitized effector cell population by Percoll density gradient; and (d) treatment of mice donating the responder lymphocytes with low doses of either cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, or indomethacin. Although the highly reactive effector cells generated under the improved conditions also reacted appreciably with unrelated tumor target cells, only low levels of cytotoxicity could be demonstrated against normal target cells. The antitumor cytotoxic cells in sensitized splenocyte cultures were exclusively Thy1+, Lyt1-2+, whereas in lymph node cell cultures some cytotoxicity was also exerted by Thy1+, Lyt1+2+ cells.",,,,,

They suppressed both erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage colony formation in normal bone marrow cultures and suppressed immunoglobulin production by normal B lymphocytes in vitro. Though the myeloid cells were preserved in the bone marrow and the values of serum immunoglobulins were within normal limits, it can be estimated from these results that red cell hypoplasia and neutropenia were partially due to the suppression of haemopoietic precursor cells by leukaemic T lymphocytes.",,,,,

As a result of the First International Workshop on Human Leucocyte Differentiation Antigens (Paris, 1982), a very clear correspondence between these different antibodies has been established by regrouping into ""differentiation classes"", each class corresponding to a given molecular species at leucocyte surface. One of the consequences of this international co-operative study has been the development of a nomenclature system now officially adopted by the World Health Organization. In addition, it is now possible to identify the general characteristics of leucocyte surface molecules, which provides information on their organization and function. The international study is in progress, and the results of the Second Workshop (Boston, 1984) will soon be available.",,Les antigenes de differenciation leucocytaire humains.,25,,

This early recognition provides an opportunity for a practicing physician to make an important contribution to new knowledge in the field. Another important reason for the physician to have a high index of suspicion of cancers being related to workplace exposures has to do with compensation benefits which may accrue to the injured worker. The physician's role in the compensation system is critical both in providing medical opinion, which is material to the final decision, and because in many states it is the physician who starts the time clock for the statute of limitations. Three case examples are used to illustrate the importance of clinical recognition by an alert physician: 1) mesothelioma and labor; 2) lung cancer in a plumber who smokes and one who does not smoke; 3) leukemia in a rubber industry worker. Given the inherent preventable nature of occupational cancers, it is hoped that society will assist in searching for these important links.",,,,,

Interleukin-2 (IL-2), which induces proliferation of T cells specifically activated by antigen, has substantial therapeutic potential as a reagent for increasing the magnitude of tumor-specific T cell responses. The purpose of the present studies was to determine the effector mechanisms operative in tumor-bearing hosts by which subpopulations of immune T cells can mediate tumor eradication, and to determine if the in vivo administration of exogenous IL-2 can augment these T cell effector functions. Disseminated leukemia was eradicated by adoptive therapy with the immune Lyt 1+2- noncytolytic T cell subpopulation, under experimental conditions in which cytolytic T lymphocytes could not participate. The Lyt 1+2- subset contains helper/amplifier cells that produce endogenous IL-2 in response to tumor and effector cells that mediate delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. The administration of exogenous IL-2 following transfer of immune T cells containing this noncytolytic subset failed to augment their therapeutic activity, implying that the amount of IL-2 being produced endogenously did not limit the antitumor response. Adoptive therapy with purified cytolytic Lyt 1-2+ T cells produced a demonstrable but limited antitumor effect. Since this cytolytic subpopulation lacked helper T cells, the limited activity observed presumably reflected a requirement for an IL-2-producing cell. Administration of exogenous IL-2 following cell transfer satisfied this requirement and markedly augmented the efficacy of adoptive therapy with Lyt 1-2+ T cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,

Detection of rare common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA)-positive cells in peripheral blood is significantly improved by using multiple flow cytometric parameters to exclude a variety of mature blood cells which may nonspecifically bind the antibody reagent. Monocytes and granulocytes are excluded by gating out cells with high 90 degrees light scatter. By gating on red fluorescence, a variety of mature cell types binding to phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated Leu 3, Leu 2, and M3 monoclonal antibodies are also excluded. CALLA-positive lymphoblasts from 6 consecutive patients were not excluded on the basis of these parameters. Gating on log 90 degrees light scatter and log red fluorescence in this fashion reduced the incidence of nonspecific binding to peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a fluorescein-conjugated irrelevant monoclonal antibody by 98% from 308 cells per million to 5 cells per million. One CALLA-positive lymphoblast per 100,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells could be detected in mixture experiments using this method. The normal range of CALLA-positive cells in adults is less than 16 cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This low background of CALLA-positive peripheral blood cells may permit the detection of early leukemic relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia by analysis of the peripheral blood. This methodology can be applied to the detection of any rare cell type by using phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies to markers that the cell type does not possess.",,,,,

This property of the detergent is potentially useful for separating under mild conditions proteins that bind detergent from those that do not (Bordier, C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1604-1607). We studied the distribution of the receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) and its subunits in the two phases. IgE and IgE complexed either with intact receptors or with the alpha chains of the receptor alone are principally partitioned into the upper phase, whereas the unliganded receptor as well as the isolated alpha, and especially the beta and gamma chains of the receptor, preferentially partition into the lower detergent phase. Chromatography of IgE and of the subunits of the receptor on a hydrophobic support showed that the beta and gamma chains have a considerably greater hydrophobic surface than the alpha chains or IgE. These results indicate that the distribution of a protein in the two phases of phase-separated Triton X-114 is not an all-or-none effect based upon whether it binds detergent or not. Rather, it reflects the overall balance between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of the protein's surface.",,,,,

When HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate into macrophages by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cell-associated PA activity and secretion of PA into the conditioned medium increased profoundly. PA activity increased earlier and as a result of lower concentrations of TPA than the ability of the cells to adhere. Exposure to 10(-6)M dexamethasone did not prevent TPA-induced adherence and produced a slight inhibition of cellular PA activity. These findings imply that TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells to macrophage-like cells is associated with induction of PA activity.",,,,,

In this paper we have focused on the ratio of helper to suppressor cells in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and in patients with malignancy. In thirty-three patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the majority showed an inverted helper:suppressor ratio, elevated serum thymosin alpha 1, and elevated serum lysozyme levels. The inverted ratio was due to a deficiency in T-helper cells. The inverted helper:suppressor ratio was associated with functional suppressor cell activity that was seen in 12 out of 21 patients examined. Patients' lymphocytes were found to suppress the PHA, pokeweed mitogen, and concanavalin-A responses of normal subjects' lymphocytes. The suppression also correlated with impaired lymphocyte proliferative responses among the patients' cells themselves. Because of these findings, the helper:suppressor ratio was studied in patients with solid tumors, lymphoma, acute leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia. Approximately 30% of these patients have an inverted helper:suppressor ratio. However, in ten out of 30 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in three out of 45 patients with lymphoma, the helper:suppressor ratio was elevated, being greater than 3.0. The significance of these findings is as yet to be explored, but it is suggested that an inverted helper:suppressor ratio in patients with malignancy may relate to an advanced stage of disease or a poor prognosis. Documentation of this point will require further study.",,,,,

As the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) represent predominantly clonal B-cell malignancies, we examined the relationship of total T-cell [Sheep Red Blood Cell (SRBC) binding] and Fc gamma bearing T-cell populations in these disorders. Peripheral blood from seven low-grade (Rai stage 0), six high-grade (Rai stage 3 or 4) CLL patients, lymph node specimens from five patients with WDLL, seven patients with PDLL-D, three patients with MC-D, and eight patients with DHL were studied. All values were compared to normal controls. The percentage of total T cells in each disease category was decreased compared to controls. In addition, there was a reproducible correlation between the percentage of Fc gamma bearing T cells and the histopathologic diagnosis. The percentage of Fc gamma bearing T cells was highest in low-grade CLL and decreased incremently from high-grade CLL and WDLL, to MC-D, and PDLL-D. In DHL, we found no Fc gamma bearing T cells. Finally, the percentage of Fc gamma bearing T cells in each disease category was decreased compared to controls. These findings suggest a correlation between Fc gamma bearing T cells and the clinical aggressiveness of disease in NHL. In addition, they may raise important questions about therapy. Finally, they may offer a useful clinical test as an adjunct to histopathology although this will need to be confirmed in larger series.",,,,,

A very high proportion of normal T gamma lymphocytes are large granular lymphocytes (LGL), the cell responsible for most, if not all, natural killer (NK) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in humans, rats, and mice. In general, these cells are large lymphocytes with prominent azurophilic granules in the cytoplasm. Recently, a group of lymphoproliferative disorders made up predominantly of T gamma lymphocytes has been described. The most common and best studied of these disorders we refer to as ""chronic T gamma-lymphoproliferative disease"" (T gamma-LPD). In most cases, this disease represents the abnormal expansion of LGL, which is reflected by an increase in functionally active NK or ADCC effector cells. The chronic T gamma-LPD lymphocytes are generally characterized as E- and EA-rosette positive, acid-phosphatase, and beta-glucuronidase positive and express the pan-T antigens OKT3/Leu-4, OKT11/Leu-5, the suppressor-associated antigens OKT5,8/Leu-2, and the NK-associated antigens Leu-7/HNK-1. Typically, the patients are older, predominantly males and characteristically have a lymphocytosis of predominantly T gamma lymphocytes with lymphocyte infiltration of the bone marrow and often the spleen. While chronic T gamma-LPD is not usually an aggressive disease, the patients are often neutropenic and have recurrent bacterial infections requiring antibiotic therapy. Some patients have benefited from cytotoxic chemotherapy., but most patients have not required chemotherapy. An experimental LGL leukemia in F344 rats appears morphologically, functionally, and clinically similar to the human chronic T gamma-LPD and serves as an experimental model for further examining the ontogeny and function of LGL and may be applicable for exploring new and more effective means for the treatment of patients with chronic T gamma-LPD.",,,107,,

This disorder is a distinct clinicopathologic entity separate from leukemid reactions and other neutrophilic dermatoses. We describe two cases in which plaques or nodules developed in the second week after initiation of induction chemotherapy for AML. The lesions regressed in 1 week and recurred in one case when induction chemotherapy was given a second time. Histologically, the findings were similar in each case. Neutrophils palisaded about and infiltrated the eccrine coil in which necrosis of secretory epithelium was present. Focal mucinous degeneration of the eccrine adipose tissue cuff was the only other significant alteration. No vasculitis was observed. Cultures and histologic preparations for pathogenic organisms were negative. Cytarabine was the chemotherapeutic agent used in all three cases. NEH most likely represents either an unusual response caused by cytarabine or a manifestation of AML. Recognition of NEH is important in order to exclude other neutrophilic dermatoses associated with AML, such as sepsis and leukemia cutis, which may appear clinically similar.",,,,,

Two antibodies, termed T411 and T811, were obtained which were reactive by indirect immunofluorescence only with cells of the T cell lineage. The T411 antibody recognized a polypeptide chain of 100,000 dalton apparent molecular weight which was present on the surface of 94 +/- 4% of peripheral blood T lymphocytes, but only on 20 +/- 8% of thymus cells. The antibody T811 reacted with a surface molecule composed of 2 poly-peptide chains of 32,000 and 34,000 dalton apparent molecular weight, which was expressed only on 25 +/- 10% of blood T lymphocytes and on 90 +/- 4% of thymus cells. Functional analysis of the T811+ and T811- T cell subsets isolated by rosetting with anti-mouse Ig coated ox erythrocytes revealed that both subpopulations were able to mount a proliferative response to allo-antigens, whereas allo-antigen induced cytotoxic cells and their precursors were only found in the T811+ subset.

They are RTl-A,B,C,D and E regions. RTl-A,E and RTl-B,D regions encode class I and class II alloantigens, respectively. The RTl-C region encodes antigens which are similar to class I alloantigens and they are the homologue of mouse Qa-Tla antigens. A monoclonal antibody (X81-5C9) was produced against a rat B-cell leukemia, KNL-14. The KNL-14 cells were injected to a congenic rat, WKA. 1A(ACI). Spleen cells taken from the congenic rat were hybridized with mouse myeloma cell line P3.X63.Ag8.653. The monoclonal antibody lysed over 80% of nylon wool (N. W) adherent cells of lymph nodes, 25-30% of unseparated lymph node cells and/or spleen cells, and approximately 15-20% of peripheral blood lymphocytes of WKAH strain of rats. Only a portion (30-40%) of N. W. adherent cells of the peripheral blood lymphocytes was killed. Bone marrow cells, thymus cells and N. W. nonadherent cells were not lysed by the antibody. Macrophages, fetus, thymus and kidney homogenates could absorb the reactivity, whereas RBC, epidermal cells, brain, liver, testis could not absorb the cytotoxicity. A survey for the strain distribution of the antigen disclosed positive strains such as WKAH, W/Hok, LEJ, WKA. 1J (LEJ), ALB, WKA. 1B (ALB), BUF, BN, LEW, F344, W. 1L (F344) and KYN rats. The negative strains were NIG-III, WF, WKA. 1U WF), SDJ, W. 1U (SDJ), TO, W. 1T(TO), ACI, WKA. 1A(ACI), BDIX, WKA. 1DV1 (BDIX) and PVG/c rats. Immunochemically, the antibody precipitated antigens that gave two major bands on the SDS-PAGE. The heavy chain has an apparent molecular weight of 30 KD, which shifted to 33 KD under reducing conditions. The light chain has an apparent molecular weight of 12 KD. From these data a monoclonal antibody X81-5C9 is considered to detect a rat MHC (RTl) gene product which is different from the classic class I or class II cell surface antigens. It may be one of RTl-C antigens expressed mainly on B-cells. The characteristic feature of rat RTl-C antigens were discussed in relation to mouse Qa-Tla antigens.",,,,,

T-lymphoid cell lines (CEM and MOLT-3) were lysed by optimal concentrations of monoclonal antibodies and rabbit complement. Heparin at concentrations as low as 0.5 U/ml partially inhibited the complement-mediated lysis of all antibody-cell combinations while a heparin concentration of 25 U/ml produced complete inhibition. Lysis mediated by an IgG monoclonal antibody (J5) to the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) was more sensitive to heparin inhibition than that due to an IgM antibody (VIL A1). Bovine and porcine heparin were equally inhibitory. Peripheral blood T-lymphocytes collected in heparin (100 U/ml) were resistant to complete lysis when treated with 17F12 and complement immediately after isolation; complete lysis was achieved only when they were incubated for 2 h prior to treatment. The role of monoclonal antibody and complement in the in vitro lysis of normal and leukemic lymphocytes is discussed.,,,,,

A small, but significant difference was noted for both cell types, with the Fischer 344 rat being consistently higher. Other cell parameters, such as the mitotic index and the replicative index, were similar in the two strains. SCE levels in cultured peripheral lymphocytes after intraperitoneal administration of the alkylating drug cyclophosphamide (10 mg/kg) were similar for the two strains. Fischer 344 rats are known to have approximately a 10-fold higher incidence of spontaneous leukemia than do Sprague-Dawley rats. Since SCE frequency is a sensitive measure of DNA damage, our observations suggest that high leukemia incidence in the Fischer 344 rat may be related to a higher level of spontaneous DNA damage.",,,,,

Both IgG- and PC-binding proteins were further purified by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration and isoelectric focusing in the presence of 6M urea. Both IgG- and PC-binding proteins thus purified appear to be homogeneous in size as well as charge properties. The IgG-binding proteins of a molecular weight of 25,000 had an isoelectric point of 4.8, whereas the PC-binding proteins of a molecular weight of 42,000 were more basic and had an isoelectric point of 6.0. Both materials retained their IgG-binding capabilities as judged by their inhibitory capacity of murine EA gamma rosetting systems. The subclass specificities of the IgG- and the PC-binding proteins were for IgG2a and IgG2b, respectively. The PC-binding proteins possessed a typical phospholipase A2 activity, which was maximal at pH 9.5, depended on Ca++, and was specific for cleavage of fatty acid from the sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine. The binding of aggregated IgG2b to the PC-binding proteins caused the ninefold increase in noted enzymatic activity in the presence of, but not in the absence of, Ca++ (5mM). The IgG-binding proteins on the other hand, lacked any detectable phospholipase A2 activity. Thus, the biochemical and biological properties of the PC- and IgG-binding proteins isolated from murine peritoneal macrophages are essentially identical to those homologous proteins previously isolated from P388D1 cells [20].",,,,,

The potency of trimetrexate cytotoxicity against most cell lines is greater than that of methotrexate. Trimetrexate has antitumor activity in vivo in several murine leukemia and solid tumor systems, including tumors in which methotrexate is inactive. Antitumor activity was seen following oral, intravenous, or intraperitoneal administration. Trimetrexate causes a pronounced and early depression in incorporation of deoxyuridine into DNA. In tumor cell lines resistant to methotrexate because of a drug transport defect, trimetrexate retains activity. In many such cases the methotrexate-resistant tumors show collateral sensitivity to trimetrexate. In methotrexate-resistant cells with impaired drug transport, trimetrexate sensitivity was even more pronounced when cells were grown in folate-free medium supplemented with physiological levels of tetrahydrofolate cofactor. In the human tumor stem cell colony assay, trimetrexate, at concentrations achievable in vivo, gave activity against many human tumors, including samples that were unresponsive to methotrexate. Trimetrexate crosses the blood-brain barrier, and at very high doses may cause neurotoxicity. At conventional doses the primary toxic effects in mice are gastrointestinal. This toxicity is reversible at therapeutic doses. Unlike earlier lipophilic antifolates, trimetrexate has rapid plasma clearance (t1/2 in mice of 45 minutes). Trimetrexate is a tight-binding competitive inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. The Ki,slope for inhibition of the human enzyme was 4 X 10(-11) M. A dose-dependent decrease in cellular purine ribonucleotide pools is given by trimetrexate. Pyrimidine ribonucleotide pools tend to increase in treated cells. Trimetrexate caused a marked depression of cellular pools of dTTP and dGTP, and a lesser depression in dATP. Cytotoxicity of trimetrexate in vitro was prevented by leucovorin. Leucovorin also protected mice from trimetrexate toxicity. Thymidine protected cells from lethal effects of low concentrations of trimetrexate, but not from high concentrations. The combination of thymidine and hypoxanthine completely protected cells from low and high concentrations of trimetrexate. A new, stable and highly water-soluble formulation of trimetrexate has been developed. Because of the interesting biochemical and pharmacological properties of trimetrexate, and its experimental antitumor activity, clinical trials are planned.",,,,,

Three stages of leukemogenesis were defined before appearance of frankly leukemic mice. Stage 1, apparent 28-40 d after injection of MCF 69L1 virus, represented steady-state infection of thymocytes by MCF virus without apparent change in light scatter properties of the cells or in expression of alloantigens Thy-1, Lyt-1, Lyt-2, L3T4a, B2A2, or H-2K on the major thymocyte subpopulations. Expression of MCF virus was highest in the population of small cortical thymocytes. Stage II was observed at highest frequency 50-60 d postinjection and represented the emergence of a clonal population of cells with transformed properties which could be resolved from normal thymocytes by light scatter and expression of B2A2, H-2K, and gp70 antigens. Stage III was observed at highest frequency at 70 d postinjection, when considerable enlargement of thymus had occurred, and appeared to represent the outgrowth of fully transformed cells that replaced the normal thymocyte subpopulations. The alloantigen phenotype of blast cells from frankly leukemic mice did not differ qualitatively from that of stage II or stage III cells but displayed considerable heterogeneity with respect to quantitative expression of alloantigens and gp70. At least two populations of leukemic blasts could be resolved in the majority of primary thymomas analyzed. It is unclear whether these populations represent the outgrowth of independent clones of transformed cells or if they are related in some way. Our data are consistent with MCF virus-induced transformation of cells in the lineage to small peanut agglutinin-positive, cortisone-sensitive thymocytes, a subpopulation that predominates in the thymus and which is thought to be destined for cell death in situ.",PMC2187407,,,,

The phenomenon of antigenic modulation may therefore affect the use of antibodies as therapeutic agents. This study was undertaken to investigate modulation of the 65,000 dalton T65 antigen, present on normal and malignant T cells and some malignant B cells, which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody T101. To induce cell surface antigenic modulation, normal or leukemic lymphoid cells were cultured in the presence of monoclonal antibody T101 for 3-hr periods. Removal of monocytes from mononuclear cell preparations resulted in significantly lower degrees of T65 antigenic modulation. The degree of antigenic modulation could be increased by adding monocytes back to monocyte-depleted lymphocyte suspensions. Furthermore, maximal modulation occurred in the presence of monocytes at T101 concentrations that were 3 logs lower than in the absence of monocytes. The enhancing effect of monocytes was dependent on the Fc portion of the T101 antibody molecule, and presumably was mediated by cross-linking of antigen-antibody complexes on the surface membrane of the modulating cell by Fc receptors present on monocytes. Further experiments performed to examine the characteristics of this enhancement of antigenic modulation by monocytes indicated that autologous as well as allogeneic monocytes were effective, indicating that the enhancing phenomenon was not dependent upon recognition of major histocompatibility antigens. Viable monocytes were required, but pretreatment of monocytes with sodium azide to inhibit energy production, or indomethacin to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis had no effect on this phenomenon. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes did not mediate similar enhancement, although monocytic and myeloid cell lines U937, THP-1, and HL-60 did. Spent culture medium from modulated cultures and preparations containing IL 1 activity did not enhance modulation of the T65 surface antigen on lymphocytes, suggesting that direct contact between lymphocytes and monocytes is required to mediate the effect. The finding that leukemic cells from patients with CLL undergo modulation of the T65 antigen to a much lower degree in vitro than observed in vivo, and that this difference can be overcome by the addition of monocytes, suggests that monocytes or the reticuloendothelial system may augment antigenic modulation in vivo.",,,,,

Purified lymphocytes respond poorly to mevalonic acid, but their response can be significantly enhanced by one half their number of neutrophils. Preincubation of lymphocytes with neutrophils for 24 hr, even in the absence of mevalonic acid, further increases the lymphocyte response. We have been unable to demonstrate the production by granulocytes of either an intracellular or extracellular mevalonate-derived growth factor that in turn stimulates lymphocytes. Granulocytes preexposed to mevalonate do not acquire the ability to stimulate lymphocyte DNA synthesis in the absence of mevalonate. Our experiments suggest that neither neutrophil lysosomal enzymes nor reactive oxygen species generated by neutrophils are responsible for the help neutrophils provide. Normal E rosette-positive lymphocytes fail to respond to mevalonate, whereas E rosette-negative cells do. The mevalonate response of normal E rosette-negative cells is enhanced by the presence of granulocytes in contrast to B cell-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells that synthesize DNA briskly in response to mevalonic acid in the absence of neutrophil help. These observations add to our knowledge of the relationship between mevalonate metabolism and the regulation of cellular DNA synthesis and mitosis.",,,,,

Rev. Biophys. Bioeng., 10:245-276) to assess the effect of immunoglobulin E (IgE) binding on the lateral mobility of IgE-Fc receptors in the plasmalemma of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Bound IgE sharply increased the receptor's electrokinetic mobility, whereas removal of cell surface neuraminic acids cut it to near zero. In contrast, we found only a small difference between the lateral diffusion coefficients (D) of vacant and IgE-occupied Fc receptors (D: 4 vs. 3 X 10(-10) cm2/s at 24 degrees C). This is true for monomeric rat IgE; with mouse IgE, the difference in apparent diffusion rates was slightly greater (D: 4.5 vs. 2.3 X 10(-10) cm2/s at 24 degrees C). This range of D values is close to that found in previous photobleaching studies of the IgE-Fc epsilon receptor complex in RBL cells and rat mast cells. Moreover, enzymatic depletion of cell coat components did not measurably alter the diffusion rate of IgE-occupied receptors. Thus, binding of fluorescent macromolecular probes to cell surface proteins need not severely impede lateral diffusion of the probed species. If the glycocalyx of RBL cells does limit lateral diffusion of the Fc epsilon receptor, it must act primarily on the receptor itself, rather than on receptor-bound IgE.",PMC2113395,,,,

Following recent studies pointing to the favorable effect of TP-1, a partially purified extract of calf thymus, on the T cell-mediated immunity of several diseases, including Hodgkin's disease, we have used monoclonal antibodies and the enriched T lymphocytes of 16 untreated B-CLL patients to evaluate the proportion of T cell subsets before and after the administration of TP-1. In addition, the proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and the helper function in a pokeweed mitogen (PWM) system were assessed. In ten cases, the effect of TP-1 was also studied in vitro by evaluating the same parameters before and after incubation of B-CLL T cells with the drug. The study demonstrated that in vivo administration of TP-1 increases significantly (P less than .001) the proportion of the defective helper/inducer T cell population (OKT4-positive cells) in B-CLL, leading to a near normal OKT4/OKT8 ratio. Furthermore, the improved phenotypic profile was accompanied by an increased proliferative response to PHA and, in particular, by a significant increase (P less than .01) of T helper capacity; this increase was, however, insufficient to enable the normalization of the serum immunoglobulin levels. The in vitro incubation of B-CLL T lymphocytes did not succeed in producing significant modifications in distribution and function.",,,,,

This was accomplished by a two-step purification from Ficoll-Hypaque-isolated mononuclear cells. Isolated mononuclear cells were first labeled with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) specific for myeloid and erythroid precursor cells, and immune rosettes were then formed with sheep erythrocytes coated with rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (R/M-SRBC). Sedimentation through Ficoll-Hypaque then eliminated the majority of mature myeloid cells. The second step consisted of labeling the remaining rosette-negative cells with CALLA-specific MoAb and purifying CALLA+ cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting. Alternatively, CALLA+ cells were purified in a second R/M-SRBC rosette sedimentation step. The purified CALLA+ cells, which morphologically were medium to large lymphoid cells, were subsequently studied using dual fluorescence techniques to identify surface markers as well as intracytoplasmic staining to detect terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme (TdT) and intracytoplasmic mu. While the CALLA+ cell suspensions contained very few mature myeloid cells or T lymphocytes, the finding that 5% to 11% of them were cyto-mu+ and 13% to 22% expressed the B1 differentiation antigen clearly indicated that at least some of these cells were B cell precursors. Because 48% to 63% of the cells were TdT+ and practically all of them expressed Ia antigen, it appears that these cells are a mixture of very early lymphoid precursor cells as well as more differentiated pre-B cells. The phenotype of these normal cells is very similar to that of common ALL cells. Differences in the surface marker phenotypes between adult and fetal CALLA+ cells that have previously been purified were also identified.",,,,,

We have investigated the possibility that this differential DNase I sensitivity is based upon differences in the higher order structure of chromatin. When nuclei are digested under low ionic strength conditions known to unfold higher order chromatin structures, the differential sensitivity is lost. That is, the relatively DNase I resistant domain, containing the transcriptionally inactive embryonic and beta-homologous globin genes, becomes sensitive. When chromatin is recondensed with either MgCl2 or NaCl, thus indicating the higher order coiling of the chromatin fiber, the differential sensitivity is restored. Furthermore, the removal of histone H1, known to be essential for stabilization of higher order chromatin structures, results in the loss of differential DNase I sensitivity. In contrast to the DNase I resistant domain, the transcriptionally active adult beta-globin genes show no increase in the rate of digestion when chromatin is unfolded, indicating that this domain may exist as an unfolded nucleosomal chain. The data further suggest that this sensitive domain may be depleted of histone H1.",,,,,

After studying the fate of three drugs in this test system, several mechanisms were demonstrated whereby S-9 reduced cellular toxicity. For N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (HPR), fenoctimine sulfate and methyl palmoxirate, the drug concentrations (EC50) in the presence of S-9 were, respectively, 11.5, 14.3 and 4.1 times the concentrations required to achieve comparable levels of toxicity in the absence of S-9. HPR was metabolized by the S-9 and sequestered in the microsomal membranes. This was associated with a marked reduction in the cellular accumulation of the drug. The reduced toxicity of fenoctimine sulfate in the presence of S-9 was associated with extensive biotransformation to polar metabolites. This was accompanied by a reduction of radioactivity associated with the cells from 5.7% to 0.4% of the administered drug. Methyl palmoxirate was rapidly converted to its acid, palmoxirate, by horse serum enzymes present in the treatment medium. This provides an example of metabolism by a test system component other than the S-9 or lymphoma cells. The reduced toxicity of this drug in the presence of S-9 was attributed to further metabolism of palmoxirate and a reduction of the proportion of total radioactivity associated with the cells from 3.1% to 0.4%. These results emphasize the need for pilot toxicity studies, especially when components of the test system are varied, to assess the effect of drug concentration on the toxic response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,

Four adult Black West Indian women with CATL were studied using a multiparameter approach, including clinical, hematologic, pathologic, and immunologic investigations. The disease was usually characterized by adenopathy (with or without hepatosplenomegaly), peripheral blood involvement, hypercalcemia often in the absence of gross bony lesions, and a poor prognosis. The neoplastic cells were pleomorphic with marked nuclear irregularity of a multilobated or more cerebriform type. Lymph node biopsies demonstrated a diffuse pleomorphic lymphoma with variable degrees of nuclear irregularity and transformation. Marrow involvement consisted of focal nodules or, more commonly, scattered atypical lymphoid cells. Marrow biopsies also often demonstrated osteoclastic activity. Cases were all of T-cell origin, most commonly of T-helper phenotype, although there was some phenotypic heterogeneity. All patients had antibodies to the human T-lymphoma/leukemia virus.",,,,,

Its resemblance to the natural matrix produced by cells makes it ideal for studies on proliferation and differentiation of hemopoietic lineages. Every lineage, including granulocytes (basophilic, eosinophilic and neutrophilic polymorphs) monocyte-macrophages, megakaryocytes, erythroid and lymphoid lineages could be grown using a standardized collagen medium, provided that specific stimulators were added in the culture. Clones were scored on either live or fixed cultures. Compared to other gel substrates, collagen matrix proved superior for cell proliferation and maturation. Additional advantages (in situ clonal analysis by histological staining, enzyme cytochemistry), and other possibilities of the method are reported and discussed. The system offers great potential for cellular immunology, hematology and molecular biology with peculiar reference to differentiation of normal hemopoietic cells, viral transformation and leukemogenesis in vitro.

With Lewis lung carcinoma and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma implanted into the stomach wall, its antitumor activity by oral administration was slightly more effective than by intravenous route. In Beagle dogs, hematologic toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity (vomiting, diarrhea) were noted by oral administration, similar to intravenous administration, but its toxicity was mild. The maximum blood level of MCNU was noted at 30 minutes after oral administration in Beagle dogs. The half life (23.7 min) by oral administration was similar to that by intravenous route. From these results, the oral administration of MCNU deserves the consideration as a form of treatment now given other MCNU routes.",,,,,

(1) Knowledge of the immunologic group is important in predicting prognosis. Prognostic grouping may prove to be accomplished best by using a combination of traditional risk factors and immunologic phenotyping. However, definition of traditional risk factors may vary within the immunologic groups of ALL. (2) In assessing the relative effectiveness of different treatment regimens for children with ALL it is important to make comparisons among patients within the same major immunologic groups of ALL. (3) Identification of specific immunologic groups of patients within ALL may help in designing therapy for each group. The POG has already made preliminary attempts in this direction for T-ALL and B-ALL. However, leukemia species-specific therapy is still only a long-range goal. Laboratory research must endeavor to identify additional biologic characteristics peculiar to each major immunologic group of ALL. These characteristics may dictate therapeutic maneuvers in the future.",,,,,

Incubation of Jurkat with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) resulted in the production of interleukin 2, which was markedly increased by the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Antibodies reactive with T3 could activate Jurkat only if added together with PMA. However, S.5 cells failed to produce interleukin 2 in response to PHA and produced 1/16th the interleukin 2 activity that Jurkat produced in response to PHA and PMA. Incubation of S.5 cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 and PMA resulted in the production of interleukin 2 activity comparable to that produced by Jurkat. Like antibodies reactive with T3, A23187 demonstrated an obligate requirement for PMA in order to activate Jurkat or S.5. These observations suggested that T3 might participate in T-cell activation through mechanisms that increase intracellular Ca2+. This was examined by using the Ca2+ sensitive fluor, quin-2, to measure levels of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i). Addition of PHA, A23187, or monoclonal antibodies reactive with T3 to Jurkat cells resulted in substantial increases of [Ca2+]i. In contrast, only A23187 could induce an increase in [Ca2+]i in S.5 cells. Three other monoclonal antibodies reactive with other membrane antigens expressed on Jurkat or S.5 did not increase [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that T3 and/or associated molecules participate in T-cell activation through mechanisms that lead to increases in [Ca2+]i and that their expression is a relative requirement for T-cell activation by PHA.",PMC345390,,,,

Results obtained with the P815 mastocytoma, L5178Y lymphoma, and P388 lymphoma showed, in agreement with previous findings from this laboratory, that an intravenous infusion of splenic T cells from immunized mice can cause the regression of a tumor growing in T-cell-deficient mice. So far as specificity of adoptive immunity is concerned, reciprocal passive transfer experiments with these three tumors revealed that T cells from donor mice immunized against the P815 tumor are not capable of causing regression of the P388 tumor or L5178Y tumor, even if both the P815 and L5178Y tumors are growing in the same host. Similarly splenic T cells from mice immunized against the P388 tumor or L5178Y tumor had no effect on growth of the P815 tumor. Suppression of adoptive immunity was also specific, in that passively transferred suppressor T cells from mice bearing a progressive P815 tumor were capable of suppressing adoptive T-cell-mediated regression of the P815 tumor, but not the P388 tumor growing in T-cell-deficient recipients. Reciprocally, P388 suppressor spleen cells from mice bearing a progressive P388 tumor prevented adoptive T-cell-mediated regression of the P388 tumor, but not the P815 tumor. The results indicate, therefore, that the T cells from immunized mice that mediate adoptive antitumor immunity and the T cells from tumor-bearing mice that suppress the expression of this immunity are specific for the tumor that evokes their generation.",,,,,

The PBMC of 18 patients (2.4%) were found to be capable of rosetting with sheep red blood cells. Further characterization of these cells with a panel of monoclonal antibodies and other immunological and cytochemical tests led us to tentatively subdivide these 18 patients into three groups. The first one included 6 patients whose cells expressed a T-helper phenotype: they exhibited frequent skin involvement and an aggressive clinical course, and some of the patients in this group demonstrated chromosome abnormalities. On the other hand, group 2 (10 cases with expansions of granular lymphocytes and/or T suppressor-bearing phenotype cells) usually presented with a mild clinical course. These cases did not generally require therapy and a diagnosis of leukemia could not be unequivocally confirmed. Cells from the two remaining patients displayed both B-cell markers and E-rosetting ability, thus belonging to the rare group of false T-cell CLL. In fact, the clinical course and management of the latter cases were similar to those of classical B-CLL disease. In the first and second groups, mechanisms reported to be involved in mature T-cell proliferations (response to interleukin-2, production of interleukin-2 or interferon) were investigated, but the cells under study displayed neither growth ability nor lymphokine production in the above assays. In addition, these cells were negative with the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody that appears to recognize the receptor for interleukin-2. More importantly, none of these patients had serum antibodies to the recently described human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV), possibly responsible for Japanese and West Indian adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and for sporadic cases of ATL observed in other countries. Taken together, our results outline some differences between European and ATL patients. Furthermore, the data presented point out the heterogeneity of the disease and emphasize that an immunological classification and, in particular, the detection of a helper phenotype have relevant prognostic and therapeutical importance.",,,,,

This corresponds to 40% of the T-cell content of normal lymphatic tissues. The distribution of reactive T cells within the tumours was diffuse except for centroblastic/centrocytic lymphomas. When evaluating the different histological entities a correlation between number of helper T cells, T helper:T suppressor (TH:TS) ratio and histological subgroups emerged, particularly in non-Hodgkin lymphomas of low-grade malignancy. The highest ratio was found in prognostically favourable subgroups, CLL (2.7 +/- 0.3) and tumour areas of centroblastic/centrocytic lymphomas (2.9 +/- 0.4). In contrast, a significantly lower ratio was found in centrocytic lymphomas (1.4 +/- 0.3) corresponding well to the worst prognosis of this subgroup. The relationship between the number of helper T cells in tumour tissues, TH:TS ratio and prognosis was confirmed and extended by the evaluation of clinical data. It could be shown that, independently of histological criteria, a close correlation exists between the number of T cells, particularly T helper cells within the tumour, TH:TS ratio and clinical course. Patients with a favourable course had 1.4 X 10(4) T helper cells/microliter tumour tissue compared to only 0.8 X 10(4) for patients with an unfavourable clinical course (p less than 0.01); the TH:TS ratio was 2.8 for the favourable and 1.8 for the unfavourable group, respectively (p less than 0.04).

Three general activities were noted; B cell proliferation factor ( BCPF ), B cell differentiation factor (BCDF), and an IgA isotype-specific helper factor. BCPF acts on B cells to induce proliferation without differentiation and is distinct from conventional BCGF. This was documented by BCPF 's inability to synergize with anti-mu Ab in a standard BCGF assay ( Muraguchi & Fauci 1982, Howard et al. 1982, Sieckman et al. 1981), as well as its differential effect on a leukemic B cell preparation, when compared with BCGF. A possible schema for BCPF activity is depicted in Figures 3 and 4. In Figure 3, BCPF acts like Ag in vivo or like anti-mu in vitro, pre-activating B cells and rendering them responsive to BCGF. Figure 4 represents what our data depict, that is that BCPF bypasses the response to BCGF and induces cells to proliferate without pre-activation. The difference in the 2 mechanisms may be concentration-dependent and this possibility is currently being evaluated. It is interesting to speculate that T cells in vivo are capable of initiating B cell activation and may account for polyclonal responses seen with some Ag-specific reactions. BCDF(s) act on post-activated B cells (Figure 3) to induce differentiation to Ig-secreting cells. They appear to be heterogeneous and, therefore are capable of inducing varied responses depending on the B cell subpopulation affected. Figure 3 is deliberately complex demonstrating some of the possible as well as documented BCDF activities including polyclonal differentiation and isotype specific activity in IgA committed B cells. We cannot be certain of the frequency of these BCDF-secreting T cells, but the studies of cells from patients with common variable immunodeficiency and chronic lymphocytic leukemia have helped to dissect out these activities. These data would suggest that these BCDF subgroups are important, as deficiencies in one or more subgroups may result in disease.",,,42,,

This mutant line, designated CEM-T15, was derived from the human T-cell line CEM after mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate. The polyethylene glycol induced fusion and the selection in hypoxanthine- aminopeterin -thymidine medium were performed by modification of standard somatic cell hybridization techniques. After fusion, the strategy for selecting hybrids consisted in screening growing cultures for the presence of cells expressing the OKT3 cell surface differentiation antigen. OKT3 was chosen because it is present in 85-95% of normal human T cells but absent from CEM-T15 cells. Thus, OKT3+ cells growing 5-7 weeks after fusion most likely represented hybrids between normal T cells (OKT3+) and continuously growing CEM-T15 cells (OKT3-). Several of the hybrids were tested for their capacity to promote pokeweed mitogen-induced antibody production by B cells. These experiments demonstrated that many of the hybrids had helper activity. Periodical testing of these uncloned hybrids for helper activity revealed functional instability, with most of the hybrids losing helper activity after 20 weeks of continuous culture. However, early and repeated cloning of the same hybrids resulted in a series of hybrid clones with helper activity still present more than 8 months after fusion. In more recent fusions, we have demonstrated that human helper hybrids producing helper factor(s) can also be obtained. These and similar hybrids with different functions will be of considerable importance in further studies of the immunobiology of human T lymphocytes.",,,,,

Fc alpha R was detected by the cytophilic binding of anti-TNP murine IgA myeloma protein (MOPC 315 IgA) to Con A blasts as determined by an indirect rosette method with trinitrophenylated sheep red blood cells (TNP-SRBC). After 18 hr preculture with IgA, Fc alpha R was expressed on 15 to 20% of Con A blasts, which released IgA BF suppressing the in vitro IgA synthesis of the spleen cells stimulated with pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Without preculture with IgA, there was neither induction of Fc alpha R nor the production of IgA BF from Con A blasts. Fc alpha R was not induced on Con A blasts by IgA if Fc gamma R(+) cells were depleted from the blasts by rosetting with SRBC sensitized with rabbit IgG antibody (EA gamma). Even after preculture with IgA, the suppressive IgA BF was undetectable in the culture supernatant of Con A blasts depleted of the Fc gamma R(+) cell population. By using a double rosette method with EA gamma and trinitrophenylated quail red blood cells, Fc alpha R proved to be co-expressed on Fc gamma R(+) precursor T cells in the Con A blasts. The results suggested that both Fc gamma R and Fc alpha R could be co-expressed on Con A blasts, as is the case with T2D4 Fc gamma R(+), Fc alpha R(+) T hybridoma cells, which are known to produce IgG-binding factor(s) (IgG BF) and IgA BF. The relationship between Fc gamma R and Fc alpha R on a single cell was studied by using monoclonal anti-Fc gamma R antibody (2. 4G2 ). The reactivity of 2. 4G2 antibody with T cell Fc gamma R was proved by the inhibition of EA gamma rosette formation by Con A blasts or T2D4 cells. The addition of 2. 4G2 monoclonal antibody, however, did not affect the induction of Fc alpha R on Con A blasts by IgA. Furthermore, the binding of IgA to Fc alpha R already expressed on L5178Y T lymphoma cell line cells was not inhibited by the monoclonal antibody. The results confirmed that Fc alpha R are distinct from Fc gamma R co-expressed on the same Con A blasts, and that the expression of Fc alpha R on Fc gamma R(+) T cells and their production of suppressive IgA BF may be induced by the binding of IgA to Fc alpha R.",,,,,

An IL 2-containing, MAF- and IFN-free supernatant from the EL-4 thymoma (EL-4 SN) significantly enhanced release of MAF and IFN by mitogen- or antigen-stimulated, cytolytic or noncytolytic T lymphocyte clones directed against alloantigens or Moloney leukemia virus-associated antigens. Highly purified IL 2 produced equivalent enhancement as EL-4 SN in cultures of alloreactive clones stimulated with concanavalin A. Kinetics experiments showed that EL-4 SN increased both the rate and duration of MAF release by T cell clones. EL-4 SN also increased MAF production when added during restimulation of limiting dilution cultures of positively selected Lyt-2+ and Lyt-2- C57BL/6 splenic T lymphocytes activated against DBA/2 alloantigens. This enhancement resulted in a threefold increase in the apparent precursor frequency of MAF-secreting cells among Lyt-2+ lymphocytes, but did not affect the frequency among Lyt-2- cells. Additional analysis indicated that average MAF production in cultures of Lyt-2-+ cells was sixfold lower than in cultures of Lyt-2- cells, and hence that EL-4 SN allowed detection of a significant proportion of Lyt-2+ cell cultures secreting low levels of MAF. Under these improved conditions, the MAF assay detected the majority of responding Lyt-2+ and Lyt-2- lymphocytes.",,,,,

Of 42 untreated patients, 35 had detectable amounts of CALLA by flow cytometric (FCM) analysis of J-5 monoclonal antibody binding. Using an FCM technique that provides correlated measurements of a given cell surface antigen, cell size, and DNA content, we detected increased CALLA expression as lymphoblasts moved from G0/G1 phase through S phase of the cell cycle. The density of the antigen (per unit of blast surface area) remained relatively constant over the same interval, indicating that the change was not due to S phase-specific enhancement of CALLA expression. Eight cases had hyperdiploid cellular DNA content and in seven of these, only cells with clonal abnormalities of DNA content expressed the CALLA marker. Mean amounts of CALLA for each patient ranged widely within the study group, from very high to marginally detectable. This variation had no discernible relation to cell size, stem-line DNA content, percentage of cells in S phase, or the presence or absence of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin. Results of a univariate proportional hazards analysis showed that both quantitative level of CALLA for S phase cells (P = 0.048) and white blood cell count (P = 0.012) had made significant contributions to treatment outcome.

Each of these compounds is believed to delay the onset of DNA synthesis. Since relief of the FudR block to DNA synthesis by addition of thymidine can increase the number of initiation sites for replication (Taylor, 1977), the effect of various inducers and inhibitors of differentiation of Friend cells upon the relative number of initiation sites for replication and transcription was investigated. Very efficient inducers of hemoglobin synthesis, hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), increase the number of initiation sites for transcription and HMBA also increases the number of functional initiation sites for replication. Two other compounds that induce differentiation of Friend cells, low levels of actinomycin D and FudR, did not increase the number of initiation sites for transcription. Compounds that prevent induction of hemoglobin synthesis by HMBA and DMSO include 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and novobiocin. Both of these compounds were found to decrease the number of functional initiation sites for transcription and it is known that both compounds reduce the number of initiation sites for replication. The relation between initiation of replication and transcription, and its effect upon differentiation of erythroleukemia cells is discussed.",,,,,

Splenectomy in our patient, as well as in other instances where undertaken, has been ineffective in alleviating the neutropenia.

The studied cases were 63 patients with acute leukemias, 26 patients with chronic leukemias, 85 patients with lymphomas and 14 normal controls. The presence of TdT in the neoplastic cells was determined by optimized assays of enzymatic activity or by immunofluorescence test for TdT positive blasts. The fluorescence tests made use of anti-TdT antibodies specifically absorbed on cells containing the enzyme and then revealed by a second fluorescent antibody. Appreciable amounts of TdT were found in the white cells of blood or bone marrow from the following 25 out of 35 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) with modulations in the different phenotypes; 13 out of 14 acute undifferentiated leukemias (AUL); and 9 out of 15 blastic crises in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CMLbc). The enzyme was present in 12 out of 14 lymphomas of lymphoblastic type (LL); 2 B lymphoblastic lymphomas did not show any TdT positivity. The highest levels of TdT were detected in cells classified as immature lymphoblast or in their precursors. TdT was absent from normal lymph nodes from leukocytes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic (CML) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). 2 out of 14 cases of AML showed a border-line positivity. A definite correlation between concentrations of enzymatic activity and percentage of immunofluorescent cells could not be established. We did not find a precise correlation between the TdT content of lymphoid blasts and other clinical prognostic indices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Studio della presenza dell'enzima terminale dessossinucleotidil trasferase (TdT) nelle cellule dei linfomi e delle leucemie.,,,

Patients that have died intercurrently of early leukaemic recurrences showed considerable fluctuations in N-methylnicotinamide excretion over the entire period and no ""normalization"" of levels in these patients was seen. In those cases where late leukaemic recurrence or infections were the cause of death, usually after discharge from the clinic, excretion patterns typical of those seen in disease-free patients were observed.

In K562 cells in which the epsilon-globin gene is transcribed, six DNase I-hypersensitive sites are found in 6 kilobases (kb) of upstream flanking DNA; in HL60 cells in which the c-myc gene is expressed, two DNase I-hypersensitive sites are observed in 2 kb of upstream DNA. Neither the inactive epsilon-globin gene in HL60 cells nor the inactive c-myc gene in K562 cells displays such upstream DNase I-hypersensitive sites. Our results are consistent with previous studies that have shown DNase I-hypersensitive sites within 1 kb of the 5' end of other expressed genes. In addition, we have found sites displaying even more DNase I sensitivity further upstream of expressed epsilon-globin and c-myc genes. Among the six DNase I-hypersensitive sites of the expressed epsilon-globin gene in K562 cells, the most sensitive site is located about 6 kb upstream of the epsilon-globin gene. When correlated with the DNA sequence upstream of the epsilon-globin gene, this site was found to correspond to a region that contains a stretch of 28 consecutive Ts, three enhancer core-like sequences, and a stretch of consecutive (C-A)15(T-A)6 alternating purine and pyrimidine bases. These findings suggest the possibility that an enhancer element for epsilon-globin gene expression resides within this DNase I-hypersensitive site.",PMC345141,,,,

Megakaryocytic differentiation was detected when lineage-specific monoclonal antibodies were used to monitor the effect of TPA on K562 cells. A monoclonal anti-platelet antibody (C17) directed against an epitope present on GP IIIa appeared to react with K562 cells after induction. This was observed together with the disappearance of glycophorin A, the erythrocyte-specific lineage antigen. The induced megakaryocytic cells were also detected by ultrastructural platelet peroxidase (PPO). Immunoprecipitation, after ectolabeling of the cells with the C17 antibody and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proved that TPA-induced K562 expressed both GP IIIa and GP IIb. However, the monoclonal antibody C15 directed against another epitope of platelet GP IIIa reacted only partially, or not at all, indicating that GP IIIa expressed on TPA-induced K562 differs structurally from that on normal platelets. K562 clones, expressing glycophorin A in all cells, were obtained by limiting dilution and culture. When these clones were treated with TPA, again megakaryocytic cells were obtained.

Whereas this entire collection of snRNP particles is precipitated by patient anti-Sm autoantibodies, anti-(U1)RNP autoantibodies specifically recognize U1 snRNPs. Here, we have performed immunoblots using the sera from 29 patients and a mouse anti-Sm monoclonal antibody to identify which HeLa cell snRNP proteins carry anti-Sm or anti-(U1)RNP antigenic determinants. Strikingly, every serum surveyed, as well as the monoclonal antibody, recognizes determinants on two or more snRNP protein components. The three proteins, 68K, A, and C, that uniquely fractionate with U1 snRNPs are specifically reactive with anti-(U1)RNP sera in blots. Anti-Sm patient sera and the mouse monoclonal antibody react with proteins B, B', D, and sometimes E, one or more of which must be present on all Sm snRNPs. The blot results combined with data obtained from a refined 32P-labeled RNA immunoprecipitation assay reveal that, in our collection of the sera from 29 patients, anti-Sm rarely exists in the absence of equal or higher titers of anti-(U1)RNP; moreover, (U1)RNP sera often contain detectable levels of anti-Sm. Our findings further define the protein composition of the Sm snRNPs and raise intriguing questions concerning the relatedness of snRNP polypeptides and the mechanism of autoantibody induction.",,,,,

Using the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonylcyanide-p-trifluormethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP) which collapses the mitochondrial potential, it was shown that about one third of the overall potential resulted from the mitochondrial contribution. Degranulation of the RBL cells induced by two different IgE-cross-linking agents (specific antigen and anti-IgE antibodies), was accompanied by, and well correlated with, a decrease in the overall potential. However, evaluation of the source of these observed potential changes revealed that the FCCP-insensitive fraction of the overall potential, delta psi P, (representing the plasma membrane potential), was not affected. In contrast, the FCCP-sensitive component due to the mitochondrial potential decreased when receptor cross-linking increased. Thus, the observed decrease in the overall potential is most probably a secondary event in the sequence leading from stimulus to secretion. Indeed, exposure of the RBL cells either to a high external concentration of K+ ions or to a high amount of external TPP+, both causing depolarization, failed to trigger degranulation. It is suggested that the apparent decrease in the measured overall potential is a reflection of the mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The latter is most probably caused by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake initiated by the increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ which follows cells activation.",PMC557376,,,,

Cells growing in Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum were modified with respect to fatty acid composition by supplementing their growth medium with 32 microM docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) or oleic acid (18:1). A soft agar clonogenic assay was then used to assess survival following incubation with Adriamycin. When exposed to the drug at a concentration of 0.4 microM, cells grown in the 22:6-supplemented medium were more sensitive (min of drug treatment required to reduce survival by 63% on the exponential portion of the survival curve, 64.9 +/- 4.2 min) to the cytotoxic effects of Adriamycin than cells grown in unsupplemented medium (min of drug treatment required to reduce survival by 63% on the exponential part of the survival curve, 106 +/- 9.7 min) (p less than 0.005). Cytotoxicity of L1210 cells grown in 18:1-supplemented medium was similar to that of cells grown in unsupplemented medium (min of drug treatment required to reduce survival by 63% on the exponential part of the survival curve, 126.6 +/- 9.1 min). The heightened sensitivity to Adriamycin of cells whose medium contained 22:6 increased as the concentration of fatty acid used to supplement the growth medium was increased. The cytotoxicity was also a function of the concentration of Adriamycin from 0.1 to 1.6 microM. When compared to cells grown in unsupplemented medium, those grown in 22:6-supplemented medium contained 3- to 4-fold more polyunsaturated fatty acids in their phospholipids, with a resultant doubling in the mean number of double bonds per fatty acid molecule.

Nuclei were digested with either DNase I or micrococcal nuclease, and the purified DNA was hybridized to a set of cloned genomic DNA fragments covering the beta-globin gene region. This region consisted of two distinct domains as characterized by sensitivity to DNase I digestion. One domain was relatively sensitive and contained the potentially active or actively transcribed beta-major and beta-minor globin genes. The other, relatively insensitive domain contained the nontranscribed embryonic and beta-globin homologous genes. The sensitivity of these domains was not altered during erythroid differentiation. In nonerythroid cells, the entire globin gene family, including the adult and embryonic globin genes, was contained in a single relatively resistant domain. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) also defined two general domains of nuclease sensitivity that coincided with those of DNase I. However, the relatively sensitive MNase domain containing the beta-major and beta-minor genes became more sensitive upon chemically stimulated erythroid differentiation. A detailed examination of the beta-major globin gene revealed that the actual coding region became increasingly sensitive to micrococcal nuclease after differentiation while the 5'-flanking DNA did not. Thus, micrococcal nuclease was able to accurately define the primary transcription unit of the beta-major gene.",,,,,

Changes in cell surface markers detected by monoclonal antibodies as well as morphologic, histochemical, and functional changes were monitored. We found that gamma-IFN, but not alpha- or beta-IFN, induced the expression of antigens characteristic of monocytes and granulocytes (AML-2-23, 63D3, and 61D3), as well as changes in morphology consistent with monocytoid differentiation. These included induction of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase, increased cell size, and a decrease in azurophilic granules. The gamma-IFN dose dependency and time course of the effect on antigen expression suggest that de novo protein synthesis was induced by gamma-IFN. The activity of gamma-IFN and of mixed-lymphocyte culture supernatant was blocked by a monoclonal antibody to gamma-IFN. Significant augmentation in the ability of the HL-60 cells to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was induced by gamma-IFN.

The DNase I hypersensitivity of the globin genes accompanied their actual transcription and was strongly correlated with commitment events. On the other hand, the rate of micrococcal nuclease digestion was closely related to the rate of globin gene transcription. Two distinct DNase I hypersensitive sites were found on the 5' side of the beta-major globin gene in HMBA-induced cells. One site was located near the 5' side of the beta-major globin gene and the second site was located approximately 3 kilobases upstream of the beta-major cap site. Following the commitment of MEL cells to differentiate, DNase I sensitivity was stably inherited in the absence of inducer.

Modification of immune function seen during the photochemotherapeutic studies prompted attempts to determine the effect of HPD on the immune and hemopoietic systems. Splenic hyperplasia as well as marrow hypercellularity were noted in mice treated with HPD. In vitro phytohemagglutinin or lipopolysaccharide stimulation of spleen lymphocytes caused normal or scant increases in blast transformation compared to the stimulation index for lymphocytes from untreated animals. HPD treatment did not significantly alter production of antibody to sheep red blood cells, as evaluated by hemagglutination or hemolytic assay. In contrast, HPD treatment did promote an increased number of spleen colonies in lethally irradiated mice transfused with syngeneic bone marrow. The capacity of HPD to increase the number of bone marrow and spleen cells has been exploited to accelerate the recovery from peripheral leukopenia induced in animals by previous drug or radiation treatment. The time for full return from severe leukopenia induced by an antimetabolite compound (5-fluorouracil) or an alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide or X-rays was significantly shorter in mice treated with HPD than in controls. Furthermore, improved survival was demonstrated in irradiated mice after HPD treatment. Finally, HPD treatment of L1210 leukemic mice did not affect the antitumor activity of cyclophosphamide. If the properties described here be confirmed, HPD might contribute to recovery of leukopenic cancer patients.",,,,,

One approach seeks evidence for increasing and progressive deviation from the normal chromosome pattern in tumors. The clearest examples, found in some leukemias, are those in which successive karyotypic changes are superimposed on an already aberrant cell population. Evidence of chromosomal progression within solid tumors is far less frequent, possibly because the tumors themselves are at a relatively late stage in their evolution. An alternative approach, therefore, attempts to correlate the extent of karyotypic deviation with other aspects of tumor progression. Recent data, based on classical cytogenetic analyses and flow cytometry, are presented to determine relationships between karyotype and specific origin and morphology of tumors. The predominant theme which emerges, not surprisingly, is that the more deviant chromosome patterns are associated with other measures of increased biologic malignancy. What is surprising is the degree to which these properties are expressed in primary tumors and the relative lack of evidence for further karyotypic evolution with recurrence or metastasis. Examples of genetic instability, evolution through polyploidy, gene amplification, and selection for specific chromosomal rearrangement are found in populations of premalignant and malignant human cells. There is increasing recognition of the importance of tumor-specific chromosome aberrations in the stepwise progression from the normal to the fully neoplastic cell.",,,172,,

Intercellular aggregation in this system is mediated by the binding of the Fc portions of IgG antibodies on the spleen cells with Fc receptors (Fc gamma R) on P388D1. We show that the rate of aggregation reaches a plateau with increasing cell concentrations, suggesting that the initial collision between cells is not the rate limiting step of conjugate formation. The rates of aggregation are strongly dependent upon the cell surface densities of both Fc gamma R and antibody. In conjugates, however, only small fractions of available receptors or antibodies are utilized in bond formation. The rate-limiting step of aggregation, therefore, involves the formation of ligand-receptor bonds, and may be the diffusion of antibodies and receptors toward one another in small areas of intercellular contact. Inhibitor studies implicate microfilaments, but not microtubules, divalent cations, or energy-dependent processes as being important in aggregation. Finally, conjugates are stable when diluted into medium alone, but dissociate in media containing protein A, soluble immune complexes, or anti-Fc gamma R antibodies. This suggests that conjugates are stabilized by multiple intercellular ligand-receptor bonds, which constantly break and reform at the cell:cell interface, and that protein A, immune complexes, and anti-Fc gamma R disaggregate the conjugates by preventing the reformation of broken bonds.",,,,,

Fc gamma Rlo can be inhibited and the receptor precipitated by monoclonal antibody 3G8. We have used this monoclonal antibody to study the course of Fc gamma Rlo appearance on bone marrow cells, leukocytes of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and HL-60 and U937 cells induced to differentiate with agents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), retinoic acid, phorbol myristate acetate, and lymphokine. We report that Fc gamma Rlo is a late differentiation antigen, first expressed at the metamyelocyte stage. Since precursors to metamyelocytes bear Fc gamma R, and the promyelocyte line HL-60 bears Fc gamma Rhi, there must be a progressive loss of Fc gamma Rhi during myeloid differentiation and the reciprocal expression of Fc gamma Rlo. Results of immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel analysis of the proteins are consistent with these results. We have also studied the receptor for the C3bi complement component (CR3), which is blocked and immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody OKM10. During DMSO-driven differentiation of HL-60 cells, we find that CR3 is induced on all cells, whereas Fc gamma Rlo is induced on only 24% of cells, suggesting that CR3 appears earlier during differentiation than Fc gamma Rlo does.",PMC425043,,,,

The results further indicate that the blast cells of acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML) may represent an immature variant of monocytic leukemia (AMoL) and that morphological examination alone is inadequate in the assessment of monocytic differentiation in acute myeloid leukemias. Inhibition studies of cytochemical ANAE activity with sodium fluoride (NaF) show that the presence of NaF-sensitive or NaF-resistant ANAE enzymes is often unrelated to the diagnostic category of acute leukemia.

However, enriched CLL B-cells failed to respond to SPA compared to normal enriched B-cells, with mean cpm 444 vs. 6438 respectively.

CLL B-lymphocytes were stimulated by SPA when cultured in the presence of T-lymphocytes, indicating a T-helper defect in the B-CLL proliferative response to SPA, rather than an intrinsic inability of CLL B-cells to proliferate.

In vivo photoirradiation of DBA/2Ha mice bearing L1210 solid tumors and previously given injections of meso-tetra-(4-sulfonatophenyl)-porphine, meso-tetra-(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphine, or hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) indicated that all three chemicals elicited a photodynamic response resulting in necrosis of exposed tissue. Isolation of tumor cells from mice given injections of porphyrin with the use of mild mechanical means and physiologic conditions followed by in vitro photoirradiation of the cells under conditions established to optimize rapid cytocidal effects resulted in no appreciable cell death. A similar situation was noted with the use of spleen cells from mice given injections of Hpd, the spleen cells presumably containing substantial amounts of porphyrin. Both fluorescence microscopy and chemical extraction and quantitation of the porphyrins in the cells indicated that the inability to elicit a rapid cytocidal effect upon in vitro photoirradiation resulted from either the absence of or the presence of only very small amounts of porphyrin. These results indicate that in this particular tumor system the neoplastic cell per se plays only a minor role in porphyrin localization and, as a consequence, cannot be readily killed upon photoirradiation, suggesting that rapid cytocidal effects, due solely to porphyrin contained within the cell, probably do not occur among the majority of parenchymal cells during in vivo photoirradiation.",,,,,

Up to now, it has been thought that the La antigen is associated only with RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III, including precursors of tRNA and 5 S ribosomal RNA. Here we report that anti-La sera also react with ribonucleoprotein particles containing small nuclear RNA U1, which is transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Anti-La sera from 12 out of 12 patients tested were found to precipitate U1 RNA-protein complexes from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, under conditions where nonimmune sera do not. Ribonucleoprotein particles containing a second small nuclear RNA, U2, do not react appreciably with anti-La sera although they are present in HeLa cell nuclei at the same concentration as U1 RNA. Anti-La sera also react with U1 RNA-protein complexes in mouse and frog cells, but not in Drosophila or Chironomus, two organisms which lack the La antigen. Hybridization of cloned U1 DNA with anti-La-reactive RNA from HeLa cell nuclear extracts reveals mature U1 RNA, whereas anti-La-reactive cytoplasmic RNA contains a series of hybridizing bands that represent molecules 1-7 nucleotides longer than U1 and which may include precursors of nuclear U1 RNA (Madore, S. J., Wieben, E. D., and Pederson, T. (1984) J. Cell Biol., 188-192). Pulse-chase experiments suggest that the association of La antigenicity with these cytoplasmic U1 RNA molecules is transient. These results are discussed in relation to the presence of uridylate-rich sequences in the 3' termini of U1 RNA precursors and mature U1 RNA, which are similar to La antigen binding sites in several RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III.",,,,,

Fifty-five percent out of 201 viable progeny died prior to weaning due to tumors derived from the injected cells. Of the remaining 91 apparently healthy adult animals, 2 had chimeric populations. One mouse had a chimeric population of granulocytes and the other mouse a chimeric population of macrophages. The animal with a chimeric population of macrophages was chimeric at 1 and 2 months of age and had lost any detectable donor derived contribution by the age of 3 months. The chimeric granulocyte population in the other animal was still stable at 3 months. The myeloid leukemic cells injected into midgestation embryos thus participated in the development of two different cell types in apparently healthy adult animals.

The marrows were categorized into five morphological groups, broadly corresponding to those described by the FAB group, and further graded into mild and severe according to the severity of dysgranulopoiesis. Fractionated bone marrow and peripheral blood granulocyte receptors were assessed by rosette formation with optimally sensitized ox erythrocytes and the results compared with those found in 17 normal marrows and with those previously reported in megaloblastic anaemia. Fc-IgG and C3b receptor expression was generally increased in maturing granulocytes in all MDS diagnostic groups but premature expression was particularly marked in chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and refractory cytopenia. Receptor patterns showed a better correlation with the severity of dysgranulopoiesis than with the morphological types. It is suggested that, as in megaloblastic anaemia, changes in membrane receptor expression reflect nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony.

Our results confirmed the observation of Rabellino et al. (1979, 1981), using polyclonal antibodies, that GP I was expressed throughout normal MK maturation. The present result differs from our previous work which failed to detect binding of AN51 on promegakaryoblasts (PMKB). Improvement of immunofluorescent techniques has permitted detection of weak fluorescent labeling on normal PMKB by day 6-7 of in vitro culture from normal CFU-MK. An increased number of labeled PMKB was observed in bone marrow from patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) as compared with normal bone marrow. In 20 selected cases of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, AN51 labeled the PMKB but at a lower percentage than with J15 (monoclonal anti-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex). The MK nature of the blasts was confirmed by the ultrastructural detection of platelet peroxidase (PPO) and by the binding of AN51 demonstrated with immunoferritin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The immunogold technique revealed that the density of gold particles on the cell membrane of PMKB was variable, but generally weaker than in platelets or pathological micromegakaryocytes. The specificity of AN51 for MK lineage was shown by the absence of binding of AN51, by all blasts from 60 cases of acute leukemia involving other cell lines. Because of its weak labeling of PMKB due to the small number of antigenic sites, AN51 must be associated with another megakaryocytic marker in the diagnostic assessment of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.",,,,,

In addition, no new ""receptor-associated"" components were observed. However, after the cells were stimulated, the gamma chains of the receptors showed an average 35% decrease in their associated 32P. Changes in the beta subunits were more variable but on the average showed a similar-sized increase in 32P. Using a novel protocol that permitted examination of aggregated and unaggregated receptors from the same cell, we found that changes in the unaggregated receptors were quantitatively indistinguishable from those exhibited by the aggregated receptors.

B cells were enriched in the Sephadex G-10-passed lymphocytes by treating with anti-Thy-1.2 and complement (C). After stripping any cytophilic Ig with low pH, the B cells were 125I surface labeled; subsequently the membranes were solubilized with nonionic detergent, and putative Fc epsilon R components were allowed to bind to IgE-coated adsorbents. Bound radiolabel was eluted with low pH, and when examined by SDS-PAGE, was found to consist primarily of a relatively broad band centered at 49,000 m.w. (49K). Fluid-phase IgE could prevent the binding of the 49K component to the IgE solid-phase adsorbents. Rebinding studies further indicated that the 49K component exhibited a specificity for IgE, thus confirming that the 49K component was the murine B lymphocyte Fc receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R). Some rebinding to rabbit IgG was observed, and by using 2.4G2, the monoclonal anti-Fc gamma 2b receptor (Fc gamma 2bR) antibody to isolate the IgG2b receptor, a clear distinction between the FC gamma 2bR and the 49K IgE receptor was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis. Rabbit IgG was thus found to interact with both the 49K Fc epsilon R and the 59K FC gamma 2bR. The murine B lymphocyte Fc epsilon R was compared with the human B cell Fc epsilon R from the RPMI 8866 cell line and with the high affinity Fc epsilon R on rat basophilic leukemia cells by one- and two-dimensional gel analyses.

In the present report, viral antigen expression and T cell response in mice injected as adults with M-MuLV intrathymus (i.t.) was investigated. Only thymic and splenic T lymphocytes from these mice express virus-induced antigens since they were lysed by virus-specific CTL, and stained by anti-M-MuLV fluorescent serum. In addition, the percentage of M-MuLV-infected T cells increased with increasing post- inoculation times. However, these mice could mount a strong cellular immune response against M-MuLV-infected cells, as detected by massive mixed leucocyte tumour cell culture and by evaluation of virus- specific CTL precursor frequency. Finally, i.t. injected mice were not viraemic and did not develop lymphomas during an observation period of 12-15 months. These data, in contrast with the recent hypothesis that T cell lymphoma development depends on a chronic stimulation of virus-specific T lymphocytes, indicate that the cellular immune response is sufficient for prevention of neoplastic transformation, despite a persistent viral infection of the thymus and peripheral T lymphocytes.",PMC1454409,,,,

The ability of Con A activated cell population to form rosettes with autologous RBCs (ARFC) is also investigated. The results indicate that lymphocytes from CML patients in 1st (61.8 +/- 6.1%), 2nd (62.6 +/- 3.0%) and 3rd (55.3 +/- 4.8%) remissions show significantly high suppressor cell activity than normal healthy donors (36.5 +/- 1.9%) when activated with Con A.

Thus it appears that a higher suppressor cell precursor population is present in CML patients in remission. However, this could not be correlated with the progression of the disease.

An increased frequency of Down's syndrome was observed among relatives of the probands: a rate of 3.6 per 1,000, as compared with an expected rate of 1.3 per 1,000. A history of thyroid disease was established in 9 (19.6%) of the 46 female probands, a frequency greater than that reported in the general population. There was no excess of hematological malignancies among the blood relatives, and parental age at the time of birth of the probands did not differ from the norm. The results of this study indicate that early-onset Alzheimer's disease is associated with a genetic factor manifested in a substantial familial aggregation of dementia, a probable excess of Down's syndrome in the probands' relatives, and a possible association with thyroid dysfunction in women with this form of dementia.",,,,,

The risk factors were: an age over 60, previous vascular problems, the quality of follow-up (maintenance of hematocrit below 50 p. cent and platelet count below (600.10(9)/l). The treatment is one of the most important factors: the risk of vascular complications was three times greater in patients treated by venesection, al other factors being equal. This counter-balanced the higher risk of leukemia in patients treated by myelo-depression. The use of platelet anti-agregant drugs remains controversial. Recent results question their efficacy in preventing thrombosis and emphasise the risk of hemorrhage. The results of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and beta-thromboglobin (beta TG) levels provide further information for judging the vascular risk of these patients, and may, in prospective studies, give a better assessment of the efficacy of platelet anti-agregant drugs in vivo.",,Accidents vasculaires dans la polyglobulie.,,,

As judged from their sensitivity to proteinase-K digestion, all the above polypeptides possess a transmembrane orientation. Digestion with endoglycosidases H and F (endo-H and endo-F), and tunicamycin treatment indicate that all the polypeptides, except that of 19 000 mol. wt. are N-glycosylated. The 21 000 and 23 000 mol. wt. chains possess both immature and mature oligosaccharide units, whereas the 26 000 mol. wt. band apparently has mature units only. Pulse chase experiments combined with digestion by endo-F and endo-H suggest that the N-glycosylated polypeptides are derived from two polypeptides of mol. wts. 14 000 and 16 000.

The immune response and its regulation by genes within the major histocompatibility complex, particularly of the I region of the mouse and of the HLA-D/DR region in man, is of central importance in both graft acceptance (rejection) and graft-versus-host disease. Methods which are available for typing alleles at the HLA-A, -C, -B, -DR and complotype (BF, C2, C4A, C4B) loci, have been considered in detail. The extent to which recombination affects specific alleles on haplotypes within families is discussed, as is the occurrence of linkage disequilibrium and extended haplotypes in populations of unrelated individuals. Because the HLA-DR and complotype region in man is thought to be critical for the success of bone marrow transplantation, methods for typing of HLA-D by both the HTC and PLT approaches have been examined. Although HLA-D/DR assignments are easily made in normal subjects, they are ambiguous in about 50 per cent of candidates for bone marrow transplantation, including, particularly, patients with aplastic anaemia, leukaemia, and severe combined immunodeficiency. In this setting, it is particularly important to obtain additional information by modification of HLA-D typing procedures and through complotype and GLO allele determinations in all family members. Finally, we can hope that there will be an increased possibility of using non-family donors through methods for removing cytotoxic T cells from donor marrow and through the identification, in the general population, of individuals who are genotypically similar or identical to the recipient. In this regard, the recognition that some 30 per cent of chromosome 6 in caucasians (50 per cent of individuals) bear extended haplotypes, which include a relatively fixed set of alleles particularly in the HLA-B, -DR, complotype and GLO regions, offers considerable promise.",,,146,,

The concentration of intact CLZ was determined in the medium and the intracellular water space. The cell: medium ratio (intracellular concentration/medium concentration) of CLZ in bone marrow cells was greater than that seen for L1210 cells. However, the intracellular CLZ concentration generally remained constant in both cell types at 37 degrees C, between 7.0 and 10.0 pmole/microliters. The L1210: murine bone marrow cell ratio of intracellular CLZ concentrations was approximately 1.0 from 10 to 60 min. The intracellular CCNU concentration during the uptake of 0.1 mM (chloroethyl-U-14C) CCNU at 37 degrees C was constant at 85 pmol/microliters from 10 to 60 min in L1210 cells, but slowly decreased from 66 pmole/microliters at 20 min to 43 pmole/microliters at 60 min in bone marrow cells. The L1210: murine bone marrow cell ratio of intracellular CCNU concentrations ranged from 1.45 to 1.98 from 20 to 60 min. Thus, it appears that the preferential ratio of alkylation of L1210 DNA to murine bone marrow DNA by CLZ compared with equimolar CCNU cannot be explained by differences in uptake of the two agents by the two cell types. The uptake of 0.1 mM CLZ at 37 degrees C by L1210 cells in McCoy's 5A medium containing 300 mg% glucose was not affected by the addition of 5 mM cold drug, nor was it affected by the absence of glucose in the medium, with or without cold drug. This suggests that CLZ uptake into L1210 cells is via passive diffusion and that CLZ does not enter these cells via the glucose transport mechanism.",,,,,

Eventually, however, the tumor-dormant state terminates, and all mice develop ascitic tumors. In an evaluation of the mechanisms involved in termination of the tumor-dormant state, we detected in the peritoneal cavity of many tumor-dormant mice macrophages with increased capacity to suppress the in vitro generation of a secondary anti-L5178Y cell cytolytic T-lymphocyte response. The incidence of macrophage-mediated immunosuppressive activity in individual tumor-dormant mice was related directly to the number of tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity of those mice. Furthermore, in tumor-dormant mice harboring fewer than 5 X 10(4) L5178Y cells, the detection of macrophage-mediated immunosuppressive activity was a prognostic indicator of termination of the tumor-dormant state and development of an ascitic tumor. These data suggest that peritoneal macrophage-mediated immunosuppressive activity, through inhibition of cytolytic T-lymphocyte generation in vivo, contributes to the termination of the tumor-dormant state and development of ascitic tumors.",,,,,

Mice inoculated with low-leukemogenic D-RadLV do not develop suppressor cells but contain anti-tumor reactive lymphocytes that can inhibit in vivo tumor growth. Cyclophosphamide (CyF) treatment of mice inoculated with A-RadLV hampered suppressor cell function and rendered the animals' lymphocytes responsive to A-RadLV induced tumor cells in vitro. Administration of CyF also reduced leukemia incidence in mice inoculated with A-RadLV, but had no effect on leukemia induction by D-RadLV in irradiated mice.

The malignant cells isolated from the patient's blood and skin were studied utilizing cytochemical analysis and multiple monoclonal antibodies directed against cell surface antigens. The leukemic cells displayed a surface antigen phenotype similar to that of normal post thymic suppressor T-cells. On the basis of this study together with the few published reports, it appears that T-prolymphocytic leukemia is derived from lymphocytes demonstrating either the suppressor or helper phenotype, and that extensive dermal infiltration may be independent of phenotypic classification. Although T-prolymphocytic leukemia shares certain morphologic, cytochemical, and immunologic features with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, it is an aggressive disease with an average survival of approximately 6 months and is best thought of as a distinct pathologic entity.",,,,,

The ability to induce differentiation of normal B-lymphocytes into antibody producing plasma cells, in a pokeweed mitogen (PWM) stimulated system, was similar to that of normal T-cells in all 6 cases studied. Both the T-colony growth and the helper capacity were unrelated to the distribution of T-lymphocyte subsets defined by monoclonal antibodies, despite an increase in OKT8+ cells (suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype) and a decrease in OKT4+ cells (helper/inducer phenotype) in 44% of the patients.

Supernatant fluids from cultures of lymphocytes infected with a variety of viruses or cocultured with cell lines have the same FcR enhancing effect as IFN gamma. We identify the factor in the supernatant fluid responsible for the induction as immune interferon. Among the different types of IFN, only the gamma type (both purified and recombinant) specifically induces the appearance of FcR for monomeric IgG1 on normal and leukemic myeloid cells but not on cells of lymphoid origin. This effect is also evident on mature PMN. We show that the specificity and the affinity of the receptor induced on HL-60 promyelocytic cells, peripheral blood monocytes, and PMN are identical to those of the receptor spontaneously present on the same cells, except for PMN, which do not spontaneously express this type of receptor. The results of inhibition experiments performed with mouse IgG of and IgG3. These results suggest that the receptor present on human monocytes different isotypes indicate that the receptor can be inhibited by murine IgG2a or immature myeloid cells, selectively inducible by IFN gamma, has a specificity similar to the FcR1 described on mouse macrophages.",PMC2187379,,,,

A small proportion of these cells was able to differentiate into anti-SRBC hemolytic plaque-forming cells when cultured in vitro in the absence of polyclonal stimulators. The addition of pokeweed mitogen or of x-irradiated allogeneic T cells further enhanced their differentiation. The addition of antigen (SRBC) to unstimulated cultures of the patient's mononuclear cells suppressed the anti-SRBC antibody production. Marked suppression was induced by concentrations of SRBC that were found to stimulate anti-SRBC antibody production optimally by normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Two lines of evidence suggest this inhibition was not due to the activation of suppressor cells. First, depletion of T cells with the phenotype reported to be associated with suppressor cells, namely OKT8+ cells, did not prevent suppression. Secondly, the patient's mononuclear cells pulsed with SRBC did not suppress anti-SRBC antibody production by untreated autologous cells in co-culture. These findings suggest that leukemic cells were inhibited by the direct interaction with antigen. This suppression might be the result of intrinsic abnormalities of leukemic B cells. Alternatively, it could be the reflection of a tolerogenic response to antigen stimulation displayed by the patient's leukemic cells, which have a surface phenotype, IgM+D-, that is comparable to that of immature normal B cells.",,,,,

Incubation of human leukemic cells expressing CALLA with specific monoclonal antibody (J5) at 37 degrees C causes rapid and selective internalization and degradation of this antigen (antigenic modulation). In these studies we show that CALLA-specific monoclonal antibodies also identify a cell surface glycoprotein having a m. w. of approximately 100,000 on 2 to 6% of nonmyeloid nucleated cells of normal adult bone marrow, on normal fibroblasts in tissue culture, and on cells of several nonhematopoietic human tumor cell lines. J5 antibody similarly modulates the surface expression of CALLA on nonleukemic cell populations, although the extent of modulation at a given concentration of antibody varied considerably. Modulation was almost complete for CALLA on cells of normal bone marrow, but was highly variable for cells of nonhematopoietic cell lines, possibly reflecting variability in antibody access to surface antigen. Using fluoresceinated or iodinated J5 antibody to modulate expression of CALLA on cells of leukemic cell lines, we show that antibody-antigen complexes undergo a temperature-dependent redistribution on the cell surface during modulation to form microaggregates. Antibody as well as antigen is then internalized. Studies of [35S]methionine-labeled cells indicate that synthesis of CALLA continues despite modulation of its surface expression by specific antibody, implying that the presence of CALLA on the cell surface reflects a dynamic equilibrium between the processes of surface expression of newly synthesized glycoprotein and its spontaneous and antibody-mediated clearance. The implications of these observations for immunotherapy are discussed.",,,,,

An absent autologous reaction was associated with ratios of OKT4:OKT8 positive cells less than 1.5, and such ratios were more often observed after splenectomy. Non-T cells from 10 of 11 patients stimulated allogeneic normal T cells. The amounts of HLA-DR antigens on hairy cells were similar to those on normal peripheral blood non-T cells.

Unlike Adriamycin, menogarol does not bind strongly to DNA, and it minimally inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis at lethal doses. Adriamycin is a clinically active drug, and menogarol is undergoing preclinical toxicology at National Cancer Institute. In view of the reported mutagenicity of Adriamycin, we have compared the genotoxicity of the two drugs. Our results show that, although Adriamycin and menogarol differ significantly in their bacterial mutagenicity (Ames assay), they have similar genotoxic activity in several mammalian systems. Adriamycin is strongly mutagenic in the Ames assay with TA98 and TA100. Menogarol is nonmutagenic to TA98 and TA100. For the mammalian cell culture systems, V79 (Chinese hamster) cells are exposed for 2 hr to drug, following which cell survival, induction of sister chromatid exchanges, chromosome damage, and production of mutants resistant to 6-thioguanine are measured. The percentage of survival obtained with the two drugs ranges between 25 and 50% at 0.15 microgram/ml and 5 to 15% at 0.3 microgram/ml. At 0.15 microgram/ml, Adriamycin and menogarol increase the percentage of cells with chromosome damage from a background level of 8.8 to 30 and 22.5%, respectively. The same drug concentration causes a small but significant increase in sister chromatid exchange rate. Both drugs are equally active (increase mutation frequency about 3- to 6-fold above background) in producing 6-thioguanine-resistant mutants. The induction of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes of rats is the most sensitive assay system. Both drugs cause 10- to 15-fold increase in micronuclei at nontoxic doses.",,,,,

We also studied a B-cell lymphoblastoid line, WI-L2/m4, that was 13,000-fold resistant. Assay of cellular dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) showed the following pattern of activity in resistant cell lines, relative to parental cell activity: RAJI/MTX-R, 550-fold increased; CEM/MTX-R, unchanged; TE-85/MTX-R, 4-fold increased; MG-63/MTX-R, 6-fold increased; SAOS-2/MTX-R, unchanged; and WI-L2/m4, 110-fold increased. Measurement of MTX membrane transport showed decreased uptake in CEM/MTX-R and SAOS-2/MTX-R, relative to parental cell lines. The other DHFR-overproducing cells all gave normal initial MTX uptake rates but increased total uptake. The DHFR-overproducing lines all had significant cross-resistance to both metoprine and trimetrexate; the two lines with defective MTX transport were not cross-resistant, and the CEM/MTX-R cells showed collateral sensitivity to these agents. Only minor cross-resistance to homofolic acid was found in all MTX-resistant lines. The highly MTX-resistant RAJI/MTX-R and WI-L2/m4 cells showed minor cross-resistance to the dual inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase and DHFR, CB3717 (5- and 15-fold, respectively). These studies demonstrated that, depending upon the mechanism of resistance, MTX-resistant human tumor cells may be effectively killed by antifolates with different routes of uptake into cells, or with a different enzyme target. Thus, there are at least three functionally distinct classes of folate antagonist with antitumor activity.",,,,,

To investigate the time course of this delayed methylation we have used three different cell lines, two of human and one of hamster origin. These were synchronized by two different methods: mitotic detachment and double hydroxyurea blocks. A uniform picture was obtained with all three cell lines. Delayed methylation of early replicating sequences occurred while cells were still in mid-S-phase, with the maximum rate of delayed methylation occurring in cells in the second half of S and in G2. Delayed methylation seems to be complete before cells entered the next G1-phase. Limited DNAase I hydrolysis of cell nuclei was used to test whether the delay in methylation in some DNA sequences was due to high levels of transcriptional activity. However, DNA sequences exhibiting delayed methylation showed no preferential concentration in or exclusion from DNAase I hypersensitive regions.",,,,,

These vesicles pinch off from the adherent cells after treatment with 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide or 50 mM formaldehyde and 1 mM dithiothreitol, and they are isolated from the supernatant after two centrifugation steps with yields of 20-25% of the initial cell-bound 125I-IgE. With phase and fluorescence microscopy, micron-size vesicles are seen which are unilamellar and spherically shaped and devoid of intracellular organelles. On dextran gradients at least 70% of the 125I-IgE is bound to membranes which band at low density, indicating large, intact vesicles that are impermeable to macromolecules. Between 60 and 75% of the bound 125I-IgE is accessible to the external medium, showing the vesicles to be predominantly right side out. This preparation was found to be suitable for resonance energy-transfer measurements. We have determined that amphipathic, fluorescent donor and acceptor probes partition into the vesicle bilayer in a randomly distributed, noninteracting manner. The densities of the probes can be ascertained directly from the amount of energy transfer that is observed as a function of acceptor concentration. This experimental system will allow energy-transfer measurements to determine distances between sites on receptor-bound IgE and the membrane surface.",,,,,

Despite the use of an HLA identical sibling donor, however, the survival after BMT is reduced by the occurrence of two major immunologic complications: graft-vs-host disease and a long-lasting immune deficiency responsible for late infections. This immune deficiency could be explained by an imbalance of lymphocyte subpopulations reconstituted after transplant. The aim of the present work was to study the helper function by measuring the production of interleukin 2 (IL 2). This lymphokine is responsible for the amplification of the effector phase of immunity. A consecutive series of 34 patients was tested for IL 2 production after BMT. This production was absent or low in 32 of 34 patients for at least 2 yr after BMT. The mechanism of this low IL 2 production was investigated. Irradiation of patients' lymphocytes in vitro with low dose gamma-rays partially restored the IL 2 production after 6 mo of evolution. The IL 2 production was not restored or was slightly affected by irradiation early after BMT. These results suggest that the lack of immune reconstitution after BMT may be caused by the lack of IL 2-producing cells and/or the increased activity of suppressor cells of the helper function. This suppression is radiosensitive.",,,,,

The beta-globin genes were preferentially sensitive to DNase I digestion in both uninduced and induced cells as compared to the alpha-fetoprotein gene and bulk DNA. Additionally, we detected specific cleavage sites in the region of the beta-major globin gene when nuclei from uninduced cells were digested with DNase I. Following induction, a 2- to 4-fold increase in DNase I digestion at one of these hypersensitive sites was observed while digestion at the other sites was greatly reduced. We have localized this primary hypersensitive site to the 5' end of the beta-major gene. To determine when during induction these observed changes in chromatin structure occur, nuclei were digested with DNase I after 6 to 120 h of induction with dimethyl sulfoxide. Some change in chromatin conformation was detectable by 12 h of induction and the configuration characteristic of the fully induced state was established by 24 h of induction. Since it has been reported that increases in beta-globin mRNA levels are not detected until 18-20 h of induction, it appears that alterations in the chromatin conformation of the globin genes may precede the changes in other biochemical parameters associated with differentiation and may be an early reflection of commitment to the erythroid pathway.",,,,,

Special attention was paid to the three regulator enzymes of glycolysis, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Results for the K562 cell line were compared with those for the mature red cell. K562 cells exhibit a relatively low phosphofructokinase and high pyruvate kinase activity. Electrophoresis of hexokinase shows the presence of two bands in the HK I region. HK II is also present, probably as a result of culture conditions. Only 15% of the total hexokinase activity is mitochondrial bound. Phosphofructokinase in K562 cells is mainly composed of the L- and F-types of which the F-type is characteristic for platelets and granulocytes and not for erythrocytes. In the electrophoretic pattern of pyruvate kinase a predominant K4 band besides three hybrids were found. The hybrids were demonstrated to contain L-type subunits of pyruvate kinase, which means a new erythroid marker of K562 cells, as the red cell is the only blood cell that contains L-type pyruvate kinase. Induction experiments with hemin, ARA-C and mitomycin-C gave rise to more than 85% benzidine positive cells after 11 days of culture. The isozyme composition of pyruvate kinase did not change after induction. HK II disappears after induction with ARA-C and mitomycin-C but not with hemin. The results support the idea of the multipotential features of the K562 cell line.",,,,,

Normal peripheral blood B lymphocytes from 18 normal subjects cocultured with equal numbers of autologous T cells generated cells secreting 2,542 +/- 695 IgG, 2,153 +/- 615 IgA, and 2,918 +/- 945 IgM. Normal B lymphocytes cocultured with normal allogeneic T cells generated similar numbers. However, B lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cocultured with T cells from the same patient generated only 0.5% as many cells secreting IgG and 11% and 23% as many secreting IgA and IgM, respectively. The reason for this markedly defective generation of immunoglobulin-secreting cells was investigated by evaluating T-helper, T-suppressor, and B-cell function using B cells from tonsil and T and B cells from peripheral blood of normal and leukemic individuals. T cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia provided somewhat greater help than did normal T cells to normal peripheral blood B cells and normal help to tonsil B cells, whether stimulated with mitogen or antigen. T cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia did not demonstrate increased suppressor function compared to normals with B cells from normal peripheral blood. The hypogammaglobulinemia in these patients therefore was associated with a markedly defective generation of immunoglobulin secreting cells, and as there was normal or increased T-cell helper activity without excessive suppressor activity, it seems likely that this was due to an intrinsic B-cell defect.",,,,,

The lymphocytes did not form E rosettes but had an OKT3+, OKT4+, OKT6+, OKT8+, OKT11+, HNK-1+, HNK-36+, OKIa1+, OKM1+ phenotype and functionally had suppressor and natural killer activity. Morphologically, they were large granular lymphocytes, which were strongly acid phosphatase positive and nonspecific esterase negative. They did not respond to mitogens, or to allogeneic cells. Initially, the spleen appeared to be the most involved organ and, judging from the high proportion of leukemic splenic lymphocytes in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, was also the organ of origin of the leukemic cells. Only a few leukemic cells in the blood and bone marrow were in S and G2/M phases. After splenectomy, the lymphocyte count rose considerably and the bone marrow became progressively more infiltrated by tumor nodules. One year after diagnosis, the patient was started on chemotherapy because of progressive anemia. He responded to the chemotherapy by normalization of the hemoglobin and neutrophil count and had a moderate decrease in the bone marrow involvement and peripheral lymphocytosis.",,,,,

The appearance of these differentiated functions were always accompanied with a loss of mitotic activity. It is well known that the intracellular contractile proteins play an important role in both cell motility and cytokinesis. Our question is, why the actomyosin system in the M1 cell line is utilized only for cell division and not for cell motility before differentiation, and why the opposite situation takes place after differentiation. Changes in contractile proteins hitherto revealed during the differentiation of this cell line are as follows: Actin; contents, synthetic rate, ability to polymerize, ratio of gamma-actin, activity to activate the myosin Mg2+ ATPase, and binding to plasma membrane all showed an increase after differentiation. Changes in the chemical structure of actin molecule were suggested by peptide mapping. In the undifferentiated M1 cytoplasms, an inhibitor protein for actin polymerization was identified. Myosin; contents, ratio of light chain L2, and binding to plasma membrane showed an increase after differentiation. Which one plays the most essential role in the transition from cell division to cell motility, and what interrelation is there among those changes are remained to be disclosed.",,,,,

These transformed, CFUe-like erythroid precursor cells exhibit in their uninduced state, a DNA methylation pattern and globin gene (formula; see text) chromatin configuration (DNase I sensitivity) that is compatible with actual or potential gene transcription. Such features may reflect alterations in chromatin configuration that have occurred at a stage prior to leukemic transformation, during the differentiation of earlier erythroid precursor cells and associated with the restriction in developmental potential characteristic of progression to the CFUe (or MELC) stage of erythropoiesis. Uninduced MELC display a low level of globin gene transcription, producing globin mRNA or mRNA precursors whose processing or stabilization is the target of action of hemin. The major increase in MELC globin gene transcription that is initiated by DMSO, HMBA, or butyric acid, is accompanied by, and perhaps preceded by, an increase in DNase I hypersensitivity in the regions 5' to the active globin genes. This suggests that reorganization of chromatin structure in the globin gene domains is associated with accelerated globin gene transcription and may be characteristic of a developmental transition during terminal differentiation in the erythroid cell lineage.",,,,,

In contrast to T4 CLL, T8 CLL characteristically presents with relatively low lymphocyte counts, little organ involvement, and often only discreet bone marrow involvement, and has a long clinical course. The leukemic cells are often large and have abundant cytoplasm with azurophilic granules. Similar features in cases reported as T8 lymphocytosis with neutropenia lead us to consider both entities part of a spectrum of the same disorder.",,,,,

The B-cell nature of the malignant lymphocytes was determined by surface marker analysis, and cytochemical and ultrastructural studies. The lymphocyte membrane immunoglobulin (IgG1K) did not have anti-sheep red cell activity and was not responsible for the binding of sheep erythrocytes to the leukemic cells as shown by (i) the failure to inhibit rosette formation with anti-immunoglobulin reagents and (ii) the different sensitivity to proteolysis of the membrane immunoglobulin and the sheep erythrocyte receptor. The malignant lymphocytes expressed a receptor for sheep erythrocytes similar to that of normal T cells since they stained with monoclonal antibodies directed against the sheep red cell receptors. Furthermore these antibodies blocked rosette formation. Endogenous labeling experiments demonstrated that the patient's cells produced IgG both of the membrane and of the secretory type. The latter molecular form was also actively secreted. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that the malignant clone comprised cells at different maturational stages and with different secretory properties. These findings were confirmed by the analysis of intracytoplasmic acid hydrolases, which are normally expressed at late maturational stages. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a process of maturation was occurring within the malignant clone.",,,,,

An imbalance in the distribution of OKT-4 and OKT-8 lymphocyte subpopulations was observed, with an overall significant reduction in the OKT-4/OKT-8 ratio. When the patients were subdivided according to Rai's staging classification, the OKT-4/OKT-8 ratio was more severely impaired in stages III and IV than in stages 0, I, and II. The correlation between the expression of Fc receptors and monoclonal antibodies revealed in both systems an increase in cells bearing suppressor phenotypes (OKT-8+ and TG+ cells) and a decrease in cells bearing helper phenotypes (OKT-4+ and TM+). However, a strict correlation between cells defined by the two assays could not be found in individual cases. In some cases a proportion of T lymphocytes (E+ and OKT-3+) did not express the OKT-4 and OKT-8 determinants; possible implications of this finding are discussed.

Sera from seven of the patients studied in partial or complete remission demonstrated significant binding to autochthonous leukemic cells obtained from bone marrow or peripheral blood. In two cases sera taken during the leukemic stage demonstrated the most pronounced binding to the patients' own leukemic cells. Sera from four patients with demonstrable significant binding to autochthonous leukemic cells failed to bind to autochthonous remission cells when both types of target cells were tested in parallel.

The maximum tolerated regimen was found to be 3 g/sq m every 12 hr for 6 days. At this dose, nonhematologic toxicity was limited to conjunctivitis in approximately half of the patients, and liver toxicity (transient elevations in transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, or bilirubin) was frequently observed, but neither was dose-limiting. Extending the duration of treatment to 8 days resulted in excessive diarrhea and skin toxicity (painful erythema with bullae), while increasing the dose to 4.5 g/sq m q. 12 hr for 6 days resulted in severe cerebellar toxicity. Myelosuppression was severe, but was not related to the intensity of treatment; granulocyte recovery occurred a median of 28 days (range 22-40 days) after initiating therapy, and platelet recovery occurred after a median of 25 days (range 16-41 days). Antileukemic activity was evaluable in the 46 patients who survived at least 3 wk. Complete remissions were obtained in 1 of 6 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in accelerated phase and 1 of 3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. A more detailed analysis of response was possible for the 37 evaluable patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia: 70% of these patients responded, with 51% complete remissions. The median unmaintained response was 4 mo (range 2-26+ mo). The complete response rate was higher in patients who received at least 12 doses of high-dose cytosine arabinoside compared to shorter regimens [17/28 (61%) versus 2/9 (22%), p less than 0.05]. Resistance to cytosine arabinoside in conventional doses was documented in 11 patients, 5 of whom responded (2 complete remissions) to high-dose regimens. We conclude that high-dose cytosine arabinoside in the maximally tolerated regimen of 3 g/sq m every 12 hr for 6 days has substantial antileukemic activity in patients refractory to standard therapy. Durable unmaintained remissions can be achieved, even in patients who fail to respond to cytosine arabinoside in conventional doses.",,,,,

The results show a wide variation in the peroxidase and esterase activities in these cells, whereas the percentages of mononuclear phagocytes with Fc gamma and C3b receptors did not differ appreciably from those in normal individuals. A discriminant analysis of these data and corresponding data from normal individuals showed that a below-normal peroxidase activity of circulating monocytes has predictive value for the presence of monocytic leukemia; a below-normal esterase activity has less, but nevertheless some, predictive value in this respect. An increase in the percentage of circulating monocytes, a decrease in the percentage of Fc gamma or C3b receptors, and a decline in the ability to phagocytose bacteria has no predictive value for the presence of monocytic leukemia. The mean percentage of patients' promonocytes that incorporated 3H-thymidine amounted to 80.9%, which is close to the control value in normal individuals. The mean values for the labeling indices of cultured bone marrow and peripheral blood monocytes are 1.0% and 0.74%, respectively; when 3H-thymidine was added to whole blood, the labeling index of the monocytes amounted to 3.6%.

At physiological PH, the chloroethylnitrosoureas can be decomposed into an isocyanate and 2-chloroethyl diazene hydroxide. Therefore, it is clear that they have both alkylation and carbamoylation actions. In addition to the spontaneous chemical dissociation, the nitrosoureas can be metabolized by liver microsomal enzymes to more polar hydroxylated products, and certain nitrosoureas can be denitrosated by these enzymes to the parent urea. Since the lipid-soluble nitrosoureas and some of the water-soluble nitrosoureas such as ACNU and MCNU demonstrated to cross the blood-brain barrier, they have been used in the treatment of primary brain tumors and tumors and tumors of metastatic origin. It has been demonstrated from the results of our study and other reports that the alkylation of DNA by ACNU progresses more slowly as compared with that of other alkylating agents. This is an important finding in relation to the appearance of delayed myelosuppression of the nitrosoureas and in the design of dose schedules of these agents. The major clinical emphasis has been directed towards the more active chloroethylnitrosoureas with reduced myelosuppression, and attempts are now made for this purpose. Unfortunately, the results of phase I and II trials of the newly developed nitrosoureas suggest that these agents produce delayed and cumulative bone marrow toxicity. Antitumor activity of the nitrosoureas is frequestly observed in chronic myelocytic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, brain tumors and small cell carcinoma of the lung, and less frequently in gastrointestinal carcinoma, multiple myeloma and malignant melanoma. In order to enhance clinical effects of the nitrosoureas, further investigation of the design in therapeutic schedules on the basis of their pharmacokinetic characteristics will be needed.",,,65,,

In Ehrlich carcinoma, the protocol of injection was shown to be of critical importance, since high and low levels of protection and even facilitation of tumour growth were observed according to the protocol used. The oil emulsion used as the vehicle for injection of the fractions (control groups) induced facilitation of tumour growth with some protocols. The highest levels of protection were observed when treatment was performed on day -6 for a single i. p. injection or on days -14 and 0 for two injections. Using the former protocol of immunization, the highest level of protection was detected with cell walls and deproteinized cell walls. CWS isolated from the Canadian and Glaxo substrains were found to be inactive, whereas those isolated from the Swedish and Russian substrains induced significant levels of protection. In L1210 leukaemia, very few preparations induced significant protection. CWS preparations did not induce protection. Canadian and Russian deproteinized cell walls and Canadian cell walls (100 and 250 micrograms, respectively) induced some protection. The use of different protocols of injection did not increase the anti-tumour activity of the Canadian cell walls.

We also followed the fate of the internalized ligands and their receptors, as well as the fate of the free receptor on cells internalizing oligomers. In contrast to monomeric IgE, surface-bound oligomeric IgE was internalized. Notably, dimers provided an effective signal for internalization, although larger oligomers seem to be internalized more efficiently. In our experiments, 48% of the cell-bound dimers and 67% of the trimers were eliminated from the cell surface in 180 min. One-half of the maximal internalization observed with dimers and trimers occurred in 25 and 11 min, respectively. Release of radioactivity into the supernatant followed internalization; the released radioactivity did not bind to fresh cells and was only partially TCA-precipitable. Radioactive ligands remaining associated with the cells were unchanged as judged by m.w; they also were shown to remain receptor-bound. During either internalization or release of substantial amounts of the originally cell-bound oligomers, there was no increase in IgE-binding activity. In contrast, there was a transient drop (25%) in the number of free surface receptors suggesting internalization of the free receptors together with the oligomer-occupied receptor. Cells that failed to release histamine (RBL-I) processed dimeric and trimeric IgE similarly to histamine-releasing (RBL-2H3) cells. We conclude that dimeric and trimeric IgE are internalized by RBL cells and later are released to the medium in a partially degraded form. The ligand-bound receptor seems to be internalized with the ligand, along with some free receptor, and does not appear to be reusable or to recycle rapidly to the cell surface.",,,,,

Primary mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) and cell-mediated lysis (CML) responses between the patient's remission (pretransplant) and donor's lymphocytes were negative. Stimulation of donor lymphocytes for 7 d in vitro with irradiated leukemia cells, leukemia cells plus allogeneic irradiated lymphocytes, or a pool of irradiated lymphocytes from 10 donors, did not activate any cytotoxic cells able to destroy the HLA identical leukemic blasts. Further culturing for 7 additional d in T cell growth factor (TCGF) generated lymphocytes that induced effective cytotoxicity against the leukemic blasts, but not against autologous lymphocytes. Effective killing against the leukemia was observed only in cultures initially stimulated with the irradiated leukemia cells. These cytotoxic cells were maintained in TCGF and mediated persistent killing against the leukemic target cells. They were also able to destroy lymphocytes from the patient's mother and father, but not from an unrelated cell donor. This suggested specific recognition of non-HLA antigens inherited by the patient, that were foreign to the HLA identical bone marrow donor. These lymphocytes were cloned by a limiting dilution technique and one clone maintained cytotoxicity to the AML blasts and the father's lymphocytes, but not lymphocytes from the mother or an HLA-identical donor. This cytotoxicity was inhibited by a monoclonal anti-HLA antibody. Thus, in vitro sensitization of this sibling's lymphocytes with AML blasts followed by TCGF expansion, and cloning, enabled the detection of HLA-restricted cytotoxic cells that recognize minor locus histocompatibility antigens. This immune recognition may be relevant to the ""graft vs. leukemia"" effect that has been observed in leukemic animals and patients following histocompatible hematopoietic transplants.",PMC370383,,,,

Using a monoclonal and a polyclonal antiserum a small % (about 10%) of cells was shown to carry this antigen. In double-labelling experiments these cALLA positive cells were shown not to carry surface immunoglobulin, and very little T-antigen if any. During a 13-d cultivation of normal mononuclear blood cells in diffusion chambers, the cALLA positive cells disappeared but could be detected again on day 13 at a frequency comparable to that before culture. Proliferation is discussed as the mechanism accounting for the reappearance of the cALLA positive cells, perhaps due to the influence of the T-helper cells generated during culture.",,,,,

The variant cell line, R1, was derived from the inducer-sensitive DS19 cell line by selection for inducer-resistance. R1 cells are resistant to induction of erythroid differentiation by hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA) whereas the parental line is HMBA-sensitive. Uninduced MELC (both inducer-sensitive DS19 cells and inducer-resistant R1 cells) have DNase I-sensitive sites in chromatin containing the alpha 1- and beta maj-globin genes. These nuclease-sensitive regions are located within the beta maj-globin second intervening sequence (IVS2) and near the alpha 1-globin gene 5' cap site. Culture with HMBA causes changes in chromatin structure in both parental and variant cell lines. In DS19 cells, the DNase I-sensitive site within the beta maj-globin IVS2 becomes more resistant to nuclease cleavage, and a new DNase I-sensitive region develops near the beta maj-globin cap site. In addition, the nuclease-sensitive region adjacent to the cap site of the alpha 1-globin gene increases, and a novel 5' nuclease-sensitive site is also established. In R1 cells, HMBA-mediated changes in chromatin structure are incomplete. The DNase I-sensitive site within the beta maj-globin IVS2 becomes more resistant to nuclease cleavage, but the nuclease sensitivity near the beta maj-globin cap site does not increase to the extent observed in DS19 cells. The pattern of nuclease sensitivity near the alpha 1-globin gene is essentially unchanged after culture of R1 cells with HMBA. Thus, in R1 cells, resistance to HMBA-induced expression of globin genes is associated with failure to detect inducer-mediated changes in chromatin structure 5' to the cap site of the alpha 1- and beta maj-globin genes. These results also suggest that the increased nuclease resistance of a site in the beta maj-globin IVS2 does not depend on the establishment of a DNase I-sensitive region near the beta maj-globin gene cap site.",PMC394040,,,,

Five deaths were due to acute leukaemia, but in 3 of these the diagnosis of aplastic anaemia was retrospectively doubtful. Long-term adverse reactions were rare: 2 cases each of benign hepatoma and peliosis; jaundice was frequent, but no cirrhosis was observed. Survivors who had been treated before puberty reached normal weight and height. Six normal pregnancies occurred. Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria was noted in 8 patients with uncontrolled disease. After androgen therapy was discontinued 50% of the patients relapsed with equally or less severe symptoms. Relapses were more frequent when androgens were abruptly withdrawn or in cases with incomplete initial improvement. Most relapses responded to androgen treatment. More than 25% of the patients are still androgen-dependent.

A high rate of chromosome breakage is observed in mitoses of cultured blood cells, but the caryotypes are normal. Forty-four patients (27 boys and 17 girls) were followed in the same department between 1962 and 1976. Most were treated with androgens, sometimes combined with corticosteroids. Nine patients died of acute granuloblastic leukaemia, with more than 25% bone marrow blasts; in three of these, cytogenetic examination showed clonal anomalies. Five patients were in preleukaemic state with non-blastic bone marrow; 4 showed clonal anomalies and 2 of these died of aplasia; the 5th patient had gross liver and spleen enlargement and died of haemorrhage. Among the 30 remaining patients 12 are still alive and 18 died of cerebral haemorrhage (7), hepatic failure (3), cardiac failure (1), pancreatitis (1), septicaemia (2) or graft-versus-host reaction after bone marrow transplantation. One patient transplanted 4 years ago has complete chimerism and is still alive without treatment. The incidence of leukaemic or preleukaemic state in this series was 30%, while no case of leukaemia was observed in 200 patients with acquired aplastic anaemia. Neither parents norsibship had leukaemia. Androgen treatment apparently did not increase the risk of leukaemia which developed within 1 to 13 years (mean = 5 years) of the diagnosis, was preceded by a 2 1/2 year long preleukaemic state with clonal chromosomal anamolies and invariably was of the granulocytic type.

In vitro clonogenic assays were used to measure cytotoxicity following a 3-hr drug exposure. 5'-dFUrd was less potent than was 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine in all cells examined, exhibiting its best activity against the 47-DN [concentration that prevented 50% clonal growth compared to untreated control (LD50) = 32 microM] and MCF-7 (LD50 = 35 microM) breast carcinomas and MG-63 osteosarcoma (LD50 = 41 microM). Intermediate activity was observed against HCT-8 (LD50 = 200 microM) and Colo-357 (LD50 = 150 microM) gastrointestinal tumors. 5'-dFUrd had very poor activity against the HL-60 leukemia (LD50 = 470 microM). The suppression of the clonal growth of human bone marrow stem cells required the greatest amount of 5'-dFUrd (LD50 = 580 microM). With use of these studies, a therapeutic ratio (concentration that prevented 25% clonal growth compared to untreated control of bone marrow divided by LD50 of tumor) was calculated for each drug in each tumor. 5'-dFUrd had values ranging from 1.2 to 7.5 for the solid tumors and 0.5 in HL-60 cells. This was in marked contrast to 5-fluorouracil, or 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, which failed in all cases to have ratios greater than or equal to one. The results indicate that 5'-dFUrd can exhibit a cytotoxic selectivity for human tumor cells compared to human bone marrow stem cells that does not exist for 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine. This suggests that 5'-dFUrd may be of greater therapeutic benefit in the treatment of certain human cancers than the fluoropyrimidines used currently.",,,,,

The enriched T-cells (E-rosette positive) from all B-CLL cases showed a reduced capacity to induce the differentiation of normal B-lymphocytes compared with normal T-cells (P less than 0.005). After enrichment of the T mu cells, the helper/inducer capacity was still significantly depressed compared with the same fraction from normal controls (P less than 0.01). On the other hand, enriched T gamma cells from B-CLL were effective in suppressing the differentiation of normal B-lymphocytes to a similar degree as normal T gamma cells. These findings are indicative of a deficient T-cell helper function in B-CLL, which appears to be unrelated to the clinical stage of the disease. The fractionation experiments suggest that this functional impairment is not only due to the abnormal T-cell subset distribution seen in the majority of cases, but point to a possible intrinsic defect within the T mu cell population.",,,,,

B cells were cross-sensitive to FU and dFUR. On the other hand, leukemia L1210 cells were sensitive to FU but resistant to dFUR. The difference in the biological activities of FU and dFUR in B and L1210 cells correlated with (a) the metabolism of dFUR to FU by intact B (60% conversion) and L1210 (no conversion) cells, and (b) the phosphorylase activity of B (660 nmoles converted in 2 hr per mg protein) and L1210 (undetectable) cells. The intracellular metabolism of FU and dFUR was studied using a reversed-phase ion-pair high pressure liquid chromatographic assay. FU and dFUR shared similar metabolic pathways in B cells; their anabolites included FU ribose and deoxyribose nucleosides and nucleotides. In L1210 cells, FU was anabolized to 5-fluorouridine triphosphate and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, whereas dFUR was present mainly as the unchanged drug. Further metabolism studies using dFUR with tritium label in either the FU moiety or the altered sugar moiety established that the metabolic pathway of dFUR to cytotoxic FU anabolites in the B cells was via phosphorolysis to FU. These data indicate that, on a cellular level, an FU prodrug such as dFUR, which is activated by cytosolic enzyme, has a different selectivity from that of FU, and that the basis of differential selectivity is the initial phosphorolysis to FU.",,,,,

Similar to the loss of antibody response capacity by their splenocytes, the FLV-infected mice progressively lost the ability to produce helper factors in response to lipopolysaccharide. In vitro cultures of FLV-infected cells also showed a depressed ability to produce helper factor activity both spontaneously and in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation.

NK activity present in PBL from 10 HCL patients was at least six-fold lower (p less than 0.01) than that present in PBL from 15 healthy donors. Decreased NK activity in HCL PBL was not due to dilution of the NK effector cells by the neoplastic cells; in fact, NK activity of PBL from 4 HCL patients with less than 5% circulating neoplastic cells was still five-fold lower (p less than 0.01) than that present in normal PBL. Partial characterization of the NK defect in HCL patients indicated that: (A) defective cytotoxicity was not dependent on the duration of the assay; (B) HCL PBL added to normal PBL during the assay did not exert suppressor activity; (C) the NK activity of HCL PBL could be potentiated in vitro by interferon; and (D) low levels of NK activity were associated with reduced numbers of circulating monocytes (p less than 0.01) and of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) (p less than 0.01).

In a diffusion-limited reaction the effect will be on the rate of dissociation but not on the rate of association until the cell is virtually saturated with ligand. If the rate of reaction is not diffusion limited, then the opposite holds; i.e., the forward velocities will be proportional to the concentration of vacant receptors, but the reverse reactions will not be. We examined the kinetics of reaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) and its receptor and clearly demonstrated that the reaction is not diffusion controlled. The substantial (congruent to 30-fold) increase in the forward rate constant observed for the reaction of IgE with solubilized receptors as opposed to cell-bound receptors is therefore not an artifact of calculation. Since the reverse rate constants show little difference, we postulate that the presence of other surface components (rather than conformational differences in the receptor) affects the reaction with the cells. As an aid to the analysis, the theory has been extended so that not only the rate constants but also the entire course of the reaction of ligand with cell receptors can be predicted for diffusion-limited vs. non-diffusion-limited interactions.",,,,,

The component of PMA-induced P388D1 supernatant responsible for its co-mitogenic activity is probably PMA, rather than interleukin 1. For responsive clones, the co-mitogenic effect of PMA requires stimulator cells that display the specific allogeneic determinants recognized by the clones. This response persists after T cells are removed from the stimulating population, ruling out induction of mitogenic lymphokines from stimulator T cells by PMA as a primary mechanism for augmentation of clonal proliferation. Both splenocytes and thymocytes cooperate with PMA for enhanced clonal expansion, but heat treatment (45 degrees C, 45 min) of thymocytes destroys their cooperative capacity. PMA can also potentiate the lymphokine-driven proliferation of cloned T cells, indicating that PMA can, under certain conditions, influence T cell clonal expansion by a direct action on T lymphocytes.",,,,,

The origin of the NK-like cells was not previously known because, although the majority of fresh human NK cells react with monoclonal antibodies OKM1 and B73.1, lymphocytes bearing these markers are not detected several days after the onset of MLC, when NK-like cells are present. In this study, experiments were undertaken to determine whether NK-like cells generated after stimulation with x-irradiated pooled allogeneic normal cells (poolx) or with autologous LCL are derived from cells expressing antigens reactive with monoclonal antibodies OKM1 or B73.1, which react with fresh NK cells. Mononuclear cells, depleted of monocytes, were stained with OKM1 or B73.1 and fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Lymphocytes depleted of OKM1+ or B73.1+ cells, by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and lymphocytes that were stained but not sorted were stimulated for 7 days with either poolx or autologous LCL. The generation of NK-like activity was decreased at least 90% after depletion of cells reactive with OKM1 or B73.1, whereas the generation of CTL against autologous and allogeneic LCL was minimally affected. These findings show that NK-like cells generated in MLC are derived from cells that express the phenotype of fresh NK cells (OKM1+ or B73.1+) and that CTL can be generated in cultures in which relatively little NK-like activity is concomitantly detected, by depleting NK cells with monoclonal antibodies before stimulation.",,,,,

In that report the receptor was isolated by using a heavily absorbed polyclonal antibody raised against lymphocytes bearing receptors for IgE (5). Monomeric IgE binds so weakly to macrophages that affinity chromatography of IgE-receptor complexes, such as has been used for isolation of the receptors for IgE on basophils (6) and for IgG on macrophages (7), cannot be readily accomplished. We have used oligomers of IgE to enhance the binding of IgE to macrophages (3), but this alone would not be sufficient because--depending on whether the receptors are multi- or univalent--once the cells are solubilized, multipoint attachment would again be reduced if not abrogated. In this report we describe the use of cross-linking reagents to stabilize further the interaction between IgE and its receptor on peritoneal macrophages. With this approach we have found that the receptor is likely to be composed of two chains whose gross properties are similar to the polypeptides constituting the receptor with high affinity for monomeric IgE on rat basophilic leukemia cells and mast cells.",,,,,

In addition, glycoproteins of 25-28, 37, and 44 kDa are found in anti-T3 immunoprecipitates derived from surface-labeled cells. The four antigens appeared to be strongly associated with each other in detergent-containing solutions. Comparative studies of the four proteins, facilitated by the use of endo-beta-N-acetylglycosaminidase F, revealed that their polypeptide backbones have different molecular weights and pI values. Moreover, peptide maps of the 20-kDa T3 and the 25-28-kDa T3 were quite different. Metabolic labeling experiments suggested that the 25-28-kDa protein might become associated with the 20-kDa T3 antigen during biosynthesis. The 37-kDa and 44-kDa proteins could not, however, be detected and, therefore, might become associated with the 20-kDa T3 on the cell surface.

The cells were also 11-fold cross-resistant to 5-fluorouracil. In contrast to several previous studies involving FdUrd-resistant mouse cells, thymidylate synthetase levels were not substantially elevated in these FdUrd-resistant human leukemic cells. Thymidine kinase activity was also unchanged in the resistant cells, although the levels of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate (FdUMP), the potent inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase, generated at equimolar doses of FdUrd were about 40% lower than in the sensitive cells. Studies of the kinetics of FdUMP binding to thymidylate synthetase isolated from the FdUrd-resistant cells disclosed a considerably higher dissociation constant (Kd = 1.0 X 10(-9) M) for the ternary covalent enzyme . FdUMP . 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate complex compared to the value obtained with enzyme from sensitive cells (Kd = 4.4 X 10(-11) M). The thymidylate synthetase from the FdUrd-resistant cells also showed 17-fold weaker binding of 2'-deoxyuridylate, even though the Km value for 2'-deoxyuridylate was 3-fold lower compared to the enzyme from FdUrd-sensitive cells. The turnover number of the altered enzyme was 1.8-fold higher than that for the normal enzyme but the rate constants for the release of FdUMP from the ternary complex, which is also an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, were identical for both enzymes. Electrophoresis of the radiolabeled ternary complexes on nondenaturing gels showed small but reproducible differences in migration rates. These results demonstrate that the mechanism of resistance to FdUrd in this cell line involves an alteration in the target enzyme, thymidylate synthetase, which causes it have a lower affinity for nucleotides.",,,,,

MLC stimulatory capacity was either normal or strongly decreased in comparison with that of normal lymphocytes despite the expression of HLA-DR antigens and p23,30 (""Ia-like"") determinants on the tumor cells of all patients. Strongly decreased stimulatory capacity of HLA-DR-positive tumor cells could not be ascribed to suppressive activity of the tumor cells. Tumor cells from three patients with a T-cell malignancy failed to stimulate in MLC and did not react with anti-p23,30 serum. The decreased stimulatory capacity of many DR-positive neoplastic cells is ascribed either to altered membrane presentation of DR antigens or to the absence of MLC stimulatory determinants specified by genes closely linked to, but different from, those coding for DR.",,,,,

Although T-PLL appears to be heterogenous in respect of membrane phenotype, the observation of unexpected features in 8 of the cases raises the possibility that it may originate in a cell of intermediate maturation between late thymocytes and mature T-lymphocytes.

This antigenic pattern was detected by OKT monoclonal antibodies. PMA treatment did not cause the expression of a cytotoxic function but rather induced the expression of a suppressor cell marker. This marker was characterized by the ability of the treated CEM cells to suppress [3H]thymidine incorporation into phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes. After 4 days of treatment of CEM cells from either cloned or the parental cell population with 16 nM PMA, 71-98% of the cells expressed reactivity with OKT3 and OKT8 antibodies whereas reactivity with OKT4 and OKT6 was detected in less than or equal to 1-8% of the cells. The CEM cells can be divided into five groups based on the antigenic patterns of cells from randomly isolated clones. The cells from four of these groups were characterized by either low or high reactivity with each of the four OKT antibodies. The antigenic pattern of the fifth group resembled that of the parent CEM cells. The acquisition of reactivity with the OKT3 antibody in the CEM cells after PMA treatment was dependent on both time and dose and did not require cell replication. Acquisition of reactivity with OKT3 antibody also occurred after treatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate but not after treatment with phorbol 13-monoacetate, phorbol 12,13-diacetate, or dimethyl sulfoxide. These results indicate that treatment of CEM cells with PMA and related agents can cause the cells to express a phenotype that resembles that of a mature suppressor T lymphocyte.",PMC347334,,,,

Gain of chromosomes 8, 19 and 22 would characterize leukemic myeloblasts in an early stage of differentiation.

This lymphocyte product, which may have implications in the fibrosis associated with chronic cell-mediated inflammatory lesions, is not elaborated by unstimulated lymphocytes. Characterization of the fibroblast mitogenic factor differentiated it from a monocyte-derived factor with similar activity. The T cell factor appears to be a protein with an apparent m.w. of 40,000 and an isoelectric point between 5.0 and 5.5. This fibroblast growth factor can be produced in the relative absence of monocytes, and further evidence that the factor is a T cell product stems from the ability of a human T cell line to generate such a factor. Comparison of the biochemical characteristics of the normal T cell product with those of the T cell line revealed them to be indistinguishable. Thus, the T cell line can be used as a source of fibroblast-activating factor (FAF) for more detailed analysis of its structure and function. Further characterization of this lymphokine may contribute to understanding the mechanisms that mediate fibrosis in normal tissue repair as well as in the pathophysiologic fibrotic response associated with certain chronic inflammatory diseases.",,,,,

It is suggested that these data explain, at least in part, the lack of immuneparesis of HCL as compared with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) which is consistently associated with immuneparesis and an excess of Leu 2a+ suppressor cells. In individual splenectomised patients, some variations in Leu 2a+ and 3a+ numbers were observed, and it is suggested that the spleen, known to be important in the natural history of HCL, may have an influence on peripheral T-cell subsets. Although HCL is clearly shown to differ from CLL and myeloma regarding T-cell subset numbers, the fundamental mechanism underlying this difference remains unknown.",,,,,

Specific mortality rates from respiratory diseases (particularly pneumonia), infectious diseases, congenital heart disease, leukaemia and neurological disorders are still substantially increased. Disorders of immunological functioning, particularly T-cell mediated, appear related to this increased vulnerability, although further research is necessary.

Investigations were therefore undertaken to investigate the possible significance of this secondary biochemical modification by comparing the activity of the HMGs with and without their glycosyl side chains in various functional assays of the proteins. For example, these HMGs have been found to be equally effective in the partial inhibition of the histone deacetylase enzymes of mammalian cell nuclei whether or not they contain covalently bound carbohydrate residues. We also investigated the possibility that the glycosyl modifications might be involved in the reported ability of these HMGs to specifically cause reconstitution of the DNase I-sensitive structure of ""active"" genes in salt-depleted chromatin. Unexpectedly, in experiments with both the active beta-globin gene of Friend cells and the total complement of active genes in these same mouse cells (which can be preferentially labeled by nuclear nick translation) we have been unable, using purified HMG 14 and 17 preparations, to reconstitute the active DNase I structure of genes in salt-depleted chromatin preparations. Therefore, the possible role, if any, played by HMG glycosylation in such reconstitution experiments remains unknown. However, in the course of these experiments we did find that HMG 14 and 17 proteins covalently linked to carbohydrate side chains bind preferentially to the nuclear protein matrix of mammalian cells. Furthermore, this association appears to be mediated through the glycosyl side chains since enzymatic removal of these modifications from the HMGs greatly reduced their binding to the nuclear matrix. Since numerous workers have implicated the nuclear matrix as the site of both RNA transcription and DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, the finding of HMG association with this nuclear structure may have significance for our understanding of the overall architectural organization of the active domains of chromatin in cells.",,,,,

Partially purified granulocytic chalone (PPGC) was added to cultures of a rat myeloid cell line (W25), a human myeloid cell line (HL60), a human B lymphocytic cell line (8392), and a human T lymphocytic cell line (8402). The growth rate of the target cell populations was directly assessed by serial cell counts. PPGC pretreatment resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation of the 2 myeloid permanent cell lines, while the growth rate of the lymphocytic cell lines was not affected. Moreover, inhibition of cell proliferation was spontaneously reversed when PPGC treatment was discontinued.

This method, using the Moloney virus as a carrier in a hapten-carrier system, allows to definition of the specific helper function of antibody responses. T helper cells were induced in murine sarcoma virus or inactivated Moloney murine leukemia virus-primed spleens or lymph nodes. T helper function was due to Thy-1.2, Lyt-1+2- cells and was macrophage-dependent. It was stimulated by whole virus of Moloney gp71 envelope protein but not Moloney p30 internal protein.

The supernatants were then recovered and the cells washed in fresh RPMI. T cells from normal donors and from CGL patients were then cocultured with normal allogeneic marrow cells grown in soft agar for CFU-C colony formation. Target marrow cells were also grown in agar in the presence of T-derived supernatants. The results of this study can be summarized as follows. (1) Normal PB and BM T cells efficiently suppressed autologous and allogeneic CFU-C growth after PWM stimulation. (2) T cells derived from peripheral blood or marrow of CGL patients failed to inhibit CFU-C growth, whether pretreated with PWM or not. (3) The supernatants of PWM-treated normal T cells strongly inhibited CFU-C colony formation, whereas the supernatants of PWM-treated CGL T cells had no CFU-C/suppressor activity. These data indicate that T cells from CGL patients cannot be primed to become CFU-C suppressor cells after PWM: stimulation in vitro and cannot release a soluble inhibitor of granulopoiesis produced by PWM-primed normal T cells.",,,,,

T-cell subsets defined by the presence of Fc receptors for IgM or IgG showed an overall increase in the proportion of T gamma cells and a non-significant decrease of T mu cells, regardless of the clinical state of the disease. Results with monoclonal antibodies showed that in patients with HCL in clinical remission T-cell subsets were normally balanced, while in patients with active disease the distribution and absolute number of T-cell subpopulations appeared markedly impaired, with a significant increase of OKT8 positive cells (suppressor/cytotoxic) and a significant reduction of OKT4 positive cells (helper/inducer) compared both with active disease patients and with normal controls. The OKT4+/OKT8+ ratio was also significantly reduced in patients with active disease compared with those in clinical remission and with controls (0.96 v 1.63 and v 1.94, respectively). Our findings confirm the heterogeneity of T-cell subset positivity defined by monoclonal antibodies and by Fc mu and Fc gamma receptors and suggest that in patients with HCL the distribution of OKT4 and OKT8 positive cells is closely correlated to the clinical state of the disease.",,,,,

In addition, mice treated with guanazole combined with 5-fluorouracil survived longer than was observed with any dose of guanazole or with 5-fluorouracil alone. Tetrahydrodeoxyuridine, a potential prodrug of a transition-state analog of deoxycytidylate deaminase, did not have antitumor activity by itself nor did it improve the therapeutic response of leukemic mice to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that deoxyuridylate accumulation was limited by inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase but not by administration of tetrahydrodeoxyuridine.

Surface markers for T and B cells and in some cases functional assays, were also performed. Our results indicate a heterogeneous pattern in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency: one had peripheral blood mononuclear cells negative with all the monoclonal antibodies used; one had an increase in OKM2+ cells, whereas OKT3+ cells were absent; one had defect and imbalance of immunoregulatory T cell subpopulations. Major imbalances of T cell subsets were not detected in patients with X-linked agamma and IgA defect, whereas in some patients with common variable hypogammaglobulinemia an inversion of the physiological ratio between OKT4+ and OKT8+ cells was consistently detected. In an unclassified case of primary immunodeficiency, almost all peripheral blood mononuclear cells formed rosettes with sheep erythrocytes, but lacked antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies.

Cells with bright surface Ig. a volume greater than or equal to 178 fl. and elevated amounts of Ia responded poorly to TPA.

The stimulating capacity of unirradiated CLL B cells and CLL monocytes or irradiated CLL B cells was significantly depressed as compared to that of respective normal B cells and monocytes in allogeneic MLR. The responding capacity of CLL T cells was also variably lower than that of normal T cells against unirradiated or irradiated normal allogeneic B cells and monocytes. The depressed allogeneic MLR between CLL B cells or CLL monocytes and normal T cells described in the present study could be explained on the basis of a defect in the stimulating antigens of leukemic B cells or monocytes. The decreased allogeneic MLR of CLL T cells might simply be explained by a defect in the responsiveness of T lymphocytes from patients with CLL. However, these speculations do not adequately explain the complete lack of autologous MLR in these patients. When irradiated CLL B cells or irradiated CLL T cells were cocultured with normal T cells and irradiated normal B cells, it was found that there was no suppressor cell activity of CLL B cells or CLL T cells on normal autologous MLR. Our data suggest that the absence or dysfunction of autoreactive T cells within the Tnon-gamma subset account for the lack of autologous MLR in patients with CLL.

Furthermore, this augmented suppression could be abrogated by the addition of monoclonal anti-gp70 antibody.

In our experiments, PGE1 or PGE2 suppressed the generation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in the syngeneic mixed lymphocyte tumor cell cultures. Indomethacin, a PG synthetase inhibitor, blocked the induction of the macrophage-mediated suppression, which suggested that suppression was caused by endogenous PG. This suppression might be further mediated by the generation of suppressor T-cells. Significant reduction in the levels of macrophage-induced suppression was seen in hosts receiving cyclophosphamide treatment, which could eliminate the precursors of suppressor T-cells.

It suppressed the induction of specific tumor immunity in the syngeneic, primary mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture reactions. Preexposure of splenic adherent cells (SAC) to syngeneic FBL-3 tumor cells induced complete suppression of the generation of cytotoxic T-cells. The SAC responsible for inducing suppression were consistent with being macrophages. They were resistant to the treatment of anti-Thy-1.2 antibody plus complement and were relatively radioresistant (at least less than or equal to 750 R X-radiation). Adherent cells obtained from lymph nodes or thymuses acted in the same way as SAC. However, preexposure of peritoneal adherent cells to tumor cells failed to induce suppression. In contrast, the simultaneous presence of peritoneal adherent cells with SAC upon exposure to tumor cells prevented the induction of suppression. These peritoneal cells were also consistent with being macrophages. These results confirmed our previous observations obtained with experiments performed in the allogeneic system. An immunoregulatory circuit existed between two subsets of macrophages that were derived from the population of cells in the peritoneal cavity and from spleen, lymph nodes, or thymus. In the presence of tumor cells, these macrophages produced both positive regulation and negative regulation of the T-cell-mediated cytotoxic response against syngeneic tumor cells. The tumor cells may have utilized the host's own immune network to activate the suppressor mechanisms, thus successfully evading the host's immune surveillance.",,,,,

The cells also bore a receptor for histamine inhibitable by cimetidine (H-2). The clonal nature of the proliferation was documented by the presence of a consistent marker chromosome (22-trisomy) in metaphases elicited by culture with T cell growth factors. Although the surface phenotype suggested that these cells might function as suppressor lymphocytes, they had an enhancing effect on the pokeweed- mitogen- (PWM) driven generation of plasma cells and reverse hemolytic plaque-forming cells in vitro. This helper activity was modified neither by irradiation of the leukemic cells nor by removal of a minor population of Leu-3a+ cells, suggesting that the effects were attributable to the CLL cells themselves. In addition to these functions, the CLL cells were active in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays in association with expression of Fc receptors for IgG. The ADCC was diminished when a transient loss of the Fc receptor expression was observed. No activity in natural killer cell assays employing K-562 cells or herpes simplex virus- (HSV) infected cells as targets could be attributed to the leukemic clone. These studies indicate that the cell surface phenotype, as defined by monoclonal antibodies, may not always predict the functional state of a particular cell, and suggest that within the Leu-2a+ (TH-2+) population of human lymphocytes, some helper as well as suppressor/cytotoxic cells are to be found.",,,,,

Mice were irradiated sublethally and 16 hr later 131I-labeled tumor cells were injected either subcutaneously or i.p. Simultaneously, graded doses of various effector cell populations were injected i.v. and the mice were counted daily to assess the potential elimination of the radiolabeled tumor cells. Thus, allogeneic 2 degrees mixed leukocyte culture cells were observed to eliminate allogeneic but not syngeneic tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner, with as few as 0.2 x 10(6) effector cells causing significant destruction of 2 x 10(6) allogeneic tumor cells. The protective effect of the mixed leukocyte culture cells was considerably reduced when Lyt-2+-bearing lymphocytes were eliminated by treatment with monoclonal antibody plus complement. In additional experiments, Lyt-2+ lymphocytes positively selected by enrichment on antibody-coated petri dishes gave efficient protection, in the absence of Lyt-2- cells. Surprisingly, when several different cloned, specific, long-term allogeneic cytolytic T cells lines were injected either i.p. of i.v., tumor cell destruction was observed only after i.p. injection.",,,,,
