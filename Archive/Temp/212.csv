Children's Cancer and Leukemia Study Group.,143-55,"Bcl-2 expression and its prognostic value were evaluated in 42 children with acute leukemia. The Bcl-2 expression of the leukemic blast cells was measured quantitatively by flow cytometry and was further analyzed by the simultaneous immunostaining of Bcl-2 with the surface membrane antigens, DNA, Ki-67 antigen. All of the cases showed a consistent expression of Bcl-2 protein; virtually all leukemic lymphoblasts were Bcl-2 positive. Although the expression of Bcl-2 varied widely from 7 to 80 x 10(3) MESF units, no significant difference was found in the mean value between the patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and those with acute myeloblastic leukemia. In more than half of the patients with AML, intraclonal heterogeneity of Bcl-2 expression was observed. The expression of Bcl-2 showed no apparent fluctuations during the different phases of the cell cycle. However, the proportion of Bcl-2-positive and -negative cells during the cell cycle was different between ALL and AML patients. In the ALL patients, few Bcl-2-negative cells were detected only in the GI phase, whereas in the AML patients Bcl-2-negative cells were detected in the S and G2/M phases, as well as in the G1 phase. No apparent difference was found in Bcl-2 expression between the Ki-67-negative noncycling population and the Ki-67-positive cycling population. Of the clinical features of these patients, only CD34 expression in the ALL patients was associated with high levels of Bcl-2 expression. In the 28 untreated cases of ALL, high expression of Bcl-2 was not an unfavorable factor for the outcome of this disease.","['Tsurusawa, M', 'Saeki, K', 'Katano, N', 'Fujimoto, T']","['Tsurusawa M', 'Saeki K', 'Katano N', 'Fujimoto T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA/analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/analysis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880019809167229 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Mar-Apr;15(2):143-55. doi: 10.3109/08880019809167229.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",['Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Mar-Apr;15(2):105-7.

The impact of severe skeletal involvement (SI) on survival and the correlation between SI and biological markers were analyzed. Therefore, radiographs and medical charts of 106 ALL patients who received a skeletal survey at the time of diagnosis and were treated at the University Children's Hospital Wurzburg between 1974 and 1995 were reviewed. On the basis of the skeletal survey, SI was quantified using a score. Fifty-nine patients (55%) showed radiographic abnormalities defined as metaphyseal banding (48%), periosteal reactions (11%), osteolysis (33%), osteosclerosis (31%), or osteopenia (22%). Children with severe SI (n = 32) presented with a higher rate of severe radiographic abnormalities such as geographic destructive osteolysis (37%; P < .001) and periosteal reactions (28%; P < .05) compared with children with moderate SI (0% and 4%, respectively). Patients with severe SI showed a lower peripheral blast count (P < .05) at diagnosis, a more frequent ""prednisone good response"" (P < .05), and a higher survival rate (83 +/- 7%; P < .05) than patients without SI (54 +/- 9%). Patients with moderate SI (n = 27) showed a higher hemoglobin concentration (P < .05), an enlargement of liver (P < .05) and spleen (P < .01), a higher BFM risk factor (P < .01), but still a higher survival rate (73 +/- 11%) than patients without SI (NS). Patients with severe SI had a higher (P < .001) DNA content of leukemic cells as measured by DNA index (DI) than patients without SI. Thirty-one percent of patients with severe SI, 22% of patients with moderate SI, and no patient without SI had a DI > 1.16. No patient with a DI < 1.0 presented with severe SI. The number of radiographic abnormalities in patients with SI correlated with the DI (rho: 0.46; P < .001). However, patients with euploidy (DI = I) and severe SI also had a higher (P = .05) survival rate (70 +/- 18%; n = 15) than euploid patients without SI (49 +/- 11%; n = 24). Of the patients with severe SI, 78% had common ALL and 22% had an ALL type other than common ALL (P < .05). In patients with ALL types different from common ALL, severe SI was also associated with higher survival rates. We conclude that on the basis of clinical features, two distinct subgroups could be identified in terms of SI. Patients with clinically relevant severe SI had a better prognosis, a higher DI, and more frequently a common ALL than patients without SI. However, the impact of severe SI on prognosis was independent of DI and type of leukemia.","['Muller, H L', 'Horwitz, A E', 'Kuhl, J']","['Muller HL', 'Horwitz AE', 'Kuhl J']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Diseases/blood/*complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Bone and Bones/diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA/analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pain', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1998/05/21 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1998/05/21 00:00'],"['1998/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880019809167227 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Mar-Apr;15(2):121-33. doi: 10.3109/08880019809167227.,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, in order to clarify indication for operation and perioperative management, 6 cases were classified into 2 groups. The details of each group were as follows: Group 1 was defined by the fact that the underlying hematological disease had not yet been controlled. (One case was ITP and the others were 2 AML cases). Group 2 was defined by the fact that the underlying hematological disease was well controlled. (One case was CML, one case was ATL and one case was ITP). A tendency to bleed was corrected in all patients of group 1 in the perioperative period. In the AML cases, prevention of infection was mandatory because both AML cases had been in remission, and no serious postoperative complication had occurred. The outcome of short term treatment was excellent in all but one case, in whom the recurrence of subdural hematoma caused death during the period 1 month after operation. On the other hand, no cases classified in group 2 needed specific hematological perioperative management and the short term treatment outcome was excellent. Since intracranial hemorrhage related to hematological disease has often been fatal, those patients were treated conservatively in most cases. However, from our analyses, we were able to emphasize that most intracranial hemorrhage related to hematological disease might be treated surgically and with good result, if the underlying hematological disease has entered the remission period.","['Ochiai, H', 'Yamakawa, Y', 'Ikeda, T', 'Miyata, S', 'Fukushima, T', 'Makino, S']","['Ochiai H', 'Yamakawa Y', 'Ikeda T', 'Miyata S', 'Fukushima T', 'Makino S']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Miyazaki Prefectural Hospital, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,No Shinkei Geka,No shinkei geka.

RESULTS: In summary, 52 patients showed alterations of the lung. Pulmonary hyperhydration was seen in 21 cases, bacterial pneumonia was found in 18 cases, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was documented in 14 cases, and 5 cases of severe haemorrhage were seen. An unexplained pulmonary edema in 13 patients with interstitial and alveolar infiltrates is considered to be a complication of treatment with cytosine- arabinoside. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that chest X- ray and computed tomography have a high impact in detection and treatment of pulmonary complications following intensive chemotherapy. We may expect the development of diffuse opacity following administration of cytosine-arabinoside in medium-sized doses.","['Kirchner, J', 'Boehme, A', 'Huttmann, C', 'Jacobi, V']","['Kirchner J', 'Boehme A', 'Huttmann C', 'Jacobi V']","['Abt.

Among three main histological subtypes, the small-cleaved cell type demonstrated highest positive persentage (83%), followed by lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma (71%) and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (51%). In respect to immunological subtypes, bcl-2 was detected in 69% of B cell lymphoma, 75% of T cell lymphoma, and 83% of lymphomas which could not be classified by present immunohistochemistry repectively. The results indicated that the inhibition of apoptosis might not be one of reasons for the development of some LMALT.","['Gao, Y H', 'Yang, L J', 'Huang, G S']","['Gao YH', 'Yang LJ', 'Huang GS']","[""Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,8711066,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis']",1996/09/01 00:00,1998/05/21 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi. 1996 Sep;31(5):278-80.,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of studies have suggested that decreases in the cellular level of protein phosphotyrosine content may play a role in MEL cell differentiation. In particular, it was shown that the expression of several protein tyrosine phosphatase genes accompany this process and that the transfection of one of these genes into MEL cells followed by its subsequent expression induced eythroid differentiation. However, none of the physiological substrates for these protein tyrosine phosphatases have been identified. It is shown here that MEL cell differentiation is accompanied by decreases in tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and possibly of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). Immunoprecipitation of the EpoR and analysis of co-precipitated proteins, indicates that the EpoR associates with Vav, STAT5 and an unidentified 60 Kd protein, . HMBA-induced erythroid differentiation abrogates these associations. The phosphatase inhibitors, Na3VO4 and levamisole, inhibit HMBA-induced differentiation as well as the association of the EpoR with Vav, STAT5 and the 60 Kd protein. This is of interest since Na3VO4, at the concentrations used here, has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases. These results suggest that levamisole, at least indirectly, acts by a molecular mechanism similar to that of Na3VO4 and that the loss of the association of the EpoR with Vav, STAT5, and and/or the reduction in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins may play a role in MEL cell differentiation.","['Scher, B M', 'Wei, X J', 'Waxman, S', 'Scher, W']","['Scher BM', 'Wei XJ', 'Waxman S', 'Scher W']","['Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Levamisole/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",1998/06/04 00:00,1998/06/04 00:01,['1998/06/04 00:00'],"['1998/06/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.12.6.1307 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1998 Jun;12(6):1307-13. doi: 10.3892/ijo.12.6.1307.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Vav1 protein, mouse)', '2880D3468G (Levamisole)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different from pmt1 in which the catalytic Pro-Pro-Cys (PPC) motif is 'mutated' to Pro-Ser-Cys, Dnmt2 contains all the conserved methyltransferase motifs, thus likely encoding a functional cytosine methyltransferase. However, baculovirus-expressed Dnmt2 protein failed to methylate DNA in vitro . To investigate whether Dnmt2 functions as a DNA methyltransferase in vivo , we inactivated the Dnmt2 gene by targeted deletion of the putative catalytic PPC motif in ES cells. We showed that endogenous virus was fully methylated in Dnmt2 -deficient mutant ES cells. Furthermore, newly integrated retrovirus DNA was methylated de novo in infected mutant ES cells as efficiently as in wild-type cells.

H-RS cells can be functionally regarded as antigen-presenting cells (APC) able to elicit an intense, but anergic and ineffective, T-cell mediated immune response along with a hyperplastic inflammatory reaction which involves several cell types including T- and B-cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, plasma cells, fibroblasts and stromal cells. In tissues involved by HD, malignant H-RS cells and their reactive neighboring cells are able to cross-talk via a complex network of cytokine- and cell contact-dependent interactions. As a result of such interactions, mediated by specific surface receptors and adhesion molecules on both tumor and non-neoplastic cells, H-RS cells may receive several proliferative and anti-apoptotic signals favoring the cellular expansion and tumor cell survival in HD. The ineffective T-cell immune response elicited by the abnormal APC function of H-RS cells may further contribute to the biologic and clinical progression of HD. Innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking the pathways of dysregulated cellular cross-talk among H-RS cells and bystander reactive cell populations might be beneficial in the treatment of HD patients.","['Pinto, A', 'Gattei, V', 'Zagonel, V', 'Aldinucci, D', 'Degan, M', 'De Iuliis, A', 'Rossi, F M', 'Tassan Mazzocco, F', 'Godeas, C', 'Rupolo, M', 'Poletto, D', 'Gloghini, A', 'Carbone, A', 'Gruss, H J']","['Pinto A', 'Gattei V', 'Zagonel V', 'Aldinucci D', 'Degan M', 'De Iuliis A', 'Rossi FM', 'Tassan Mazzocco F', 'Godeas C', 'Rupolo M', 'Poletto D', 'Gloghini A', 'Carbone A', 'Gruss HJ']","['The Leukemia Unit, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano, Italy. apinto@ets.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biotherapy,"Biotherapy (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",8903031,IM,"['Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology', 'Humans']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02678551 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotherapy. 1998;10(4):309-20. doi: 10.1007/BF02678551.,,,,,106,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though they have different mechanisms of action, little information is available on their interaction. This paper reviews experimental evidence for retinoic acid-cis-platinum synergy and presents toxicity data from patients with stage IV head and neck squamous cell cancer participating in a phase I trial combining 13-cis-retinoic acid and cis-platinum. METHODS: Patients were given 13-cis-retinoic acid orally daily for 7 days before and daily during high-dose (150 mg/m2 per week for 4 weeks) intraarterial cis-platinum treatment with concurrent radiation. Toxicity was scored with use of the cancer and leukemia group B scale. RESULTS: In the phase I clinical trial, 15 patients were treated to determine a maximum tolerated dosage for 13-cis-retinoic acid of 20 mg/day. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity was dose limiting in 3 of 8 patients treated with 40 mg/day and in 1 patient treated with 60 mg/day. There were no deaths caused by toxicity; 12 of the 15 patients received all four weekly doses and the remaining 3 received three doses. Of 10 patients with fully evaluable data, all achieved a complete response at the primary site and 9 had a complete response in the neck. One patient had persistent neck disease after chemoradiation, and this tumor was removed with neck dissection. CONCLUSIONS: 13-Cis-retinoic acid and cis-platinum are strongly synergistic against head and neck squamous cell cancer in vitro. Pretreatment with retinoic acid results in stronger synergy than concurrent drug exposure alone. Preliminary clinical experience with combined retinoic acid and cis-platinum in a design that parallels the in vitro study indicates that toxicity is acceptable with 13-cis-retinoic acid dosages of 20 mg/day in a high-dose-intensity intraarterial chemoradiation regimen.","['Weisman, R A', 'Christen, R', 'Los, G', 'Jones, V', 'Kerber, C', 'Seagren, S', 'Glassmeyer, S', 'Orloff, L A', 'Wong, W', 'Kirmani, S', 'Howell, S']","['Weisman RA', 'Christen R', 'Los G', 'Jones V', 'Kerber C', 'Seagren S', 'Glassmeyer S', 'Orloff LA', 'Wong W', 'Kirmani S', 'Howell S']","['Department of Surgery, University of California, San Diego, San Diego Veterans Administration Medical Center, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,8508176,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Cisplatin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intra-Arterial', 'Isotretinoin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S019459989800151X [pii]', '10.1177/019459989811800506 [doi]']",ppublish,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1998 May;118(5):597-602. doi: 10.1177/019459989811800506.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,"['1-RO3-CA68299-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MO1RR00827/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We report here immunofluorescence studies on the cellular localization of PLZF and PLZF/RAR alpha and compare it with the localization of PML and PML/RAR alpha. PLZF localizes to nuclear domains of 0.3-0.5 microns, approximately 14 per cell in the KG1 myeloid cell line. These PLZF-bodies are morphologically similar to the domains reported for PML (PML-NBs). There is tight spatial relationship between about 30% of PLZ-NBs and PML-NBs: they partially overlap. However, PML and PLZF do not form soluble complexes in vivo. PLZF- and PML-NBs are functionally distinct. Adenovirus E4-ORF3 protein expression alters the structure of the PML-NBs and interferon increases the number of PML-NBs and neither has any effect on PLZF NBs. The localization of PLZF/RAR alpha is different to that of PLZF and RAR alpha. The nuclear distribution pattern of PLZF/RAR alpha is one of hundreds of small dots (microspeckles) less than 0.1 micron. Expression of PLZF/RAR alpha did not provoke disruption of the PML-NBs. Co-expression of PML/RAR alpha and PLZF/RAR alpha in U937 cells revealed apparent colocalization. Overall the results suggest that the PML- and PLZF-NBs are distinct functional nuclear domains, but that they may share common regulatory pathways and/or targeting sequences, as revealed by the common localization of their corresponding fusion proteins.","['Ruthardt, M', 'Orleth, A', 'Tomassoni, L', 'Puccetti, E', 'Riganelli, D', 'Alcalay, M', 'Mannucci, R', 'Nicoletti, I', 'Grignani, F', 'Fagioli, M', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Ruthardt M', 'Orleth A', 'Tomassoni L', 'Puccetti E', 'Riganelli D', 'Alcalay M', 'Mannucci R', 'Nicoletti I', 'Grignani F', 'Fagioli M', 'Pelicci PG']","['European Institute of Oncology, Department of Experimental Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201722 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Apr 16;16(15):1945-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201722.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we and others have defined a tumor suppressor region on the short arm of chromosome 9 harboring a cluster of genes, including MTAP, CDKN2A (p16INK4a), and CDKN2B (p15INK4B), which is frequently deleted in a variety of tumor types. To determine whether this region is involved in a particular subset of malignant lymphomas, we have examined 16 cases of diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) (including three cases that evolved from low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (transformed DLCL)), and nine cases of low-grade NHL that had subpopulations of large cells with a diffuse growth pattern (seven follicular NHL, one chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one mycosis fungoides). Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on these samples using a 250-kb cosmid contig (COSp16), which encompasses MTAP, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B. Six of the 16 DLCLs and one of nine low-grade NHLs had deletions of COSp16. COSp16 was homozygously deleted in four cases; two cases had hemizygous deletions, and one case had a partial homozygous deletion of the cosmid contig. Three of 13 cases of de novo DLCL, all three transformed DLCLs, and one of nine low-grade NHL had COSp16 deletions. Although the numbers are small, COSp16 deletion was associated with transformed DLCL in contrast to de novo DLCL (P < 0.04, Fisher's exact test) or low-grade NHL (P < 0.02). The COSp16 deletion was mostly submicroscopic and was not observed in association with any specific recurring cytogenetic abnormalities. These results suggest that targeted deletion of the CDKN2A region occurs in a subset of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and may be associated with transformed lymphomas.","['Dreyling, M H', 'Roulston, D', 'Bohlander, S K', 'Vardiman, J', 'Olopade, O I']","['Dreyling MH', 'Roulston D', 'Bohlander SK', 'Vardiman J', 'Olopade OI']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*genetics']",1998/05/20 02:11,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/20 02:11'],"['1998/05/20 02:11 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/20 02:11 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199805)22:1<72::AID-GCC10>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998 May;22(1):72-8.,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)""]",,,,40,,['R29 CA68431-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In this paper, two such compounds, isolated from garlic and from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, are described for review. Elemene, isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Rhizoma zedoariae, was shown to exhibit antitumor activity in human and murine tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. This novel antineoplastic agent has substantial clinical activity against various tumors. The in vitro effect of elemene on the growth of leukemia cells was evaluated by MTT assay. The IC50 values of elemene for promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and erythroleukemia K562 cells were 27.5 micrograms/mL and 81 micrograms/mL, respectively, while IC50 for peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) was 254.3 micrograms/mL. The inhibitory effect of elemene on proliferation of HL-60 cells was associated with cell cycle arrest from S to G2M phase transition and with induction of apoptosis. The apoptosis of tumor cells was confirmed by DNA ladder formation on gel electrophoresis and characteristic ultrastructural alterations. The results also demonstrated that inhibitory effects of allicin, a natural organosulfide from garlic, on proliferation of tumor cells were associated with the cell cycle blockage of S/G2M boundary phase and induction of apoptosis. These findings suggest that induction of apoptosis may contribute to the mechanisms of antitumor activity of elemene and allicin, which merit investigation as potential chemoprevention agents in humans.","['Zheng, S', 'Yang, H', 'Zhang, S', 'Wang, X', 'Yu, L', 'Lu, J', 'Li, J']","['Zheng S', 'Yang H', 'Zhang S', 'Wang X', 'Yu L', 'Lu J', 'Li J']","['Cancer Institute, Zhejiang Medical University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem Suppl,Journal of cellular biochemistry.

TUNEL labeling of bone marrow from 24 patients with MDS revealed significant positivity in 10 of 11 patients with refractory anemia (RA), five of seven with RA and excess of blasts (RAEB), all three patients with RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), and all three patients with RA with ring sideroblasts (RARS). The percent of positive cells ranged from 5 to 50% but showed no apparent correlation with morphological subtype. In a series of 29 patients with acute leukemia, 17 showed significant positivity (13 of 13 with myeloid disease: three M1, seven M2, one M3, two M4; four of 16 patients with lymphoid disease: one Burkitt-type lymphoma, two null acute leukemia, and one common acute lymphoid leukemia). Intramedullary apoptosis was associated with myeloid or early committed progenitor cells and was highest in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Normal bone marrow samples from 12 individuals showed no evidence of apoptosis. Our results suggest that an increased level of intramedullary apoptosis is apparent in both patients with MDS and those with AML; those with secondary AML have the highest levels.

In addition, our data may be relevant to recently considered CDD gene transfer strategies for the detoxification of hematopoietic stem cells during high-dose therapy with cytosine nucleoside analogs.","['Kirch, H C', 'Schroder, J', 'Hoppe, H', 'Esche, H', 'Seeber, S', 'Schutte, J']","['Kirch HC', 'Schroder J', 'Hoppe H', 'Esche H', 'Seeber S', 'Schutte J']","['Institute of Molecular Biology (Cancer Research), University of Essen Medical School, West German Cancer Center.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Cytarabine/chemistry', 'Cytidine/chemistry', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*chemistry/*genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Deamination', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genetic Variation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Proteins/*chemistry', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 May;26(5):421-5.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen patients, aged 9 months to 18 years old, 8 ALL and 9 AML, were treated with cytarabine (Ara-C) 1 g/m2 q12h for 8 doses with mitoxantrone, idarubicin, VP-16, or asparaginase. A total of 71 courses of HD C/T was given. G-CSF was not used in 14 courses (Group A). Prophylactic G-CSF was given in 57 courses (Group B) as 200 microg/m2/d SC started one day after the completion of HD C/T and continued until the neutrophil recovery was maintained. The incidences of sepsis per course in Group A and Group B were 35.7% (5/14) and 40.4% (23/57), respectively. While 2 patients in Group A died of sepsis or pneumonia, none in Group B died. The mortality and delay in chemotherapy were fewer in Group B (P = 0.037 and 0.0006, respectively, Fisher exact test). There was a shorter average number of days of neutrophil <500/cumm, antibiotic usage, fever, and hospital stay in Group B (11, 8, 5, 17 days in Group B vs. 21, 17, 10, 37 days in Group A; P = 0.0001, log-rank test; 0.0006, 0.0023, 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank sum test, respectively). The incidence of neutropenic fever was lower in Group B, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.06, Fisher exact test). We conclude that G-CSF as an adjunct therapy in HD C/T is effective in reducing mortality, days of neutropenia, antibiotic usage, fever, hospital stay, and frequency of delay in chemotherapy. The efficacy of this treatment approach requires further testing in a randomized, controlled trial.","['Chen, S H', 'Liang, D C', 'Liu, H C']","['Chen SH', 'Liang DC', 'Liu HC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/05/20 02:09,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/20 02:09'],"['1998/05/20 02:09 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/20 02:09 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199805)58:1<20::AID-AJH4>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199805)58:1<20::aid-ajh4>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1998 May;58(1):20-3. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199805)58:1<20::aid-ajh4>3.0.co;2-2.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this model, age-related changes in functionally and phenotypically definable thymocyte subsets were assessed. In thymocytes from 90 to 308 day survivors, specific immune memory was long term; both CD4+ and CD8+ cells were required for the ex vivo stimulation of lytic activity, but the specific anti-EL4 cytotoxic effector was CD4-CD8+. On day 520, the surviving mice were randomized into 2 groups. One group received a second re-challenge with EL4 tumor cells and all survived. The other group was sacrificed on day 520. Their thymocytes, exposed to X-irradiated EL4, developed anti-EL4 lytic activity and, in comparison with thymocytes of young and age-matched control mice, were markedly enriched in CD4-CD8+CD44+ cells.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis, cell-cycle distribution and expression of several genes encoding apoptosis-promoting and -inhibiting factors were analyzed during the process of PU.1-induced apoptosis. FACS analysis revealed that cells were accumulated in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle before apoptosis. Morphological analysis of PI-stained nuclei of the apoptotic cells sorted by a FACScan showed 22.6% in G0/G1, 35.8% in S and 8.5% in G2/M phase by fluorescent microscopy after cell sorting, suggesting that PU.1-induced apoptosis in MEL cells occurs in G0/G1 through S phases. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that expression of c-myc and bcl-2 genes was reduced during the apoptotic process, while expression of bax and bcl-X(L) genes was not changed. Expression of the p53 gene was reduced rather than enhanced, suggesting that PU.1-induced apoptosis in MEL cells is p53-independent. Apoptosis was inhibited by adding 30% serum in culture, while no reduction of c-myc and bcl-2 gene expression was observed. Forced expression of the c-myc, bcl-2 and bcl-X(L) genes protected MEL cells from apoptosis.

It also inhibited Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (E. coli pol I) and human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV RT). The mode of inhibition of these polymerases was competitive with the DNA template primer and was non-competitive with the substrate dTTP. KN-208 inhibited pol beta most strongly, with a Ki value of 0.05 microM, 10-fold lower than that for pol alpha (0.5 microM) and 60- or 140-fold lower than that for HIV RT (3 microM) or for E. coli pol I (7 microM), respectively. The loss of sulfate on the 6'-position of glucopyranoside of this compound completely abrogated inhibition. However, the hydrophilic part of KN-208, glucose 6-sulfate alone, showed no inhibition. Other sulfated compounds containing different hydrophobic structures, such as dodecyl sulfate and cholesterol sulfate, exhibited a much weaker inhibition. Our results suggest that the whole molecular structure of KN-208 is required for inhibition. KN-208 was shown to be modestly cytotoxic for the human leukemic cell line K562. Interestingly, a subcytotoxic dose of KN-208 increased the sensitivity of the human leukemic cells to an alkylating agent, methyl methanesulfonate, while it did not potentiate the effects of ultraviolet light or of cisplatin.","['Ogawa, A', 'Murate, T', 'Izuta, S', 'Takemura, M', 'Furuta, K', 'Kobayashi, J', 'Kamikawa, T', 'Nimura, Y', 'Yoshida, S']","['Ogawa A', 'Murate T', 'Izuta S', 'Takemura M', 'Furuta K', 'Kobayashi J', 'Kamikawa T', 'Nimura Y', 'Yoshida S']","['First Department of Surgery, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Archaea/*enzymology', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Polymerase I/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Polymerase beta/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycolipids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HIV/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Methyl Methanesulfonate/*pharmacology', '*Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', '*Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/20 02:09,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/20 02:09'],"['1998/05/20 02:09 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/20 02:09 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19980518)76:4<512::AID-IJC12>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980518)76:4<512::aid-ijc12>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1998 May 18;76(4):512-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980518)76:4<512::aid-ijc12>3.0.co;2-9.,"[""0 (1-O-(6'-sulfo-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol)"", '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', 'AT5C31J09G (Methyl Methanesulfonate)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Blood 1993; 81: 2860-5) and Satake et al. (Br J Haematol 1995; 91: 892-8) were evaluated. Bone marrow samples, one at diagnosis and two in complete remission from a patient with M2 subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia, with t(8;21), were analysed using both methods. The Kasumi-1 cell line was used as a positive control and a patient with M3 subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia as a negative control. To confirm the feasibility of Satake's method a group of 35 patients with subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia at diagnosis were studied. The method of Downing requires Southern blotting and hybridization with a specific probe because it often generates non-specific amplification products. By contrast, the method of Satake yields only a single amplification product, using one single round of PCR in samples at diagnosis, or two rounds in complete remission samples. The sensitivity of this method allows the detection of a single Kasumi-1 cell in 10(6) normal cells. The AML1/ETO rearrangement was observed in 5 of the 35 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia at diagnosis (14.3%) and in 3 of the 14 cases of M2 subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia (21.4%). The two remaining positive cases corresponded to the acute myeloid leukaemia subtypes M4 and M6. The results indicate that the method of Satake better meets the requirements of the clinical laboratory due to its greater simplicity, specificity, sensitivity and feasibility, thus making it more appropriate for use in diagnosing and monitoring minimal residual disease.","['Barragan, E', 'Bonanad, S', 'Lopez, J A', 'Bolufer, P', 'Sanz, M A']","['Barragan E', 'Bonanad S', 'Lopez JA', 'Bolufer P', 'Sanz MA']","['Departamento de Biopatologia Clinica, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/CCLM.1998.026 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 1998 Mar;36(3):137-42. doi: 10.1515/CCLM.1998.026.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, two cases of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated HD, which occurred in males with seropositivity for anti-HTLV-I, are reported. One patient is alive and was diagnosed as having interfollicular HD with CD20+CD15-CD30-CD3-CD4-CD8-CD45RO-Read-Sternberg (R-S) cells. Positivity for EBV-encoded RNA 1 (EBER-1) and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) was shown on follicular germinal center cells and R-S cells. In that case, neither T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain rearrangement nor integration of the HTLV-I provirus was demonstrated in the lymph nodes, although atyical lymphocytes (2%) were found in the peripheral blood. The other case pursued an aggressive clinical course and the patient was diagnosed as having an adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) because of the presence of anti-HTLV-I antibody, lymph node swelling, and the appearance of flower-like cells in the peripheral blood. However, an autopsy revealed no obvious ATLL cell infiltration in any of the organs examined. Multiple granulomatous lesions were found in the bone marrow, liver, kidneys, spleen, and lymph nodes. Reassessment of lymph node lesions in biopsies and granulomatous lesions in autopsy samples demonstrated that both lesions contained CD15+CD30+CD3-CD4-CD8-CD20-CD45RO-EBER-1+L MP-1+R-S cells, and they were considered to be a composite lymphoma of HD and ATLL.

PROCEDURE: Of 30 patients (15 females and 15 males), 18 were treated with C + I and 12 were treated with C only. Height standard deviation score (HSDS) and body mass index standard deviation score (BMISDS) before treatment, at end of treatment, and at follow-up were calculated from height and weight registered from the charts. At follow-up examinations, provocative growth hormone (GH) tests (clonidine and insulin tolerance test) and an ACTH test were performed. Furthermore, blood samples for hormonal analysis, IGF-I, IGFBP-3, GHBP, and leptin were drawn. RESULTS: Eleven patients (9 treated with C + I and 2 treated with C) showed insufficient response to GH tests. Two patients had hypogonadism. HSDS and IGF-I were significantly lower and GHBP significantly higher in GH-deficient patients compared to the group with normal GH secretion at follow-up. BMISDS steadily increased from start of treatment until follow-up, independent of GH status at follow-up. BMISDS at follow-up was positively correlated with serum leptin (P < 0.001), and serum leptin was significantly higher in the cranial irradiated group as compared to the nonirradiated group. CONCLUSIONS: GH deficiency is frequently found at long-term follow-up in patients treated for childhood ALL. Other hormonal deficiencies are rare. HSDS at long-term follow-up is dependent on GH secretory status. Long-term endocrinological follow-up examinations in patients treated for childhood ALL are recommended, as hormonal replacement therapy may be indicated.","['Birkebaek, N H', 'Fisker, S', 'Clausen, N', 'Tuovinen, V', 'Sindet-Pedersen, S', 'Christiansen, J S']","['Birkebaek NH', 'Fisker S', 'Clausen N', 'Tuovinen V', 'Sindet-Pedersen S', 'Christiansen JS']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Aarhus at Skejby, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Height', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Growth', 'Human Growth Hormone/*deficiency', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/physiopathology/*therapy']",1998/05/20 02:08,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/20 02:08'],"['1998/05/20 02:08 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/20 02:08 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199806)30:6<351::AID-MPO9>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199806)30:6<351::aid-mpo9>3.0.co;2-d [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1998 Jun;30(6):351-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199806)30:6<351::aid-mpo9>3.0.co;2-d.,['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DISCUSSION: Skeletal morbidity was most prevalent in older subjects who had been given cranial radiotherapy. However, there was no difference in the frequency of fractures in two groups of younger children (< or = 9 years of age), one irradiated and the other not. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that corticosteroid therapy plays an important part in the pathogenesis of this disorder.

Apoptosis has been identified by the internucleosomal DNA cleavage which appears to be associated with endonuclease activation. Proteolysis is considered to be an early event in apoptosis. We studied the effects of proteolysis on early apoptotic events, such as chromatin condensation, nuclear breakdown, DNA breakage and sensitivity to denaturation induced by anticancer drugs (camptothecin: CAM, 5-azacytidine: AZA) on HL-60 cells. CAM induced apoptosis on S phase and AZA on G1 phase. The internucleosomal DNA cleavage shown by both the presence of DNA fragments during gel electrophoresis and a large number of in situ DNA strands breaks (revealed in high intensity fluorescence FITC of cells in the TdT reaction) was prevented by the protease inhibitor, TPCK (N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chlorometyl-ketone), as well as by an inhibitor of the apoptosis-associated endonuclease, ZnSO4. The protective effects were observed under conditions in which apoptosis was induced by agents with a different mechanism of action, such as the DNA damaging drug. CAM (topo-isomerase inhibitor), and an RNA antimetabolite, AZA. The protease inhibitor inhibits early events of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation, nuclear breakdown, DNA breakage and sensitivity to denaturation, which have different structures and a different mechanism of interaction with drugs.

It has been suggested in previous research that the majority of survivors display equivalent levels of psychosocial functioning post-treatment as compared with healthy controls. However, despite successful treatment, survivors may have to adjust to living with a chronic illness and its associated late effects interspersed across the lifespan (e.g. infertility, cognitive deficits, heart complications). Whilst young people appear to have similar levels of psychosocial functioning, avoidance strategies such as denial may result in previous research findings being confounded and in underestimating the true psychosocial status of survivors. It is important to understand the psychosocial status of survivors in order to optimise their quality of life. METHODOLOGY: Coping mechanisms, anxiety levels and self-concepts of 32 adolescent cancer survivors, predominantly Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) were compared with 34 healthy adolescents (age range 12-17 years), via a mailout. RESULTS: Survivors' self-reports suggest no overt psychological dysfunctioning. Whilst the two groups shared similar coping strategies, survivors were found to be less anxious than peers, with a tendency to employ avoidance strategies to deal with problems faced in adolescence. Age, gender and specific illness variables, such as age at diagnosis and time since treatment, were strong predictors of psychological outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Results can be interpreted as suggesting that whilst cancer survivors have a similar psychosocial profile to healthy peers, they are more likely to utilise avoidance strategies to manage problems.","['Bauld, C', 'Anderson, V', 'Arnold, J']","['Bauld C', 'Anderson V', 'Arnold J']","[""Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,J Paediatr Child Health,Journal of paediatrics and child health,9005421,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology', 'Psychological Tests', 'Regression Analysis', 'Survivors/*psychology']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1440-1754.1998.00185.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Paediatr Child Health. 1998 Apr;34(2):120-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1754.1998.00185.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the contribution of cytokines using RX435, an anti-gp130 antibody. Leukemia inhibitory factor, which is one of the cytokines and has the common receptor subunit gp130, activated MAP kinase and the response was completely blocked by pretreatment of the Atg-/- cardiac myocytes with RX435. RX435 pretreatment greatly reduced stretch-induced activation of MAP kinase in Atg-/- cardiac myocytes. Interestingly, the same results were obtained in the cardiac myocytes of control mice.

The present study determined whether apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in activation of AP24 and examined the possible relationship to caspase activity. We showed that an inhibitor of AP24, DK120, could block DNA fragmentation induced in three leukemia cell lines (U937, HL-60, and CEM) by various DNA-damaging drugs including etoposide, camptothecin, chlorambucil, and the CC1065-related drug, YW201. Etoposide-induced activation of intracellular DEVD-pNa cleaving activity and apoptosis was suppressed by low micromolar concentrations of cell-permeable inhibitors of caspase-3. Furthermore, these inhibitors also suppressed activation of AP24. In contrast, DK120 did not prevent etoposide activation of DEVD-pNa cleaving activity, nor did it prevent cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. AP24 isolated from apoptotic cells following treatment with etoposide activated DNA fragmentation in isolated normal nuclei and was inhibited by DK120, but not by caspase inhibitors. This evidence shows that activation of caspase 3-like proteases generates signals that contribute to the activation of AP24 which may then induce nuclear DNA fragmentation in chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis.","['Wright, S C', 'Schellenberger, U', 'Wang, H', 'Wang, Y', 'Kinder, D H']","['Wright SC', 'Schellenberger U', 'Wang H', 'Wang Y', 'Kinder DH']","['Palo Alto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Boron Compounds/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/radiation effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Precursors/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(98)98508-4 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1998.8508 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1998 Apr 28;245(3):797-803. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1998.8508.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (carbobenzoxy-alanyl-alanyl-borophenylalanyl)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (AP24 apoptotic protease)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,['CA68223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Out of 18 patients treated with 2-CdA one patient was excluded of the study because of association of HCL with acquired sideroblastic anemia. In the remaining 17 patients the mean value of RDW before therapy was 18.8% (range 13.5% to 25.0%) and dropped after successful therapy after 6 to 12 months to the mean value of 13.6% (range 11.2% to 17.9%) and after 18 months to 13.4% (range 12.6% to 14.7%) (p = 0.00015 and p = 0.00049 respectively). The hemoglobin level increased from the mean value of 119 g/l (range 99 g/l to 157 g/l) before therapy to the mean value of 145.9 g/l (range 127 g/l to 172 g/l) after 6 to 12 months and after 18 months to 147.8 g/l (range 132 g/l to 168 g/l) (p = 0.000017 and p = 0.00036 respectively). The same trend was observed in the group of patients treated with IFN-alfa. The RDW decreased from the mean value of 21.3% (range 18.8% to 28.7%) to the mean value of 15.3% (range 12.4% to 16.7%), (p = 0.031). The hemoglobin level increased in this group of patients from the mean value of 115 g/l (range 98 g/l to 127 g/l) to the mean value of 136 g/l (range 127 g/l to 146 g/l) (p = 0.031). In 9 patients in complete hematologic remission 34 to 293 months after splenectomy the mean value of RDW was 13.9% (range 13.0% to 15.5%). CONCLUSION: Increased RDW in HCL is associated with active disease and is reversible after successful therapy. This phenomenon has not been reported in the literature yet. Preliminary results show that the increase of RDW may be due to the dyserythropoiesis.","['Chrobak, L', 'Zak, P', 'Podzimek, K', 'Stransky, P']","['Chrobak L', 'Zak P', 'Podzimek K', 'Stransky P']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Charles University, Faculty of Medicine and Teaching Hospital, Hradec Kralove.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove),Acta medica (Hradec Kralove),9705947,IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Deoxyadenosines/therapeutic use', '*Erythrocyte Indices', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Splenectomy']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove). 1998;41(1):23-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', ""JYW18Y92UP (2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among its sublines, UT-7/GM, which remains undifferentiated in the presence of GM-CSF, has a bipotency showing differentiation into erythroid or megakaryocytic cell lineages in the presence of EPO or thrombopoietin (TPO), respectively. To investigate the mechanism underlying determination of cell differentiation, we investigated the role of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) in EPO-induced erythroid differentiation. UT-7 cells grow in response to GM-CSF and EPO but do not differentiate into mature cells. UT-7/GM cells grow in response to GM-CSF and differentiate into erythroid cells by EPO. In UT-7 cells, both GM-CSF and EPO induced the activation of Stat1 alpha, Stat3 and Stat5. In UT-7/GM cells, EPO activated Stat5 alone, although the activation of Stat1 alpha, Stat3, and Stat5 was induced by GM-CSF or TPO. In addition, GM-CSF inhibited EPO-induced erythroid differentiation and concomitantly activated Stat1 alpha and Stat3 in UT-7/GM cells even in the presence of EPO. Further we transfected Stat1 alpha, Stat3 cDNA or both into UT-7/GM cells. Hemoglobin-positive cells were decreased in the stable transfectants stimulated with EPO. These results indicate that Stat1 alpha and Stat3 have an inhibitory effect on the EPO-induced erythroid differentiation, and more complicated combination of transcription factors may play an important role in the decision of cell differentiation.","['Miura, Y', 'Kirito, K', 'Komatsu, N']","['Miura Y', 'Kirito K', 'Komatsu N']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi-ken, Japan. ymiura@jichi.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', '*Leukopoiesis', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/physiology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/20 02:06,2000/10/06 11:01,['1998/05/20 02:06'],"['1998/05/20 02:06 [pubmed]', '2000/10/06 11:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 02:06 [entrez]']","['40834 [pii]', '10.1159/000040834 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1998;99(3):180-4. doi: 10.1159/000040834.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a selectable SFFVp that otherwise mimics the specificity of the disease, we demonstrate that the kinetics of the polyclonal expansion depends on the transcriptional strength of the retroviral cis-active elements. By exchanging gp55 for apathogenic genes, we show that SFFVp enhancer and splice signals can be successfully utilized for the development of retroviral vectors mediating very efficient transgene expression in hematopoietic cells.

However, transduction efficiency in these HSC is extremely low compared to fibroblasts or more mature hematopoietic cells. This infection block was analyzed in the HSC line FDC-Pmix. The infection frequency with the amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV-A) is more than 100-fold lower in FDC-Pmix cells as compared to fibroblasts. Pseudotyping with the env of the 10A1 strain (MLV-10A1), which uses both the amphotropic receptor (Pit-2) and the receptor for gibbon ape leukemia virus (Pit-1), did not improve the infection efficiency. Vectors pseudotyped with VSV G protein were found to overcome the infection block in FDC-Pmix, confirming that the block is at the level of virus binding and possibly penetration. Accordingly, we could not detect virus binding of MLV-A or MLV-10A1 to FDC-Pmix cell lines. Northern blot analysis was performed to detect whether the defect is at the level of transcription. Surprisingly, similar levels of Pit-2 receptor transcripts were detected in all cell types. The overexpression of rat Pit-2 DNA in CHO but not in FDC-Pmix cells improved amphotropic infection frequency after introducing rat Pit-2 DNA into the cells. Taken together these results show that the inefficient infection of FDC-Pmix is due to a lack of functional receptors. Either the receptor protein is incorrectly processed in these cells or a cofactor is missing in FDC-Pmix cells that is necessary for efficient binding and/or penetration.","['Thomsen, S', 'Vogt, B', 'von Laer, D', 'Heberlein, C', 'Rein, A', 'Ostertag, W', 'Stocking, C']","['Thomsen S', 'Vogt B', 'von Laer D', 'Heberlein C', 'Rein A', 'Ostertag W', 'Stocking C']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur Experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie, Universitat Hamburg, Deutschland. thomsen@hpi.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/growth & development', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription Factor Pit-1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",1998/05/20 02:06,2000/10/06 11:01,['1998/05/20 02:06'],"['1998/05/20 02:06 [pubmed]', '2000/10/06 11:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 02:06 [entrez]']","['40829 [pii]', '10.1159/000040829 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1998;99(3):148-55. doi: 10.1159/000040829.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Pit1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pou1f1 protein, rat)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Transcription Factor Pit-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New drugs which are active in induction therapy in randomised clinical trials are etoposide, idarubicin and high dose cytarabine. Intensification of induction treatment with etoposide or high-dose cytarabine does not appear to alter the CR rate but prolongs remission and has some impact on survival. High-dose cytarabine in induction combinations increase relapse-free survival compared to standard approaches. These induction results appear to parallel results obtained with post-remission therapies intensified with high-dose cytarabine. These studies provide clinical evidence that intensified induction with cytarabine in AML influences subsequent outcome but is more toxic, gives more profound myelosuppression post-remission and has benefit confined to younger patients.","['Bishop, J F']",['Bishop JF'],"['Sydney Cancer Centre, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, N.S.W., Australia. jbishop@canc.rpa.cs.nsw.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/05/20 02:06,2000/10/06 11:01,['1998/05/20 02:06'],"['1998/05/20 02:06 [pubmed]', '2000/10/06 11:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 02:06 [entrez]']","['40827 [pii]', '10.1159/000040827 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1998;99(3):133-7. doi: 10.1159/000040827.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An oecological study covers 16 years' incidence of childhood malignancies in areas surrounding nuclear facilities and in matched control regions. Two population-based case control studies explore potential risk factors of childhood leukaemia in the state of Lower Saxony (1988 93) and in all western states of Germany (1992-94). RESULTS: There was no increased incidence of childhood leukaemia and other malignancies in the vicinity of nuclear installations. X-ray examinations during pregnancy and in early childhood were not associated with an increased risk of childhood leukaemia. There were no data to support Gardner's hypothesis of an increased risk due to paternal pre-conception exposure to ionizing radiation. Following the Chernobyl accident, the reported incidence of neuroblastoma and infant leukaemia was increased. The increase cannot be explained by exposures due to the accident. CONCLUSIONS: Although the carcinogenic effect of ionizing radiation is well known, the recent population-based epidemiological studies show that under current conditions exposure to ionizing radiation in Germany does not constitute risks of childhood malignancies that are relevant to public health.","['Michaelis, J']",['Michaelis J'],"['Institut fur Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation, Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Power Plants', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Radiobiology', 'Radiography/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/095530098142202 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1998 Apr;73(4):377-81. doi: 10.1080/095530098142202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSIONS: Perhaps the most interesting and potentially useful finding following the cloning of the gene has been the discovery of homologies with various previously known PIK related kinases. There is also a very wide range of mutations associated with A-T and it is clear that some ATM mutations can lessen the severity of both the clinical and cellular features of the disorder. The function(s) of ATM remain an enigma. There are several indications of its involvement in protecting the cell from the effects of ionizing radiation and radiomimetic agents, although the pathways that involve p53 and c-Abl are far from clear. Expression of AIM in tissue culture cells can reverse the cellular features of A-T, particularly the increased level of radiosensitivity. The localization of ATM on meiotic chromosomes and its speculated role in meiotic recombination is an important finding. Finally, cloning the ATM gene has allowed the development of mouse models, which are providing information about A-T and will be crucial for testing future treatments for the disorder.","['Taylor, A M']",['Taylor AM'],"['CRC Institute for Cancer Studies, The Medical School, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/complications/*genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Breast Neoplasms/etiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured/radiation effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/095530098142185 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1998 Apr;73(4):365-71. doi: 10.1080/095530098142185.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,56,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,

Our data indicate that three different stress response pathways mediating gadd gene induction are most likely regulated by different protein kinases or combinations of protein kinases. The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine and the temperature sensitive (ts) p34cdc2 mutant reduced induction by the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) of the rodent gadd45 and gadd153 genes. However, staurosporine had no effect of the ionizing radiation (IR) induction of the human GADD45. Caffeine and 2-aminopurine, on the other hand, completely blocked this IR induction. Suramin, an antitumor drug that interferes with the interaction of growth factors with their receptors, inhibited the UV radiation induction of GADD45 and GADD153 but had no effect on the MMS and IR pathways. Elevated expression of gadd45 by medium depletion (starvation) was partially reduced by the addition of either genistein or tyrphostin, two protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while gadd153 was affected by tyrphostin only. Two inhibitors acting preferentially on cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide, HCl (H8) and protein kinase inhibitor (PKI), also had a moderate effect on the medium depletion-induced levels of both gadd genes. Thus, these varied effects of inhibitors on gadd gene responses point to important differences in the pathways controlling these responses.","['Carrier, F', 'Zhan, Q', 'Alamo, I', 'Hanaoka, F', 'Fornace, A J Jr']","['Carrier F', 'Zhan Q', 'Alamo I', 'Hanaoka F', 'Fornace AJ Jr']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, DTP, DCT, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. carrier@Box-c.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cricetinae', '*DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Suramin/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/20 02:05,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/05/20 02:05'],"['1998/05/20 02:05 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 02:05 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(97)00592-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00592-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 Mar 15;55(6):853-61. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00592-3.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen low molecular weight thiol-bearing compounds were shown to arrest the proliferation of CCRF-CEM cells and a methotrexate-resistant subline, with IC50 values between 10(-5) and 10(-4) M. Cysteamine arrested proliferation by slowing the passage of cells through S phase. These cells subsequently resumed cycling, although a proportion went on to die by apoptosis. The antiproliferative action of cysteamine was shown to depend, in part, on H2O2 production. This ability to generate peroxide is shared by many thiol compounds, and molecular modeling indicated that thiol groups were required for the antiproliferative actions of the congeners of cysteamine. Molecular modeling also revealed that the most efficacious antiproliferative agents were those that had their amino acid and thiol moieties separated by an intramolecular distance of 3.17 to 5.9 A, as exemplified by WR 1065 and the aminothiophenols. These findings indicate that thiol-bearing compounds may have some efficacy in the treatment of drug-naive and -resistant leukemia cells.","['Jeitner, T M', 'Delikatny, E J', 'Bartier, W A', 'Capper, H R', 'Hunt, N H']","['Jeitner TM', 'Delikatny EJ', 'Bartier WA', 'Capper HR', 'Hunt NH']","['Department of Pathology, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. jeitner@wadsworth.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Linear Models', 'Mercaptoethanol/pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Peroxides/metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(97)00575-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00575-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 Mar 15;55(6):793-802. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00575-3.,"['0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients' emotional states and cognitive functioning were assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Trail Making B Test (Trails B), respectively. Two hundred ninety-five patients completed the POMS and Trails B at pretreatment, 224 patients after the completion of the ACE course of chemotherapy (week 9), and 177 patients after the completion of the PCE chemotherapy and RT (week 17). RESULTS: No differences on the POMS or Trails B measures were found between the two treatment arms as predicted, given that the only difference between the two treatment arms was the presence or absence of warfarin. Analysis of the POMS revealed that, overall, mean scores remained stable over the course of treatment; however, women showed a trend toward higher mean scores, which indicated a higher level of distress, compared with men at the pretreatment assessment. Examination of cognitive functioning, measured by the Trails B, revealed improved performance from baseline to post-ACE chemotherapy, which is consistent with a practice effect, but a significant worsening of Trails B scores post-RT compared with the pre-RT assessments, which is consistent with impaired cognitive functioning because of treatment (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Emotional state, measured by the POMS, did not differ between the groups or change significantly over time in this study of small-cell lung cancer patients treated with a combination of chemotherapy and RT plus or minus warfarin. However, the pattern of relatively stable POMS scores and poorer Trails B performance post-RT suggested that this combination of chemotherapy and RT had a negative impact on cognitive functioning.","['Ahles, T A', 'Silberfarb, P M', 'Herndon, J 2nd', 'Maurer, L H', 'Kornblith, A B', 'Aisner, J', 'Perry, M C', 'Eaton, W L', 'Zacharski, L L', 'Green, M R', 'Holland, J C']","['Ahles TA', 'Silberfarb PM', 'Herndon J 2nd', 'Maurer LH', 'Kornblith AB', 'Aisner J', 'Perry MC', 'Eaton WL', 'Zacharski LL', 'Green MR', 'Holland JC']","['Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA. tim.a.ahles@dartmouth.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticoagulants/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/*psychology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', '*Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', '*Emotions', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*psychology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neuropsychological Tests', 'Trail Making Test', 'Warfarin/*administration & dosage']",1998/05/20 02:05,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/05/20 02:05'],"['1998/05/20 02:05 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 02:05 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.5.1954 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 May;16(5):1954-60. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.5.1954.,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '5Q7ZVV76EI (Warfarin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'ACE protocol 1', 'CCE protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic studies were performed in 180 consecutive patients with therapy-related myelodysplasia (t-MDS) or t-AML in Copenhagen and in 270 consecutive patients in Chicago. Leukemic cells were available for studies of the molecular biology in 72 patients, including four with inv(16). RESULTS: An inv(16)(p13q22) was observed in only two of 180 cases of t-MDS and t-AML in Copenhagen and in only four of 270 cases of t-MDS and t-AML in Chicago. Four patients with t-AML and inv(16) previously had received combination chemotherapy, which included an alkylating agent, and in two a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor was included (mitoxantrone and etoposide). One patient had received paclitaxel followed by etoposide and one patient had received radiotherapy only. One patient, previously treated with mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide for breast cancer, presented a new and, to our knowledge not previously reported, type of fusion transcript, with breakpoint at nt 399 of the CBFB gene and at nt 2134 of the MYH11 gene. Two patients previously treated with alkylating agents both presented the less common type D transcript, whereas the most common A transcript, observed in 80% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) de novo with inv(16), only was observed in the patient treated with paclitaxel and etoposide for leiomyosarcoma.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 24 patients who developed HA related to fludarabine therapy were collected from the Spontaneous Reporting System of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC). RESULTS: Seventeen (71%) patients developed HA after either the first, second, or third cycle of this drug. The longest duration of fludarabine therapy before HA occurred was six cycles. The median decline in hematocrit from baseline during the hemolytic episode was 14.1 (range, 8.0 to 28.9) for the 18 patients for whom this information was available. For the 11 patients for whom transfusion requirements were known, the number of transfusions administered ranged between three and 36. Seven (29%) patients died of medical complications associated with the HA. Seven of eight patients who were re-challenged with fludarabine after an episode of HA developed recurrent HA, and three of these patients died. CONCLUSION: HA associated with fludarabine therapy appears to be uncommon, but it can be severe and fatal, especially if a patient is re-treated with this drug after a previous episode of HA. The mechanism of this toxicity is unknown, but it may be caused by the release of a suppressed auto-antibody to a native red cell antigen.","['Weiss, R B', 'Freiman, J', 'Kweder, S L', 'Diehl, L F', 'Byrd, J C']","['Weiss RB', 'Freiman J', 'Kweder SL', 'Diehl LF', 'Byrd JC']","['Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA. rayweissmd@aol.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/*chemically induced/therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.5.1885 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 May;16(5):1885-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.5.1885.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",['J Clin Oncol. 1998 Sep;16(9):3209-10.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with tumors appropriate for paclitaxel therapy who had abnormal liver function tests were eligible. Patients were assigned to one of three treatment cohorts: I, AST level twofold normal and bilirubin level less than 1.5 mg/dL; II, bilirubin level 1.6 to 3.0 mg/dL; and III, bilirubin level greater than 3.0 mg/dL. Doses were explored in at least three patients within each cohort. Although designed to assess a 24-hour infusion schedule, the trial was extended to also assess a 3-hour regimen. Pharmacokinetics were to be studied in all patients. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were assessable for toxicity. Patients with bilirubin levels greater than 1.5 mg/dL had substantial toxicity at all doses explored, whereas the toxicity for patients with elevated AST levels occurred at doses that ranged from 50 to 175 mg/m2 administered over 24 hours. In most patients, the DLT was myelosuppression. The pharmacokinetic data were insufficient to adequately evaluate the relationship between pharmacokinetics and toxicity in patients who received 24-hour infusions but provided evidence of a longer exposure to paclitaxel than anticipated for the doses used in this study in the 3-hour infusion group. CONCLUSION: If paclitaxel is used for patients with elevated levels of AST or bilirubin, dose reductions are necessary, and an increase in toxicity can be anticipated. The increased myelosuppression observed is at least partially because of altered paclitaxel pharmacokinetics in such patients.","['Venook, A P', 'Egorin, M J', 'Rosner, G L', 'Brown, T D', 'Jahan, T M', 'Batist, G', 'Hohl, R', 'Budman, D', 'Ratain, M J', 'Kearns, C M', 'Schilsky, R L']","['Venook AP', 'Egorin MJ', 'Rosner GL', 'Brown TD', 'Jahan TM', 'Batist G', 'Hohl R', 'Budman D', 'Ratain MJ', 'Kearns CM', 'Schilsky RL']","['University of California, San Francisco, USA.

METHODS: We retrospectively surveyed the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for cases of cancer that occurred between July 1982 and February 1997 in children who were HIV seropositive before or at the time of cancer diagnosis. We used Kaplan-Meier survivorship curves, hazard function estimates, and Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate survival. RESULTS: Sixty-four children (39 boys, 25 girls) with 65 tumors were reported. Thirty-seven children (58%) acquired HIV infection vertically (median age at cancer diagnosis, 4.3 years); 22 children (34%) acquired HIV through transfusion of blood or blood products (median age at cancer diagnosis, 13.4 years). Forty-two children (65%) had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Eleven children (17%) had leiomyosarcomas (or leiomyomas), which are otherwise exceptionally rare in children. Other malignancies included acute leukemia (five children), Kaposi's sarcoma (KS; three children), Hodgkin's disease (two children), vaginal carcinoma in situ (one child), and tracheal neuroendocrine carcinoma (one child). Median survival after NHL diagnosis was 6 months (range, 1 day to 89 months) and after leiomyosarcoma was 12 months (range, 10 days to 19 months). The average monthly death rate after NHL diagnosis was 12% in the first 6 months, which decreased to about 2% thereafter. In contrast, the monthly death rate after leiomyosarcoma diagnosis increased from 5% in the first 6 months to about 20% thereafter. CONCLUSION: After NHL, leiomyosarcoma is the second leading cancer in children with HIV infection. Both cancers have high mortality rates; improved outcome for NHL, in particular, may depend on earlier diagnosis and therapy.","['Granovsky, M O', 'Mueller, B U', 'Nicholson, H S', 'Rosenberg, P S', 'Rabkin, C S']","['Granovsky MO', 'Mueller BU', 'Nicholson HS', 'Rosenberg PS', 'Rabkin CS']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. granovsm@epndce.nci.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leiomyosarcoma/complications', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/mortality/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.5.1729 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 May;16(5):1729-35. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.5.1729.,,,,,,,['CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen hundred four patients were entered onto Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) 9005, a randomized phase III trial, between January 11, 1991 and September 1, 1994. After remission induction, patients were randomized to one of three 24-week intensification schedules: regimen A, MTX 1,000 mg/m2 i.v. infused over 24 hours and MP 1,000 mg/m2 i.v. infused over 6 hours; regimen B, low-dose repetitive MTX 30 mg/m2 orally every 6 hours for six doses and i.v. MP; or regimen C, i.v. MTX alone. Intensification was given every 2 weeks for 12 courses. CNS prophylaxis was age-adjusted intrathecal MTX (ITM). In August 1992, the CNS prophylaxis was changed to age-adjusted triple intrathecal therapy (TIT). Reports of grades 3 and 4 acute NT were reviewed. RESULTS: Acute NT was reported in 95 of 1,218 (7.8%) eligible patients treated on POG 9005. The incidence by regimen was regimen A, 46 of 543 patients (8.3%); regimen B, 13 of 354 patients (3.7%); and regimen C, 36 of 321 patients (11.2%) (P < .001). The majority of events were seizures and the median number of days to first occurrence of symptomatic NT after ITM or TIT was 10 to 11 days. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence consistent with leukoencephalopathy (LE), with or without the presence of cerebral calcifications, was observed in 75% and 77.1 % of symptomatic patients treated on regimens A and C, respectively, but in only 15.4% of symptomatic patients treated on regimen B (P < .001). Factors associated with an increased incidence of NT included increased cumulative exposure with repeated i.v. MTX (regimens A and C v B), increased MTX-leucovorin (LCV) ratio (regimens A and C v B), and choice and timing of TIT therapy. The use of i.v. MP during intensification did not appear to contribute to these complications. The switch to TIT CNS prophylaxis was associated with an inferior overall 4-year continuous complete remission (CCR) (P=.031) when compared with ITM. CONCLUSION: Intensification with repeated i.v. MTX in the setting of low-dose LCV rescue was associated with a higher risk for acute NT and LE, especially in patients who received concomitant TIT. The long-term consequences for affected patients remain unknown.","['Mahoney, D H Jr', 'Shuster, J J', 'Nitschke, R', 'Lauer, S J', 'Steuber, C P', 'Winick, N', 'Camitta, B']","['Mahoney DH Jr', 'Shuster JJ', 'Nitschke R', 'Lauer SJ', 'Steuber CP', 'Winick N', 'Camitta B']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA. dmahoney@msmail.his.tch.tmc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Oral', 'Antidotes/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1998/05/20 02:05,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/05/20 02:05'],"['1998/05/20 02:05 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 02:05 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.5.1712 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 May;16(5):1712-22. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.5.1712.,"['0 (Antidotes)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-11233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Polymerase chain reaction-amplified short tandem repeat genotyping was used for early confirmation of donor engraftment after PBSC transplantation (PBSCT). A standard cyclosporine A/methotrexate combination was used to prevent acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). All donors, including one in the third trimester of pregnancy, tolerated G-CSF administration and 3-day PBSC harvesting procedures well. Engraftment was prompt for all patients; it was verified using a panel of 12 human polymorphic short tandem repeat loci from bone marrow as early as 7 days posttransplantation. This status was maintained until relapse, when mixed chimerism was detected using the polymerase chain reaction. A minimum resurgence of recipient cells to 1% of the population was required to detect chimerism. The median times to recovery of the absolute neutrophil count to greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and the sustained platelet count to greater than 20 x 10(9)/L without transfusion were 10 and 12 days after PBSCT, respectively. Six patients experienced acute GVHD, Grade I in two patients and Grade II in four, including two HLA-haploidentical recipients. Chronic GVHD was noticed in three of the 11 patients who were followed for at least 100 days after PBSCT. Ten patients were still alive at the latest follow-up and have been disease free for a median of 278 days (range 60-671). Five patients died from causes other than graft failure: three from leukemia relapse and two from transplant-related complications. The results confirm that G-CSF can be safely administered to healthy donors and that engraftment after allogeneic PBSCT is fast and durable. Complete chimerism can be detected early by genomic analysis. PBSCT may offer an alternative to bone marrow transplantation.","['Tzeng, C H', 'Lyou, J Y', 'Lin, J S', 'Chen, Y R', 'Hu, H Y', 'Yung, C H', 'Wang, S Y', 'Lee, J C']","['Tzeng CH', 'Lyou JY', 'Lin JS', 'Chen YR', 'Hu HY', 'Yung CH', 'Wang SY', 'Lee JC']","['Section of Transfusion Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/therapy', 'Child', 'Female', 'Genotype', '*Graft Survival', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/blood/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Platelet Count', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 1998 Apr;97(4):252-60.,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that degradation of the Abi proteins occurs through a Ras-independent pathway.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is known to induce in vitro and in vivo differentiation of APL cells and to favor their release from the bone marrow into the blood at initiation of therapy. In order to determine whether these effects might be mediated in part by modifications of beta1-integrin and pseudoimmunoglobulin expression on APL cells, the expression of these adhesion molecules on bone marrow (BM) blast cells from 24 APL patients was assayed at diagnosis by an indirect immunofluorescence method. CD49b, CD49d, CD49e, CD49f, CD54, CD58, and CD56 were expressed respectively on 18%+/-20% (0-66%), 40%+/-31% (0-96%), 48%+/-32% (0-97%), 29%+29% (1-94%), 51%+/-30% (5-98%), 37%+/-24% (1-85%) and 32%+/-31% (0-97%) of APL cells, with respectively 39%, 71%, 79%, 50%, 70%, 70%, and 53% positive cases (> or = 20% positive cells). Despite a wide variability between individual samples, the expression of beta1-integrins and that of pseudo-immunoglobulins tended to be higher in APL in comparison with that of a cohort of 63 patients with other AML subtypes with significant differences for CD54 expression (51%+/-30% vs 28%+/-27%, P=0.006) and CD56 expression (37%+/-24% vs 17%+/-19%, P=0.0003). An in vitro differentiation assay was performed in nine cases. Cells were harvested after 4-7 days of culture and studied for the expression of adhesion molecules. Granulocytic differentiation was marked by persistence of CD15 expression. Antigen expression was decreased after culture with ATRA for all beta1-integrins (except CD49b and CD49f) and pseudoimmunoglobulins (except CD54) tested. However, changes were statistically significant only for CD56 (P=0.04), CD49d (P=0.02) and CD49e (P=0.01). The modifications in the expression of the beta1-integrins and pseudo immunoglobulins were not specific to ATRA-induced differentiation, but commonly observed with differentiation. Furthermore, the modifications in the adhesive properties of APL cells to extracellular matrix proteins, observed on adhesion assays, were not statistically significant after ATRA-induced differentiation. Overall, the level of expression of beta1-integrins and pseudo-immunoglobulins was higher in APL than in other AML subtypes, and appeared modified with induced differentiation. This was not specific of ATRA, but might be involved in the general differentiation phenomenon. The modulation of adhesion molecules does not seem a sufficient requisite for the development of the retinoic acid syndrome, but could nevertheless be part of the increase in leukocyte counts observed during the first days of ATRA therapy.","['Thomas, X', 'Anglaret, B', 'Campos, L', 'Thiebaut, A', 'Sabido, O', 'Bailly, M', 'Archimbaud, E']","['Thomas X', 'Anglaret B', 'Campos L', 'Thiebaut A', 'Sabido O', 'Bailly M', 'Archimbaud E']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/19 00:00,1998/05/19 00:01,['1998/05/19 00:00'],"['1998/05/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697001513 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00151-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Jan;22(1):61-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00151-3.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrin beta1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of an M-CSF receptor-like membrane protein.,55-60,"We have isolated an M-CSF-like membrane-associated growth factor from human leukemic J6-1 cells that can enhance the growth and colony formation of J6-1 cells in vitro. Indirect evidence suggests that this membrane-associated M-CSF-like growth factor may do so by stimulating a corresponding receptor co-expressed on the adjacent J6-1 cells. The objective of this study is to isolate the putative receptor in J6-1 cells by virtue of its ability to bind and thus ""block"" the growth of J6-1 cells. Based on this approach, we have isolated from the J6-1 cell membrane an inhibitory activity that can inhibit the clonal growth of J6-1 cells. The activity of this inhibitor can be readily neutralized by either anti-M-CSFR MAb or anti-M-CSFR antiserum, suggesting that it is related to M-CSFR, a product of c-fms proto-oncogene. Judging from Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, the molecular weight (MW) of this putative M-CSFR-like inhibitor was estimated to be approx. 150-180 kDa, comparable with that of M-CSFR. The specificity of M-CSFR-like protein to recognize and block membrane-bound M-CSF also was implicated by its ability to upregulate the steady-state levels of c-fms mRNA in J6-1 cells. Besides its antiproliferative activity in vitro, treatment of J6-1 cells with the putative receptor protein before inoculation effectively blocked the growth and tumor formation in vivo by J6-1 cells in a nude mouse model. These findings suggest that the growth and tumor development by J6-1 leukemic cells may involve a contact-mediated ""juxtacrine mechanism"".","['Wu, K F', 'Rao, Q', 'Zheng, G G', 'He, Z H', 'Ying, H G', 'Song, Y H', 'Chen, B D']","['Wu KF', 'Rao Q', 'Zheng GG', 'He ZH', 'Ying HG', 'Song YH', 'Chen BD']","['Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/19 00:00,1998/05/19 00:01,['1998/05/19 00:00'],"['1998/05/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212697001355 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00135-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Jan;22(1):55-60. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00135-5.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,['CA 73212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The mean follow-up was 13.5 months. The mean relative fluorescence intensity (MIF) of CAF7 varied between 6 and 83 channels (256 channels resolution). No correlation was established between CAF7 cell surface density and most of the predictive parameters such as age, sex, blood counts, immunophenotype, proliferative index (PI) or DNA index. Nevertheless expression of CAF7 correlated positively with survival duration (mean 210 vs 391 days, P = 0.048) and complete remission (CR) duration (mean 132 vs 361, days P = 0.032). The levels of CAF7 differed significantly between ALL and AML (P < 0.001), the ALL cases being all CAF7intermediate or CAF7high. In the AML group the low levels of CAF7 expression correlated with shorter CR duration (mean 132 vs 414 days, P = 0.017). The lack of correlation with other clinical and biological parameters suggested that CAF7 might have an independent prognostic significance in adult AML. Although PI was also positively related to survival duration (P = 0.02), it did not correlate with CR duration or the expression of CAF7. We suppose that the prognostic impact of CD98 is related to the control of cell growth and survival in which the molecule normally participates.","['Nikolova, M', 'Guenova, M', 'Taskov, H', 'Dimitrova, E', 'Staneva, M']","['Nikolova M', 'Guenova M', 'Taskov H', 'Dimitrova E', 'Staneva M']","['Department of Immunology, National Center of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, Sofia, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*immunology', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fusion Regulatory Protein-1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/05/19 00:00,1998/05/19 00:01,['1998/05/19 00:00'],"['1998/05/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S014521269700129X [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00129-x [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1998 Jan;22(1):39-47. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00129-x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fusion Regulatory Protein-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type I has been implicated in cellular transformation. Like other oncoproteins, such as Myc, Jun, and Fos, Tax is a transcriptional activator. How it mechanistically dysregulates the cell cycle is unclear. Previously, it was suggested that Tax affects cell-phase transition by forming a direct protein-protein complex with p16(INK4a), thereby inactivating an inhibitor of G1-to-S-phase progression. Here we show that, in T cells deleted for p16(INK4a), Tax can compel an egress of cells from G0/G1 into S despite the absence of serum. We also show that in undifferentiated myocytes, expression of Tax represses cellular differentiation. In both settings, Tax expression was found to increase cyclin D-cdk activity and to enhance pRb phosphorylation. In T cells, a Tax-associated increase in steady-state E2F2 protein was also documented. In searching for a molecular explanation for these observations, we found that Tax forms a protein-protein complex with cyclin D3, whereas a point-mutated and transcriptionally inert Tax mutant failed to form such a complex. Interestingly, expression of wild-type Tax protein in cells was also correlated with the induction of a novel hyperphosphorylated cyclin D3 protein. Taken together, these findings suggest that Tax might directly influence cyclin D-cdk activity and function, perhaps by a route independent of cdk inhibitors such as p16(INK4a).","['Neuveut, C', 'Low, K G', 'Maldarelli, F', 'Schmitt, I', 'Majone, F', 'Grassmann, R', 'Jeang, K T']","['Neuveut C', 'Low KG', 'Maldarelli F', 'Schmitt I', 'Majone F', 'Grassmann R', 'Jeang KT']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['*Cell Cycle', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'E2F2 Transcription Factor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/virology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.6.3620 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Jun;18(6):3620-32. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.6.3620.,"['0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (E2F2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,PMC108944,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms by which these proteins act remain obscure. Here we demonstrate that the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR-1) promoter is a target for AML/ETO transcriptional repression. This repression is of basal, not activated, expression from the MDR-1 promoter and thus represents a new mechanism for AML/ETO function. We have defined two domains in AML/ETO that are required for repression of basal transcription from the MDR-1 promoter: a hydrophobic heptad repeat (HHR) motif and a conserved zinc finger (ZnF) domain termed the MYND domain. The HHR mediates formation of AML/ETO homodimers and AML/ETO-ETO heterodimers. Single serine substitutions at conserved cysteine residues within the predicted ZnFs also abrogate transcriptional repression. Finally, we observe that AML/ETO can also inhibit Ets-1 activation of the MDR-1 promoter, indicating that AML/ETO can disrupt both basal and Ets-1-dependent transcription. The fortuitous inhibition of MDR-1 expression in t(8;21)-containing leukemias may contribute to the favorable response of these patients to chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Lutterbach, B', 'Sun, D', 'Schuetz, J', 'Hiebert, S W']","['Lutterbach B', 'Sun D', 'Schuetz J', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry and the Vanderbilt Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Point Mutation', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.6.3604 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Jun;18(6):3604-11. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.6.3604.,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,"['R01-CA77274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC108942,,,,,,,,

In rat neonatal ventricular myocytes, both JNK and p38 were stimulated by hypertrophic agonists like endothelin-1, phenylephrine, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Expression of MAP kinase kinase 6b (EE), a constitutive activator of p38, stimulated the expression of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), which is a genetic marker of in vivo cardiac hypertrophy. Activation of p38 was required for ANF expression induced by the hypertrophic agonists. Furthermore, a specific p38 inhibitor, SB202190, significantly changed hypertrophic morphology induced by the agonists. Surprisingly, activation of JNK led to inhibition of ANF expression induced by MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) and the hypertrophic agonists. MEKK1-induced ANF expression was also negatively regulated by expression of c-Jun. Our results demonstrate that p38 mediates, but JNK suppresses, the development of myocyte hypertrophy.","['Nemoto, S', 'Sheng, Z', 'Lin, A']","['Nemoto S', 'Sheng Z', 'Lin A']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Molecular and Cellular Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/biosynthesis', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cardiomegaly/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Cardiotonic Agents/pharmacology', 'Endothelin-1/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Myocardium/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Phenylephrine/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.6.3518 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Jun;18(6):3518-26. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.6.3518.,"['0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '1WS297W6MV (Phenylephrine)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)']",,,,,,['CA73740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC108933,,,,,,,,

In addition, analysis of Hox11-/- mice has demonstrated a critical role for this gene in murine spleen development. A possible mode of in vivo function for the HOX11 protein in these two situations is regulation of target genes following DNA binding via the homeodomain, but little is known about how HOX11 regulates transcription in vivo. By performing transcriptional studies in yeast and mammalian one-hybrid systems, a modular transcriptional transactivation region at the NH2 terminus of HOX11 has been functionally dissected from other parts of the protein. This NH2-terminal region includes the previously identified short conserved Hep motif, which itself activates transcription in one-hybrid assays. The importance of the NH2-terminal region for the function of HOX11 in vivo was assayed by activating a HOX11-dependent gene in NIH 3T3 cells. Activation of this gene was found to be dependent upon an intact homeodomain in HOX11, but maximal activation was obtained only when the NH2-terminal 50 amino acids of HOX11 was present, showing that this region of HOX11 is important for in vivo transcriptional control of a chromosomal target gene.","['Masson, N', 'Greene, W K', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Masson N', 'Greene WK', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge CB2 2QH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.6.3502 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Jun;18(6):3502-8. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.6.3502.,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tlx1 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,PMC108931,,,,,,,,

The receptors for these cytokines consist of a common signaling subunit, gp130, to which other subunits are added to modify ligand specificity. We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding a subunit of the mouse OSM receptor. In NIH 3T3 cells (which endogenously express gp130, LIF receptor beta [LIFRbeta], and the protein product, c12, of the cDNA described here), mouse LIF, human LIF, and human OSM signaled through receptors containing the LIFRbeta and gp130 but not through the mouse OSM receptor. Mouse OSM, however, signaled only through a c12-gp130 complex; it did not use the LIF receptor. Binding studies demonstrated that mouse OSM associated directly with either the c12 protein or gp130. These data highlight the species-specific differences in receptor utilization and signal transduction between mouse and human OSM. In mouse cells, only mouse OSM is capable of activating the mouse OSM receptor; human OSM instead activates the LIF receptor. Therefore, these data suggest that all previous studies with human OSM in mouse systems did not elucidate the biology of OSM but, rather, reflected the biological actions of LIF.","['Lindberg, R A', 'Juan, T S', 'Welcher, A A', 'Sun, Y', 'Cupples, R', 'Guthrie, B', 'Fletcher, F A']","['Lindberg RA', 'Juan TS', 'Welcher AA', 'Sun Y', 'Cupples R', 'Guthrie B', 'Fletcher FA']","['Department of Immunology, Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1789, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Species Specificity']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.6.3357 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Jun;18(6):3357-67. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.6.3357.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (C12 protein, Sus scrofa)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",,,,,['GENBANK/AF058805'],,PMC108917,,,,,,,,

The question to be addressed was whether a correlation exists between the incidence of DNA aneuploidy and the stage of disease. With one-parameter analysis of DNA staining, a DNA aneuploidy was detectable in 17 of 60 patients. The detection rate for DNA aneuploidies could be increased to 37 of 60 patients with the second method, the simultaneous measurement of DNA content in additional immunophenotyped cells (CD38 or B-B4). In MGUS and the early stages of MM, the discrepancy between both methods was higher than in stage III MM. There were no statistical differences in the incidence of DNA aneuploidy between MGUS or the early stages of MM and stage III MM (21/32 patients vs 16/26 patients). The CD56 expression in plasma cells was significantly higher in cases of DNA aneuploidy (mean +/- SD, 64.7% +/- 33.65% vs 39.3% +/- 36.69%; P = .028). Comparing the ratio of diploid to DNA aneuploid with that of CD56+ to CD56- plasma cells, a correlation was found in MGUS (r = 0.7320) in the early stages of MM, I and II (r = 0.8023), but not in stage III MM. Based on these data, the dual-staining method for DNA content in immunophenotyped cells is preferred for the detection of DNA aneuploidy, especially in the early stages of MM and in MGUS. The clinical importance of a classification of DNA aneuploidy and CD56 antigen expression together is proposed for testing.","['Nowak, R', 'Oelschlagel, U', 'Range, U', 'Molle, M', 'Ehninger, G']","['Nowak R', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Range U', 'Molle M', 'Ehninger G']","['Medizinische Klinik I, Universitatsklinikum der TU, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Aneuploidy', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/ultrastructure', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Plasma Cells/immunology']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/109.2.226 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1998 Feb;109(2):226-32. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/109.2.226.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the immunophenotype of adult AML, 106 cases were studied by cytochemical analysis and by flow cytometry with a panel of 22 antibodies. The results were compared with the French-American-British (FAB) Cooperative Group classification, as well as with available cytogenetic data on each case. CD45, CD33, and CD13 were the most commonly expressed antigens (97.2%, 95.3%, and 94.3%, respectively). Lymphoid-associated antigens were expressed in 48.1% of cases. CD20 was the most commonly expressed lymphoid antigen (17%), although often expressed in only a subpopulation of leukemic cells, followed by CD7 (16%), CD19 (9.8%), CD2 (7.5%), CD3 (6.7%), CD5 (4.8%), and CD10 (2.9%). Some immunophenotypes correlated with FAB type, including increased frequency of CD2 expression in AML-M3; lack of CD4, CD11c, CD36, CD117, and HLA-DR expression in AML-M3; increased frequency of CD20 and CD36 expression and lack of CD34 expression in AML-M5; increased frequency of CD5 expression in AML-M5a; and increased frequency of CD14 expression in AML-M5b, when compared with all other AMLs (P < .05). When compared with AML-M5b, AML-M5a demonstrated a lack of CD4 expression and a high frequency of CD117 expression. Complete morphologic and cytogenetic agreement between AML-M3 and t(15;17) was present, and four of five cases of AML-M4Eo demonstrated inv(16). The remaining case of M4Eo was characterized by a 6;9 translocation, and two other inv(16) cases were not classified as M4Eo. Expression of CD2 was present in two t(15;17) cases and in one inv(16) case, but expression of this antigen was not restricted to AML cases with these karyotypic abnormalities. Similarly, expression of CD19 was not specific for t(8;21) AML. All t(8;21) leukemias demonstrated M2 morphology. With the exception of M3, M4Eo, and a subgroup of M2 leukemias, the FAB classification does not appear to define cytogenetically distinct disease groups in adult AML. Immunophenotypically distinct profiles were identified in the M3 and M5 morphologic groups of the FAB classification. Immunophenotyping studies are helpful in the determination of myeloid lineage. In general, however, they are not sufficiently specific alone to be useful in precisely identifying either FAB or cytogenetically defined disease subtypes.","['Khalidi, H S', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Chang, K L', 'Brynes, R K', 'Slovak, M L', 'Arber, D A']","['Khalidi HS', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Chang KL', 'Brynes RK', 'Slovak ML', 'Arber DA']","['Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Classification', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/classification', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/classification', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/109.2.211 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1998 Feb;109(2):211-20. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/109.2.211.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, a simple and accurate test is needed to establish the diagnosis of APL and to identify those patients having a relapse of the disease. We describe an accurate, 2-hour indirect immunofluorescent assay for identifying APL cells in bone marrow specimens. The assay uses the PML (PG-M3) murine monoclonal antibody that is directed against the amino-terminal portion of the PML gene product. We observed a distinctive, finely speckled pattern of fluorescence in the NB4 cell line (a positive control), as well as in 15 clinical specimens that were confirmed to have APL by cytogenetic, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic studies, including four cases of microgranular variant of APL. By contrast, a coarse globular pattern of fluorescence was observed in 53 other clinical specimens that did not contain APL. When we performed dilution studies using artificial mixtures of APL cells with normal bone marrow cells, we detected as few as 5% APL cells in the mixture. Finally, there was complete concordance between the immunofluorescent assay and a polymerase chain reaction-based assay for the PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha chimeric gene in 12 other clinical specimens. We conclude that the immunofluorescent assay for PML protein is a rapid, sensitive, and accurate method for determining the presence of APL cells in clinical specimens. This assay therefore should be considered as a cost-effective alternative to other diagnostic tests, such as karyotyping or polymerase chain reaction, for the diagnostic evaluation of APL.","['Samoszuk, M K', 'Tynan, W', 'Sallash, G', 'Nasr, S', 'Monczak, Y', 'Miller, W H Jr']","['Samoszuk MK', 'Tynan W', 'Sallash G', 'Nasr S', 'Monczak Y', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Quest Diagnostics (formerly Nichols Institute), San Juan Capistrano, California 92690-6130, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', '*Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/05/16 02:18,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/05/16 02:18'],"['1998/05/16 02:18 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 02:18 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/109.2.205 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1998 Feb;109(2):205-10. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/109.2.205.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sequence, in the amino-terminal portion of HIV-1 Rev, maintains a Rev mutant with a dysfunctional nuclear/nucleolar targeting signal outside of the nucleus, although this Rev molecule itself is small enough to pass through the nuclear pores. Transition of this sequence to the N-terminus of human T-lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) p21x, which is usually located evenly distributed throughout the cell, resulted in capture of p21x in the cytoplasm. Mutational analysis clarified that a 14 residue peptide sequence was sufficient to display this inhibitory effect against nuclear entry. Furthermore, this HIV-1 Rev sequence was capable of inhibiting nuclear entry of a fragment of a human ribosomal protein, when it was fused to the carboxy terminus.

In this study, recombinant PML adenovirus, Ad-PML was constructed and used to infect human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, the anti-oncogenic function of PML and its mechanism of growth suppressing effect in breast cancer cells were examined. We showed that Ad-PML effectively infected the MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells. A high level of PML protein was expressed within 24 h post-infection and a detectable level remained at day 16. Ad-PML significantly suppressed the growth rate, clonogenicity, and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells. Intratumoral injections of MCF-7-induced tumors by high titer Ad-PML suppressed tumor growth in nude mice by about 80%. The injection sites expressed high level of PML and associated with a massive apoptotic cell death. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of PML's growth suppressing function, we examined the effect of Ad-PML on cell cycle distribution in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells. We found that Ad-PML infection caused a cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. We further showed that G1 arrest of MCF-7 cells is associated with a significant decrease in cyclin D1 and CDK2. An increased expression of p53, p21 and cyclin E was found. The Rb protein became predominantly hypophosphorylated 48 h post-infection. These findings indicate that PML exerts its growth suppressing effects by modulating several key G1 regulatory proteins. Our study provides important insight into the mechanism of tumor suppressing function of PML and suggests a potential application of Ad-PML in human cancer gene therapy.","['Le, X F', 'Vallian, S', 'Mu, Z M', 'Hung, M C', 'Chang, K S']","['Le XF', 'Vallian S', 'Mu ZM', 'Hung MC', 'Chang KS']","['Department of Tumor Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Adenoviridae Infections/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'G1 Phase/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intralesional', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/administration & dosage/*genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201705 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Apr 9;16(14):1839-49. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201705.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,,"['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-55577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We examined BAX expression in 20 cell lines derived from human haemopoietic malignancies and consistent with a potential tumour suppressor function, identified two cell lines, DG75 (a Burkitt lymphoma cell line) and Jurkat (a T-cell leukaemia line), which lacked detectable BAX expression. Apoptosis of DG75 cells induced by low serum or ionomycin was significantly delayed relative to similar Burkitt lymphoma cell lines with normal BAX levels. Although DG75 and Jurkat cells expressed several BAX RNA species including the prototypical BAX alpha RNA, the absence of BAX protein was due to single base deletions and additions in a polyguanine tract within the BAX open reading frame. These frameshift mutations result in premature termination of translation and have recently also been identified in some colon cancers with microsatellite instability. Although mismatch repair defects are not considered a common feature of haemopoietic malignancies, DG75 and Jurkat cells had widespread microsatellite instability and did not express detectable levels of MSH2. In Jurkat cells, lack of MSH2 expression was due to a point mutation in exon 13 of MSH2 resulting in premature termination of translation. Our results suggest that a pathway linking mismatch repair defects, BAX tumour suppressor frameshift mutations and resistance to apoptosis may be a key feature of some lymphomas and leukaemias.","['Brimmell, M', 'Mendiola, R', 'Mangion, J', 'Packham, G']","['Brimmell M', 'Mendiola R', 'Mangion J', 'Packham G']","[""Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Imperial College School of Medicine at St Mary's, London.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Frameshift Mutation/*genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201704 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Apr 9;16(14):1803-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201704.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical value of glycated hemoglobin (GHb) and fructosamine (Frc) in the long-term glycemic control of ALL patients. An attempt was made to identify the risk factors for hyperglycemia in ALL patients. The study group comprised 26 newly diagnosed ALL patients admitted to hospital during 1995-96. Patients with a history of blood transfusion or infection within the past 3 months were excluded from the study. White blood cell (WBC) counts, fasting blood glucose (FBG), GHb and Frc levels were analyzed in venous blood on screening day 0, before induction of chemotherapy. Frc analysis was repeated on the 21st day and GHb level on the 60th day of chemotherapy. FBG tests were performed before each dose of L-asparaginase, on days 21 and 60. None of the patients was obese. Although six children (23%) had hyperglycemia during the induction therapy, four of them had a GHb level higher than normal on admission. Only one patient who developed hyperglycemia had a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with a high initial WBC count (> 20 x 10(9)/L) had a significantly higher baseline GHb than patients with a WBC count below this level. GHb values returned to normal after achievement of complete remission. It is suggested that the leukemic process could impair glucose metabolism and baseline GHb may be used to monitor possible small changes in glucose homeostasis of ALL patients, prior to chemotherapy.","['Yetgin, S', 'Yalcin, S S', 'Ozbek, N']","['Yetgin S', 'Yalcin SS', 'Ozbek N']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Acta Paediatr Jpn,Acta paediatrica Japonica : Overseas edition,0370357,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Glucose/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fructosamine/*blood', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A/*analysis', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/prevention & control', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1442-200x.1998.tb01402.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr Jpn. 1998 Feb;40(1):52-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200x.1998.tb01402.x.,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Glycated Hemoglobin A)', '4429-04-3 (Fructosamine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides its involvement in transmembrane signaling, CD38 play a role in cell adhesion processes. Structurally, membrane CD38 was reported as presenting lateral associations with molecules involved in recognition and signaling, namely with the TCR/CD3 complex in T cells. Here we report that ligation of CD38 by agonistic and non-agonistic monoclonal antibodies exerts different effects on T cells, the former inducing down-modulation of the associated molecules, probably through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. This observation supports the view that the reduced expression of TCR/CD3 is secondary to interplay with CD38-mediated signaling, which partially overlaps with the CD3-mediated pathway. CD3 ligation by monoclonal antibodies leads not only to the expected internalization of the TCR/CD3 complex but also to down-modulation of surface CD38. The results obtained indicate that CD38 is closely associated with the CD3/TCR complex and that co-modulation of CD38 with TCR/CD3 is a critical step in signaling processes on T lymphocytes.","['Reinis, M', 'Morra, M', 'Funaro, A', 'Di Primio, R', 'Malavasi, F']","['Reinis M', 'Morra M', 'Funaro A', 'Di Primio R', 'Malavasi F']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, University of Torino Medical School, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis/*physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/physiology', 'CD3 Complex/analysis/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endocytosis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Jurkat Cells/chemistry/physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/analysis/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 1997 Oct-Dec;11(4):137-42.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,['E.0266/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,,,

Two regions that have been implicated in HOX/PBX cooperative interactions are the YPWM motif, found N-terminal to the HOX homeodomain, and the GKFQ domain (also known as the Hox cooperativity motif) immediately C-terminal to the PBX homeodomain. Using derivatives of the E2A-PBX oncoprotein, we find that the GKFQ domain is not essential for cooperative interaction with HOXA1 but contributes to the stability of the complex. By contrast, the YPWM motif is strictly required for cooperative interactions in vitro and in vivo, even with mutants of E2A-PBX lacking the GKFQ domain. Using truncated PBX proteins, we show that the YPWM motif contacts the PBX homeodomain. The presence of the GKFQ domain increases monomer binding by the PBX homeodomain 5-fold, and the stability of the HOXA1.E2A-PBX complex 2-fold. These data suggest that the GKFQ domain acts mainly to increase DNA binding by PBX, rather than providing a primary contact site for the YPWM motif of HOXA1.

This region is notably thought to be involved in the presentation of the NH2-terminal peptide to allow cell fusion. By using hydrophobic cluster analysis and by analogy with the influenza A hemagglutinin structures, the core of the TM structure including this particular region was predicted to consist, in the BLV and other retroviral envelope proteins, of an alpha-helix followed by a loop region, both docked against a subsequent alpha-helix that forms a triple-stranded coiled coil. The loop region could undergo, as in hemagglutinin, a major refolding into an alpha-helix integrating the coiled coil structure and putting the fusion peptide to one tip of the molecule. Based on this model, we have identified amino acids that may be essential to the BLV TM structure, and a series of mutations were introduced in the BLV env gene of an infectious molecular clone. A first series of mutations was designed to disturb the coiled coil structure (substitutions with proline residues), whereas others would maintain the general TM structure. When expressed by Semliki Forest virus recombinants, all the mutated envelope proteins were stable and efficiently synthesized in baby hamster kidney cells. Both proline-substituted and conservative mutants were strongly affected in their capacity to fuse to CC81 indicator cells. In addition, it appeared that the integrity of the TM coiled coil structure is essential for envelope protein multimerization, as analyzed by metrizamide gradient centrifugation. Finally, to gain insight into the role of this coiled coil in the infectious potential of BLV in vivo, the mutated TM genes were introduced in an infectious and pathogenic molecular clone and injected into sheep. It appeared that only the conservative mutations (A60V and A64S) allowed maintenance of viral infectivity in vivo. Since these mutations destroyed the ability to induce syncytia, we conclude that efficient fusion capacity of the recombinant envelopes is not a prerequisite for the infectious potential of BLV in vivo. Viral propagation of these mutants was strongly affected in some of the infected sheep. However, the proviral loads within half of the infected animals (2 out of 2 for A60V and 1 out of 4 for A64S) were close to the wild-type levels. In these sheep, it thus appears that the A60V and A64S mutants propagate efficiently despite being unable to induce syncytia in cell culture.","['Gatot, J S', 'Callebaut, I', 'Mornon, J P', 'Portetelle, D', 'Burny, A', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Kettmann, R', 'Willems, L']","['Gatot JS', 'Callebaut I', 'Mornon JP', 'Portetelle D', 'Burny A', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Kettmann R', 'Willems L']","['Unite de Biologie Moleculaire, Faculte Universitaire des Sciences Agronomiques, Avenue Marechal Juin 13, B5030 Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Viral Load']",1998/05/28 00:00,1998/05/28 00:01,['1998/05/28 00:00'],"['1998/05/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.21.12870 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)57889-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 May 22;273(21):12870-80. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.21.12870.,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (gp30 envelope transmembrane protein, Bovine leukemia virus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a mammalian sina homologue was reported to be a p53-inducible gene in a myeloid leukemia cell line. To explore the function of human SINA-homologous (Siah) proteins, expression plasmids encoding Siah-1A were transiently transfected into 293 epithelial cells and GM701 fibroblast cells, resulting in growth arrest without induction of apoptosis. We discovered that BAG-1, a ubiquitin-like Hsp70/Hsc70-regulating protein, is a negative regulator of Siah-1A. Siah-1A was identified as a BAG-1-binding protein via yeast two-hybrid methods. Specific interaction of BAG-1 with Siah-1A was also demonstrated by in vitro binding experiments using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Siah-1A-induced growth arrest in 293 and GM701 cells was abolished by co-transfection of wild-type BAG-1 with Siah-1A but not by a C-terminal deletion mutant of BAG-1 that fails to bind Siah-1A. Over-expression of BAG-1 significantly inhibited p53-induced growth arrest in 293 cells without preventing p53 transactivation of reporter gene plasmids. BAG-1 also prevented growth arrest following UV-irradiation-induced genotoxic injury without interfering with accumulation of p53 protein or p21(waf-1) expression. BAG-1 functions downstream of p53-induced gene expression to inhibit p53-mediated suppression of cell growth, presumably by suppressing the actions of Siah-1A. We suggest that Siah-1A may be an important mediator of p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and demonstrate that Siah-1A is directly inhibited by BAG-1.","['Matsuzawa, S', 'Takayama, S', 'Froesch, B A', 'Zapata, J M', 'Reed, J C']","['Matsuzawa S', 'Takayama S', 'Froesch BA', 'Zapata JM', 'Reed JC']","['Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Drosophila', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1998/06/10 00:00,1998/06/10 00:01,['1998/06/10 00:00'],"['1998/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/17.10.2736 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1998 May 15;17(10):2736-47. doi: 10.1093/emboj/17.10.2736.,"['0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (seven in absentia proteins)']",,,,,,['CA-67329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1170614,,,,,,,,

The mouse TERT is widely expressed at low levels in adult tissues, with greatest abundance during embryogenesis and in adult thymus and intestine. The mTERT component mRNA levels were regulated during both differentiation and proliferation, while mTR levels remained constant throughout both processes. Comparison of mTERT and mTR levels to telomerase activity indicates that mTERT expression is more tightly linked to the regulation of telomerase activity during these processes than is mTR. In contrast to the situation in human cell cultures, mTERT transcript levels are present at readily detectable levels in primary cultured cells and are not upregulated following crisis.

Virions pseudotyped with the chimeric envelope proteins bound to 293 cells expressing murine c-Kit (293KIT) preferentially; however, they could not transduce any c-Kit-positive cells under conventional conditions. They could transduce 293KIT cells in the presence of chloroquine, and HEL cells expressing human c-Kit on a fibronectin fragment (CH296)-coated dish.

Using myeloid leukemia cells (P39) retrovirally transduced with mutant H-RAS, we found that the influence of this oncogene was highly dependent on the inducer used: whereas RAS had no significant effect on spontaneous apoptosis or on the response to the cytotoxic drugs (doxorubicin or 1-beta-arabinofuranosylcytosine), P39-RAS cells showed a strongly augmented response to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in both the induction of apoptosis and differentiation. Because, under some circumstances, RAF has been associated with promoting apoptosis, we examined whether the activation of this kinase by mutant RAS could be responsible for the augmented response to ATRA. However, constitutive activation of RAF did not alter the apoptotic sensitivity of these cells, making it unlikely that RAS promotes apoptosis by stimulating this kinase. Nor did we find that BCL-2 was differentially down-regulated in P39-RAS cells. Rather, we found that the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by low-dose phorbol ester could almost entirely recapitulate transformation by RAS, in terms of promoting both apoptosis and differentiation after treatment with ATRA. Moreover, the RAS-induced phenotype could be completely abolished by a specific inhibition of PKC under conditions that had no effect on the response of control cells. In conclusion, we have shown that mutant RAS promotes differentiation-associated cell death in P39 cells by stimulating the activity of PKC, which is itself an important regulator of myeloid differentiation. PKC activation, in turn, powerfully synergizes with the PKC-independent action of ATRA. This work identifies a possible explanation for the ability of this oncogene to promote myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Clinically, it raises the possibility that although leukemias expressing mutant RAS may not show an altered response to cytotoxic agents, they may show enhanced sensitivity to differentiation therapy with ATRA.","['Gallagher, A P', 'Burnett, A K', 'Bowen, D T', 'Darley, R L']","['Gallagher AP', 'Burnett AK', 'Bowen DT', 'Darley RL']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/15 00:00,1998/05/15 00:01,['1998/05/15 00:00'],"['1998/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 May 1;58(9):2029-35.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients can become resistant to RA, and this resistance is thought to be mediated in part by an increase in the rate of RA metabolism. We have characterized the metabolism of all-trans-retinol (ROL; vitamin A) in NB4 cells, which are human promyelocytic leukemia cells. NB4 cells metabolize ROL into a variety of compounds, including all-trans-4-hydroxyretinol, all-trans-4-oxoretinol (4-oxoROL), 14-hydroxy-4,14-retro-retinol, anhydroretinol, and several ROL esters. No metabolism of ROL to RA or to RA derivatives in NB4 cells was detected. The rate of ROL metabolism increased after cell differentiation; in a 24-h period, differentiated cells metabolized 2-fold more ROL than did undifferentiated cells. The major difference in the ROL metabolism pattern between undifferentiated and differentiated cells was an approximately 10-fold increase in the production of all-trans-4-hydroxyretinol and 4-oxoROL in differentiated cells. Furthermore, exogenously added 4-oxoROL was capable of eliciting NB4 cell differentiation, as measured by growth inhibition, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, nuclear body relocalization of PML, and surface expression of CD11b. In addition, 4-oxoROL synergized with IFN-gamma in the promotion of NB4 cell growth arrest. Following treatment of NB4 cells with 4-oxoROL to induce differentiation, the production of 4-oxoROL from ROL was observed; this indicated that 4-oxoROL induces its own synthesis in NB4 cells. In addition, 48 h after the administration of 1 microM 4-oxoROL, NB4 cells maintained a high intracellular concentration (17 microM) of 4-oxoROL. These unique properties of 4-oxoROL may provide advantages over RA in the treatment of promyelocytic leukemia cells because it may be possible to maintain cytodifferentiating concentrations of 4-oxoROL in the cells for extended periods of time.","['Faria, T N', 'Rivi, R', 'Derguini, F', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Gudas, L J']","['Faria TN', 'Rivi R', 'Derguini F', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Gudas LJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Cornell University Medical College, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Vitamin A/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1998/05/15 00:00,1998/05/15 00:01,['1998/05/15 00:00'],"['1998/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 May 1;58(9):2007-13.,"['11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '62702-55-0 (4-oxoretinol)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,"['R01 CA43796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA77509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM47599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) and lymphoma (GRSL) cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of UV radiation compared to hamster cell lines, although normal UV-induced hprt mutation frequencies were found. Determination of UV-induced repair replication revealed a limited capacity of MEL and GRSL cells to perform NER consistent with poor removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine 6-4 pyrimidone photoproducts from transcriptionally active genes during the first 8 h after UV exposure. However, both cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine 6-4 pyrimidone photoproducts appeared to be processed to almost normal level 24 h after UV treatment. In parallel, we observed that the UV-irradiated MEL and GRSL cells suffered from severe DNA fragmentation particularly 24 h after UV exposure. Taken together, these data indicate a reduced repair of UV-induced photolesions in apoptotic cells, already established at the early onset of apoptosis. To test whether inhibition of repair in cells was due to inactivation of NER or to apoptosis-induced chromatin degradation, we performed in vitro excision assays using extracts from UV-irradiated MEL cells. These experiments showed that the NER capacity during early apoptosis was intact, indicating that slow removal of UV-induced photolesions in apoptotic cells is due to substrate modification (presumably degradation of chromatin) rather than direct inhibition of factors involved in NER.","['Vreeswijk, M P', 'Westland, B E', 'Hess, M T', 'Naegeli, H', 'Vrieling, H', 'van Zeeland, A A', 'Mullenders, L H']","['Vreeswijk MP', 'Westland BE', 'Hess MT', 'Naegeli H', 'Vrieling H', 'van Zeeland AA', 'Mullenders LH']","['Medical Genetics Centre-Department of Radiation Genetics and Chemical Mutagenesis, Leiden University, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Damage/*radiation effects', '*DNA Fragmentation', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'Deoxyribodipyrimidine Photo-Lyase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Pyrimidine Dimers/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1998/05/15 00:00,1998/05/15 00:01,['1998/05/15 00:00'],"['1998/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 May 1;58(9):1978-85.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Pyrimidine Dimers)', 'EC 4.1.99.- (pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidone photolyase)', 'EC 4.1.99.3 (Deoxyribodipyrimidine Photo-Lyase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In agreement with previous studies, treatment of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells with 1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] induced a transient increase of ceramide levels within 2 h, which then returned to basal levels within 8 h. In contrast, sphingosine kinase activity increased more slowly and reached maximal levels only after 20 h of exposure, leading to a concomitant increase in SPP level. Unlike treatments with cell-permeable ceramide analogues or sphingomyelinase, which induce apoptosis, 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not induce apoptosis, despite the early formation of ceramide. Moreover, prolonged treatment of HL-60 cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 suppressed ceramide-induced apoptosis. There was a correlation between the time course and dose response of the activation of sphingosine kinase by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and the protection against apoptosis. In contrast, treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid neither stimulated sphingosine kinase activity nor protected cells from ceramide-induced apoptosis. Treatment with SPP protected HL-60 cells from ceramide-induced apoptosis, and N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), a competitive inhibitor of sphingosine kinase, prevented the survival effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3. The effect of DMS was counteracted by SPP, suggesting that SPP is a critical component of the cytoprotective effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Chelerythrine chloride, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, markedly reduced sphingosine kinase activity and the apoptosis-sparing effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3, and conversely, the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorhol-13-acetate not only suppressed ceramide-induced apoptosis but also stimulated sphingosine kinase activity. Moreover, the protective effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was blocked by DMS. Collectively, our observations indicate that the cytoprotective effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 is mediated by SPP, which is formed as a consequence of activation of sphingosine kinase.","['Kleuser, B', 'Cuvillier, O', 'Spiegel, S']","['Kleuser B', 'Cuvillier O', 'Spiegel S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20007, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alkaloids', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', '*Lysophospholipids', 'Phenanthridines/pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1998/05/15 00:00,1998/05/15 00:01,['1998/05/15 00:00'],"['1998/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 May 1;58(9):1817-24.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'E3B045W6X0 (chelerythrine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'L9QRA71834 (N,N-dimethylsphingosine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,"['CA61774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 43880/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested previously that enhanced cross-link repair is a primary mechanism of resistance to nitrogen mustards (NMs) in B-CLL. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks and in rejoining steps in recombination mechanisms. Mutants defective in this process are hypersensitive to alkylating agents. We have recently demonstrated that the activity of DNA-PK is a determinant in the cellular response of B-CLL to CLB. The DNA-PK gene has homology to the P110 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K). Wortmannin, an inhibitor of P110 PI 3-K, also inhibits DNA-PK activity in vitro. We investigated the effect of wortmannin on DNA-PK activity and CLB toxicity in the lymphocytes from 11 patients with B-CLL. Our results demonstrate that DNA-PK activity is decreased after exposure to wortmannin in a dose-dependent manner. Wortmannin, at nontoxic concentrations, synergistically sensitized B-CLL lymphocytes to the effects of CLB. Moreover, we observed a significant correlation when we compared the fold decrease in DNA-PK activity and the synergistic value (I), obtained when wortmannin was used at 0.1 microM. In the resistant B-CLL lymphocyte samples, there was a highly significant correlation between the ability of wortmannin at 0.1 and 0.25 microM to decrease the level of DNA-PK activity and to increase CLB sensitivity. In a model of primary human tumor cells, our findings suggest that the inhibition of DNA-PK activity may be a powerful way to overcome resistance to NMs such as CLB and point to new possibilities to improve the effectiveness of NM therapy.","['Christodoulopoulos, G', 'Muller, C', 'Salles, B', 'Kazmi, R', 'Panasci, L']","['Christodoulopoulos G', 'Muller C', 'Salles B', 'Kazmi R', 'Panasci L']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, The Sir Mortimer B.

In other cell types, including two T-cell leukemia cell lines, these transcripts were absent. The PCR fragments of the hybrid transcripts contained two open reading frames (ORFs). One was a hybrid HERV-H protease/HERV-E integrase ORF and the other was the HERV-E envelope surface glycoprotein ORF. Alternative splice products were also identified. The genomic DNA origin of the hybrid transcripts was shown to be a HERV-H element with a large 3'-end deletion, adjacent to a HERV-E element lacking the 5'-LTR.

We demonstrate a novel multicolor flow cytometry approach for quantifying apoptosis and cell cycle information of phenotypically distinct populations, using less than 2 x 10(5) cells per sample. We used incorporation of Cy5-dUTP into DNA strand breaks by the terminal dUTP nucleotide end labeling (TUNEL) method to determine apoptosis, while cell cycle information was assessed with an ultraviolet DNA binding dye, DAPI. To simultaneously determine surface phenotype, we used paraformaldehyde fixation and a gentle permeabilization protocol combined with FITC- and PE-labeled surface antibodies. Using these fluorochromes, and three-laser instrumentation, we quantified apoptosis and cell cycle phase in lymphocyte subpopulations from heterogeneous human and murine cell sources, subjected to various culture conditions. Further, we used this method to detect divergent rates of apoptosis in a human, heterogeneous lymphocyte tumor population, demonstrating a potential application for clinical and/or research settings. Thus, we describe a six-parameter, four-color flow cytometry approach for evaluating apoptosis and cell cycle with dual surface labels. This method may also be useful as a generalized scheme to assess simultaneously two intracellular targets in a mixed cell population.","['Douglas, R S', 'Pletcher, C H Jr', 'Nowell, P C', 'Moore, J S']","['Douglas RS', 'Pletcher CH Jr', 'Nowell PC', 'Moore JS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104-6082, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/immunology']",1998/05/15 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/15 02:03'],"['1998/05/15 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/15 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19980501)32:1<57::AID-CYTO8>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980501)32:1<57::aid-cyto8>3.0.co;2-c [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1998 May 1;32(1):57-65. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980501)32:1<57::aid-cyto8>3.0.co;2-c.,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,"['CA16520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Many different approaches have been used for this evaluation, often leading to conflicting results. The aim of our study was to analyze several commonly used AgNOR parameters in bone marrow smears of 32 newly diagnosed cases of acute leukemia: number of clusters and dots, percentage of cells with one cluster (cells in a long G1 phase), total and percentage of silver-stained area per nucleus, mean size of AgNORs, and the Ruschoff index. These parameters were compared with the in vitro incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). A significant correlation was found between the BrdU index and the mean number of clusters (r = 0.60), dots (r = 0.60), percentage of cells with one cluster (r = -0.63), as well as with the mean size of AgNORs (r = -0.63) and the Ruschoff index (r = 0.72). In a factor analysis, total AgNOR area, its percentage of nuclear area, the mean AgNOR size, and the nuclear area formed one factor (factor of area parameters), and clusters, dots, the percentage of cells with one cluster, and BrdU index made another factor (factor of proliferation parameters). The Ruschoff index participated equally in both factors. Based on these data, we postulate that the number of clusters and dots are related to the percentage of cells in S-phase and the AgNOR area may be related to the cell duplication time, as has been reported in the literature. Mean size of AgNORs is smaller in highly proliferating cells. Probably the Ruschoff index is related to the percentage of cells in S-phase as well as to the cell duplication time, and seems to be the best AgNOR parameter for the global evaluation of cell kinetics in acute leukemias.","['Lorand-Metze, I', 'Carvalho, M A', 'Metze, K']","['Lorand-Metze I', 'Carvalho MA', 'Metze K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. ilmetze@obelix.unicamp.br']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Division', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Nucleolus Organizer Region', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'S Phase', 'Staining and Labeling/methods']",1998/05/15 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/15 02:03'],"['1998/05/15 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/15 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19980501)32:1<51::AID-CYTO7>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980501)32:1<51::aid-cyto7>3.0.co;2-i [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1998 May 1;32(1):51-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980501)32:1<51::aid-cyto7>3.0.co;2-i.,['G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, DNA adducts different from O6-methylguanine might be also involved in cytotoxicity induced by methylating agents. Because the loss of p53 function is generally associated with tumor cell resistance to anticancer chemotherapy, we have investigated whether wild-type p53 might affect chemosensitivity of leukemia cells endowed with high OGAT levels to the methylating agent temozolomide (TZM). The effect of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PADPRP) inhibition, which potentiates the cytotoxic effects of N7-methylguanine and N3-methylguanine, was also assessed in OGAT-proficient cells, either susceptible or tolerant to O6-methylguanine. OGAT-proficient and p53 null HL60 cells were transfected with the human p53 cDNA (p53+ cells). Treatment with TZM concentrations not toxic for the cells transduced with the control vector (p53-cells), induced apoptosis in p53+ cells. These cells were characterized by a lower level of bcl-2 protein than p53- cells, whereas bax and OGAT expression was comparable in both lines. Inhibition of PADPRP potentiated the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of TZM in either p53- or p53+ HL60 cells. Furthermore, PADPRP inhibitors potentiated apoptosis induced by TZM in Jurkat cells, which possess a mutated p53 gene and are tolerant to O6-methylguanine adducts. The analysis of cell cycle indicated that the drug combination of TZM and PADPRP inhibitors provoked G1 arrest only in p53+ cells. Conversely, G1 arrest was not observed in p53+ cells exposed to TZM alone. It is possible to speculate that PADPRP inhibitors might affect the repair of DNA adducts that are processed differently from O6 methylguanine and induce a different pattern of cell cycle distribution. In conclusion, the results show that p53 increases apoptosis by TZM in OGAT-proficient cells and suggest the potential role of PADPRP inhibitors in enhancing TZM activity against leukemias independently of DNA repair systems.","['Tentori, L', 'Lacal, P M', 'Benincasa, E', 'Franco, D', 'Faraoni, I', 'Bonmassar, E', 'Graziani, G']","['Tentori L', 'Lacal PM', 'Benincasa E', 'Franco D', 'Faraoni I', 'Bonmassar E', 'Graziani G']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/genetics/physiology', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Temozolomide', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",1998/05/15 00:00,1998/05/15 00:01,['1998/05/15 00:00'],"['1998/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1998 May;285(2):884-93.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '01KC87F8FE (O(6)-benzylguanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clone which was strongly activated by the virus stimulated autologous T cells. It was also damaged by the cytotoxic T cells which were generated in mixed cultures with autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). Cultured, non-infected CLL cells were not lysed by these effectors. The other B-CLL clone, which was activated to considerably lesser extent by the virus, did not stimulate the autologous T lymphocytes. While, also in this case cytotoxic function was generated in the mixed T cell-LCL culture, the effectors did not damage the EBV-infected CLL cells. The results with B-CLL cells can be regarded as a model for the EBV genome carrier normal B lymphocytes. They substantiate the current concept that such cells persist in seropositive healthy individuals undisturbed by the specific immune response as long as they maintain the phenotype of resting cells. However, after activation they can be recognized and eliminated by T cells.","['Tomita, Y', 'Avila-Carino, J', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Mellstedt, H', 'Klein, E']","['Tomita Y', 'Avila-Carino J', 'Yamamoto K', 'Mellstedt H', 'Klein E']","['Microbiology and Tumorbiology Center, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infectious Mononucleosis/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",1998/05/15 00:00,1998/05/15 00:01,['1998/05/15 00:00'],"['1998/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2478(97)00142-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(97)00142-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1998 Feb;60(2-3):73-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(97)00142-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years particular attention has been paid to myeloproliferative disorders with dysplastic features or myelodysplastic syndromes that evolve into a myeloproliferative disorder. The present study was designed to analyze patients with MDS but with a normal or increased colony forming capacity, in order to see whether or not cell cultures could contribute to the diagnosis of intermediate MDS-MPD conditions. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 80 patients diagnosed as having MDS were included in the study. CFU-GM assay was performed by plating 1 x 10(5) mononuclear cells/mL in IMDM and 0.9% methyl-cellulose containing 10% PHA-LCM. In all cases cultures were run in parallel without PHA-LCM to assess autonomous growth. Cultures were incubated at 37 degrees C in a fully humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and scored at day 14. Cytogenetic analysis was performed according to standard procedures. Short-term cultures of 24 and/or 48 hours were used. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients out of the 80 MDS cases included in the study showed a normal or increased cell growth pattern. Among these 22 patients, eight were diagnosed as suffering from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) according to the FAB criteria and were excluded from the present analysis. The remaining 14 cases, which constitute the body of this study, displayed an increased number of clusters and/or colonies, with an altered cluster/colony ratio (anomalous growth) in 10 cases. Autonomous colony formation was present in five of these 14 cases and autonomous cluster growth was seen in all but three of them. In addition, one patient showed endogenous BFU-E growth. Morphological diagnoses were then revised due to this aberrant colony growth pattern: based on actual criteria, 3 patients could have been considered as having a-CML (atypical chronic myeloid leukemia). Another 6 cases evolved to a more proliferative disorder: 5 to CMML, and one to a-CML. Interestingly, in 3 of these 6 patients the evolution took place concomitantly with an infectious episode. In one additional patient the platelet count increased up to 1000 x 10(9)/L and required treatment with hydroxyurea. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that intermediate MDS-MPD cases are relatively common and that in vitro characteristics, i.e. high clonogenic capacity with a high cluster/colony ratio and scanty autonomous growth, in patients showing myelodysplastic features could contribute to an early diagnosis in these cases. It is possible that in some cases an infectious episode, through higher cytokine secretion, contributes to the development of these disorders.","['Del Canizo, M C', 'Brufau, A', 'Mota, A', 'Lopez, N', 'Fernandez, M E', 'Vallejo, C', 'Hernandez, J M', 'Garcia, J L', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Del Canizo MC', 'Brufau A', 'Mota A', 'Lopez N', 'Fernandez ME', 'Vallejo C', 'Hernandez JM', 'Garcia JL', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/pathology']",1998/05/15 00:00,1998/05/15 00:01,['1998/05/15 00:00'],"['1998/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Jan;83(1):3-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present the results of the treatment of a group of patients aged above 70 years with AML diagnosed in our Hospital since 1990. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have studied retrospectively the cases of AML in patients older than 70 years diagnosed in our Service since January 1990 to June 1996. Induction treatment was performed, in all cases but one, with two cycles of Ara-C 10 mg/m2/12 h s.c. for 21 days and after haematological recuperation, if complete remission had been achieved, monthly maintenance treatment with Ara-C (25 mg/m2/12 h oral x 5 days), prednisone (40 mg/m2/day x 5 days) y vincristine (1 mg/m2 i.v. x 1 day) was begun. RESULTS: During the period of study 48 patients with AML have been diagnosed in our Service, among them 22 (45.8%) were older than 70 years. One of them could not be considered for the study as not all data from him could be compiled. Among the other 21 patients 5 presented previous haematological processes (4 myelodysplastic syndrome and 1 Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia). Initial diagnosis according to FAB classification for AML was as follows: 7 M1, 6 M2, 4 M4, 2 M5 and 2 M6. From these 21 patients 2 received no treatment due to rapid progression and death, among the other 19, one was directly treated with a modification of the maintenance treatment with vincristine and prednisone without response (survival 2 months). The other 18 patients were treated with low-dose Ara-C (described above), among them 3 (16.7%) were not evaluable as they did not finish the first cycle of induction treatment; 8 (44.4%) showed no response; 2 (11.1%) achieved partial remission and 5 (27.8%) complete remission. One patient did not show any response after two cycles of low-dose Ara-C but she obtained complete remission when treated with Ara-C and idaurubicin. Overall mean survival was 5.7 months (median 2; 95% confidence interval 1.6-9.8 months). In the group of patients treated with low-dose Ara-C mean survival was 6.6 months (median 3.5; 95% confidence interval 1.9-11.2 months). CONCLUSION: We consider that the treatment with low-dose Ara-C is a valid option in the treatment of elderly patients (aged 70 or above) with AML because 28% complete remissions can be achieved, specially in those ones in which other more aggressive treatments are not possible.","['Rodriguez, J N', 'Fernandez-Jurado, A', 'Martino, M L', 'Dieguez, J C', 'Moreno, M V', 'Quesada, J A', 'Polo, B', 'Canavate, M', 'Amian, A', 'Prados, D']","['Rodriguez JN', 'Fernandez-Jurado A', 'Martino ML', 'Dieguez JC', 'Moreno MV', 'Quesada JA', 'Polo B', 'Canavate M', 'Amian A', 'Prados D']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez, Huelva.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/pathology']",1998/05/15 00:00,1998/05/15 00:01,['1998/05/15 00:00'],"['1998/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1998 Feb;43(1):35-9.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,Leucemia mieloide aguda en mayores de 70 anos.

This SEAm-PA fusion protein can then be used to direct cytotoxic T cells to tumour cells coated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this communication, we tested the PA-SEAm fusion protein together with mAbs against the myeloid cell surface antigens CD13, CD15 and CD33. A SEA-reactive T cell line was used as effector cells against 10 different myeloid leukaemic cell lines. Optimal lysis of antigen positive leukaemic cells was obtained at a PA-SEAm concentration of 1 ng/ml and effector : target cell ratios of 15 : 1. No correlation between target cell sensitivity and the level of surface antigen expression could be seen. The 6 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines tested appeared to be more sensitive than the 4 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cell lines. The sensitivity of the AML cell line HL-60 could be improved further by stimulation with TNFalpha. This was accompanied by increased surface ICAM-1 expression whereas specific target molecule expression (CD13, CD33) was unchanged. This suggests that sensitivity to lysis is related to the leukaemic subtype and ICAM-1 expression but not to the tumour antigen density. Our results show that it is possible to direct cytotoxic T cells to myeloid leukaemia cells by using SAgs linked to mAbs, and encourage the construction and testing of a recombinant direct SAg-mAb fusion protein as a candidate drug for therapy of myeloid leukaemias.","['Gidlof, C', 'Carlson, B', 'Dohlsten, M', 'Totterman, T H']","['Gidlof C', 'Carlson B', 'Dohlsten M', 'Totterman TH']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Superantigens/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1998/05/14 00:00,1998/05/14 00:01,['1998/05/14 00:00'],"['1998/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01029.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1998 Apr;60(4):233-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01029.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Superantigens)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 94 kDa AML1-ETO fusion protein was detected in all samples. However, this fusion protein was not detectable in all 40 patients with t(8;21)-negative AMLs. The biological significance of AML1-ETO was examined in K562 cells, which stably overexpress AML1-ETO. We found that AML1-ETO blocked the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells induced by low doses of Ara-C. Thus, t(8;21)-positive AMLs appear to overexpress the AML1-ETO fusion protein, which may be responsible for differentiation block and leukemogenesis in AML.","['Le, X F', 'Claxton, D', 'Kornblau, S', 'Fan, Y H', 'Mu, Z M', 'Chang, K S']","['Le XF', 'Claxton D', 'Kornblau S', 'Fan YH', 'Mu ZM', 'Chang KS']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/immunology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/immunology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/05/14 00:00,1998/05/14 00:01,['1998/05/14 00:00'],"['1998/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01027.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1998 Apr;60(4):217-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01027.x.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,['CA55164-5/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Using the cutoff level of the mean false monosomy and trisomy in the control cells +2 S.D., chromosome loss or gain for the somatic chromosomes could be revealed beyond a clonal ratio of 3.6-13.2% and 1.1-6.8%, respectively. The same value for the sex chromosomes was 3.5% and 0%, respectively. In 5 of 11 patients the leukemic cells proved to be diploid with all three methods at both gross DNA and chromosome levels. Interphase cytogenetics revealed chromosome loss or gain in all of the remaining six patients, however, the metaphase analysis indicated numerical aberration in only two patients. In one of them only the increased chromosome number could have been detected without identifying the chromosomes involved and in the other one the two methods indicated trisomy for a different chromosome. Flow cytometric data showed aneuploidy in three of the six aneuploid leukemia patients. The results suggest that interphase cytogenetics might be more accurate compared with flow cytometry and metaphase analysis to reveal aneuploidy.","['Pajor, L', 'Szuhai, K', 'Mehes, G', 'Kosztolanyi, G', 'Jakso, P', 'Lendvai, G', 'Szanyi, I', 'Kajtar, P']","['Pajor L', 'Szuhai K', 'Mehes G', 'Kosztolanyi G', 'Jakso P', 'Lendvai G', 'Szanyi I', 'Kajtar P']","['Department of Pathology, University Medical School of Pecs, Hungary. pajor@pathology.pote.hu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Interphase', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",1998/05/14 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/14 02:03'],"['1998/05/14 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/14 02:03 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19980415)34:2<87::AID-CYTO5>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1998 Apr 15;34(2):87-94.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In leukemias designated as ALL or AML by both methodologies, there was lineage agreement in all but 3 of 71 cases (95.8%). However, when nondiagnostic or biphenotypic diagnoses made by either methodology were included, complete agreement occurred in only 77.4% of cases. Of 37 cases designated myeloid origin by flow cytometry, 33 (89.2%) were read as myeloid by cytochemistry. The four discordant diagnosis were read as lymphoid (2) or as non-diagnostic (2). Eighty percent of lymphoid leukemias were diagnosed as such by both flow cytometry and cytochemistry; one early B cell ALL was diagnosed as myeloid and 8 as non-diagnostic. Fifty percent (50%) of flow cytometry defined T-cell ALL were considered non-diagnostic by cytochemistry as compared to 17% of the total ALL group. Of the remaining four designated non-T cell ALL by flow cytometry and non-diagnostic by cytochemistry, three were read by flow cytometry to be standard pre-B ALL and one an early B-cell ALL. Only 2/9 leukemias considered biphenotypic by flow were identified as such by cytochemistry. Given (1) the potential importance of non-lineage expression in the prognosis of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, (2) cytochemistry's impaired ability to diagnose biphenotypic, T-cell, and promyelocytic leukemias, and (3) the increased costs incurred in diagnosis when both modalities are used, perhaps it is time to re-examine the utility of performing both flow cytometry and cytochemistry as initial testing for leukemia categorization.","['Kheiri, S A', 'MacKerrell, T', 'Bonagura, V R', 'Fuchs, A', 'Billett, H H']","['Kheiri SA', 'MacKerrell T', 'Bonagura VR', 'Fuchs A', 'Billett HH']","['Department of Pathology, The Long Island Jewish Medical Center Campus for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New Hyde Park, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Histocytochemistry/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*diagnosis/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/immunology/metabolism']",1998/05/14 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/14 02:03'],"['1998/05/14 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/14 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19980415)34:2<82::AID-CYTO4>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980415)34:2<82::aid-cyto4>3.0.co;2-e [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1998 Apr 15;34(2):82-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980415)34:2<82::aid-cyto4>3.0.co;2-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As in our experience, reactivity of B-cells with these antibodies seemed to be correlated, we evaluated whether the simultaneous use of anti-CD20 and FMC7 antibodies is justified. Using flow cytometry, we measured the binding of these 2 antibodies to the B-cells of 67 bone marrow aspirates, 31 lymph node biopsies, 18 peripheral blood specimens, and 12 tissue samples from other locations. The diagnoses included 50 cases without overt abnormalities, 5 reactive lymphadenopathies, 56 lymphomas and chronic lymphoid neoplasias, and 17 cases with other malignancies. Although CD20 expression was consistently higher, we observed a significant and strong correlation between CD20 and FMC7 antigen expression on B-lymphocytes, irrespective of the nature of the sample or disease (r=0.910; P < 0.001). Moreover, FMC7 antigen expression on B-cells could be predicted by CD20 expression with a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 94% and an efficiency of 96%. Our results show that although differing in intensity, expression of CD20 on B-cells closely parallels that of FMC7 antigen. We, therefore, conclude that little additional information is revealed by using FMC7 in immunophenotyping of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas or chronic lymphoid leukemias if intensity of CD20 expression is taken into consideration.","['Hubl, W', 'Iturraspe, J', 'Braylan, R C']","['Hubl W', 'Iturraspe J', 'Braylan RC']","['Department of Pathology, University of Florida College of Medicine, and Shands Hospital, Gainesville 32610-0275, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*immunology', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",1998/05/14 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/14 02:03'],"['1998/05/14 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/14 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19980415)34:2<71::AID-CYTO2>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980415)34:2<71::aid-cyto2>3.0.co;2-f [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1998 Apr 15;34(2):71-4. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19980415)34:2<71::aid-cyto2>3.0.co;2-f.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (MS4A1 protein, human)']",['Cytometry. 1999 Feb 15;38(1):44-6.

Plasma samples were screened by an HTLV-I ELISA and an IFA test (on MT2 cells), and positive samples were tested by an HTLV-I and -II type-specific Western blot. Overall seropositivity in the village was 6.7%, but HTLV-I infection was restricted to 3 of 6 ethnic groups, including the Noir-Marron (descendants of escaped African slaves, 8%), the Creoles (4.1%) and those of mixed Noir Marron/other ethnicity (3.6%). In the Noir-Marron population of 1,222 persons, including 606 men and 616 women and representing 76% of those tested, HTLV-I seroprevalence increased significantly with age in both sexes, reaching 40% in women older than 50 years. Univariate risk factors for HTLV-I seropositivity in women included older age, more pregnancies, more live births and a history of hospitalization. A cross-sectional analysis of sexual partners demonstrated an excess of discordant female HTLV-I+/male HTLV-I- couples, indicating preferential male-to-female sexual transmission. The demonstration of II HTLV-I-seropositive children aged less than 15 years, of whom 9 had a seropositive mother, suggested maternal-child HTLV-I transmission. Our results demonstrate a very high seroprevalence of HTLV-I in this South American population descended from African slaves, probably due to high rates of mother-to-child and sexual transmission within this rather isolated group.","['Plancoulaine, S', 'Buigues, R P', 'Murphy, E L', 'van Beveren, M', 'Pouliquen, J F', 'Joubert, M', 'Remy, F', 'Tuppin, P', 'Tortevoye, P', 'de The, G', 'Moreau, J P', 'Gessain, A']","['Plancoulaine S', 'Buigues RP', 'Murphy EL', 'van Beveren M', 'Pouliquen JF', 'Joubert M', 'Remy F', 'Tuppin P', 'Tortevoye P', 'de The G', 'Moreau JP', 'Gessain A']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Endemic Diseases', 'Female', 'French Guiana/epidemiology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/ethnology/immunology/transmission', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases/immunology']",1998/05/14 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/14 02:03'],"['1998/05/14 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/14 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19980504)76:3<331::AID-IJC8>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980504)76:3<331::aid-ijc8>3.0.co;2-w [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1998 May 4;76(3):331-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980504)76:3<331::aid-ijc8>3.0.co;2-w.,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now identified a variant HPS cDNA that contains the same 5' sequence as the published HPS gene and a unique 3' sequence. Analysis of genomic DNA suggests that the two cDNA are derived from alternative transcripts of a single gene; two polyadenylated transcripts were found in normal human melanocytes, human bone marrow cells, human melanoma cells, lymphoblastoid cell lines, and megakaryocytic leukemia cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and northern analysis. The splicing exhibited by this gene is identical to the splicing found to produce two alternative transcripts of the Chediak-Higashi Syndrome gene, another pigment disorder exhibiting platelet storage pool deficiency.

Unlike HIV-1, both the wild-type SIV Env and a truncated form, which lacks most of the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane glycoprotein, were incorporated into MoMLV particles and generated infectious retroviral vectors which could transduce CD4+ sMAGI macaque cells. The infection depended on target cell CD4 expression, and was neutralized by both soluble CD4 and sera from SIV-infected macaques. We also observed pseudotype-mediated gene transfer of a green fluorescent protein marker into the CD4+ CEMX174 and C8166 lymphoid cell lines. More importantly, primary human lymphocytes were also successfully transduced ex vivo by MoMLV/SIV pseudotypes, albeit at lower efficiency, and gene transfer was specifically restricted to the CD4+ subset. These findings demonstrate that MoMLV/SIV pseudotypes can be used to transduce cells which are susceptible to SIV infection, and thus might be advantageously employed in animal models for direct in vivo delivery of gene therapy-based approaches.","['Indraccolo, S', 'Minuzzo, S', 'Feroli, F', 'Mammano, F', 'Calderazzo, F', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L', 'Amadori, A']","['Indraccolo S', 'Minuzzo S', 'Feroli F', 'Mammano F', 'Calderazzo F', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Amadori A']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Targeting', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Macaca', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', '*Simian Immunodeficiency Virus', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Viral Envelope Proteins']",1998/05/14 00:00,1998/05/14 00:01,['1998/05/14 00:00'],"['1998/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300603 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1998 Feb;5(2):209-17. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300603.,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that elevation of intracellular cAMP could protect HL-60 cells from NO- or NO plus PMA-induced DNA damage. Exposure of cells to sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 0.5 to 4 mM), a NO-generating agent, induced apoptotic cell death as monitored by morphological means, gel electrophoresis, and in situ TdT-apoptosis assay. However, concomitant incubation of the cells with DB-cAMP markedly inhibited SNP-induced apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained with other commonly used cAMP analogs such as CPT-cAMP and 8-C1-cAMP and the intracellular cAMP-elevating agent such as forskolin. In contrast, pretreatment of HL-60 cells with H89 or KT5720, which are known to inhibit cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), abolished the protective effect of cAMP analogs and forskolin on SNP-induced apoptosis. Synergism between SNP and phorbol ester to induce apoptosis was also inhibited by prior treatment of HL-60 cells with DB-cAMP or forskolin. The effect of DB-cAMP in maintaining cell viability was not associated with the onset of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. In addition, neither dimethyl sulfoxide nor retinoic acid (which produce granulocyte differentiation) could produce cAMP effect. Under the same conditions, DB-cAMP also inhibited NO- or NO plus phorbol ester-induced apoptosis in another transformed cell line, U-937 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that exposure of HL-60 cells to cAMP analogs renders them more resistant to NO-induced DNA damage and further suggest the existence of specific down-modulatory mechanisms related to NO-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation.","['Jun, C D', 'Pae, H O', 'Yoo, J C', 'Kwak, H J', 'Park, R K', 'Chung, H T']","['Jun CD', 'Pae HO', 'Yoo JC', 'Kwak HJ', 'Park RK', 'Chung HT']","['Department of Microbiology and Immununology, Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Iksan, Chonbuk, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Nitric Oxide/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Nitroprusside/pharmacology', 'Nitroso Compounds/pharmacology', 'Penicillamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine', 'S-Nitrosoglutathione', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/14 00:00,1998/05/14 00:01,['1998/05/14 00:00'],"['1998/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-8749(97)91232-6 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1997.1232 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1998 Jan 10;183(1):13-21. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1997.1232.,"['0 (Nitroso Compounds)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '57564-91-7 (S-Nitrosoglutathione)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '79032-48-7 (S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compactin, farnesyldiphosphate and cholesterol were cytotoxic by the induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death, PCD). Compactin doubled the number of apoptotic cells compared to control numbers, whereas farnesyldiphosphate and cholesterol led to a fivefold increase in PCD over the control levels. At variance with cholesterol, cholesterol esters did not affect K562 cell viability and apoptotic body formation, regardless of chain length and degree of saturation. Compactin and farnesyldiphosphate reduced the membrane cholesterol content, thus increasing membrane fluidity. Conversely, cholesterol treatment reduced the membrane fluidity by increasing cholesterol content in the lipid bilayer. Unlike farnesyldiphosphate, the other cholesterol precursors and cholesterol esters were ineffective in increasing the cholesterol content and, thereby, the fluidity of cell membranes. Compactin and cholesterol precursors, apart from farnesyldiphosphate, did not affect the amount of the farnesylated proteins Ras and lamin B in the cytosolic and the membrane fractions of K562 cell extracts, whereas farnesyldiphosphate reduced the content of both proteins in both fractions. The level of lamin B in K562 cytosol and membranes was also reduced by cholesterol treatment, which did not significantly affect the amount of Ras.

Here we show that exogenous administration of these factors selectively regulates neuropeptide phenotype in intact sensory neurons in a manner consistent with their role as injury-induced factors. Intraneural injection of leukemia inhibitory factor into the intact sciatic nerve of adult rats induces a significant increase in the percentage of neuronal profiles immunoreactive for galanin in the L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia without altering the percentage profiles immunoreactive for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or neuropeptide Y. Galanin-immunoreactivity was predominantly confined to those neurons which retrogradely transported and accumulated leukemia inhibitory factor. The up-regulation of galanin-immunoreactivity observed in L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia following unilateral axotomy of the sciatic nerve was significantly reduced following continuous treatment for two weeks with a monoclonal antibody against the gp130 receptor motif. Intraneural injection of interleukin-6 into the intact sciatic nerve also significantly increased the percentage of neuronal profiles which displayed galanin-immunoreactivity but not vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or neuropeptide Y-immunoreactivity. Our results indicate that cytokines which interact with the gp130 receptor at the site of peripheral nerve injury contribute to the cell body response to axotomy.

The potent donor cell-mediated cytolysis following DLI may lead to a short period of aplasia before the re-establishment of donor haematopoiesis. The absence of detectable donor cells in patients prior to DLI infusion may result in permanent aplasia in certain patients. We report on four patients who relapsed 1, 3, 6.5 and 7 years post-BMT for chronic phase CML and were treated with DLI from their original BMT donor. Polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs) were used to assess haematological chimaerism both prior to and following DLI. At the time of relapse, STR-PCR indicated the presence of donor cells in all four patients, at levels ranging from 1-40%. A clinical and molecular response was seen in 4/4 patients following a short period of cytopenia and all patients remain in clinical remission with a follow-up of 2 months-3 years post-DLI. STR-PCR indicated that a response was occurring during the period of pancytopenia when metaphase analysis was unsuccessful. Lineage-specific analysis of the cellular response to DLI was monitored using STR-PCR of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) lymphocyte-enriched fractions and CD2-positive and -negative T cell fractions. In one patient BM and PB CD34-positive and -negative fractions were also assessed. A change in the ratio of donor:recipient cells in the PB lymphocyte fraction was the earliest molecular indication of an anti-leukaemic response. Subsequent conversion to donor chimaerism occurred in the other lineages and the granulocyte fraction was the last lineage to convert. In conclusion, lineage-specific STR-PCR permits detailed monitoring of subtle changes in donor/recipient cell dynamics in specific lineages following DLI during the crucial pancytopenic phase and may be a useful predictor of haematological response to DLI therapy.","['Gardiner, N', 'Lawler, M', ""O'Riordan, J M"", 'Duggan, C', 'De Arce, M', 'McCann, S R']","['Gardiner N', 'Lawler M', ""O'Riordan JM"", 'Duggan C', 'De Arce M', 'McCann SR']","['Department of Haematology, St James Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', '*Cell Lineage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/05/13 00:00,1998/05/13 00:01,['1998/05/13 00:00'],"['1998/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701154 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Apr;21(7):711-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial reports of high incidence of graft rejection after TCD BMT led to a move away from this approach but improved conditioning regimens have reduced this risk substantially. The use of TCD has also been associated with higher relapse risk post-BMT although the success of donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) as treatment for relapse has reduced this problem, especially in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Currently the use of TCD BMT is increasing particularly due to the relative increase in BMT from non-related donors for whom TCD is the optimal GVHD prophylaxis. However, doubts remain over the long-term effect on the reconstituted immune system of recipients of TCD BMT, particularly in adult recipients. In this study we have undertaken a detailed sequential analysis in 23 patients who received allo-grafts from HLA-identical sibling donors after high-dose chemo/radiotherapy for acute or chronic leukaemia. Of these patients, 11 received non-manipulated grafts, five received 'partially TCD' (PTCD) and a further seven received 'fully TCD' (FTCD) bone marrow. T cell depletion was performed ex vivo by Campath-1M plus autologous serum as a source of complement. Partial TCD describes grafts with a T cell reduction of 1-2 log. Full TCD refers to grafts with a reduction of >2.5 log. The decision regarding the optimal degree of TCD was clinical and was based upon the perceived relative risk of relapse based upon the disease and remission status. All patients were monitored for up to 12 months post-BMT with regard to reconstitution of T and NK cell subsets. T cell depletion at either level was associated with a slower recovery of CD4 cells. This was most marked in the FTCD recipients and lasted throughout the period of study. CD8 cell recovery was also slower in the TCD recipients but this normalised throughout the 12 months post-BMT. The ratio of CD45RA+:CD45RO+ increased in all recipients after month 3. This suggests that a degree of extra-thymic T cell maturation can occur in recipients of allogeneic BMT. NK cell recovery was more rapid in the TCD recipients and these differences were maintained throughout the first year.","['Lowdell, M W', 'Craston, R', 'Ray, N', 'Koh, M', 'Galatowicz, G', 'Prentice, H G']","['Lowdell MW', 'Craston R', 'Ray N', 'Koh M', 'Galatowicz G', 'Prentice HG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunity', 'Leukemia/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/05/13 00:00,1998/05/13 00:01,['1998/05/13 00:00'],"['1998/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701153 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Apr;21(7):679-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701153.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Although not significant, cancer history in parents was found to be associated with an elevated risk of infant leukemia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-3.6), predominantly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (OR = 2.2, CI = 0.6-9.0). Cancer history among second-degree relatives was also related to a nonsignificantly elevated risk of AML. Family history of autoimmune diseases, on the other hand, was generally not found to be related to the risk of infant leukemia.

Epstein-Barr virus mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization in three cases. Although the degree of apoptosis varied, apoptotic cells were detected in all cases by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling. We conclude that CD8+ PTCLs are relatively rare, often involve extranodal sites, have an aggressive clinical course, and are often associated with Epstein-Barr virus. Compared with ALCLs, which have recently been considered as neoplasms of cytotoxic T-cells, we think that CD8+ PTCLs are more lineage-specific neoplasms of mature, cytotoxic, T lymphocytes.","['Yamashita, Y', 'Yatabe, Y', 'Tsuzuki, T', 'Nakayama, A', 'Hasegawa, Y', 'Kojima, H', 'Nagasawa, T', 'Mori, N']","['Yamashita Y', 'Yatabe Y', 'Tsuzuki T', 'Nakayama A', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Kojima H', 'Nagasawa T', 'Mori N']","['First Department of Pathology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan. k46581anucc.cc.nagoya-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/cytology/virology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Granzymes', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*chemistry/genetics/virology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/analysis/genetics', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*analysis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*chemistry/metabolism/virology']",1998/05/13 00:00,1998/05/13 00:01,['1998/05/13 00:00'],"['1998/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1998 Apr;11(4):313-23.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its medical use is recent and has been supported both by numerous technical improvements and the discovery of new human viruses. This is illustrated by the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, HIV-2, human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I/II, and human herpesviruses (HHV) 6, 7 and 8. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) gave a major boost to an extended use of molecular biology techniques. This resulted in a better knowledge of human viral infections as illustrated by studies on HIV and HHV-8. New viruses have been characterized. Molecular markers have permitted analysis of virus transmission cases, classification of genetic variants and detection of mixed infections. The quantitation of viral load has led to a better understanding of chronic infections and reactivations. As a tool for diagnosis, molecular biology is not yet considered as a universal alternative to classical procedures such as serology and antigen detection. However, major improvements in molecular biology techniques might question current diagnosis strategies in the very near future.","['Agut, H']",['Agut H'],"['Laboratoire de virologie du Cervi, groupe hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, France.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Transfus Clin Biol,Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine,9423846,IM,"['HIV/isolation & purification', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*diagnosis', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Molecular Biology/*methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Infections/*diagnosis', 'Viral Load']",1998/05/13 00:00,1998/05/13 00:01,['1998/05/13 00:00'],"['1998/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1246782098801092 [pii]', '10.1016/s1246-7820(98)80109-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Clin Biol. 1998 Feb;5(1):39-46. doi: 10.1016/s1246-7820(98)80109-2.,,,,Interet de la biologie moleculaire dans les infections par les retrovirus et les herpesvirus.,23,,,,,,,,,,,

The linkage is used to estimate cumulative and average annualized magnetic field exposure for a case-control study. On-site electromagnetic field monitoring data for 1,966 volunteer utility employees, at 59 sites in the United States and three other countries, were obtained from a large project (the EMDEX project) designed to collect, analyze, and document 60-Hz electric and magnetic field exposures for a diverse population. These data represent 9 primary work environments, and 16 job classification categories, amounting to 144 unique job categories which were consolidated using the job-exposure matrix presented into 282 three-digit Dictionary of Occupational Title (DOT) codes. The DOT code categories were then linked to lifetime occupational histories from a case-control study of leukemia. The method may be extended to link additional job titles with monitoring information. Job titles linked with electromagnetic field monitoring information provide more specific estimates of exposure intensity than previous ordinal estimates of exposure. Therefore, estimates of cumulative electromagnetic field exposure are achievable, as well as high and low level exposure estimates.","['Burau, K D', 'Huang, B', 'Whitehead, L W', 'Delclos, G M', 'Downs, T D']","['Burau KD', 'Huang B', 'Whitehead LW', 'Delclos GM', 'Downs TD']","['School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston 77030, USA. kburau@utsph.sph.uth.tmc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Expo Anal Environ Epidemiol,Journal of exposure analysis and environmental epidemiology,9111438,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', '*Databases, Factual', '*Electromagnetic Fields', '*Environmental Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Job Description', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1998/05/13 00:00,1998/05/13 00:01,['1998/05/13 00:00'],"['1998/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Expo Anal Environ Epidemiol. 1998 Apr-Jun;8(2):231-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 12 Spanish children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were studied, 11 of them newly diagnosed and 1 relapsed. The patients were between 18 months and 10 years old. Bone marrow aspiration was collected between april and december 1996, RNA was isolated and cDNA was subjected to PCR amplification for TEL/AML1, E2A/PBX1 and BCR/ABL genes. Normal ABL and E2A genes were studied as amplification controls. RESULTS: One of these hybrid genes was found in 33.3% of patients studied. TEL/AML1 in two cases (16.6%), E2A/PBX1 in one case (8.3%) and BCR/ABL in another one (8.3%). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these data it would be useful to achieve a molecular screening of TEL/AML1, E2A/PBX1 and BCR/ABL genes in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for allowing a molecular classification in a great percentage of patients that exceed the BCR/ABL positivity in adults.","['Anguita, E', 'Gonzalez, F A', 'Contra, T', 'Martin, N', 'Valverde, F', 'Villegas, A']","['Anguita E', 'Gonzalez FA', 'Contra T', 'Martin N', 'Valverde F', 'Villegas A']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario San Carlos de Madrid.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",1998/05/13 00:00,1998/05/13 00:01,['1998/05/13 00:00'],"['1998/05/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/13 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1998 Feb;43(1):7-11.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,Utilidad de un screening molecular en las leucemias linfoblasticas pediatricas.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This multilineage involvement suggests the malignant transformation of a primitive hematopoietic stem cell. In this disorder, the 8p11-12 region is associated with three different partners 6q27, 9q33, and 13q12. We describe here the molecular characterization of the t(8;13) translocation that involves the FGFR1 gene from 8p12, encoding a tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the fibroblast growth factor family, and a gene from 13q12, tentatively named FIM (Fused In Myeloproliferative disorders). FIM is related to DXS6673E, a candidate gene for X-linked mental retardation in Xq13.1; this defines a gene family involved in different human pathologies. The two reciprocal fusion transcripts, FIM/FGFR1 and FGFR1/FIM are expressed in the malignant cells. The FIM/FGFR1 fusion protein contains the FIM putative zinc finger motifs and the catalytic domain of FGFR1. We show that it has a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity.","['Popovici, C', 'Adelaide, J', 'Ollendorff, V', 'Chaffanet, M', 'Guasch, G', 'Jacrot, M', 'Leroux, D', 'Birnbaum, D', 'Pebusque, M J']","['Popovici C', 'Adelaide J', 'Ollendorff V', 'Chaffanet M', 'Guasch G', 'Jacrot M', 'Leroux D', 'Birnbaum D', 'Pebusque MJ']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Unite 119, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Institut de Cancerologie et Immunologie, 232 Boulevard Sainte-Marguerite, 13009 Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Catalysis', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Introns', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Plant Proteins/*genetics', '*Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",1998/05/20 00:00,1998/05/20 00:01,['1998/05/20 00:00'],"['1998/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.10.5712 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 May 12;95(10):5712-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.10.5712.,"['0 (FIM protein, Antirrhinum majus)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Fgfr1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",,,,,['GENBANK/Y13472'],,PMC20444,,,,,,,,

We have examined the effect of PMA and hemin on the expression of the Kell blood group and CD10 antigens, two related proteins that belong to a family of membrane-bound neutral metalloendopeptidases. We show here that differentiation of K562 cells by PMA in the megakaryocytic lineage results in abolishment of Kell mRNA accumulation and protein expression and, in parallel, the induction of CD10 mRNA accumulation, protein expression, and enzymatic activity. Conversely, differentiation of these cells by hemin in the erythroid lineage is accompanied by an up-regulation of Kell mRNA and protein expression, with no changes in CD10 mRNA and protein expression.

MRC Working Party on Leukaemia in Adults.,195-202,"Plateau phase has been achieved in 64% of all newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma treated with the ABCM (adriamycin, BiCNU, cyclophosphamide and melphalan) regimen in the Medical Research Council (MRC) trials; this stable clinical stage of the disease is associated with no more than minimal symptoms. Several studies have found that alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) maintenance therapy increases the duration of plateau phase, but it is less clear if this translates into prolonged survival. We report the effect of alpha-IFN on the duration of plateau phase and overall survival in a trial with 284 patients who were randomized to receive alpha2b-IFN (Intron-A) or no maintenance therapy during first plateau phase. The minimum follow-up after randomization was 21 months. There was no significant difference in the overall survival between the two treatment groups (X2=0.32, P=0.57). There was a trend towards longer relapse-free survival in the patients allocated alpha-IFN, but this trend to longer plateau phase was not statistically significant (X2 = 1.62, P = 0.2). Disease progression at relapse on alpha-IFN appears to be more severe with greater elevations from plateau levels of serum paraprotein (P = 0.06) and beta2-microglobulin (P= 0.03) levels. Physicians tended to start chemotherapy sooner after diagnosis of relapse when patients had received alpha-IFN (P = 0.16). Although, in common with most other studies, there is a trend for patients treated with alpha-IFN to have a longer plateau phase, this is counteracted by morbidity attributable to the treatment and a somewhat shortened survival post relapse. Meta-analysis of interferon trials is required to assess whether the minor trend for longer survival in patients maintained on alpha-IFN found in some studies is significant and, if so, the extent of this advantage.","['Drayson, M T', 'Chapman, C E', 'Dunn, J A', 'Olujohungbe, A B', 'Maclennan, I C']","['Drayson MT', 'Chapman CE', 'Dunn JA', 'Olujohungbe AB', 'Maclennan IC']","['Department of Immunology, University of Birmingham Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",1998/05/12 00:00,1998/05/12 00:01,['1998/05/12 00:00'],"['1998/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00648.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Apr;101(1):195-202. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00648.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine patients relapsed and MRD had been detected in six of them, 5-15 weeks before relapse despite morphological complete remission. 43 patients remain in clinical remission and in none of these was MRD detected. Disease-free survival based on the detection of MRD by flow cytometry showed a statistically significant difference between both groups (P<0.0001). The absence of MRD correlates with a low relapse rate, whereas the presence of MRD predicted early relapse. This study has shown that flow cytometry can improve the morphologic assessment of bone marrow (BM) remission status in B-lineage ALL. The finding of < 5% blasts in BM aspirates did not correlate with 'true' remission in a proportion of cases as residual leukaemic blasts were detected by flow cytometry in nine samples from six patients. On the other hand, the presence of > 5% blasts assessed by morphology was not necessarily a feature of relapse in five patients as these cells were shown to have a phenotype identical to normal TdT-negative B-cell precursors. Quantitative flow cytometry was more informative than conventional morphology to assess remission status and showed a strong correlation with clinical outcome. This methodology is useful to define MRD in the majority of patients with B-lineage ALL and should be tested in prospective clinical trials.","['Farahat, N', 'Morilla, A', 'Owusu-Ankomah, K', 'Morilla, R', 'Pinkerton, C R', 'Treleaven, J G', 'Matutes, E', 'Powles, R L', 'Catovsky, D']","['Farahat N', 'Morilla A', 'Owusu-Ankomah K', 'Morilla R', 'Pinkerton CR', 'Treleaven JG', 'Matutes E', 'Powles RL', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden NHS Trust and Institute of Cancer Research, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/05/12 00:00,1998/05/12 00:01,['1998/05/12 00:00'],"['1998/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00675.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Apr;101(1):158-64. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00675.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary AML blasts were resistant to IL-2-activated PBMC effectors generated from normal individuals, allogeneic and autologous patients in five, six and eight of the 10 AML samples tested, respectively, IL-12 alone proved ineffective in generating anti-leukaemic activity, whereas, in combination, the two cytokines induced anti-leukaemic killing in all five cases resistant to normal PBMC, in 4/6 samples resistant to allogeneic AML effectors and in 5/8 cases resistant to autologous effectors. In each case the lytic effect was maintained at the lowest cytokine combination (10 + 10 IU/ml) utilized. The suggestion of a synergistic effect was further strengthened by the evidence that at the lowest doses of IL-2 and IL-12 the degree of killing was greater than that promoted by each cytokine independently. The results of this study suggest that two major limitations associated with the administration of IL-2 to AML patients, the resistance of the blasts to IL-2-generated killing and the toxicity associated with high-dose IL-2, may be overcome by the combined use of very low doses of IL-2 and IL-12. As IL-2-resistant blasts may be lysed by a low-dose combination of IL-2/IL-12, feasibility studies with this cytokine combination are worthy of exploration in vivo.","['Vitale, A', 'Guarini, A', 'Latagliata, R', 'Cignetti, A', 'Foa, R']","['Vitale A', 'Guarini A', 'Latagliata R', 'Cignetti A', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/*administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1998/05/12 00:00,1998/05/12 00:01,['1998/05/12 00:00'],"['1998/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00645.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Apr;101(1):150-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00645.x.,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Truncation mutations were detected in a minor percentage of transcripts from two other patients. In one patient the mutation has been constant at a low level (5-10% of total mRNA and 2/40 myeloid colonies) for 2 years. In the other patient the mutation was acquired, remained present at low levels for nearly 3 years and then spontaneously disappeared. Both patients had polyclonal haemopoiesis. We hypothesize that these mutations do not cause SCN, are randomly acquired with the mutant clone being expanded to detectable levels by high levels of exogenous or endogenous G-CSF, and may disappear by clonal succession.

Patients received four courses of intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy, with or without subsequent autologous (A-BMT) or allogeneic (allo-BMT) bone marrow transplant. There were randomized comparisons of thioguanine versus etoposide in induction and of A-BMT versus not. Allo-BMT was recommended for patients with a HLA-matched sibling and was evaluated by donor versus no donor comparison. The complete remission rate was 92%. In first remission there were 20 deaths during consolidation chemotherapy and 11 after BMT (8/61 allo-BMTs. 1/60 A-BMTs and 2/4 matched unrelated donor transplants). The relapse rate was low, decreasing from 26% in the first year to 2% in the fourth. Long-term outcome was excellent with survival at 7 years from entry of 56% and event-free survival of 48%. There were no significant differences between thioguanine and etoposide, whereas both A-BMT and allo-BMT reduced relapse risk but did not produce a significant survival benefit. It appears that over half the children entered into AML 10 are cured, a result which compares favourably with other reported series. We conclude that four courses of intensive chemotherapy are an effective approach to the treatment of paediatric AML, which avoids the acute toxicity and long-term side-effects of BMT and also avoids the need for prolonged maintenance therapy or cranial irradiation.","['Stevens, R F', 'Hann, I M', 'Wheatley, K', 'Gray, R G']","['Stevens RF', 'Hann IM', 'Wheatley K', 'Gray RG']","[""Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Patient Compliance', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioguanine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/05/12 00:00,1998/05/12 00:01,['1998/05/12 00:00'],"['1998/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00677.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Apr;101(1):130-40. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00677.x.,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular analysis revealed that 55.6+/-9% SD of CD 34+ DR- colonies, in which actin and ABL mRNA were detectable, expressed the product of the BCR-ABL gene. The percentage and the clonogenic efficiency of CML DR- cells were significantly lower than those of comparable DR- cells from normal donors. However, clonogenic assays using recombinant human CSFs demonstrated a remarkable proliferation of CML cells when stimulated by SCF, IL-11 and IL-3, used as single factors in the presence of erythropoietin (EPO) and was almost entirely due to erythroid progenitors. Conversely, optimal stimulation of CD34 +DR- cells from normal donors required co-incubation with three or more CSFs. Stroma-noncontact long-term cultures were then established in the presence of exogenous CSFs and human irradiated allogeneic stromal layers or the murine stromal cell line M2-10B4, engineered to produce G-CSF and IL-3. In these cultures the combination of SCF and IL-3 induced a 25.4 +/- 5 SD, 40 +/- 6 SD and 20.5 +/- 6 SD fold increase of colony-forming unit cells (CFU-C), at weeks 2, 4 and 5, respectively. At the same time-points the number of primitive long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-IC) showed a 4 +/- 2 SD, 3.3 +/- 1.5 SD and 2.3 +/-1 SD fold increase compared to baseline values. BCR-ABL mRNA analysis of single colonies demonstrated that 27 +/- 9% SD and 7 +/- 3% SD CFU-C at weeks 4 and 5, respectively, expressed the fusion gene, whereas leukaemic LTC-IC disappeared from the culture by week 2. These results suggest that leukaemic CD34+ DR- cells have a different pattern of response to CSFs than normal cells. In addition, we established culture conditions which allow selective expansion of benign haemopoietic cells coexisting with leukaemic progenitors.","['Fogli, M', 'Amabile, M', 'Martinelli, G', 'Fortuna, A', 'Rondelli, D', 'Ratta, M', 'Curti, A', 'Tura, S', 'Lemoli, R M']","['Fogli M', 'Amabile M', 'Martinelli G', 'Fortuna A', 'Rondelli D', 'Ratta M', 'Curti A', 'Tura S', 'Lemoli RM']","['Institute of Haematology and Medical Oncology Seragnoli, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/metabolism/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1998/05/12 00:00,1998/05/12 00:01,['1998/05/12 00:00'],"['1998/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00659.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Apr;101(1):119-29. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00659.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chronic phase varied widely, with a median duration of 17 months (range 3-90 months). All patients were treated with intensive conventional chemotherapy regimens and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhuG-CSF, lenograstim). Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) were harvested by leukaphereses during early recovery from chemotherapy-induced aplasia. A total of 119 leukaphereses were performed. Median numbers of CD34+ cells and CFU-GM collected were 2.04 x 10(6)/kg and 2 9 x 10(4)/kg, respectively. There was a significant correlation between white cell count and number of CD34+ cells in the leukaphereses (P = 0.0001, r2 = 0.41, n = 104). A strict correlation between the number of CD34+ cells and CFU-GM in the leukapheretic product (P = 0.0001, r2 = 0.39, n = 110) was observed. 21% of evaluable patients (6/29) achieved a complete cytogenetic remission in the leukapheretic product and the other four patients achieved a major cytogenetic response for an overall response of 35% (10/22 patients). To date, 16 patients have been autografted and are alive. Five of them are Ph1-negative (three patients) or partially Ph1-negative (two patients). In conclusion, despite the high-risk characteristics of this study population, Ph1-negative PBPC were successfully mobilized in more than one-quarter of patients using a chemotherapy plus rhuG-CSF regimen. The importance of this achievement is increased by the current lack of other practical methods of rescuing Ph-negative cells in such patients.","['Carella, A M', 'Simonsson, B', 'Link, H', 'Lennard, A', 'Boogaerts, M', 'Gorin, N C', 'Tomas-Martinez, J F', 'Dabouz-Harrouche, F', 'Gautier, L', 'Badri, N']","['Carella AM', 'Simonsson B', 'Link H', 'Lennard A', 'Boogaerts M', 'Gorin NC', 'Tomas-Martinez JF', 'Dabouz-Harrouche F', 'Gautier L', 'Badri N']","['Haematology/Autografting Unit Azienda Ospedaliera e Cliniche Universitarie Convenzionate, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Lenograstim', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/05/12 00:00,1998/05/12 00:01,['1998/05/12 00:00'],"['1998/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00670.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Apr;101(1):111-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00670.x.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Medical Research Council Working Party on Childhood Leukaemia.,94-103,"We examined the outcome of the 489 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who relapsed in the UKALL X trial, and produced graphical displays of adjusted comparisons of event-free survival (EFS) for chemotherapy versus bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from a sibling or volunteer unrelated donor, and autologous BMT (ABMT). EFS at 5 years was only 3% (95% CI 0-6%) for children who relapsed in the bone marrow (BM) within 2 years of diagnosis, irrespective of type of post-relapse treatment, whereas for those with late extramedullary relapse it was 66% (95% CI 48-85%). Comparison of the types of treatment did not show benefit for ABMT. For allogeneic BMT the overall reduction in the odds of an event was 26% (95% CI 1-51%) (2P= 0.05), resulting in an absolute increase in 5-year event-free survival of 14% (from 26.4% to 40.7%). New approaches are needed for children with early BM relapses whose prognosis is virtually hopeless with current therapy; however, a conventional chemotherapy approach may be justifiable for late extramedullary relapses. For the remaining patients (71%), with later BM or early extramedullary relapses, the optimal treatment is still not clear. This uncertainty warrants a formal randomized comparison of BMT and chemotherapy, to avoid the biases due to unmeasurable selection factors.","['Wheeler, K', 'Richards, S', 'Bailey, C', 'Chessells, J']","['Wheeler K', 'Richards S', 'Bailey C', 'Chessells J']","['Department of Paediatrics, Oxford Radcliffe Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Failure']",1998/05/12 00:00,1998/05/12 00:01,['1998/05/12 00:00'],"['1998/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00676.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Apr;101(1):94-103. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00676.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A soluble form of the LIF-R alpha, called LIF binding protein (LBP) has been isolated from mouse serum. LIF and OSM stimulate proteoglycan (PG) release and inhibit PG synthesis in cultured pig articular cartilage explants. The aim of this study was to determine whether LBP can block PG resorption and or reverse the inhibition of PG synthesis induced by LIF and OSM. In cultured pig cartilage explants LBP was found to dose dependently inhibit LIF stimulated release of PGs and reverse the suppression of PG synthesis. LBP was found to substantially attenuate the effects of LIF. In contrast only partial inhibition of the stimulatory effect of OSM was observed at the highest concentration of LBP available. At maximal concentrations, LBP produced minimal reversal of OSM mediated inhibition of PG synthesis. When tested in combination LIF and OSM had no additive effects on PG metabolism, but the combination of LIF and IL-1 and also OSM and IL-1 did show additive effects in respect to stimulation of PG catabolism and inhibition of PG synthesis. These effects were significantly greater than those observed for LIF, OSM and IL-1 alone. The results suggest that pig articular chondrocytes possess the LIF/OSM receptor, but possibly not an independent OSM receptor. The actions of mLBP indicate that rhLBP could be a clinically useful antagonist for LIF and perhaps OSM.","['Hui, W', 'Bell, M C', 'Carroll, G J', 'Layton, M J']","['Hui W', 'Bell MC', 'Carroll GJ', 'Layton MJ']","['Department of Rheumatology, Royal Perth Hospital, Western Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Animals', 'Cartilage, Articular/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Proteoglycans/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Swine']",1998/05/12 00:00,1998/05/12 00:01,['1998/05/12 00:00'],"['1998/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(97)90279-9 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1997.0279 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1998 Mar;10(3):220-6. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1997.0279.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased relapse risk in patients treated with ciprofloxacin for gut decontamination.,84-92,"Three hundred and six patients with low- and intermediate-risk leukaemias undergoing allogeneic BMT between 1980 and March 1996 were studied regarding transplantation-related mortality (TRM), relapse, and leukaemia-free survival (LFS). Among the patients were 262 recipients of marrow from HLA-identical siblings and 44 patients receiving marrow from HLA-A, -B, and -DR identical unrelated donors. Between 1986 and 1993, 153 adult patients received ciprofloxacin continuously during Cy conditioning, but since November 1993 ciprofloxacin has not been given until after Cy treatment. TRM at 5 yr showed an incidence of 30%. Significant risk factors in Cox regression multivariate analysis comprised acute GVHD grades II-IV (p < 0.0001), seropositivity for 3-4 herpes viruses prior to BMT (p = 0.002), intermediate risk disease (p = 0.008), female donor to male recipient (p = 0.015), and a donor age over 17 yr (p = 0.025). The risk of relapse was studied from 90 d after BMT, and the overall 5-yr incidence was 32%. Significant risk factors comprised acute leukaemia, as compared to CML (p = 0.003), total body irradiation (TBI) compared to busulphan treatment (p = 0.011), gram-negative prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin during cyclophosphamide (Cy) conditioning (p = 0.024), GVHD prophylaxis using a combination of methotrexate (MTX) and cyclosporine (CSA), compared to monotherapy (p = 0.037) and absence of chronic GVHD (p = 0.050). The 5-yr probability of relapse in patients receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis during Cy conditioning was 40%, compared to 24% in patients not receiving this treatment (p = 0.01). Overall, LFS at 5 yr was 49%. LFS was evaluated from day 30 after BMT until relapse or death of the patient. We found no difference in TRM, relapse or LFS between recipients of HLA-identical sibling or unrelated bone marrow, risk factors significantly associated with an inferior LFS included acute GVHD grades II-IV (p = 0.0002), intermediate risk disease (p = 0.003), donor seropositivity for 3-4 herpes viruses (p = 0.046), and TBI conditioning (p = 0.048).","['Carlens, S', 'Ringden, O', 'Aschan, J', 'Hagglund, H', 'Ljungman, P', 'Mattsson, J', 'Remberger, M']","['Carlens S', 'Ringden O', 'Aschan J', 'Hagglund H', 'Ljungman P', 'Mattsson J', 'Remberger M']","['Department of Transplantation Surgery, Huddinge University Hospital, Karolinska Institute, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Ciprofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/epidemiology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",1998/05/12 00:00,1998/05/12 00:01,['1998/05/12 00:00'],"['1998/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Transplant. 1998 Apr;12(2):84-92.,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we clarified this point through genomic and biochemical analysis: 1) 5'-UT and genomic sequences represented the prokaryote promoter and ribosomal binding site; 2) the TGA codons in M161Ag cDNA were translated not into selenocysteines but into tryptophans; 3) M161Ag anchored onto the membrane secondary to its N-terminal palmitoylation like prokaryote lipoproteins; 4) genomic and cDNA clones of M161Ag were highly homologous to Mycoplasma fermentans gene encoding P48, a monocytic differentiation/activation factor, recently released in the data base, although the resultant proteins were different in the amino acid sequences. Additionally, purified soluble M161Ag efficiently provoked IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-6 like P48, and further IL-10 and IL-12 in human peripheral blood monocytes. Thus, M161Ag originates from M. fermentans, and latently infected M. fermentans allows human cells to produce M161Ag. The liberated protein serves as a potent modulator of innate and cellular immune responses via its complement-activating and cytokine-producing activities.","['Matsumoto, M', 'Nishiguchi, M', 'Kikkawa, S', 'Nishimura, H', 'Nagasawa, S', 'Seya, T']","['Matsumoto M', 'Nishiguchi M', 'Kikkawa S', 'Nishimura H', 'Nagasawa S', 'Seya T']","['Department of Immunology, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases, Higashinari-ku, Osaka 537, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement Pathway, Alternative', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Mycoplasma fermentans/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.20.12407 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)84277-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 May 15;273(20):12407-14. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.20.12407.,"['0 (M161 antigen)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,['GENBANK/AB026157'],,,,,,,,,,

The French-American-British (FAB) Cooperative Group proposed a classification based on easily obtainable laboratory information. In spite of some limitations, the FAB criteria have been useful for a long time. Currently, the recognition of other distinct morphological MDS subgroups such as hypocellular MDS and MDS with myelofibrosis, the increasing incidence of MDS in children as well as that of therapy-related MDS, and the finding of specific chromosomal alterations associated with different morphological features, reveal the insufficiency of this classification. The aim of the present review is to examine some new aspects of the diagnosis, classification, and cytogenetics of MDS. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The authors of this review have been actively working and contributing original papers on MDS for the last 15 years. They also organized or participated in the Fourth International Symposium on MDS (Barcelona, April 24-27, 1997). In addition, the present review critically examines relevant articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. STATE OF THE ART AND PERSPECTIVES: Most of investigators working on MDS tend to integrate morphology and cytogenetics in the diagnosis and classification of these disorders. FAB criteria remain useful particularly for patients with not available cytogenetic study. Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia should be considered as a new MDS subtype. Some authors propose considering all patients with more than 20% of blast cells in peripheral blood or bone marrow as having acute leukemia. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with myeloproliferative features may be included among chronic myeloproliferative disorders. MDS with myelofibrosis is recognized as a new MDS subtype. Therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) should be classified according to the involved agents. Finally, besides including chromosomal abnormalities in the diagnosis (e.g., RAEB with trisomy 8), several cytogenetic abnormalities such as deletion 5q and deletion 17q, associated to specific clinical-morphological features, should be of help to identify new MDS syndromes.","['Vallespi, T', 'Imbert, M', 'Mecucci, C', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Fenaux, P']","['Vallespi T', 'Imbert M', 'Mecucci C', 'Preudhomme C', 'Fenaux P']","[""Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['*Cytogenetics', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/*diagnosis/genetics']",1998/05/09 00:00,1998/05/09 00:01,['1998/05/09 00:00'],"['1998/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Mar;83(3):258-75.,,,,,160,,,,,,,,,,,

However, if a CML patient has an HLA-identical sibling, bone marrow transplant (BMT) represents the best choice of treatment. Since IFN-alpha is known to modify the immunologic response and to increase marrow fibrosis, information is needed on the outcome of patients transplanted after IFN-alpha treatment. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively 32 Ph+ CML patients submitted to BMT in the last 6 years in Institute ""Seragnoli"". All the patients were in 1st chronic phase, their median age was 37 years, the donors were HLA-identical (27/32) or 1 Ag-mismatched (5/32) siblings. Big BuCy was the conditioning regimen employed for all and GVHD prophylaxis was based on CsA in 4 patients and Csa+MTX in 28 patients; all patients received homogeneous pre and post-transplant supportive care, antimicrobial and antiviral prophylaxis. These patients were divided into 2 groups according to the treatment before BMT: 16 received IFN from diagnosis to BMT (mean dose 6.9 MU/daily) for at least 6 mos (mean 23 mos, range 8-75) and 16 received chemotherapy alone (hydroxyurea [HU]). RESULTS: Hematological recovery was comparable in the two groups: time to 0.5 x 10(9)/L PMN was 20.5 days (range 11-32) in the IFN group and 20 days (range 10-32) in the HU group; time to 50 x 10(9)/L platelets was 28 days (range 20-117) in the IFN group and 27 days (range 20-112) in the HU group. The incidence of acute GVHD was not different in the two groups for any grade of the disease; in patients who survived more than 100 days, chronic GVHD occurred in the two groups with the same frequency. Seven patients died of transplant related mortality (TRM), 4 in the IFN group and 3 in the HU group. Hematological relapse was observed in only one case in the HU group; no cytogenetic relapse occurred. Disease free survivals at 7 years are 61% and 72%, respectively; the difference is not significant. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the low number of patients included in this study, the data reported here confirm that prior treatment with alpha-IFN does not adversely affect transplant outcome.","['Zuffa, E', 'Bandini, G', 'Bonini, A', 'Santucci, M A', 'Martinelli, G', 'Rosti, G', 'Testoni, N', 'Zaccaria, A', 'Tura, S']","['Zuffa E', 'Bandini G', 'Bonini A', 'Santucci MA', 'Martinelli G', 'Rosti G', 'Testoni N', 'Zaccaria A', 'Tura S']","['Hematology Unit, S.

Spanish Society of Hematology.,222-30,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Intensive induction and post-remission therapies have improved the prognosis in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, different from children, the impact of late intensification therapy in the overall results of treatment has not been consistently evaluated. The objective of this study was to analyze the results of a multicenter prospective protocol, PETHEMA ALL-89, in which, after intensive induction and consolidation therapy, randomization to receive delayed intensification treatment was performed. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and eight adults (age > or = 15 years) diagnosed with ALL (ALL L3 excluded) in 22 Spanish hospitals from 1989 to 1994 were treated with a five-drug induction therapy, followed by four cycles of early post-remission treatment during four months, and maintenance therapy for two years. Patients in remission at the end of the first year were randomized to receive one six-week cycle of late intensification therapy. Uni- and multivariate analyses of early response to treatment, complete remission (CR), leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were performed. RESULTS: The median (range) age of the series was 28 (15-74) years and leukocyte count 26 x 10(9)/L (1-600). ALL L1/L2 was present in 38/70 patients, early pre-B in 13, common in 53, pre-B in 12 and T in 30 cases. The CR rate was 86%, and refractory disease 9%. Median LFS was 34 months, with a 5-yr probability of 41% (95% CI, 29-53), whereas median OS was 51 months and 5-year probability 47% (34-59%). There were no differences in either LFS and OS between patients who did or did not receive delayed intensification therapy. Prognostic factors for CR attainment were advanced age and slow response to therapy. These two features were, in addition to high leukocyte counts, the parameters with negative influence in both LFS and OS. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results of PETHEMA ALL-89 are similar to those referred in other chemotherapy-based protocols in adult ALL. Delayed intensification has not improved the length of remission and survival. Efforts to improve the prognosis of adult ALL patients must be mainly focused in early intensification treatment.","['Ribera, J M', 'Ortega, J J', 'Oriol, A', 'Fontanillas, M', 'Hernandez-Rivas, J M', 'Brunet, S', 'Garcia-Conde, J', 'Maldonado, J', 'Zuazu, J', 'Gardella, S', 'Besalduch, J', 'Leon, P', 'Macia, J', 'Domingo-Albos, A', 'Feliu, E', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Ribera JM', 'Ortega JJ', 'Oriol A', 'Fontanillas M', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Brunet S', 'Garcia-Conde J', 'Maldonado J', 'Zuazu J', 'Gardella S', 'Besalduch J', 'Leon P', 'Macia J', 'Domingo-Albos A', 'Feliu E', 'San Miguel JF']","['Hematology Department, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Barcelona, Spain. jmribera@as.hugtip.scs.es']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Spain', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/05/09 00:00,1998/05/09 00:01,['1998/05/09 00:00'],"['1998/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Mar;83(3):222-30.,,['Haematologica. 1998 Mar;83(3):193-6.

Expression of ril, a novel LIM domain gene, is down-regulated in HRAS-transformed cells and restored in phenotypic revertants. Oncogene 10, 61-68). Searching for novel genes on human chromosome 5q31.1 by the cDNA selection technique, we isolated a cDNA clone identical with the cDNA of the human RIL gene (GenBank Accession No. X93510). The human 5q31.1 region is of interest because it contains the cytokine gene cluster and is frequently deleted in the malignant cells of patients with myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemia. Using Southern blot analysis and restriction mapping of genomic YAC (yeast artificial chromosome) and cosmid clones, we located the human RIL gene 240-260 kb telomeric to the IRF1 gene and characterized its genomic structure. PCR analysis indicated the presence of two alternative RIL transcripts in human fetal brain mRNA. The major transcript is identical with the RIL cDNA previously deposited in GenBank and contains seven exons distributed over 14.5 kb of genomic DNA with the two last 3'-exons coding a LIM domain. The minor transcript lacks the sixth exon compared with the major transcript, which leads to the loss of the LIM domain. We also identified two putative transcription start points (tsp) and sequenced the 5'-flanking region of RIL to reveal potential binding sites for transcriptional factors.","['Bashirova, A A', 'Markelov, M L', 'Shlykova, T V', 'Levshenkova, E V', 'Alibaeva, R A', 'Frolova, E I']","['Bashirova AA', 'Markelov ML', 'Shlykova TV', 'Levshenkova EV', 'Alibaeva RA', 'Frolova EI']","['Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia. bash@ibch.siobc.ras.ru']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1998/05/09 00:00,1998/05/09 00:01,['1998/05/09 00:00'],"['1998/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111998000808 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00080-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1998 Apr 14;210(2):239-45. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00080-8.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (PDLIM4 protein, human)']",,,,,['GENBANK/U82997'],,,,,,,,,,

In this study, pseudotype formation between MoMLV and the prototype parainfluenza virus Sendai virus (SV) was investigated. We report for the first time that SV infection of MoMLV producer cells results in the formation of MoMLV(SV) pseudotypes, which display a largely extended host range compared to that of MoMLV particles. This could be associated with SV hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (SV-HN) glycoprotein incorporation into MoMLV envelopes. In contrast, solitary incorporation of the other SV glycoprotein, SV fusion protein (SV-F), resulted in a distinct and narrow extension of the MoMLV host range to asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R)-positive cells (e.g., cultured human hepatoma cells). Since stably ASGP-R cDNA-transfected MDCK cells, but not parental ASGP-R-negative MDCK cells, were found to be transduced by MoMLV(SV-F) pseudotypes and transduction of ASGP-R-expressing cells was found to be inhibited by ASGP-R antiserum, a direct proof for the ASGP-R-restricted tropism of MoMLV(SV-F) pseudotypes was provided. Cultivation of ASGP-R-positive HepG2 hepatoma cells on Transwell-COL membranes led to a significant enhancement of MoMLV(SV-F) titers in subsequent flowthrough transduction experiments, thereby suggesting the importance of ASGP-R accessibility at the basolateral domain for MoMLV(SV-F) pseudotype transduction. The availability of such ASGP-R-restricted MoMLV(SV-F)-pseudotyped vectors opens up new perspectives for future liver-restricted therapeutic gene transfer applications.","['Spiegel, M', 'Bitzer, M', 'Schenk, A', 'Rossmann, H', 'Neubert, W J', 'Seidler, U', 'Gregor, M', 'Lauer, U']","['Spiegel M', 'Bitzer M', 'Schenk A', 'Rossmann H', 'Neubert WJ', 'Seidler U', 'Gregor M', 'Lauer U']","['Abteilung Innere Medizin I, Medizinische Universitatsklinik Tubingen, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Respirovirus/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.6.5296-5302.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Jun;72(6):5296-302. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.6.5296-5302.1998.,"['0 (F0 protein, Sendai virus)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,,,PMC110129,,,,,,,,

Preincubation with anticapsid antibodies against B19 virus, but not anticapsid antibodies against AAV, inhibited transduction of primary human erythroid cells. The efficiency of transduction of primary human erythroid cells by the recombinant B19 virus vector was significantly higher than that by the recombinant AAV vector.

Pit1 is not able to function as a receptor for A-MuLV infection, while Pit2 does not confer susceptibility to GALV. Previous studies of chimeric receptors constructed by interchanging regions of Pit1 and Pit2 failed to clarify the determinants unique to Pit2 which correlate with A-MuLV receptor function. In order to identify which regions of Pit2 are involved in A-MuLV receptor function, we exchanged the putative second and third extracellular domains of Pit1, either individually or together, with the corresponding regions of Pit2. Our functional characterization of these receptors indicates a role for the putative second extracellular domain (domain II) in A-MuLV infection. We further investigated the influence of domain II with respect to A-MuLV receptor function by performing site-specific mutagenesis within this region of Pit2. Many of the mutations had little or no effect on receptor function. However, the substitution of serine for methionine at position 138 (S138M) in a Pit1 chimera containing domain II of Pit2 resulted in a 1,000-fold reduction in A-MuLV receptor function. Additional mutations made within domain II of the nonfunctional S138M mutant restored receptor function to nearly wild-type efficiency. The high degree of tolerance for mutations as well as the compensatory effect of particular substitutions observed within domain II suggests that an element of secondary structure within this region plays a critical role in the interaction of the receptor with A-MuLV.","['Leverett, B D', 'Farrell, K B', 'Eiden, M V', 'Wilson, C A']","['Leverett BD', 'Farrell KB', 'Eiden MV', 'Wilson CA']","['Division of Cellular and Gene Therapies, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/physiology', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.6.4956-4961.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Jun;72(6):4956-61. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.6.4956-4961.1998.,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,,,PMC110057,,,,,,,,

Because focal adhesions may modulate cytoskeletal functions and thereby alter phagocytosis, cell migration, and adhesion in monocyte-macrophages, we investigated the role of RAFTK signaling in these cells. RAFTK was abundantly expressed in THP1 monocytic cells as well as in primary alveolar and peripheral blood-derived macrophages. Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) stimulation of THP1 cells increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK; similar increases in phosphorylation were also detected after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. RAFTK was phosphorylated with similar kinetics in THP1 cells and peripheral blood-derived macrophages. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed associations between RAFTK and the signaling molecule phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase. PI-3 kinase enzyme activity also coprecipitated with the RAFTK antibody, further confirming this association. The CSF-1/M-CSF receptor c-fms and RAFTK appeared to associate in response to CSF-1/M-CSF treatment of THP1 cells. Inhibition of RAFTK by a dominant-negative kinase mutant reduced CSF-1/M-CSF-induced MAPK activity.

The critical roles of the Fas-Fas ligand system in apoptosis suggest that its inactivation may be involved in malignant transformation. We analyzed the expression of Fas antigen on adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells by flow cytometry and found that Fas antigen expression was absent in a case of ATL and markedly decreased in another case among 47 cases examined. Apoptosis could not be induced in the Fas-negative ATL cells by antibody against Fas antigen. Sequencing of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products of the Fas genes in the Fas negative cells showed two types of aberrant transcripts: one had a 5-bp deletion and a 1-bp insertion in exon 2, and the other transcript lacked exon 4. These mutations caused the premature termination of both alleles, resulting in the loss of expression of surface Fas antigen. These aberrant transcripts were not detected in a nonleukemic B-cell line from the same patient. An RNase protection assay of the Fas gene showed mutations in 2 additional cases with Fas-positive ATL cells of 35 cases examined: 1 case lacked exon 4 and the other was a silent mutation. In the Fas antigen-negative case, leukemic cells were resistant to anticancer drugs in vivo, indicating that the loss of expression of Fas antigen may be associated with a poor response to anticancer drugs. Indeed, Fas-negative ATL cells were resistant to adriamycin-induced apoptosis in vitro, which is consistent with the finding that ATL in this case was resistant to chemotherapy. These findings indicate that mutation of the Fas gene may be associated with the progression of ATL and with resistance to anticancer drugs.","['Tamiya, S', 'Etoh, K', 'Suzushima, H', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Matsuoka, M']","['Tamiya S', 'Etoh K', 'Suzushima H', 'Takatsuki K', 'Matsuoka M']","['The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Exons/genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Zidovudine/therapeutic use', 'fas Receptor/*genetics/immunology']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54716-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 15;91(10):3935-42.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TonB210.1 demonstrates conditional growth factor independence in tissue culture and rapidly forms tumors in mice fed the tetracycline analog doxycycline. The tumors regress completely upon doxycycline withdrawal, but ultimately reform in all animals. After a long latency, tumors also develop in animals never exposed to doxycycline. Subclones of TonB210.1 established from doxycycline-independent tumors demonstrate distinct mechanisms of transformation. Most subclones manifest increased basal levels of BCR/ABL expression; some have lost the capacity to augment expression upon induction, whereas others remain inducible. More interestingly, some subclones maintain tight conditional expression of BCR/ABL and are therefore transformed by secondary mechanisms that no longer require BCR/ABL expression. These subclones show constitutive phosphorylation of the STAT5 protein, suggesting that activating mutations have occurred upstream in the signaling pathway to STAT5. The tight conditional expression of BCR/ABL in the TonB210.1 cell line affords the opportunity to study several interesting aspects of the biology of BCR/ABL, including activation of critical signaling pathways and transcriptional programs, and its potential role in genomic instability.","['Klucher, K M', 'Lopez, D V', 'Daley, G Q']","['Klucher KM', 'Lopez DV', 'Daley GQ']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA Transposable Elements/genetics', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Genes, Synthetic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetracycline/pharmacology', 'Tetracycline Resistance/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transfection', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54715-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 15;91(10):3927-34.,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ATM gene, located in the 11q22-23 chromosomal region, is consistently mutated in AT patients. The strong predisposition of AT patients to develop T-PLL and the high frequency of T-cell leukemias/lymphomas observed in atm-deficient mice, together with the known functions of the ATM protein, led us to evaluate the ATM gene as a potential tumor suppressor gene involved in T-PLL. Paired leukemic and nonleukemic cells were obtained from a series of 15 patients suffering sporadic T-PLLs, allowing loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis. LOH of the 11q22-23 region was detected in 10 of these 15 cases (67%). The minimal deleted region was defined as an approximately 2.5 Mb interval that contained the ATM gene. No ATM rearrangement or biallelic deletion was detected by Southern blotting in the T-PLL series. However, in five T-PLLs with LOH of the 11q22-23 region, Western blot analysis showed either undetectable (3 cases) or decreased levels (1 case) of ATM protein, whereas ATM was present at high levels in cases without LOH. The protein truncation test (PTT) was then used to search for mutations in the ATM gene. Four mutations (1 nonsense, 2 aberrant splicings, and 1 missense) were detected in patients with LOH and none in patients without LOH of the region. The acquired character of these ATM mutations was demonstrated in three patients. Altogether, allelic ATM inactivations by large deletions or mutations were found in approximately two thirds of T-PLL. ATM is thus a tumor suppressor gene whose inactivation is a key event in the development of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemias.","['Stoppa-Lyonnet, D', 'Soulier, J', 'Lauge, A', 'Dastot, H', 'Garand, R', 'Sigaux, F', 'Stern, M H']","['Stoppa-Lyonnet D', 'Soulier J', 'Lauge A', 'Dastot H', 'Garand R', 'Sigaux F', 'Stern MH']","['Unite INSERM U462, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Exons/genetics', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54714-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 15;91(10):3920-6.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukocyte migration from circulation into tissue depends on integrin-mediated adhesion to endothelium, and integrins are tightly regulated by several stimuli, such as inflammatory chemokines. However, the exact mechanisms that enhance adherence of leukemic cells to the endothelium and infiltration into tissues remain to be fully understood. We investigated the mechanisms of extravasation of leukemic cells using ATL cells and report the following novel features of endogenous chemokine-induced adhesion of ATL cells to the endothelium. ATL cells spontaneously adhered to endothelial cells without exogenous stimulation. Integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on ATL cells was spontaneously activated. ATL cells produced high amounts of chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and MIP-1beta. Adhesion of ATL cells to endothelial cells and the expression of activated form of LFA-1 were reduced by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, wortmannin, or anti-MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta antibodies or transfection with antisense of MIP-1alpha or MIP-1beta. Spontaneous polymerization of cytoskeletal F-actin was observed in ATL cells, which was also inhibited by pertussis toxin and wortmannin. We propose that ATL cells adhere to endothelial cells through an adhesion cascade similar to normal leukocytes and that the chemokines produced by ATL cells are involved in triggering integrin LFA-1 through cytoskeletal rearrangement induced by G-protein-dependent activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinases in an autocrine manner. These events result in a strong adhesion of ATL cells to the endothelium and spontaneous transendothelial migration.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Mine, S', 'Figdor, C G', 'Wake, A', 'Hirano, H', 'Tsukada, J', 'Aso, M', 'Fujii, K', 'Saito, K', 'van Kooyk, Y', 'Eto, S']","['Tanaka Y', 'Mine S', 'Figdor CG', 'Wake A', 'Hirano H', 'Tsukada J', 'Aso M', 'Fujii K', 'Saito K', 'van Kooyk Y', 'Eto S']","['The First Department of Internal Medicine , University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Actins/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'DNA, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Umbilical Veins', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology', 'Wortmannin']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54713-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 15;91(10):3909-19.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate the successful delivery of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene into two human NK cell lines, IL-2-dependent NK-92 and IL-2-independent YT, by retroviral transduction. An MuLV-based retroviral vector expressing human IL-2 and neor markers from a polycistronic message was constructed and transduced into a CRIP packaging cell line. By coincubation of NK cells with monolayers of CRIP cells or by using retrovirus-containing supernatants in a flow-through method, 10% to 20% of NK cells were stably transduced. Upon selection in the presence of increasing G418 concentrations, transduced NK cells were able to proliferate independently of IL-2 for more than 5 months and to secrete up to 5.5 ng/10(6) cells/24 h of IL-2. IL-2 gene-transduced NK-92 cells had an in vitro cytotoxicity against tumor targets that was significantly higher than that of parental cells and secreted interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in addition to IL-2. Moreover, the in vivo antitumor activity of IL-2 gene-transduced NK-92 cells against established 3-day liver metastases in mice was greater than that of parental nontransduced NK cells. Stable expression of the IL-2 transgene in NK cells improved their therapeutic potential in tumor-bearing hosts. Thus, transduced NK cells secreted sufficient quantities of bioactive IL-2 to proliferate in vitro and mediated the antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo in the absence of exogenous IL-2. These results suggest that genetic modification of NK cells ex vivo could be useful for clinical cancer therapy in the future.","['Nagashima, S', 'Mailliard, R', 'Kashii, Y', 'Reichert, T E', 'Herberman, R B', 'Robbins, P', 'Whiteside, T L']","['Nagashima S', 'Mailliard R', 'Kashii Y', 'Reichert TE', 'Herberman RB', 'Robbins P', 'Whiteside TL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma/immunology/secondary/therapy', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Genes, Synthetic', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism/transplantation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/immunology/secondary/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Stomach Neoplasms/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54707-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 15;91(10):3850-61.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,['R01-CA63513/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Only BFU-E colonies were positive for EPO mRNA. Lysates from pooled BFU-E colonies stained positively for EPO by immunoblotting.

However, once the stem cell compartment is established, the function of SCL in subsequent differentiation and commitment events within normal hematopoietic cells remains undefined. The aim of the current study was to investigate this role using purified normal human hematopoietic CD34(+) cells. An SCL retrovirus was used to transduce CD34(+) cells isolated from human bone marrow, peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood. Enforced expression of SCL increased by a median of twofold the number of erythroid colonies, with an increase in both colony size and the rate of hemoglobinization. Unexpectedly, enforced expression in CD34(+) cells also significantly increased the number of megakaryocyte colonies, but with no impact on the size of colonies. There was no consistent effect on the number nor size of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colonies. The proliferative effect of enforced SCL expression on erythroid cells was attributed to a shortened cell cycle time; the self-renewal capacity of erythroid or GM progenitors was unchanged, as was survival of cells within colonies. These results demonstrate a role for SCL in determining erythroid and megakaryocyte differentiation from normal human hematopoietic CD34(+) cells.","['Elwood, N J', 'Zogos, H', 'Pereira, D S', 'Dick, J E', 'Begley, C G']","['Elwood NJ', 'Zogos H', 'Pereira DS', 'Dick JE', 'Begley CG']","['Rotary Bone Marrow Research Laboratories, Victoria, Australia. elwood@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blood Cells/cytology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54696-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 15;91(10):3756-65.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, DLI frequently also result in significant acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Several clinical and experimental lines of evidence have suggested that CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. To develop methods to reduce the incidence of GVHD associated with DLI, we administered defined numbers of CD4(+) donor T cells after ex vivo depletion of CD8(+) lymphocytes to 40 patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies after allogeneic BMT. Cohorts of patients received 0.3, 1.0, or 1.5 x 10(8) CD4(+) cells/kg. Overall, 12 of 38 patients (32%) evaluable for toxicity developed acute or chronic GVHD. However, 6 of 27 patients (22%) receiving 0.3 x 10(8) CD4 cells/kg developed GVHD compared with 6 of 11 patients (55%) who received >/=1.0 x 10(8) CD4 cells/kg (P = .07). Treatment-related mortality was low (3%), with 1 death related to infection in the setting of immunosuppression for GVHD. Disease responses after CD4(+) DLI were documented in 15 of 19 patients (79%) with early-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) relapse, 5 of 6 patients (83%) with relapsed multiple myeloma, and 1 patient with myelodysplasia. For patients with early-phase CML relapse, the Kaplan-Meier probability of achieving complete cytogenetic remission was 87% and the probability of complete molecular response was 78% at 1 year after DLI. The median time to complete cytogenetic response and molecular response in patients with CML was 13 weeks (range, 9 to 30 weeks) and 34 weeks (range, 10 to 56 weeks), respectively. The median time to response in patients with multiple myeloma was 26 weeks (range, 15 to 62 weeks). All patients in this trial who developed GVHD demonstrated tumor regression, but the presence of GVHD was not required for patients to achieve a response, because 48% of responding patients never developed evidence of GVHD. Two patients with CML who did not respond at dose level 1 subsequently achieved complete cytogenetic remission after a second infusion of CD8-depleted cells at dose level 2. In patients with evidence of mixed hematopoietic chimerism who achieved a complete remission after DLI, cytogenetic analysis of marrow cells also demonstrated conversion to complete donor hematopoiesis in all evaluable patients. These studies suggest that relatively low numbers of CD8-depleted donor lymphocytes are effective in inducing complete remissions in patients with stable-phase CML and multiple myeloma who have relapsed after allogeneic BMT. Because of the relatively low risk of toxicity associated with the infusion of defined numbers of CD4(+) donor cells, further studies can be undertaken in the setting of persistent minimal residual disease to prevent relapse after allogeneic BMT.","['Alyea, E P', 'Soiffer, R J', 'Canning, C', 'Neuberg, D', 'Schlossman, R', 'Pickett, C', 'Collins, H', 'Wang, Y', 'Anderson, K C', 'Ritz, J']","['Alyea EP', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Canning C', 'Neuberg D', 'Schlossman R', 'Pickett C', 'Collins H', 'Wang Y', 'Anderson KC', 'Ritz J']","['Divisions of Hematologic Malignancies and Biostatistics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA. edwin_alyea@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54687-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 15;91(10):3671-80.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,"['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA01730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

To evaluate levels of EBV DNA in SCT patients, a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and diluted, and PCR was performed by using a primer set specific for a well-conserved sequence of the internal repeat 1 region of the EBV genome. Forty-one SCT patients were screened with this method. Thirty-seven patients received allogeneic transplants, of which 18 were T-cell-depleted marrow. Four additional patients received autologous SCT, one of which was T-cell depleted. The mean time of follow-up by EBV PCR was 147 days (range, 47 to 328 days) posttransplant. The range of EBV copies/microg DNA from normal EBV sero-positive donors was 40 to 4,000. Seven patients had >/=40,000 copies of EBV DNA/microg DNA, all of whom were recipients of T-cell-depleted SCT. Five of the seven patients with elevated levels of EBV DNA developed EBV-LPD. Four of these five patients with EBV-LPD had elevated levels of EBV DNA from 1 to 8 weeks before diagnosis. Two patients with EBV-LPD had normal levels of EBV DNA, and two patients with >/=40,000 copies EBV/microg DNA did not develop EBV-LPD. In one patient, clinical resolution of disease correlated with a decrease in EBV DNA and an increase in the level of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell precursors. These data indicate that the measurement of EBV viral load with semiquantitative PCR is useful in detecting EBV-LPD in high-risk patients before the onset of clinical symptoms. Because not all patients with elevated levels of EBV DNA develop EBV-LPD, semiquantitative PCR results cannot substitute for clinical, radiographic, and pathological confirmation of this diagnosis.","['Lucas, K G', 'Burton, R L', 'Zimmerman, S E', 'Wang, J', 'Cornetta, K G', 'Robertson, K A', 'Lee, C H', 'Emanuel, D J']","['Lucas KG', 'Burton RL', 'Zimmerman SE', 'Wang J', 'Cornetta KG', 'Robertson KA', 'Lee CH', 'Emanuel DJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stem Cell Transplantation Program, Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapolis, IN 46202-5225, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/*blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*diagnosis/transmission/virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Leukocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Leukocytes/virology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/adverse effects', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/etiology/*virology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Risk', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*diagnosis/transmission/virology']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54685-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 15;91(10):3654-61.,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Italian Cooperative Study Group on Myeloid with Myeloid Metaplasia.,3630-6,"An unexpectedly high incidence of blast transformation after splenectomy has been reported in patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. However, whether this was associated with spleen removal after adjustment for risk factors was not determined. We conducted a multicenter historical cohort study of patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia diagnosed from January 1970 through January 1994. A total of 549 patients (325 men and 224 women from 22 to 92 years of age; median age, 63 years) were included in the final data set. The Cox's proportional-hazards model was used to identify factors associated with blast transformation and death. To further adjust for factors related to spleen removal assignment, a propensity score for splenectomy was estimated using recursive-partitioning analysis. Blast transformation developed in 78 patients (14.2%). Patients who underwent splenectomy developed more blast transformations than those who were not splenectomized (23 of 87 [26.4%] v 55 of 462 [11.9%]; P < .001). The cumulative incidence of blast transformation 12 years after diagnosis was 27.0% in nonsplenectomized patients and 55.0% in splenectomized ones (P = . 01). The risk factors independently predictive of blast transformation included prior splenectomy (relative risk = 2.61), platelet count less than 100 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis (relative risk = 2.45), and the presence of blasts in peripheral blood at diagnosis (relative risk = 2.31). The relative risk of blast transformation in splenectomized patients increased from 2.2 at 48 months from diagnosis to 14.3 at 12 years. Patients with the same propensity score for splenectomy showed a higher risk for blast transformation on the basis of having undergone splenectomy (P = .02). In conclusion, the risk of blast transformation is significantly increased in subjects who underwent splenectomy and appears to be independent of factors related to spleen removal assignment.","['Barosi, G', 'Ambrosetti, A', 'Centra, A', 'Falcone, A', 'Finelli, C', 'Foa, P', 'Grossi, A', 'Guarnone, R', 'Rupoli, S', 'Luciano, L', 'Petti, M C', 'Pogliani, E', 'Russo, D', 'Ruggeri, M', 'Quaglini, S']","['Barosi G', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Centra A', 'Falcone A', 'Finelli C', 'Foa P', 'Grossi A', 'Guarnone R', 'Rupoli S', 'Luciano L', 'Petti MC', 'Pogliani E', 'Russo D', 'Ruggeri M', 'Quaglini S']","['Laboratorio di Informatica Medica and Dipartimento di Medicina Interna e Oncologia Medica, IRCCS Policlinico S.

This double-blind trial was designed to test the hypothesis that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used as supportive care could improve the treatment of elderly AML patients. Two hundred thirty-four patients 55 or more years of age with a morphologic diagnosis of de novo or secondary AML, French-American-British (FAB) M0-M7, excluding M3, were randomly assigned to a standard induction regimen (daunorubicin at 45 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] on days 1 through 3 and Ara-C at 200 mg/m2 IV continuous infusion on days 1 through 7) plus either placebo or G-CSF (400 microg/m2 IV over 30 minutes once daily). Results are reported here for 211 centrally confirmed cases of non-M3 AML. The two groups were well balanced in demographic, clinical, and hematological parameters, with median ages of 68 years in the G-CSF and 67 years in the placebo groups. The complete response (CR) rate was not significantly better in the G-CSF group: 50% in the placebo and 41% in the G-CSF group (one-tailed P = .89). Median overall survival was also similar, 9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7 to 10 months) in the placebo and 6 months (95% CI, 3 to 8 months) in the G-CSF arms (P = .71). We found a significant 15% reduction in the time to neutrophil recovery in the G-CSF group (P = .014). G-CSF had no impact on recovery from thrombocytopenia (P = .80) or duration of first hospitalization (P = .27). When infection complications were evaluated, G-CSF had a beneficial effect on the duration but not on incidence of infection. G-CSF patients had fewer days with fever and shorter duration of antibiotic use. However, there was no difference in the frequency of total documented infections or in the number of fatal infections (19% placebo v 20% G-CSF). In this study of elderly AML patients, G-CSF improved clinical parameters of duration of neutropenia and antibiotic use, but did not change CR rate or survival or shorten hospitalization.","['Godwin, J E', 'Kopecky, K J', 'Head, D R', 'Willman, C L', 'Leith, C P', 'Hynes, H E', 'Balcerzak, S P', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Godwin JE', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Head DR', 'Willman CL', 'Leith CP', 'Hynes HE', 'Balcerzak SP', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*prevention & control', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Safety', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54679-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 15;91(10):3607-15.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,"['CA04920/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Two hundred sixteen cycles of induction or consolidation chemotherapy and 3,843 days of thrombocytopenia less than 25 x 10(9)/L were evaluated. At the start of the study, each of the 17 participating centers decided whether they would use a 10 x 10(9)/L prophylactic platelet transfusion trigger (group A/8 centers) or a 20 x 10(9)/L trigger (group B/9 centers). Bleeding complications (World Health Organization grade 2-4) during treatment cycles were comparable in the two groups: 20 of 110 (18%) in group A and 18 of 106 (17%) in group B (P = .8). Serious bleeding events (grade 3-4) were generally not related to the patient's platelet count but were the consequence of local lesions and plasma coagulation factor deficiencies due to sepsis. Eighty-six percent of the serious bleeding episodes occurred during induction chemotherapy. No patient died of a bleeding complication. There were no significant differences in the number of red blood cell transfusions administered between the two groups, but there were significant differences in the number of platelet transfusions administered per treatment cycle: pooled random donor platelet concentrates averaged 15.4 versus 25.4 (P < .01) and apheresis platelets averaged 3.0 versus 4.8 (P < .05) for group A versus group B, respectively. This resulted in the cost of platelet therapy being one third lower in group A compared with group B without any associated increase in bleeding risk.","['Wandt, H', 'Frank, M', 'Ehninger, G', 'Schneider, C', 'Brack, N', 'Daoud, A', 'Fackler-Schwalbe, I', 'Fischer, J', 'Gackle, R', 'Geer, T', 'Harms, P', 'Loffler, B', 'Ohl, S', 'Otremba, B', 'Raab, M', 'Schonrock-Nabulsi, P', 'Strobel, G', 'Winter, R', 'Link, H']","['Wandt H', 'Frank M', 'Ehninger G', 'Schneider C', 'Brack N', 'Daoud A', 'Fackler-Schwalbe I', 'Fischer J', 'Gackle R', 'Geer T', 'Harms P', 'Loffler B', 'Ohl S', 'Otremba B', 'Raab M', 'Schonrock-Nabulsi P', 'Strobel G', 'Winter R', 'Link H']","['5th Medical Department and Institute of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Nurnberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', 'Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion/adverse effects/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Plateletpheresis/economics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*therapy']",1998/06/20 00:00,1998/06/20 00:01,['1998/06/20 00:00'],"['1998/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54678-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 15;91(10):3601-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UAB8 (R1 = Et; R2 = iPr), which contains sufficient steric bulk at the terminal end of the polyene chain to mimic the trimethylcyclohexenyl ring of RA, displayed biological properties similar to those of RA. To explore the efficacy of this retinoid in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), we evaluated UAB8 isomers in in vitro assays which measure the capacity of retinoids to inhibit aberrant myeloid colony growth from blood or bone marrow cells obtained from human JMML patients and in assays measuring the potential of retinoids to differentiate NB4 cells (an APL cell line). Both (all-E)- and (13Z)-UAB8 were 2-fold more active than RA in the NB4 cell differentiation assay; however, only (all-E)-UAB8 had comparable activity to the natural retinoids in the JMML cell assays. These results were compared to the biological effectiveness of a new retinoid, UAB30 [8-(3', 4'-dihydro-1'(2'H)-naphthalen-1'-ylidene)-3,7-dimethyl-2,4, 6-octatrienoic acid], which had different nuclear receptor binding and transactivational properties than UAB8. Relative to (all-E)-RA and (all-E)-UAB8, (all-E)-UAB30 bound well to RARalpha but did not activate transcription-mediated RARalpha homodimers, even though it was effective in RARbeta- and RARgamma-mediated transactivational assays. In APL assays, this retinoid had much reduced activity and was only moderately effective in JMML assays and in cancer chemoprevention assays.","['Muccio, D D', 'Brouillette, W J', 'Breitman, T R', 'Taimi, M', 'Emanuel, P D', 'Zhang, X', 'Chen, G', 'Sani, B P', 'Venepally, P', 'Reddy, L', 'Alam, M', 'Simpson-Herren, L', 'Hill, D L']","['Muccio DD', 'Brouillette WJ', 'Breitman TR', 'Taimi M', 'Emanuel PD', 'Zhang X', 'Chen G', 'Sani BP', 'Venepally P', 'Reddy L', 'Alam M', 'Simpson-Herren L', 'Hill DL']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'Child', '*Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', '*Naphthalenes/chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Papilloma/prevention & control', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Skin/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm970635h [doi]', 'jm970635h [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1998 May 7;41(10):1679-87. doi: 10.1021/jm970635h.,"['0', ""(8-(3'-ethyl-2'-(1-methylethyl)-2'-cyclohexen-1'-ylidene)-3.7-dimethyl-2,4,6-octa"", 'trienoic acid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'PFP09575EX (UAB 30)']",,,,,,"['P01 CA34968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA59446/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1 CA60407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

They bear an N-methyl imide, N-methyl amide, or anhydride function instead of the original imide. Their inhibitory potencies toward topoisomerase I were examined using a DNA relaxation assay and by analyzing the drug-induced cleavage of 32P-labeled DNA. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition and interaction with DNA were also studied together with the in vitro antiproliferative activities against B16 melanoma and P388 leukemia cells. The antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces chartreusis), a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), and a yeast (Candida albicans) were tested as well as their antiviral activities toward HIV-1. The efficiency of the anhydride compounds was compared to that of the parent compound rebeccamycin and its dechlorinated analogue. All the compounds studied were inactive against PKC. The structural requirements for PKC and topoisomerase I inhibition are markedly different. In sharp contrast with the structure-PKC inhibition relationships, we found that an anhydride function does not affect topoisomerase I inhibition, whereas a methyl group on the indole nitrogen prevents the poisoning of topoisomerase I. The compounds exhibiting a marked toxicity to P388 leukemia cells had little or no effect on the growth of P388CPT5 cells which are resistant to the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. This study reinforces the conclusion that the DNA-topoisomerase I cleavable complex is the primary cellular target of the indolocarbazoles and significantly contributes to their cytotoxicity and possibly to their weak but noticeable anti-HIV-1 activities. The structure-activity relationships are also discussed.","['Moreau, P', 'Anizon, F', 'Sancelme, M', 'Prudhomme, M', 'Bailly, C', 'Carrasco, C', 'Ollier, M', 'Severe, D', 'Riou, J F', 'Fabbro, D', 'Meyer, T', 'Aubertin, A M']","['Moreau P', 'Anizon F', 'Sancelme M', 'Prudhomme M', 'Bailly C', 'Carrasco C', 'Ollier M', 'Severe D', 'Riou JF', 'Fabbro D', 'Meyer T', 'Aubertin AM']","['Synthese et Etude de Systemes a Interet Biologique, Universite Blaise Pascal, UMR 6504 du CNRS, 63177 Aubiere, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['*Aminoglycosides', 'Animals', '*Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Anti-HIV Agents/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Bacillus cereus/drug effects', 'Candida albicans/drug effects', '*Carbazoles', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects', 'HIV-1/drug effects', '*Indoles/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Streptomyces/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm970843+ [doi]', 'jm970843+ [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1998 May 7;41(10):1631-40. doi: 10.1021/jm970843+.,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '93908-02-2 (rebeccamycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Three models for calculating the costs and benefits of screening were developed. The first model analysed the cost of continuously testing all donations; the second analysed the cost of initially testing new blood donors and then retesting them after five years; the third analysed the cost of testing donors only at the time of their first donation. Patients who had received blood components from donors confirmed to be infected with the virus were offered testing. SETTING: Sweden. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of infection with the virus among blood donors, the risk of transmission of the virus, screening costs, and the outcome of infection. RESULTS: 648 497 donations were tested for the virus; 1625 samples tested positive by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. 6 were confirmed positive by western blotting. The prevalence of infection with the virus was 2/100 000 donors. 35 patients who had received blood infected with the virus were tested; 3 were positive. The cost of testing every donation was calculated to be $3.02m (1.88m pounds); this is 18 times higher than the cost of testing new donors only, and only 1 additional positive donor would be discovered in 7 years. Regardless of the model used, screening was estimated to prevent only 1 death every 200 years at a minimum cost of $36m (22.5m pounds). CONCLUSION: Based on these estimates the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare decided that only new blood donors would be screened for infection with the virus.","['Tynell, E', 'Andersson, S', 'Lithander, E', 'Arneborn, M', 'Blomberg, J', 'Hansson, H B', 'Krook, A', 'Nomberg, M', 'Ramstedt, K', 'Shanwell, A', 'Bjorkman, A']","['Tynell E', 'Andersson S', 'Lithander E', 'Arneborn M', 'Blomberg J', 'Hansson HB', 'Krook A', 'Nomberg M', 'Ramstedt K', 'Shanwell A', 'Bjorkman A']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd University Hospital, Danderyd, Sweden. elsa.tynell@inf.ds.sll.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Blood Transfusion/economics', 'Blotting, Western/economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/economics', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/economics/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Mass Screening/*economics/methods', 'Models, Economic', 'Prevalence', 'Program Evaluation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Transfusion Reaction']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.316.7142.1417 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1998 May 9;316(7142):1417-22. doi: 10.1136/bmj.316.7142.1417.,,,,,,,,PMC28538,,,,,,,,

To better understand the mechanism by which bHLH proteins regulate erythropoiesis, we have investigated HLH protein-DNA interactions in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells before and during chemically induced differentiation. Three bHLH (E-box) binding activities were found to be induced in nuclei from differentiating MEL cells. Using specific antisera, we have demonstrated that these complexes are dimers of TAL1 and ubiquitous E proteins. Similar complexes were detected in nuclear extracts from a human erythroid cell line, K562, and from mouse fetal liver. All three bHLH complexes were disrupted in vitro by Id1, a dominant-negative HLH protein that we and others have previously shown to antagonize MEL cell differentiation. During differentiation of an Id1-overexpressing MEL cell line, induction of a complex containing TAL1 and E2A was not only blocked but reduced below the levels seen in undifferentiating cells. These observations are consistent with the idea that TAL1 and Id1 have opposing effects on erythroid differentiation and that the level of TAL1/E2A heterodimer and/or another E protein-containing complex may influence the decision of a cell to terminally differentiate.","['Lister, J A', 'Baron, M H']","['Lister JA', 'Baron MH']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Gene Expr,Gene expression,9200651,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'COS Cells', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1', 'Mice', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Repressor Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor 4', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/08 00:00,1998/05/08 00:01,['1998/05/08 00:00'],"['1998/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Expr. 1998;7(1):25-38.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (Idb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L2 protein, human)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf7l2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor 4)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,,,,,"['T32 GM007620/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 07620/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM42413/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6151944,,,,,,,,

It is a rare event in solid tumours and has been reported only in osteosarcomas. In this study we have examined rearrangement of the p53 gene in human breast tumours. We found rearrangement in 35% of the patients (7 of 20 tumours examined). Normal tissue from these patients had an unrearranged gene, indicating that the genetic abnormality in the tumour is acquired during the natural process of tumorigenesis. No intronic rearrangement or allelic loss of the p53 gene was found in the breast tumour samples studied. Further, rearrangement of the p53 gene has been correlated with the p53 transcriptional status. Only two patients with rearranged p53 showed a high level of p53 RNA as well as protein expression. Thus, for the first time we report the rearrangement of the p53 gene in breast tumours, which may play a role in the process of tumorigenesis.","['Nayak, B K', 'Patnaik, S', 'Das, B R']","['Nayak BK', 'Patnaik S', 'Das BR']","['Molecular Biology Division, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",1998/05/08 00:00,1998/05/08 00:01,['1998/05/08 00:00'],"['1998/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(98)98444-3 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1998.8444 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1998 Apr 17;245(2):388-91. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1998.8444.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preventive effect of Bcl-xL on cell death induced by various concentrations of camptothecin (DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor; CPT) was observed in the three lines with most pronounced effect in cells containing the highest level of Bcl-xL expression. These results show that increased cell death protection by Bcl-xL is correlated with its level of expression. The extent of DNA strand break formation and DNA synthesis inhibition following CPT treatments was similar in control and transfected U-937 cells, suggesting that Bcl-xL acts downstream of CPT-DNA topoisomerase I-mediated DNA strand breaks. Modulation of cell death by Bcl-xL was also observed in cells treated with etoposide, vinblastine, paclitaxel, and cisplatinum (II) diammine dichloride. To define whether Bcl-xL functions downstream or upstream of apoptogenic proteolytic cascade activation, we compared kinetics of DNA fragmentation in treated cells with kinetics of caspase 1-like, caspase 3-like, and N-tosyl-L-phenylalanylchloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-sensitive activities. In CPT-treated U-937 cells, caspase 3-like and TPCK-sensitive activities promoting DNA fragmentation in a cell-free system were detected much more rapidly in extracts obtained from CPT-treated U-937 cells compared to those obtained from CPT-treated U-937-Bcl-xL variant cells. These results suggest that Bcl-xL delays their activation that correlates with the occurrence of DNA fragmentation. Addition of recombinant Bcl-xL in extracts containing DEVDase and TPCK-sensitive activities did not inhibit these activities, suggesting that Bcl-xL acts primarily upstream of their activation in the apoptotic process. Taken together, these results suggest that Bcl-xL is a primary checkpoint that can block or delay transmission of cell death signals emerging from DNA damage and prevents activation of an apoptogenic proteolytic cascade.","['Schmitt, E', 'Cimoli, G', 'Steyaert, A', 'Bertrand, R']","['Schmitt E', 'Cimoli G', 'Steyaert A', 'Bertrand R']","['Hospital Research Center of University of Montreal (CHUM), Montreal Cancer Institute, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'bcl-X Protein']",1998/05/08 00:00,1998/05/08 00:01,['1998/05/08 00:00'],"['1998/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94003-4 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 Apr 10;240(1):107-21. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4003.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '143313-51-3 (L 709049)', '402-71-1 (Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (DEVDase)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to LIF and bFGF in vitro permits the IEM cells to specifically chimerize endothelium in vivo and recapitulate normal endothelial development after blastocyst injection. We report here that unmanipulated IEM cells form vascular neoplasias when injected into immunodeficient nude mice. Examination of IEM neoplasia following exposure in vitro to bFGF and LIF before injection into nude mice profoundly reduced or completely suppressed the neoplastic growth of IEM cells. Furthermore, this suppression was observed by treatment with LIF alone, while bFGF treatment did not significantly alter IEM neoplasia and did not modify the LIF-mediated suppression. Characterization of the IEM responses to LIF revealed that the LIF suppression of IEM neoplasia depended on how long the cells were exposed to LIF in vitro. The IEM cell response to LIF was associated with the specific activation of the transcription factor Stat3. Stat1 activation could not be detected in response to LIF, although it is expressed in IEM cells. Our results demonstrate that the LIF-induced differentiation of IEM cells involves suppression of IEM-derived neoplasia and is associated with the specific activation of Stat3.","['Paradis, H', 'Arceci, R J', 'Adams, L C', 'Gendron, R L']","['Paradis H', 'Arceci RJ', 'Adams LC', 'Gendron RL']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229-3039, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Endothelium/cytology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Immunocompromised Host', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Vascular Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology']",1998/05/08 00:00,1998/05/08 00:01,['1998/05/08 00:00'],"['1998/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94006-X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 Apr 10;240(1):7-15. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4006.,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,,,,,['HD27322/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Members of this family are nuclear proteins that possess a characteristic tripartite motif consisting of the RING and B-box zinc binding domains and a coiled-coil domain. The promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML), another B-box family member, produces a protein product that is detected within punctate nuclear structures called PML nuclear bodies (NBs) or PML oncogenic domains (PODs). These NBs are complex structures that consist of a number of different proteins many of which have yet to be identified. In the disease acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) a fusion protein, PML-RARA, is produced through the t(15:17) translocation. In APL the morphology of the NBs is altered. We report that rfp co-localizes with PML in a subset of the PML NBs and that it interacts directly with PML. This interaction is mediated through the rfp B-box and the distal two coils. In contrast, homomultimerization of rfp preferentially involves the B-box and the proximal coil. The association of rfp with the PML NBs is altered by mutations that affect rfp/PML interaction and in NB4 cells that are derived from APL patients. When treated with retinoic acid, rfp reassociates with the NBs in a pattern similar to non APL cells. Additionally, we found that rfp colocalizes with PML-RARA protein produced in APL patients. These results suggest that rfp, along with the other known/unknown components of PML NBs, have an important role in regulating cellular growth and differentiation.","['Cao, T', 'Duprez, E', 'Borden, K L', 'Freemont, P S', 'Etkin, L D']","['Cao T', 'Duprez E', 'Borden KL', 'Freemont PS', 'Etkin LD']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Texas M.

The molecular pathogenesis of low grade B-NHL is characterized by distinct genetic pathways which selectively associate with each clinicopathologic category. At diagnosis, B-CLL/SLL frequently display deletions of 13q14 and trisomy 12, whereas evolution to Richter's syndrome associates with disruption of p53. LPL carries t(9;14)(p13;q32) in 40-50% of the cases, leading to the deregulated expression of the PAX-5 gene. FL consistently harbors rearrangements of BCL-2 independent of the cytologic variant. With time, a fraction of FL cases accumulates mutations of p53 and evolves into a high grade B-NHL. Low grade MALTL are characterized by the frequent occurrence of trisomy 3 and, occasionally, by p53 mutations. SLVL carries p53 mutations in a fraction of cases. The identification of distinct genetic categories among low grade B-NHL may help in the therapeutic stratification of these disorders.

We have used idarubicin since 1991 and found, in a retrospective comparison with a doxorubicin regimen, a decreased incidence of primarily refractory disease. The role of idarubicin in the postremission phase could not be assessed in detail but an early intensive use of anthracyclines, either idarubicin or doxorubicin, was associated with an improved outcome in early-B CD10+ and t(9;22)/BCR-leukaemias. Concurrent in vitro studies demonstrated that idarubicin, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, was less sensitive to P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux than daunorubicin and was a more effective agent to use with cyclosporin-A to circumvent this drug resistance mechanism. Idarubicin is a very effective drug for the early management of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and may be presently considered (along with cyclosporin-A or other modulator) as the reference anthracycline for cases overexpressing the P-glycoprotein drug resistance mechanism.","['Bassan, R', 'Chiodini, B', 'Lerede, T', 'Torri, V', 'Borleri, G', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Barbui, T']","['Bassan R', 'Chiodini B', 'Lerede T', 'Torri V', 'Borleri G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Barbui T']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/07 00:00,1998/05/07 00:01,['1998/05/07 00:00'],"['1998/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709058605 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Dec;26 Suppl 1:89-97. doi: 10.3109/10428199709058605.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pancytopenia and defective function of neutrophils and platelets lead to a high risk of infectious and hemorrhagic complications. The progression to acute myeloid leukemia adds to morbidity and mortality. Supportive care including red blood cell and platelet transfusions are still the cornerstone of therapeutic management. While prophylactic administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF cannot be recommended, treatment of febrile neutropenia might benefit from administration of G-CSF in addition to antibiotics. Administration of high-dose erythropoietin will improve erythropoiesis in around 20% of the patients, mainly in those with rather preserved erythroid function and no or low transfusion need. Coadministration of erythropoietin with either G-CSF or GM-CSF could increase the response rate. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation still is the only curative treatment and prolongs survival.

Their importance in neutrophil function is implied by their unusual abundance in neutrophil cytosol (approximately 40% of cytosolic protein). Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated the extracellular association of these proteins with vascular endothelium adjacent to transmigrating leukocytes. We report here a function for MRP-14 as a stimulator of neutrophil adhesion mediated by the beta 2 integrin, Mac-1. MRP-14 is an affinity regulator of Mac-1 because it promotes binding of soluble ligand and expression of an ""activation reporter"" epitope of high affinity beta 2 integrins recognized by mAb24. The activity of MRP-14 is confined to regulating integrin function because, unlike other inflammatory agonists, there was no release of L-selectin, up-regulation of cytosolic Mac-1, or induction of neutrophil respiratory burst or calcium flux. Furthermore, MRP-14 does not act as a chemoattractant or cause alterations in cell shape or cytoskeleton. MRP-8 has a regulatory role in MRP-14 activity, inhibiting the adhesion induced by MRP-14 through the formation of the heterodimer. In terms of mechanism of action, MRP-14 does not increase Mac-1 function by direct binding to this integrin but recognizes a distinct receptor on neutrophils. This receptor interaction is pertussis toxin sensitive, indicating that MRP-14-generated signals leading to a Mac-1 affinity increase are heterotrimeric G protein dependent. We postulate that MRP-14 and MRP-8 are important in vivo candidates for the regulated adhesion of neutrophils through control of Mac-1 activity.","['Newton, R A', 'Hogg, N']","['Newton RA', 'Hogg N']","['Leukocyte Adhesion Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism/*physiology', 'Binding Sites/immunology', 'CD18 Antigens/*metabolism/physiology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Calgranulin A', 'Calgranulin B', 'Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Cell Size/drug effects/immunology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/*metabolism/physiology', 'Neutrophils/immunology/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/07 00:00,1998/05/07 00:01,['1998/05/07 00:00'],"['1998/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Feb 1;160(3):1427-35.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Calgranulin B)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of small molecules, such as verapamil and cyclosporin A, bind to P-glycoprotein and inhibit its ability to pump out antitumor drugs. The kinetics of P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of various anthracycline derivatives was measured in multidrug-resistant (MDR) K562 cells in the presence of verapamil. Used for the purpose were daunorubicin, idarubicin and 8-S-fluoro-idarubicin which have the same pKa of deprotonation equal to 8.4, but different lipophilicity, 4'-epi-2'-bromo-daunorubicin which has a lipophilicity which is comparable to that of daunorubicin but a pKa equal to 6.3, pirarubicin with pKa equal to 7.7 and lipophilicity different from that of these derivatives were used. Our data show (1) that verapamil is unable to completely block the P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of anthracyclines and that 10% of its functionality remains even with high verapamil concentrations, (2) that the ability of verapamil to restore intracellular accumulation of anthracyclines in MDR cells depends on the kinetics of their uptake. With fast kinetics uptake, as is the case for idarubicin, 8-S-fluoro-idarubicin, 4'-epi-2'-bromo-daunorubicin and pirarubicin (which have either a low pKa and/or high lipophilicity), verapamil can restore in multidrug resistant cells an intracellular drug level which is comparable to that observed in sensitive cells. This is not possible when the kinetics of uptake is low as is the case for daunorubicin. Cyclosporin A is a more potent modulator and is able to fully restore daunorubicin accumulation in multidrug resistant cells.","['Mankhetkorn, S', 'Garnier-Suillerot, A']","['Mankhetkorn S', 'Garnier-Suillerot A']","['Laboratoire de Physicochimie Biomoleculaire et Cellulaire, (UA CNRS 2056) Universite Paris Nord, Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1998/05/07 00:00,1998/05/07 00:01,['1998/05/07 00:00'],"['1998/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(97)01548-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(97)01548-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1998 Feb 19;343(2-3):313-21. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(97)01548-3.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors selected controls in a 3:1 ratio to cases from persons who died of causes other than leukemia, brain cancer, and breast cancer. Overall associations with electrical occupations were modest (i.e., adjusted odds ratios of 1.2, 1.1, and 1.3 for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, respectively). Individual electrical occupations were associated more strongly with disease than overall electrical occupations, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, for which relative risks ranged from 2 to 5 across several job categories.

Factors generated by the oviduct cells (epithelial cells and fibroblasts) create the microenvironment for fertilization and first embryo stage development. Hence, it is feasible that the oviduct cells also synthesize LIF to promote and condition the embryo for implantation in the uterus. In the present study, we investigated whether cultured bovine oviduct epithelial cells and fibroblasts synthesize LIF. LIF production was measured in the conditioned medium of oviduct epithelial cells and fibroblasts, using LIF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, expression of LIF mRNA was confirmed by LIF reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in extracts of RNA from oviduct epithelial/fibroblast cells. Quantitatively similar amounts of LIF were detected in the culture medium of epithelial cells and fibroblasts. In cells cultured for 1-7 days, the levels of LIF in the medium increased in a time-dependent manner. As compared to untreated cells, treatment of cells with 17beta-oestradiol (1-100 ng/ ml), but not progesterone (1-100 ng/ml) and insulin (20 ng/ml), increased the levels of LIF in a concentration-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Similarly, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (100 ng/ml) significantly induced the levels of LIF. The effects of 17beta-oestradiol (50 ng/ml) on LIF synthesis were enhanced and not blocked in the presence of tamoxifen (1 microg/ml), an oestrogen receptor antagonist, suggesting that the stimulatory effects of 17beta-oestradiol on LIF synthesis are not receptor-mediated. In conclusion 17beta-oestradiol, but not progesterone, induces LIF synthesis by bovine oviduct epithelial cells and fibroblasts and this may play an important role in the biology of early embryo development. However, the exact pathophysiological role of LIF within the oviduct needs to be further investigated.","['Reinhart, K C', 'Dubey, R K', 'Mummery, C L', 'van Rooijen, M', 'Keller, P J', 'Marinella, R']","['Reinhart KC', 'Dubey RK', 'Mummery CL', 'van Rooijen M', 'Keller PJ', 'Marinella R']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Clinic for Endocrinology, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Fallopian Tubes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Insulin/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Estrogen/physiology', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1998/05/07 00:00,1998/05/07 00:01,['1998/05/07 00:00'],"['1998/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/molehr/4.3.301 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 1998 Mar;4(3):301-8. doi: 10.1093/molehr/4.3.301.,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The target DNA sequences for this study were the beta-globin gene locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive site 2 (HS-2) and the beta-globin gene promoter. The DNA fragments produced by HDM damage in these target sequences were selectively amplified by the ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) and analyzed at nucleotide resolution by DNA-sequencing gel electrophoresis. The DNA sequences damaged by HDM in the cellular environment were found to be similar to that observed in the purified genomic DNA. However, substantial differences did occur between the intensity of cellular and purified genomic DNA reaction products at discrete regions corresponding to transcription factor-binding motifs. This was most apparent in the LCR HS-2 at the tandem NF-E2/AP-1 motif, where the DNA damage activity of HDM was severely impaired. This motif has been shown to bind to the erythroid-specific nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2) and the widely distributed activator protein-1 (AP-1). The HDM damage protection patterns or ""genomic footprints"" observed at this motif were probably caused by protein-DNA interactions with one or both of these transcription factors. This result indicates that the DNA damaging activity of HDM in cells is sensitive to bound nuclear factors. Because HDM can enter intact cells, where its DNA damaging activity is modulated by protein-DNA interactions, it may have application in genomic footprinting experiments.","['Cairns, M J', 'Murray, V']","['Cairns MJ', 'Murray V']","['School of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Anthraquinones/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*drug effects/genetics', '*DNA Damage', 'Globins/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Locus Control Region/genetics', 'Multigene Family', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/07 00:00,1998/05/07 00:01,['1998/05/07 00:00'],"['1998/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.1998.17.325 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1998 Apr;17(4):325-33. doi: 10.1089/dna.1998.17.325.,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11048-97-8 (hedamycin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NF-IL6 is phosphorylated and activated by a Ras-dependent MAP kinase cascade, while STAT3/APRF is directly tyrosine-phosphorylated by JAK kinases that associate with the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor, and translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription (JAK-STAT pathway). STAT3 is also tyrosine phosphorylated in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), leptin and other IL-6-type cytokines including ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), oncostatin M and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Mice deficient in the genes for NF-IL6 and STAT3 were generated. NF-IL6 mice were highly susceptible to facultative intracellular bacteria owing to ineffective killing of the pathogens by the macrophages. Futhermore, the tumor cytotoxicity of macrophages from NF-IL6 KO mice was severely impaired. These results demonstrate a crucial role of NF-IL6 in macrophage bactericidal and tumoricidal activities. The target disruption of STAT3 resulted in embryonic lethality prior to gastrulation, demonstrating that STAT3 is essential for the early development of mouse embryos.","['Akira, S']",['Akira S'],"['Department of Biochemistry, Hyogo College of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology']",1998/05/07 00:00,1998/05/07 00:01,['1998/05/07 00:00'],"['1998/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(97)00063-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s1357-2725(97)00063-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 1997 Dec;29(12):1401-18. doi: 10.1016/s1357-2725(97)00063-0.,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,158,,,,,,,,,,,

We have been interested in the process of tumor progression in the AKR lymphoma system. In the present study, two newly isolated variants, the TAU-42 and TAU-44, were characterized with respect to their biological behavior, by comparing them to a previously studied low-malignancy variant, the TAU-39. While the TAU-44 variant formed large s.c. local tumors, the TAU-42 variant formed only small growths or none at all. The TAU-42 lymphoma was found to have the highest malignant potential: it displayed very marked dissemination to spleen, lymph nodes, liver and lungs. The TAU-44 variant had an intermediate degree of metastatic potential but presented a predilection for spread to lymph nodes and spleen and was sometimes found to metastasize to peculiar organs, such as heart and pancreas. Cells derived from the different lymphoma variants varied in their immunophenotype: the highly malignant variant cells expressed more CD4 antigen than the low-malignancy one. The opposite was observed with regard to CD8. The variant cells also differed in their migrating capacity, the more malignant one exhibiting a higher motile activity.

Amphotericin-B is frequently given to these patients, both therapeutically and prophylactically, and has been described to have a negative impact on the results of platelet transfusions. We conducted a prospective study of the effect of amphotericin-B on transfused platelet recovery and survival in 81 BMT or acute leukaemia patients. One hundred and ninety-five platelet transfusions administered to 81 consecutive patients were analysed. The platelets were transfused 2 h after the completion of amphotericin-B. Using this schedule resulted in no effect of amphotericin-B on platelet recovery or survival, although platelet increments were modestly depressed in patients receiving high- vs. low-dose amphotericin-B. We conclude that the timing of amphotericin-B infusion be evaluated in patients demonstrating poor platelet recovery and survival.

However, the patient died 4 days after the platelets were transfused. The cause of death was given as cardiovascular shock, entirely compatible with an overwhelming bacteraemic and septic episode. A coroner's verdict of accidental death due to transfusion of a contaminated unit of platelets was recorded. On subsequent investigation Cl. perfringens type A serotype PS68,PS80 (identical to that found in the platelet bag) was cultured from the venepuncture site of the arm of one of the donors who contributed towards the platelet pool. The donor had two young children and frequently changed nappies. Faecal contamination of the venepuncture site was the suspected source for the transmission of Cl. perfringens, an organism commonly found in the soil and intestinal tract of humans.

However, the apoptotic response appears to vary between cell types (normal or transformed) and between types of malignancy. Thus, irradiation induces apoptosis in normal human lymphocytes but not in lymphocytes derived from a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Moreover, in this subset, spontaneous apoptosis is inhibited by irradiation. Why irradiation does not allow the initiation of the apoptotic death pathway could be explained, at least in part, and in agreement with recent findings on experimental models, by the activation of the transcriptional factor NF-kappaB, which is able to inhibit apoptotic cell response. Low doses (at which no effect is observed with normal human lymphocytes) of the highly specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin are sufficient to trigger apoptosis in these malignant cells. Proteasome inhibition by lactacystin prevents the nuclear translocation of both p50 and p65 NF-kappaB subunits and sensitizes these cells to apoptosis by tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha treatment. As this subset of CLL is totally resistant to any treatment, proteasome inhibition by lactacystin provides a new therapeutic approach to be explored, considering the sensitivity of malignant CLL-derived lymphocytes to be quite different from that of normal human lymphocytes.","['Delic, J', 'Masdehors, P', 'Omura, S', 'Cosset, J M', 'Dumont, J', 'Binet, J L', 'Magdelenat, H']","['Delic J', 'Masdehors P', 'Omura S', 'Cosset JM', 'Dumont J', 'Binet JL', 'Magdelenat H']","['Laboratoire de Recherche Correspondant No2 du CEA (DSV/DRR, Fontenay Aux Roses) Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1998/05/06 00:00,1998/05/06 00:01,['1998/05/06 00:00'],"['1998/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.183 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Apr;77(7):1103-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.183.,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",['Br J Cancer. 1999 Jan;79(2):375-6.

Although the detailed mechanism is unknown, the protein products of these two genes form protein dimers with each other and the relative ratio of the two proteins is believed to be a determinant of the balance between life and death. In our preliminary study, we found that K562 erythroleukemia cells have an extremely low level of endogenous Bcl-2 expression and a fairly high level of endogenous Bax expression. We constructed Bax and Bcl-2 expression vectors and transfected them into K562 cells. We found that transfection of Bax vector increased the expression of Bax protein; a shortened form of Bax also appeared. Cell death analysis using the Annexin V assay showed that the Bax vector caused significantly more apoptotic cells that the Bcl-2 or pCI-neo vector did. After selection with G418, Bax, Bcl-2 and pCI-neo stably transfected cells were established. These three cell lines were examined for their response to the chemotherapeutic agents ara-C, doxorubicin, etoposide and SN-38. Bax-K562 cells showed significantly higher fractions of apoptotic cells than pCI-neo-K562 cells when treated with ara-C, doxorubicin or SN-38. No sensitization effect was seen when etoposide was used. In contrast, Bcl-2-K562 cells had fewer apoptotic cells than pCI-neo-K562 cells after treatment with all these agents. Therefore, Bax may sensitize K562 cells to apoptosis induced by a wide range of, but not all, chemotherapeutic agents.","['Kobayashi, T', 'Ruan, S', 'Clodi, K', 'Kliche, K O', 'Shiku, H', 'Andreeff, M', 'Zhang, W']","['Kobayashi T', 'Ruan S', 'Clodi K', 'Kliche KO', 'Shiku H', 'Andreeff M', 'Zhang W']","['Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/05/06 00:00,1998/05/06 00:01,['1998/05/06 00:00'],"['1998/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201681 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Mar 26;16(12):1587-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201681.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Treatment of Ph-positive K562, TOM 1 and KCL-22 cells with etoposide for 2d induced cytosolic vacuolation, but not nuclear condensation or DNA fragmentation. The bcr/abl kinase-selective inhibitor herbimycin A increased the induction of nuclear apoptosis by etoposide or gamma-radiation. The concentration of herbimycin required to synergize with etoposide was similar to that required to decrease the level of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins or of the protein tyrosine kinase activity of anti-abl immune complexes in K562 cells. The ability of herbimycin A to sensitize K562, TOM 1 or KCL-22 cells to apoptosis induction correlated with its ability to decrease the cellular content of phosphotyrosyl proteins in these Philadelphia-positive lines. Enhancement of nuclear apoptosis by herbimycin was not attributable to downregulation of the bcl-2 or bcl-XL anti-apoptotic proteins. In contrast, herbimycin protected Philadelphia-negative HL60 cells from apoptosis induction by etoposide and did not affect killing of NC37 and CEM cells. The data suggest that the induction of apoptosis is blocked in cells expressing the bcr/abl oncoprotein and that herbimycin A increases induction of programmed cell death following DNA damage.

The LIF signal transducing complex contains two receptor molecules, the LIF receptor (LIFR) and gp130. The extracellular region of the LIFR is unique in that it includes three membrane-proximal fibronectin type III domains and two cytokine binding domains (CBDs) separated by an immunoglobulin-like domain. Although some mutagenesis data on LIF are available, it is not yet known which regions of LIFR or gp130 bind LIF. Nor is it known whether LIFR contacts gp130 in a manner similar to the growth hormone receptor dimer and, if so, through which of its CBDs. To attempt to elucidate these matters and to investigate the receptor complex, models of the CBDs of LIFR and the CBD of gp130 were constructed. Analyses of the electrostatic isopotential surfaces of the CBD models suggest that gp130 and the membrane-proximal CBD of LIFR hetero-dimerize and bind LIF through contacts similar to those seen in the growth hormone receptor dimer. This work further demonstrates the utility of electrostatic analyses of homology models and suggests a strategy for biochemical investigations of the LIF-receptor complex.","['Smith, D K', 'Treutlein, H R']","['Smith DK', 'Treutlein HR']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*chemistry', 'Binding Sites/physiology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Dimerization', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*chemistry', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Somatotropin/chemistry', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Static Electricity']",1998/05/06 00:00,1998/05/06 00:01,['1998/05/06 00:00'],"['1998/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pro.5560070406 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Sci. 1998 Apr;7(4):886-96. doi: 10.1002/pro.5560070406.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Somatotropin)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",,,,,,,PMC2143991,,,,,,,,

Samples were derived from patients with mycosis fungoides but no marrow involvement, who were undergoing low-dose IFN-alpha treatment. Parameters included density of reticulin (argyrophilic) fibers, CD61+ megakaryocytes, PGM1+ macrophages, the GSA-I lectin-expressing (activated) macrophage subpopulation, proliferative activity (PCNA staining), and apoptosis. Following IFN-alpha therapy (3 x 3 x 10(6) U/week between 6 and 21 months), morphometric evaluation of sequential bone marrow examinations revealed a significant increase in the number of megakaryocytes and the amount of reticulin fibers. Additionally, there was an overall decrease in PCNA+ cells, accompanied by a reduction in the incidence of apoptotic bodies. On the other hand, total number of macrophages and their activated subfraction remained unchanged. Opposed to in vitro findings, a fibrogenetic capacity of IFN-alpha associated with megakaryocyte growth was detectable. Moreover, contrasting with effects of IFN-alpha treatment in chronic myelogenous leukemia, the incidence of apoptosis was significantly reduced. This feature was assumed to contribute to a maintenance of steady-state hematopoiesis expressed by a nonaltered bone marrow cellularity in our specimens.","['Thiele, J', 'Wickenhauser, C', 'Neuwirth, C', 'Schulze, H J', 'Flucke, U', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Borchmann, P', 'Krech, R', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Neuwirth C', 'Schulze HJ', 'Flucke U', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Borchmann P', 'Krech R', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.

These hybrid molecules show similar redox properties to those of 6-nitro-5-deazaflavins with no pyrrolecarboxamide(s) group, suggesting that they generate stable one- and two-electron reduction product(s). Electrolytic reductions of the hybrid molecules were carried out at a controlled potential under anaerobic conditions in the presence of plasmid pBR322 DNA. Significant conversions of the supercoiled circular pBR322 DNA (form I) to the open circular DNA (form II) have been found by treatment with the reductively activated 6-nitro-5-deazaflavin derivatives. Their DNA damaging effects have been found to be enhanced as the number of pyrrolecarboxamide group as the DNA binder increases. Antitumor activities of the hybrid molecules towards KB and L1210 cells were evaluated in vitro. It has been found that the antitumor effects of the compounds on KB cells slightly change and those on L1210 cells decrease as the number of the pyrrolecarboxamide group increases. These results reveal that the combination of 6-nitro-5-deazaflavin molecule with the pyrrolecarboxamide(s) group increase the DNA binding properties of the compounds, giving rise to promoted DNA damaging effects, and also suggest that the combination would affect the capacity of the compounds to act as the substrate for intracellular reductases and/or the cellular uptake of the compounds.","['Kanaoka, Y', 'Ikeuchi, Y', 'Kawamoto, T', 'Bessho, K', 'Akimoto, N', 'Mikata, Y', 'Nishida, M', 'Yano, S', 'Sasaki, T', 'Yoneda, F']","['Kanaoka Y', 'Ikeuchi Y', 'Kawamoto T', 'Bessho K', 'Akimoto N', 'Mikata Y', 'Nishida M', 'Yano S', 'Sasaki T', 'Yoneda F']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flavins/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Pyrroles/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1998/05/06 00:00,1998/05/06 00:01,['1998/05/06 00:00'],"['1998/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(97)10036-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0896(97)10036-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 1998 Mar;6(3):301-14. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0896(97)10036-0.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '26908-38-3 (5-deazaflavin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A report of two cases with diagnostic features in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens.,377-83,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare condition that has been associated with myriad diseases and disorders. Alveolar spaces are progressively filled with a phospholipoproteinaceous material, presumably related to a derangement of surfactant production and/or catabolism. The cytologic features of PAP in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sediments are unique, and recognition of these characteristics can help guide clinical intervention. CASES: A 47-year-old male with a history of progressive dyspnea and recent pneumonia presented with a five-lobe alveolar infiltrate and subsequently underwent bronchoscopic examination. A 31-year-old female with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast transformation developed unresponsive pulmonary infiltrates necessitating bronchoscopy with lavage. Both BAL lavage fluid sediments contained a homogeneous, basophilic, granular material typical of PAP. The material was composed of extracellular, multilamellated bodies when viewed by electron microscopy. Both patients required repeated therapeutic whole lung lavage, and one died of the disease eight months after the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation, grossly milky BAL fluid and fluid sediment with light microscopic findings of basophilic, periodic acid-Schiff-positive, granular debris with cholesterol crystals and a few alveolar macrophages suggest this process. The light microscopic findings can be confirmed by ultramicroscopic demonstration of extracellular multilamellated bodies. BAL with appropriate examination of the effluent sediment facilitates the diagnosis of PAP.","['Sosolik, R C', 'Gammon, R R', 'Julius, C J', 'Ayers, L W']","['Sosolik RC', 'Gammon RR', 'Julius CJ', 'Ayers LW']","['Department of Pathology, Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,IM,"['Adult', '*Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis/diagnosis/*pathology/physiopathology']",1998/05/06 00:00,1998/05/06 00:01,['1998/05/06 00:00'],"['1998/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000331620 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1998 Mar-Apr;42(2):377-83. doi: 10.1159/000331620.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vesnarinone treatment combined with radiation resulted in a higher antitumour activity compared with a single treatment with either vesnarinone or radiation alone. Further, vesnarinone treatment together with radiation and conventional anticancer agents including 5-FU and picibanil (an immunopotentiator) produced the highest antitumour effect compared with any other treatment. Additionally, the combination treatment induced marked differentiation and apoptosis of the tumour cells and an increase in the expression of p53 gene in the treated tumour cells.

The percentage of growth (PG), 50% inhibition of growth (GI50), the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and the concentration required for 50% lethality of cells (IC50) were examined and calculated in the presence of various (from 10(-4) to 10(-8) M) concentrations of phenothiazine alkylurea derivatives. The following cell lines were involved in the study: 6 leukemia, 9 non-small-cell lung cancer, 7 colon cancer, 6 central nervous system cancer, 8 melanoma, 6 ovarian cancer, 8 renal cancer, 2 prostate and 8 breast cancer cell lines. The antileukemic activity of four chloroethyl-substituted phenothiazine-alkylureas was shown by considerable growth inhibition, in the 10(-5) M range, of the six different leukemia cell lines. The 50% inhibition of growth was nearly the same for the four compounds on all cell lines. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and IC50 value to cells varied from -4.0 to -4.66. The two derivatives with the butylene bridge were more effective than propylene linked compounds against the CCRP-CEM, HL60 (TB), K-562 and MOLT-4 cell lines. However, the anti-leukemic activity of the derivatives was nearly the same for RPMT 8226 and SR cell lines. The substituent at the 2- position of phenothiazine ring and the length of the linker between the side chain nitrogen and the phenothiazine ring system are apparently important for antileukemic activity. Four of the 9 non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines were sensitive, while the other 5 cell lines were not. The compounds had a slight growth inhibitory effect on colon cell carcinoma and melanoma cells in which case the butylene linker seemed to be more effective than the propylene linker. At the same time, all of the compounds were weak or mostly inactive on cancer cells from the central nervous system. One ovarian cancer line of the 6, the IGROVI was sensitive to butylurea phenothiazines, however, the other five were not sensitive at all. The difference in the sensitivity of various renal cell carcinomas was significant: 5 lines were not sensitive, three of them (786-0, RXF-393 and TK-10) were sensitive to only butylene-substituted phenothiazine-ureas, propylene substitution resulted in ineffective compounds. The compounds were not able to inhibit the 2 prostate and 4 breast cancer cell lines, even at 10(-4) M. It was interesting that propylene-linked ureas were more effective than butylene-linked derivatives on MCF-7, but butylene-linked derivatives were more effective than propylene-linked compounds on MDA MB-231 and MDA-N. In addition, MDA MB 435 was more sensitive to the trifluoromethyl derivatives than the compounds without this substituent. Since the phthalimido-alkyl phenothiazines were not active at the first level of prescreen, these compounds were omitted from this study. The drug sensitivity of some cancer cell lines was not uniform for the different groups, therefore we postulate that the resistance can be related to some kind of (existing) drug-efflux mechanism. Apparently, the tumor specificity of phenothiazine alkylureas is more related to the leukemia specificity of alkylureas than to any CNS or lung specificity of phenothiazines.","['Wuonola, M A', 'Palfreyman, M G', 'Motohashi, N', 'Kawase, M', 'Gabay, S', 'Gupta, R R', 'Molnar, J']","['Wuonola MA', 'Palfreyman MG', 'Motohashi N', 'Kawase M', 'Gabay S', 'Gupta RR', 'Molnar J']","['SCRIPTGEN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Medford, MA 02155, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Phenothiazines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1998/05/06 00:00,1998/05/06 00:01,['1998/05/06 00:00'],"['1998/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 Jan-Feb;18(1A):337-48.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Phenothiazines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K1 is reportedly cytotoxic. Since access to this natural product is severely limited, the entire synthesis of K1 has been achieved in K. Buszek's laboratory, and several of its structural and stereochemical analogs (code names K3-K9) have been tested for their ability to prevent murine L1210 leukemic cells from synthesizing macromolecules and growing in vitro. At 50 microM, K1 is inactive and the eight-membered lactone K4, an oxocene, is the only compound found to inhibit tumor cell growth by about 90% in the L1210 system. The long-term inhibition of L1210 cell growth by K4 is concentration dependent (IC50 around 10 microM) and not reversible following drug removal. The delayed and weaker cytotoxic effects of K4 suggest that the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation observed 1-4 days after K4 treatment is not solely caused by drug cytotoxicity. When compared to a spectrum of representative anticancer drugs, higher concentrations of K4 must be used to maximally inhibit tumor cell growth. In contrast to its antiproliferative activity, 50 microM K4 fails to alter the rates of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis in L1210 cells. This discrepancy between the ability of K4 to inhibit macromolecule synthesis and leukemic cell growth suggests that other molecular targets are involved in the antitumor action of this drug. At 50 microM, K4 inhibits the polymerization of purified tubulin by about 45%, and therefore may be a novel microtubule de-stabilizing drug weaker than vincristine. Even though other mechanisms may be involved in its antitumor action, the ability of K4 to partially disrupt microtubule dynamics indirectly suggests that this synthetic oxocene may be a cell cycle-specific anticancer drug that blocks mammalian cells in M-phase.","['Perchellet, J P', 'Perchellet, E M', 'Newell, S W', 'Freeman, J A', 'Ladesich, J B', 'Jeong, Y', 'Sato, N', 'Buszek, K']","['Perchellet JP', 'Perchellet EM', 'Newell SW', 'Freeman JA', 'Ladesich JB', 'Jeong Y', 'Sato N', 'Buszek K']","['Anti-Cancer Drug Laboratory, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506, USA. jpperch@ksu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Camptothecin/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Lactones/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/06 00:00,1998/05/06 00:01,['1998/05/06 00:00'],"['1998/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 Jan-Feb;18(1A):97-106.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (octalactin K4)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell surface Env is frequently detected using an indirect immunofluorescence assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We found that the detection of Env in this manner requires the expression of the MoMuLV receptor (ATRC-1) on the cell surface, and the level of envelope protein detected correlates with the level of receptors expressed on the cell. In addition, Env detection corresponds to the Env protein's ability to bind to its receptor and can be competed out by the addition of a truncated form of the Env protein. These data suggest that Env detected on the cell surface by the FACS assay is protein that has rebound to its receptor after being secreted or shed, rather than actual surface-expressed protein. In contrast, a combined immunoprecipitation and biotinylation assay detected equal amounts of Env on the surface of both receptor-lacking and receptor-expressing cell lines. The immunoprecipitation-biotinylation assay is therefore a more appropriate method for detecting surface expression of the MoMuLV envelope protein.","['Yu, H', 'Empig, C', 'Xia, J', 'Anderson, W F']","['Yu H', 'Empig C', 'Xia J', 'Anderson WF']","['Gene Therapy Laboratories, Norris Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",1998/05/06 00:00,1998/05/06 00:01,['1998/05/06 00:00'],"['1998/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99073-0 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9073 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Apr 10;243(2):415-22. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9073.,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",,,,,,['CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Since compounds that chemically attack the cysteines of the finger have been shown to inactivate both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) in vitro, 14 of these compounds were tested in an MuLV-induced Friend disease model to assess their ability to inhibit retroviral replication in vivo. Of the 14 compounds tested, only Aldrithiol-2 clearly exhibited anti-retroviral activity as measured indirectly by the delay of Friend disease onset (P < 0.05). These results were confirmed by quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction studies which monitored viral spread by measuring the level of viral DNA in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of treated mice. Comparison of treated mice with untreated mice revealed that Aldrithiol-2 produced a greater than 2-log reduction in virus levels. These results functionally demonstrate that a zinc finger-attacking compound can inhibit viral replication in vivo. Since only 1 of the 14 compounds studied was effective, this study also shows the importance of in vivo testing of these types of antiviral compounds in an animal model. Given the strict conservation of the metal-coordinating cysteine structure within HIV-1 and MuLV zinc fingers, our results support the proposal that anti-retroviral drugs which target the nucleocapsid zinc finger may be clinically useful against HIV-1.","['Ott, D E', 'Hewes, S M', 'Alvord, W G', 'Henderson, L E', 'Arthur, L O']","['Ott DE', 'Hewes SM', 'Alvord WG', 'Henderson LE', 'Arthur LO']","['AIDS Vaccine Program, SAIC/Frederick, National Cancer Institute, Maryland 21702-1201, USA. ott@avpvx1.ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/virology', 'Mice', 'Nucleocapsid/*drug effects', 'Retroviridae Infections/*drug therapy/virology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/drug effects', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*drug therapy/virology', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects', '*Zinc Fingers']",1998/05/06 00:00,1998/05/06 00:01,['1998/05/06 00:00'],"['1998/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99062-6 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9062 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Apr 10;243(2):283-92. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9062.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '6OK753033Z (dibenzothiazyl disulfide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of p53 in the cell cycle control and in the modulating action of chemotherapeutic agents].,671-8,"p53 is a ""tumor suppressor gene"" with a basic function in the cellular cycle control and subsequently in the induction of the neoplastic process. p53 found changed in the majority of malignant human tumors. In the oral and maxillofacial cancers p53 mutations varies from 4% to 60% of the cases. Researches in vitro in tumors of the colon-rectum, breast, lung, ovary, testicle, bladder and in leukaemia, show a correlation between p53 overexpression (mutation) and resistance to the anti-tumor agents. The functional connection between the p53 and the chemotherapic drugs action which cause a direct DNA damage, is the apoptosis, a physiologic mechanism activated by p53 for regulating cell growth but also indispensable for the cytotoxic effects (apoptosis is an irreversible process culminating in cell death). Loss of the p53 activity (mutation) in the tumoral cells determines non-activation of the apoptosis and the drug resistance. These results have led to early clinical applications. In the breast cancers the p53 is already utilized as chemoresistance marker, directing the therapy, if changed to alternative drugs (Taxolo) which have a p53-independent action. Even into cell lung cancers a retroviral vector containing the wild-type p53 gene was produced to mediate transfer of wild-type p53, noting tumor regression. In oral and maxillofacial tumors surgery is elective. It is emphasized that, in advanced cancers, it is included in multimode protocols where the neoadjuvant chemotherapy has an important clinical function, with precise indications.

During the 50s, the successive descriptions of virus-induced sarcoma-leukemias in mice led to the oncogene theory and gradually to the postulation of a viral origin of cancer. The discovery of the reverse transcriptase in 1970 led to the establishment of the Retroviridae family including both onco and lentiviruses. The decade of the 80s was marked by three fundamental discoveries which altered the concept of oncovirus: 1) oncogenes became established as part of the cellular genome converting retroviruses into occasional vectors of the oncogene; 2) as the T cell growth factor, interleukin-2, became available, the first human oncovirus, HTLV-I, was isolated and proved to be the cause of adult T cell leukemia; 3) HIV was isolated and classified as a lentivirus and as the cause of AIDS. A few years later the antioncogenes were discovered. Both oncogenes and anti-oncogenes were found to collaborate in the cell cycle, maintaining an equilibrium between proliferation and apoptosis. Today the viral theory has been replaced by the gene theory of cancer which postulates that neoplastic transformation is the result of a cascade of events which include uncorrected DNA errors, blocking of apoptosis, activation of oncogenes and deletion of antioncogenes. At the present time, the intriguing question for retrovirologists is the role played by endogenous retroviruses which in man occupy up to 0.1% of the cellular genome.","['Dosne Pasqualini, C']",['Dosne Pasqualini C'],"['Division Medicina Experimental, ILEX-CONICET, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",Argentina,Medicina (B Aires),Medicina,0204271,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genome, Viral', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', '*Retroviridae/classification/genetics/growth & development', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*history']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/05/06 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Medicina (B Aires). 1997;57 Suppl 2:3-18.,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],,,Vision retrospectiva de la relacion entre los retrovirus y el cancer.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the extensive characterization of the PTK and its effects on cell function, relatively little is known about the nature of the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that may modulate p210 bcr-abl-induced signalling. In this study, we have demonstrated that expression of PTP1B is enhanced specifically in various cells expressing p210 bcr-abl, including a cell line derived from a patient with CML. This effect on expression of PTP1B required the kinase activity of p210 bcr-abl and occurred rapidly, concomitant with maximal activation of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the PTK. The effect is apparently specific for PTP1B since, among several PTPs tested, we detected no change in the levels of TCPTP, the closest relative of PTP1B. We have developed a strategy for identification of physiological substrates of individual PTPs which utilizes substrate-trapping mutant forms of the enzymes that retain the ability to bind to substrate but fail to catalyze efficient dephosphorylation. We have observed association between a substrate-trapping mutant of PTP1B (PTP1B-D181A) and p210 bcr-abl, but not v-Abl, in a cellular context. Consistent with the trapping data, we observed dephosphorylation of p210 bcr-abl, but not v-Abl, by PTP1B in vivo. We have demonstrated that PTP1B inhibited binding of the adapter protein Grb2 to p210 bcr-abl and suppressed p210 bcr-abl-induced transcriptional activation that is dependent on Ras. These results illustrate selectivity in the effects of PTPs in a cellular context and suggest that PTP1B may function as a specific, negative regulator of p210 bcr-abl signalling in vivo.","['LaMontagne, K R Jr', 'Flint, A J', 'Franza, B R Jr', 'Pandergast, A M', 'Tonks, N K']","['LaMontagne KR Jr', 'Flint AJ', 'Franza BR Jr', 'Pandergast AM', 'Tonks NK']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York 11724-2208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/05 02:03,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/05/05 02:03'],"['1998/05/05 02:03 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/05/05 02:03 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.5.2965 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 May;18(5):2965-75. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.5.2965.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Grb2 protein, rat)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,"['CA61033/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC110676,,,,,,,,

It plays an essential role in definitive hematopoiesis and is frequently involved in the chromosomal abnormalities associated with leukemia. In the present study, we report functionally separable modular structures in PEBP2 alphaB1 for DNA binding and for transcriptional activation. DNA binding through the Runt domain of PEBP2 alphaB1 was hindered by the adjacent carboxy-terminal region, and this inhibition was relieved by interaction with the beta subunit. Utilizing a reporter assay system in which both the alpha and beta subunits are required to achieve strong transactivation, we uncovered the presence of transcriptional activation and inhibitory domains in PEBP2 alphaB1 that were only apparent in the presence of the beta subunit. The inhibitory domain keeps the full transactivation potential of full-length PEBP2 alphaB1 below its maximum potential. Fusion of the transactivation domain of PEBP2 alphaB1 to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain conferred transactivation potential, but further addition of the inhibitory domain diminished the activity. These results suggest that the activity of the alpha subunit as a transcriptional activator is regulated intramolecularly as well as by the beta subunit. PEBP2 alphaB1 and the beta subunit were targeted to the nuclear matrix via signals distinct from the nuclear localization signal. Moreover, the transactivation domain by itself was capable of associating with the nuclear matrix, which implies the existence of a relationship between transactivation and nuclear matrix attachment.","['Kanno, T', 'Kanno, Y', 'Chen, L F', 'Ogawa, E', 'Kim, W Y', 'Ito, Y']","['Kanno T', 'Kanno Y', 'Chen LF', 'Ogawa E', 'Kim WY', 'Ito Y']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Matrix/metabolism', 'Polyomavirus', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1998/05/05 00:00,1998/05/05 00:01,['1998/05/05 00:00'],"['1998/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.5.2444 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 May;18(5):2444-54. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.5.2444.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Runx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,PMC110624,,,,,,,,

To provide further evidence that interference with the activation of NF-kappaB affects the maturation of HL-60 leukemia cells by creating an environment conducive to terminal differentiation, we measured the effects of phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides to the various subunits of NF-kappaB on the differentiation of HL-60 cells produced by low levels of vitamin D3. When used alone these oligonucleotides had no significant effect on the differentiation of HL-60 cells. However, the antisense oligomer to the Rel A subunit of NF-kappaB markedly increased the extent of differentiation produced by low levels of vitamin D3. An enhancement of the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by vitamin D3 was also obtained by several transcription factor decoys designed to mimic the consensus sequences of genes activated by Rel A.

The pluripotency of ES cells is maintained by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the family of interleukin-6-type cytokines. These cytokines activate Janus tyrosine kinases and signal transducer and activator of transcription factors (Stat) via the signalling receptor component gp130. Pluripotent ES1 cells proliferating in the presence of LIF were known from previous studies to contain Stat3 and Stat1 capable of transcriptional activation. Here we report that the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 decreases rapidly during differentiation induced by treatment of ES1 cells either with retinoic acid (RA) or by withdrawal of LIF. In line with this finding, the DNA-binding activity of Stat3 decreased during differentiation. In contrast, Stat5 was absent from pluripotent proliferating ES cells, but appeared early after induction of differentiation. The positive correlation between induction of differentiation and expression of Stat5 mRNA was confirmed for three independent ES cell lines. Stat5 transcripts were detectable in ES1 cells as early as 12 h after treatment with RA and 36 h after withdrawal of LIF. Stat5 protein was detectable 2 days after the onset of differentiation. These results establish Stat5 as a novel marker of very early stages of differentiation of ES cells.","['Nemetz, C', 'Hocke, G M']","['Nemetz C', 'Hocke GM']","['Department of Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Blastocyst/*chemistry/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Stem Cells/*chemistry/cytology', 'Trans-Activators/*analysis']",1998/05/05 00:00,1998/05/05 00:01,['1998/05/05 00:00'],"['1998/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60624-1 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.1998.6250213.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1998 Mar;62(5):213-20. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.1998.6250213.x.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new family of cationic lipids, called phosphonolipids, has been developed, with the relationship between the hydrophobic domain of the lipid molecules and the significant enhancement of transduction efficiency in a non-adherent cell line characterised in the present study. The kinetics of transfection efficiency were also investigated. Our results demonstrate that the peak of the transient expression of these reporter genes mediated by cationic lipids occurred within 3 to 14 days, depending on the aliphatic chain length of the complex used and on its formulation in the presence or absence of DOPE. Furthermore, the kinetics of transgene expression were found to differ in adherent and non-adherent cells. These results were obtained using three different techniques: CPRG, luminescence, and FACS-gal, and were in agreement with electron microscopy studies. We thus hypothesized that the plasma membrane composition of cells could affect the efficiency of transfection with cationic lipids.

In the present study, we examined the role of the TNF-alpha autocrine loop in PMA-induced macrophage differentiation and gene expression of 92- and 72-kDa gelatinases (MMP-9 and MMP-2). In HL-60 cells, PMA inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell adhesion and spreading, expression of surface maturation marker OKM1 and phagocytic activity, as well as the expression of both gelatinases, which all characterize the macrophage phenotype. In contrast, TNF-alpha alone was only effective in inhibiting cell proliferation. Blocking the endogenous TNF-alpha activity with neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibodies abolished all these PMA-induced events with the exception of MMP-2 gene expression. Since fibronectin (FN)-mediated cell adhesion and spreading are prerequisite for both macrophage differentiation and MMP-9 gene expression in HL-60 cells, we hypothesized that TNF-alpha might be involved in modulating the expression of either the FN or its integrin receptor genes. Whereas PMA substantially enhanced the steady state mRNA and protein levels of both FN and alpha5 beta1 integrins, TNF-alpha alone had little effect on the expression of these genes. However, anti-TNF-alpha antibodies blocked PMA-induced augmentation of both alpha5 and beta1 integrin gene expression without affecting the expression of the FN gene. Our results suggest that TNF-alpha may regulate macrophage differentiation and critical matrix-degrading activities of myeloid progenitor cells in an autocrine manner by augmenting surface levels of the alpha5 beta1 integrin, thus promoting interactions with the extracellular matrix, a key event for maturation and migration of these cells during inflammation.","['Xie, B', 'Laouar, A', 'Huberman, E']","['Xie B', 'Laouar A', 'Huberman E']","['Center for Mechanistic Biology and Biotechnology, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439-4833, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Collagenases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Fibronectins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gelatinases/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*cytology/*enzymology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Metalloendopeptidases/genetics', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/genetics/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",1998/06/13 00:00,1998/06/13 00:01,['1998/06/13 00:00'],"['1998/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.19.11583 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)89361-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 May 8;273(19):11583-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.19.11583.,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) markedly induced MMP-9 gene expression in HL-60 cells; the induction closely paralleled the timing and extent of PMA-induced cell adhesion and spreading, a hallmark of macrophage differentiation. Similarly, treatment with PMA or macrophage-colony stimulating factor stimulated adherence and spreading of blood monocytes with a concurrent 7- or 5-fold increase in MMP-9 production, respectively. In protein kinase C (PKC)-beta-deficient HL-60 variant cells (HL-525), PMA failed to induce cell adhesion and MMP-9 gene expression. Transfecting HL-525 cells with a PKC-beta expression plasmid restored PKC-beta levels and PMA inducibility of cell adhesion and spreading as well as MMP-9 gene expression. Induction of cell adhesion and MMP-9 gene expression in HL-60 cells and blood monocytes was strongly inhibited by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to fibronectin (FN) and its receptor alpha5 beta1 integrin. HL-525 cells, which constitutively display high levels of surface alpha5 beta1 integrin, adhered and spread on immobilized FN with concomitant induction of MMP-9 gene expression. Cytochalasins B and D were each a potent inhibitor of MMP-9 production. Our results suggest that alpha5 beta1 integrin-mediated interaction of immature hematopoietic cells with FN plays a critical role in modulating matrix-degrading activities during macrophage differentiation.","['Xie, B', 'Laouar, A', 'Huberman, E']","['Xie B', 'Laouar A', 'Huberman E']","['Center for Mechanistic Biology and Biotechnology, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439-4833, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Collagenases/*biosynthesis', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Fibronectins/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*physiology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*enzymology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Monocytes/cytology/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1998/06/13 00:00,1998/06/13 00:01,['1998/06/13 00:00'],"['1998/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.19.11576 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)89360-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 May 8;273(19):11576-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.19.11576.,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the apparent CD94-mediated specific recognition of different HLA class Ia allotypes, transfected into the HLA-defective cell line 721.221, indeed depends on their selective ability to concomitantly stabilize the surface expression of endogenous HLA-E molecules, which confer protection against CD94/NKG2-A+ effector cells. In the present study, we show that a selective engagement of the CD94/NKG2-A inhibitory receptor with a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Z199) was sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the NKG2-A subunit and SHP-1 recruitment. These early biochemical events, commonly related to negative signaling pathways, were also detected upon the specific interaction of NK cells with an HLA-E+ 721.221 transfectant (.221-AEH), and were prevented by pre-incubation of .221-AEH with an anti-HLA class I mAb. Furthermore, mAb cross-linking of the CD94/NKG2-A receptor, segregated from other NK-associated molecules by transfection into a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3), promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of NKG2-A and co-precipitation of SHP-1, together with an inhibition of secretory events triggered via Fc epsilonRI. Remarkably, interaction of CD94/NKG2-A+ RBL cells with the HLA-E+ .221-AEH transfectant specifically induced a detectable association of SHP-1 with NKG2-A, constituting a more formal evidence for the receptor-HLA class I interaction.","['Carretero, M', 'Palmieri, G', 'Llano, M', 'Tullio, V', 'Santoni, A', 'Geraghty, D E', 'Lopez-Botet, M']","['Carretero M', 'Palmieri G', 'Llano M', 'Tullio V', 'Santoni A', 'Geraghty DE', 'Lopez-Botet M']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital de la Princesa, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', '*Lectins, C-Type', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine']",1998/05/16 02:12,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/05/16 02:12'],"['1998/05/16 02:12 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/05/16 02:12 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199804)28:04<1280::AID-IMMU1280>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199804)28:04<1280::AID-IMMU1280>3.0.CO;2-O [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1998 Apr;28(4):1280-91. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199804)28:04<1280::AID-IMMU1280>3.0.CO;2-O.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-E antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (Klrd1 protein, rat)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, rat)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional analyses of CD82 revealed that 1) CD82 needs to exist on both T cells and U937 for the full activation of T cells; 2) CD82 expression is up-regulated on both T cells and U937 by stimulation such as CD3 ligation or treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; 3) overexpression of CD82 enhances both homotypic and heterotypic cell adhesion between T cells and U937; 4) CD82 signal co-stimulates T cells and the signal works synergistically with the CD28-mediated T cell co-stimulation signal; 5) in mixed leukocyte reactions using U937 as stimulator cells, CD82 overexpression on U937 correlates with the higher allogeneicity of U937 cells.

However, no test has been available to measure precursor frequencies of the important IL-4-secreting subset. METHODS: We have now established a limiting dilution analysis to measure the frequency of IL-4-producing T helper cells (IL-4/HTLp) using the IL-4-responsive indicator cell line CT.h4S and have applied this assay to measure alloreactive IL-4/HTLp frequencies in BMT donor-recipient pairs. These frequencies were then analyzed in the context of clinical data to assess the relationship between the number of donor anti-recipient IL-4-secreting T cells and disease outcome. RESULTS: Frequencies of IL-4/HTLp have been studied in HLA-identical siblings, HLA-""matched"" unrelated, and HLA-mismatched combinations and found to range from approximately 1/500,000 in HLA-identical sibling pairs to -1/2,000 in HLA-DR-mismatched pairs. These frequencies were independent of those for IL-2/HTLp and showed a negative correlation with those for CTLp. Clinical follow-up of 30 patients showed that high IL-4/HTLp frequencies are associated with a reduced risk of severe graft-versus-host disease. High IL-4/HTLp frequencies may also indicate an increased risk of leukemia relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that measurement of IL-4/HTLp frequencies provides information distinct from that obtained with CTLp and IL-2/HTLp.

Cellular factors responsible for differences in intensity of the GVL effect were examined by using two types of leukemias, i.e., a resistant leukemia (LE750) and a sensitive leukemia (8313) to induction of the GVL effect in MHC-compatible, allogeneic BMT of leukemia-bearing host. Resistance of LE750 leukemic cells to induction of the GVL effect could not be attributed to either less sensitivity to lysis by minor H antigen-specific, cytotoxic T cells or to an immunosuppressive activity of LE750 leukemic cells in leukemia-bearing host, when compared with the case of the sensitive leukemia (8313). To investigate the significance of the dose effect of effector cells for induction of the GVL effect, we used CD8+ T cells of AKR donor mice, which were shown to preferentially induce the GVL effect with hardly any lethal graft-versus host disease against C3H recipient mice, enabling us to increase the number of CD8+ T cells used in the allogeneic donor inoculum. The results suggested that the outcome of the antileukemic response in allogeneic BMT of leukemic recipients may be determined, at least in part, by the balance between the size of leukemic cells surviving and repopulating in the recipients after BMT and the number of antileukemic effector cells. The results furthermore indicated that when donors with T-cell subsets that preferentially induce an antileukemic response with reduced graft-versus-host disease are available, a more effective antileukemic response is inducible even against advanced leukemias.","['Aizawa, S', 'Kamisaku, H', 'Sado, T']","['Aizawa S', 'Kamisaku H', 'Sado T']","['Division of Biology and Oncology, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199804150-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1998 Apr 15;65(7):893-8. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199804150-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In part, this phenomenon was attributable to the stimulation of ovarian phospholipase A2 activity. In this communication we examine the possibility that the PG-promoting property of IL-1 is also due to the up-regulation of PG endoperoxide synthase (PGS), the rate-limiting step in prostanoid biosynthesis. The in vivo expression of ovarian PGS-2 transcripts in the course of a simulated estrous cycle rose abruptly to a peak (35-fold increase over the control value; P < 0.05) 8-12 h after hCG administration (i.e. before or during projected ovulation). PGS-1 transcripts, in turn, were not significantly altered during the periovulatory period. Treatment of cultured whole ovarian dispersates with IL-1beta resulted in dose- and time-dependent up-regulation of PGS-2 transcripts (as well as of immunoreactive PGS-2 protein and PGE2 accumulation), characterized by an ED50 of 2 ng/ml and a maximal (72-fold) increase at 10 ng/ml. Although treatment with IL-1beta also led to an increase in PGS-1 transcripts and immunoreactive PGS-1 protein, the relative magnitude of the effect was markedly reduced compared with that of PGS-2. Cotreatment with an IL-1 receptor antagonist completely reversed the IL-1 effects, thereby suggesting mediation via the IL-1 receptor. The ability of IL-1 to up-regulate PGS-2 transcripts proved relatively specific, in that other cellular regulators (insulin-like growth factor I, activin A, endothelin-1, transforming growth factor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, leukemia inhibitor factor, hepatocyte growth factor, or keratinocyte growth factor) were not effective. The optimal IL-1 effect required heterologous contact-dependent coculturing of granulosa and thecal-interstitial cells. Taken together, these observations 1) reaffirm (by molecular probing) the granulosa cell as the primary site of ovarian PGS-1 and PGS-2 expression, 2) document an increase in ovarian PGS-2 transcripts before ovulation, and 3) reveal a marked dependence of ovarian PGS (2 >> 1) transcripts, proteins, and activity on IL-1. The effects of IL-1 proved relatively specific, contingent upon somatic cell-cell cooperation, dose and time dependent, and IL-1 receptor mediated. These results are compatible with the proposition that the PG-promoting property of IL-1 is due, in large measure, to the activation of ovarian PGS transcription and translation. The ability of IL-1 to up-regulate ovarian PGS, an obligatory component of ovulation, is in keeping with the idea that IL-1 may constitute an intermediary in the ovulatory process.","['Ando, M', 'Kol, S', 'Kokia, E', 'Ruutiainen-Altman, K', 'Sirois, J', 'Rohan, R M', 'Payne, D W', 'Adashi, E Y']","['Ando M', 'Kol S', 'Kokia E', 'Ruutiainen-Altman K', 'Sirois J', 'Rohan RM', 'Payne DW', 'Adashi EY']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Corpus Luteum/physiology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulosa Cells/*enzymology', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Ovarian Follicle/physiology', 'Ovary/*enzymology', 'Ovulation', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.139.5.5988 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1998 May;139(5):2501-8. doi: 10.1210/endo.139.5.5988.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)']",,,,,,"['HD-19998/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-30288/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

LIF knockout mice (LIFKO), heterozygous and wild type (wt), of B6D2F1 genetic background were used to examine whether LIF may play a role in the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in vivo. Resting levels of plasma ACTH and corticosterone were similar in all three genotypes. However, LIFKO mice did not respond to 30-min restraint and 45-min immobilization stress with increased plasma ACTH. Increased circulating ACTH was only observed in LIFKO mice after very short immobilization stress (15 min), but this ACTH level was lower than in wt animals (P < 0.05). Injection of mycobacterial adjuvant resulted in a 2-fold increase of corticosterone levels 7 days after treatment in wt, but not LIFKO, mice (P < 0.05). Pituitary POMC messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were very low in LIFKO animals. Although 15 and 45 min of immobilization stress resulted in enhanced POMC mRNA content in all three groups, this elevation was lowest in LIFKO mice. Injection of 12 microg murine LIF to LIFKO and normal C57BL/6 animals resulted in increased plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels and elevated pituitary POMC mRNA levels in both LIF-repleted and LIF-depleted mice. Thus, LIF appears to play an important role in activating the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis during stress and inflammation.","['Chesnokova, V', 'Auernhammer, C J', 'Melmed, S']","['Chesnokova V', 'Auernhammer CJ', 'Melmed S']","['Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, University of California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Adrenal Glands/*physiopathology', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood', 'Animals', 'Corticosterone/blood', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Hypothalamus/*physiopathology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pituitary Gland/*physiopathology', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Restraint, Physical', 'Stress, Physiological/*physiopathology', 'Time Factors']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.139.5.6016 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1998 May;139(5):2209-16. doi: 10.1210/endo.139.5.6016.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",['Endocrinology. 1998 May;139(5):2199-200.

We therefore examined the regulation of in vitro and in vivo pituitary LIF expression by cytokines known to stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. In the corticotroph cell line AtT-20/D16v-F2, recombinant murine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta; 0.1-10.0 ng/ml) caused a 5- to 10-fold increase in LIF messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. LIF mRNA expression was induced as early as 1 h, peaked at 2 h, and still persistently elevated above the baseline after 8 h. This effect of IL-1beta on LIF mRNA expression was abolished by preincubation with human IL-1 receptor antagonist (100 ng/ml) or antimurine IL-1beta antibody (10 microg/ml). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (20 ng/ml) only modestly increased LIF mRNA, but was synergistic with IL-1beta (up to 2.5-fold). In contrast, IL-2 and IL-6 did not alter LIF mRNA. In C57BL/6 mice, i.p. injection of 100 ng IL-1beta increased plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels after 1 h (P < 0.02). In addition, pituitary LIF mRNA content was increased for up to 2 h in response to IL-1beta. In comparison to wild-type (+/+) B6D2F1 mice, LIF knockout mice with a deleted LIF gene (-/-) exhibited decreased plasma ACTH (631 +/- 61 vs. 376 +/- 50 pg/ml; P < 0.01) and corticosterone (783 +/- 85 vs. 433 +/- 51 ng/ml; P < 0.01) levels 1 h after i.p. IL-1beta administration. In conclusion, corticotroph LIF mRNA expression is specifically stimulated by IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The attenuated hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal response to IL-1beta in LIF knockout mice indicates that the effect of IL-1beta on ACTH secretion is modulated by LIF. Thus, LIF appears to function as an immune-neuroendocrine modulator signaling the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.","['Auernhammer, C J', 'Chesnokova, V', 'Melmed, S']","['Auernhammer CJ', 'Chesnokova V', 'Melmed S']","['Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, University of California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Adrenal Glands/*physiology', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Corticosterone/blood', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamus/*physiology', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Pituitary Gland/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sialoglycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.139.5.6017 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1998 May;139(5):2201-8. doi: 10.1210/endo.139.5.6017.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Il1rn protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",['Endocrinology. 1998 May;139(5):2199-200.

The precise biological role of this oncogenic signaling pathway (which also involves the HER4 gene) in breast cancer is unclear. One property conferred by this oncogene relates to response to drug therapy. Clinical studies support an association between HER2 overexpression and resistance to alkylating agents (cisplatinum and cyclophosphamide). Data from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 8869/8541 study indicate enhanced dose responsiveness to doxorubicin (Adriamycin) in patients who overexpress the HER2 receptor. Heregulin beta-2, a naturally occurring ligand that activates the HER2 receptor by inducing its heterodimerization with the HER4 receptor, has recently been cloned. The ability of this ligand to phosphorylate the HER2 receptor exogenously allows us to study the effect of HER2 activation on cancer cell behavior. To study the relationship between chemotherapy response and activation of HER2, MCF-7 cells expressing biologically active heregulin were assessed for response to doxorubicin and etoposide, both of which are topoisomerase IIalpha (topo IIalpha) inhibitors. Several clones show markedly increased sensitivity to these drugs. In addition, the same wild-type MCF-7 cells transfected with heregulin beta-2 under the control of an inducible promoter also show this dose-response relationship to doxorubicin after the expression of heregulin beta-2 is activated by zinc. The modulation of topo IIalpha was studied in the cell lines transfected with heregulin. topo IIalpha mRNA and protein (total protein and enzymatic decatenating activity) were found to be up-regulated in heregulin beta-2-transfected cells. Moreover, topo IIalpha promoter activity was also modestly increased in heregulin beta-2-transfected cells. Because up-regulation of topo IIalpha in vitro and in clinical specimens is associated with increased response to doxorubicin (presumptively by an increase in drug substrate), this may be the mechanism of the increased sensitivity to doxorubicin seen in heregulin beta-2-transfected cells. This implies that activation of HER2 or one of the other members of the receptor family may increase sensitivity to doxorubicin by up-regulation of topo IIalpha. This finding suggests the use of receptor/ligand expression to direct patient-specific therapeutic choices (e.g., doxorubicin versus alkylator-based regimens) and the use of biological agents (such as heregulin) in combination with certain chemotherapeutic agents to enhance response to treatment in breast cancer patients.","['Harris, L N', 'Yang, L', 'Tang, C', 'Yang, D', 'Lupu, R']","['Harris LN', 'Yang L', 'Tang C', 'Yang D', 'Lupu R']","['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 20502, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes, erbB-2/*physiology', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', '*Neuregulin-1', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/05/14 00:00,1998/05/14 00:01,['1998/05/14 00:00'],"['1998/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Apr;4(4):1005-12.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neuregulin-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '155646-83-6 (heregulin beta1)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant human EGF was conjugated to the soybean-derived PTK inhibitor genistein (Gen) to construct an EGF-R-directed cytotoxic agent with PTK inhibitory activity. The EGF-Gen conjugate was capable of binding to and entering EGF-R-positive MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 breast cancer cells (but not EGF-R-negative NALM-6 or HL-60 leukemia cells) via its EGF moiety, and it effectively competed with unconjugated EGF for target EGF-R molecules in ligand binding assays. EGF-Gen inhibited the EGF-R tyrosine kinase in breast cancer cells at nanomolar concentrations, whereas the IC50 for unconjugated Gen was >10 microM. Notably, EGF-Gen triggered a rapid apoptotic cell death in MDA-MB-231 as well as BT-20 breast cancer cells at nanomolar concentrations. The EGF-Gen-induced apoptosis was EGF-R-specific because cells treated with the control granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-Gen conjugate did not become apoptotic. Apoptosis was dependent both on the PTK inhibitory function of Gen and the targeting function of EGF, because cells treated with unconjugated Gen plus unconjugated EGF did not undergo apoptosis. The IC50s of EGF-Gen versus unconjugated Gen against MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells in clonogenic assays were 30 +/- 3 nM versus 120 +/- 18 microM (P < 0.001) and 30 +/- 10 nM versus 112 +/- 17 microM (P < 0.001), respectively. Thus, the EGF-Gen conjugate is a >100-fold more potent inhibitor of EGF-R tyrosine kinase activity in intact breast cancer cells than unconjugated Gen and a >100-fold more potent cytotoxic agent against EGF-R+ human breast cancer cells than unconjugated Gen. Taken together, these results indicate that the EGF-R-associated PTK complexes have vital antiapoptotic functions in human breast cancer cells and may therefore be used as therapeutic targets.","['Uckun, F M', 'Narla, R K', 'Jun, X', 'Zeren, T', 'Venkatachalam, T', 'Waddick, K G', 'Rostostev, A', 'Myers, D E']","['Uckun FM', 'Narla RK', 'Jun X', 'Zeren T', 'Venkatachalam T', 'Waddick KG', 'Rostostev A', 'Myers DE']","['Department of Oncology, Wayne Hughes Institute, St. Paul, Minnesota 55103, USA.

CD48 is expressed on T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and a wide range of lymphoid malignancies. To assess the therapeutic potential of an anti-CD48 antibody, we established a reproducible model of human B-cell (Raji) leukemia/lymphoma in C.B17/scid mice, where untreated mice develop hind leg paralysis due to tumor engraftment. Using this model, the murine anti-CD48 antibody HuLy-m3 was shown to mediate a strong in vivo antitumor effect. Long-term survival (>1 year) of scid mice was obtained after treatment with three 200-microg i.v. doses of anti-CD48 antibody on days 0, 2, and 4 after i.v. injection of tumor cells. In contrast, mice treated with an isotype control antibody developed hind leg paralysis after 34 +/- 3 days. A strong antitumor response was still observed when a dose of 20 microg of HuLy-m3 antibody was used. During preclinical investigations, we also examined a number of properties of the CD48 antigen.

This can be done with high resolution by subjecting short-term bone marrow cultures (48 h) to 24 h of mitotic arrest before harvest and detecting Ph-positive (Ph+) metaphases by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a procedure termed hypermetaphase FISH or HMF. Here, we compared procedures for detecting Ph+ interphase cells (interphase FISH or I-FISH) in peripheral blood polymorphonucleocytes (PMNs) with HMF results on the bone marrow of the same 26 CML patients in different stages of remission. The probes for I-FISH in these experiments were relatively large (200-300 kb) and sufficiently resolved in PMNs so that 97.5% of the cells were scorable. The correlation between the frequencies of Ph+ cells from the two different cell sources was excellent (r = 0.983, P < 0.0001); however, there was a consistently higher level of Ph+ cells observed in the cycling marrow cells than in the peripheral blood PMNs. This was discussed in terms of current theories of apoptosis in CML cells. The large number of PMNs analyzable by I-FISH (approximately 500/patient in this study) provided sufficiently narrow 99% confidence intervals to suggest the procedure as an effective and efficient method for monitoring the frequency of Ph+ cells in CML patients undergoing therapy. However, for detection and quantification of minimal residual disease, HMF is preferable to I-FISH because of the much lower frequency of false-positive readings with the former procedure.","['Seong, D', 'Thall, P', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Swantkowski, J', 'Xu, J', 'Shen, Y', 'Glassman, A', 'Ramagli, L', 'Siciliano, M J']","['Seong D', 'Thall P', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Swantkowski J', 'Xu J', 'Shen Y', 'Glassman A', 'Ramagli L', 'Siciliano MJ']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Metaphase/genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome']",1998/05/14 00:00,1998/05/14 00:01,['1998/05/14 00:00'],"['1998/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Apr;4(4):861-7.,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],,,,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Since 1991, 37 HTLV-I seropositive subjects, six subjects with indeterminate Western-Blot pattern, and their relatives have been followed up once a year clinically and biologically. RESULTS: Twenty-three mothers in the study group gave birth to 27 children between 1991 and 1995. Among the 13 infants born to the 12 seropositive mothers, two seroconverted before their second birthday. One adult woman whose husband was seropositive developed seropositivity 4 years after marriage. In March 1992, a family case-control study (proband study) was conducted. A seroprevalence of 27.5% was found among 138 relatives of 32 infected subjects and 1.4% among 142 relatives of 32 control subjects.

Selective removal of RBCs from donor marrow before transfusion was performed by centrifugation using a continuous-flow blood cell separator. The patient was given group O Rh-positive RBCs and group A Rh-positive platelets. Prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate. The patient experienced three hemolytic episodes, on Days 21, 35, and 160 which were due to different RBC alloantibodies (anti-K, anti-Jk(b), anti-M, IgG anti-A) produced by host lymphocytes surviving the conditioning regimen. RESULTS: The patient was group O, Jk(b-), and the marrow donor was group A, Jk(b+). After the first hemolytic episode (Day 21), immunohematologic studies showed group O RBCs and a positive direct antiglobulin test (IgG+, C3d+). Antibody screening test and eluate studies detected anti-M, anti-Jk(b), and anti-K. During the second hemolytic episode (Day 35), the patient's blood group showed a mixed population of group A and group O RBCs. The direct antiglobulin test was positive (IgG+, C3d+). Anti-M, anti-Jk(b), and IgG anti-A were detected in the serum. Eluates made from the recipient's RBCs showed the same specificity as serum antibodies. During the third hemolytic episode (Day 160), a mixture of group O and group A RBCs was still present, the direct antiglobulin test was positive (IgG+, C3d-), and anti-Jk(b) and IgG anti-A were observed in the serum and in an eluate made from the patient's RBCs. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of severe immune hemolytic anemia due to multiple RBC alloantibodies after an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. The time of appearance and the specificity of the antibodies strongly suggest that they were produced by residual recipient lymphoid cells.","['Lopez, A', 'de la Rubia, J', 'Arriaga, F', 'Jimenez, C', 'Sanz, G F', 'Carpio, N', 'Marty, M L']","['Lopez A', 'de la Rubia J', 'Arriaga F', 'Jimenez C', 'Sanz GF', 'Carpio N', 'Marty ML']","['Department of Hematology, La Fe University Hospital, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/*etiology/immunology', '*Blood Group Incompatibility', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Nuclear Family', 'Time Factors']",1998/05/01 00:00,1998/05/01 00:01,['1998/05/01 00:00'],"['1998/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1998.38398222868.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 1998 Mar;38(3):247-51. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1998.38398222868.x.,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",['Transfusion. 1998 Mar;38(3):224-8.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To analyze the expression of BCL-2 family genes, which are expressed in these subsets of AML, we used PCR sequence amplification reactions that are dependent on oligonucleotide primers representing the BH1 and BH2 homology domains to generate the unique regions between BH1 and BH2. These primers are conserved among all members of the BCL-2 gene family and are separated by a 150 nucleotide region sequence between the BH1 and BH2 domains. The PCR products unique to each BCL-2 family member were cloned directionally into sequencing vectors. The identity of the insert of each clone was determined by slotblots of the DNA amplified from individual colonies and by hybridization with radioactive probes specific to the bcl-2, bcl-x, or bax genes. RESULTS: We found that bcl-2 is the predominant member expressed in AML samples with a poor prognosis (-5, -7), whereas the transcripts of bcl-x are higher than those of bcl-2 in the AML samples with a good prognosis [inv16, t(8;21)]. No significant difference in bax expression was detected between AML subsets of good and bad prognosis. The ratio of bcl-xlong, which inhibits apoptosis, to bcl-xshort, which promotes apoptosis, was determined by amplification with a pair of primers specific to bcl-x followed by separation of the PCR product on agarose gels. Bcl-xlong and bcl-xshort appeared as bands of different molecular mass on a molecular weight gel and were visualized by ethidium bromide staining or Southern blot analysis with a bcl-x-specific probe. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the ratio of bcl-x long to bcl-x short was higher in the AML patients with a poor prognosis. These experiments showed that the levels of BCL-2 family members in the leukemia cells of good- and poor-prognosis subsets are different. In addition, novel members of the BCL-2 family were isolated from the cells of AML patients of either prognosis.","['Deng, G', 'Lane, C', 'Kornblau, S', 'Goodacre, A', 'Snell, V', 'Andreeff, M', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Deng G', 'Lane C', 'Kornblau S', 'Goodacre A', 'Snell V', 'Andreeff M', 'Deisseroth AB']","['University of Texas M.

We isolated and characterized three isoforms of OS-9 cDNA found in a myeloid leukemia HL-60 cDNA library.

Isoforms 2 and 3 encode 612 and 597 amino acid polypeptides, respectively. Comparison of their cDNA sequences with the genomic structure indicated that three isoforms are splice variants. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed predominant expression of isoform 2 mRNA in myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells, osteosarcoma OsA-CL cells and rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 cells. Northern blotting revealed similar levels of expression of OS-9 gene in various tumor cell lines of sarcoma cells, carcinoma cells and myeloid leukemia cells, but 3-4 times higher expression in OsA-CL cells and Rh30 cells containing a homogeneously staining region of 12q13-15.

METHODS: Data from a study of residential magnetic field exposure and childhood cancer were used. From a population of 127000 children living within 300 m of transmission lines in Sweden, 142 cases of childhood cancer were identified, including 39 cases of leukemia and 33 cases of central nervous system tumor. Approximately 4 referents per case were selected at random from the study base. The nitrogen dioxide content of the outdoor air was estimated as an indicator of motor vehicle exhaust. The applied methods give the 99th percentile of the nitrogen dioxide content of the outdoor air for 1-h averages over 1 year. RESULTS: A relative risk estimate of 2.7 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.9-8.5] was found for total cancer at exposure levels of > or = 50 microg/m3, related to those with < or = 39 microg/m3. At > or = 80 microg/m3, the relative risk was estimated at 3.8 (95% CI 1.2-12.1). Elevated, but imprecise risk estimates were found for leukemia and central nervous system tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate an association between childhood cancer and motor vehicle exhaust, although the number of cases was small.

These peptides bind to MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. Antigenic peptides are translocated from the cytosol to the lumen of ER by transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) proteins. In this study, it is shown that TAP1 polymorphism influences the peptide substrate specificity in human B-lymphoblastoid and tumor cell lines. TAP1A and 1C alleles specifically enhance translocation of model peptides containing basic C-terminal amino acid residue. However, TAP1B allele does not show specificity for the peptide C-terminus. Human basophilic leukemia (Ku812), and hepatocellular carcinoma (PLC/PRF/5) cells express TAP1 molecules and exhibit TAP-mediated allele-specific peptide uptake after gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) treatment. Ku812 cells express TAP1A and preferentially take up antigenic peptides with a basic C-terminus, however, PLC/PRF/5 cells with the TAP1B allele take up low but equivalent levels of peptides regardless of basic, acidic, or hydrophobic C-termini. Moreover, TAP2 polymorphisms have no influence on the peptide translocation in normal or tumor cell lines. In addition, Daudi, a beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) deficient human Burkitt lymphoma, cell line also showed TAP-dependent peptide uptake. Taken together, these results suggest that human TAP1 but not TAP2 polymorphisms influence the antigenic peptide transport and that this transport is independent of beta2m in this system.","['Quadri, S A', 'Singal, D P']","['Quadri SA', 'Singal DP']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University Medical Center, Hamilton, Ont., Canada. qshafat@bu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation/genetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Peptides/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics/immunology', 'Translocation, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology/*metabolism']",1998/04/30 00:00,1998/04/30 00:01,['1998/04/30 00:00'],"['1998/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2478(97)00157-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2478(97)00157-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1998 Mar;61(1):25-31. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2478(97)00157-0.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)', '145892-13-3 (TAP2 protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their data were retrospectively evaluated from a surgical point of view. The cumulative duration of implantation of 116 subcutaneous tunneled Catheter (STC) was 12,206 days and 45,524 days for 191 portsystems. According to the duration in each group, ports were superior to STC when infection, complication and occlusion were taken into consideration. Infection of the ports was more frequent in children under 3 years than in older patients. Conversely, in the STC-group, children over 10 years presented with the highest rate of infection episodes. The number of complications was high in young children for both types of catheter, decreasing with age. Occlusion rates were similar for both systems and were not age related. However, thrombolysis was more successful in portsystems and few catheters had to be removed for this reason. The age-related data of the presented study are discussed with regard to the surgical procedure. Recommendations are made concerning the adequate choice of catheter system, the surgical technique and postoperative management. Additionally, the medicotechnical aspect of different catheter types is discussed and some suggestions and/or requests are directed to the industrial developing laboratories.","['Petersen, C', 'Fuchs, J', 'Kotzur, A', 'Strauss, G']","['Petersen C', 'Fuchs J', 'Kotzur A', 'Strauss G']","['Abteilung fur Kinderchirurgie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover.']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,IM,"['Bacteremia/etiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*instrumentation', '*Catheters, Indwelling', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Long-Term Care', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",1998/04/30 00:00,1998/04/30 00:01,['1998/04/30 00:00'],"['1998/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1043852 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1998 Mar-Apr;210(2):65-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1043852.,,,,Zentralvenose Verweilsysteme in der padiatrischen Onkologie aus chirurgischer Sicht.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histologic, cytochemical, chromosomal, and molecular data with a nosologic discussion.",445-63,"Although myelomonoblastic leukemia is thought to originate from a malignant transformation of the stem cell of the mononuclear phagocyte system, malignant histiocytosis (MH) is classically assumed to represent a malignant change of the terminal and fixed elements of this system. Indeed, MH is characterized by the proliferation of large, clear, pleomorphic, ""histiocytic-like"" HLADR and CD30+ cells resulting in a nodal and extranodal disseminated neoplasm affecting preferentially and severely children and young adults. Although there is broad agreement on the clinicopathologic presentation of this condition, there is currently quite a controversy over the T-lymphoid or histiocytic origin of the proliferative cells that results in a nosologic discussion between the anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) advocates and the MH supporters. This article has dealt mainly with this nosologic discussion and with the contributions provided by the investigations performed on MH permanent cell lines. These in vitro studies have demonstrated that the proliferation is characterized by a unique chromosomal abnormality, the 5q35bp usually associated with a t(2;5) translocation generating a fusion gene NPM/ALK and the subsequent translation of p80 protein. Although it is known that no single chromosomal abnormality is strictly restricted to a cell lineage, this 5q35bp and associated translocations seem today to represent the hallmark for this condition. In view of these chromosomal aberrations, the CD30+ ALCLs represent a heterogeneous group because 15% to 50% express the NPM/ALK fusion gene. In addition, these in vitro investigations have shown that 5q35bp proliferative cells are glass-adherent, can develop an immunodependent phagocytosis, and are able to reduce NBT and produce TNF-alpha. More significantly, they express constitutively the c-fms (the receptor of the macrophage growth factor) and, under TPA stimulation, are able to modulate the expression of this receptor and its ligand, as well as TNF-alpha and IL-1. None of these cell lines express CD3, but several express CD68 and CD71. In contrast, genomic investigations have shown the underlying existence of monoallelic and even biallelic gene rearrangements for TCR beta and IgJH. In view of these discrepancies between the genomic and phenotypic features of these cells, the histogenetic debate should remain open but must take into account these new chromosomal and molecular data.","['Gogusev, J', 'Nezelof, C']","['Gogusev J', 'Nezelof C']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unit 90, Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/classification/*genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics']",1998/04/30 00:00,1998/04/30 00:01,['1998/04/30 00:00'],"['1998/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0889-8588(05)70522-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70522-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1998 Apr;12(2):445-63. doi: 10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70522-0.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,107,,,,,,,,,,,

Among tocopherols, only delta-T exhibited cytotoxicity. Among para quinones, alpha-TQ showed no cytotoxicity, while gamma-TQ and delta-TQ were highly cytotoxic in both CEM and CEM/VLB100 cell lines (LD50 < 10 muM). delta-TQ and gamma-TQ were more cytotoxic than the widely studied chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, which also showed selective cytotoxicity to CEM cells. The orthoquinone Tocored was less cytotoxic than doxorubicin in drug-sensitive cells but more cytotoxic than doxorubicin in multidrug-resistant cells. Cytotoxicity was not a function of the phytyl side-chain since both TMCQ and PR were cytotoxic in leukemia cells. Cytotoxic para and ortho quinones were electrophiles that formed adducts with nucleophilic thiol groups in glutathione and 2-mercaptoethanol. Cytotoxicity was enhanced when the glutathione pool was depleted by preincubation with buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine, but cytotoxicity was diminished by the addition of N-acetylcysteine to cultures. alpha-T also diminished the cytotoxicity of para- and orthoquinones. Buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine did not block the inhibitory effect of either N-acetylcysteine or alpha-T, showing that these agents did not act solely by maintaining the glutathione pool as an essential antioxidant system.

Patients were managed in the burn unit, and wounds were covered with split-thickness skin grafts. Amputation rate and mortality were measured. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of extremity streptococcal gangrene were identified. Delay to surgical referral was 5 days. Eleven (79%) patients were septic. Ten (71%) were managed with a single debridement before grafting. Limb salvage was 93% (13 of 14). One patient (7%) died on day 150 from acute myelogenous leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Delay in referral of extremity streptococcal gangrene is common, contributing to a high incidence of sepsis.

In this study we report that a dramatic elevation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in human leukemia HL-60 cells following 1 microM beta-lapachone treatment and that this increase was effectively inhibited by treatment with antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol. NAC strongly prevented beta-lapachone-induced apoptotic characteristics such as DNA fragmentation and apoptotic morphology. However, treatment of HL-60 cells with another topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) did not induce H2O2 production as compared to untreated cells. NAC also failed to block CPT-induced apoptosis. Correlated with these findings, we found that cancer cell lines K562, MCF-7, and SW620, contained high level of intracellular glutathione (GSH), were not elevated in H2O2 and were resistant to apoptosis after treatment with beta-lapachone. In contrast, cancer cell lines such as, HL-60, U937, and Molt-4 which have lower level of GSH, were readily increased of H2O2 and were sensitive to this drug. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of Bcl-2 in HL-60 cells also attenuated beta-lapachone-induced H2O2 and conferred resistance to beta-lapachone-induced cell death. Beta-Lapachone at the concentration as low as 0.25 microM effectively induced HL-60 cells to undergo monocytic differentiation, as evidenced by CD14 antigenicity and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase activity. Again, the beta-lapachone-induced monocytic differentiation was suppressed by NAC. These results suggest that intracellular H2O2 generation plays a crucial role in beta-lapachone-induced cell death and differentiation.","['Chau, Y P', 'Shiah, S G', 'Don, M J', 'Kuo, M L']","['Chau YP', 'Shiah SG', 'Don MJ', 'Kuo ML']","['Institute of Anatomy, School of Life Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Monocytes', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/pharmacology']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(97)00337-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(97)00337-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1998 Mar 1;24(4):660-70. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(97)00337-7.,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '4707-32-8 (beta-lapachone)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its subtype CD3+/CD8+ is often a clonal disease and without malignant characteristics. This kind of disease shows a clinical and laboratory heterogeneity, probably due to the immunological and functional variety of granular lymphocytes. In some cases of LGL leukemia an associated pathology, especially rheumatoid arthritis and chronic infections, has been reported. On the contrary, the relationship with neoplasms has been rarely proved in literature: only occasional studies have been reported and anyway they are not supported by a sufficient number of cases. Two cases of LGL leukemia are here delineated: a woman with advanced breast adenocarcinoma and another one with Sjogren disease. The first one had a rapidly fatal course, while the other one had a prolonged clinical course with chronic neutropenia (13 years follow-up). The association between carcinoma and LGL leukemia may be just a casual finding but the hypothesis of a possible relationship is however very interesting on account of the important role of granular lymphocytes in controlling tumoral growth. Moreover, both patients had concomitant chronic HCV-correlated infection: maybe it will worth making a prevalence study with a greater number of cases, in order to evaluate a probable relationship between these pathologies. The growth factor G-CSF may be useful in the treatment of infections that often occur in patients with severe neutropenia.","['Airoldi, M', 'Crespi, D', 'Puricelli, S', 'Pelucco, L']","['Airoldi M', 'Crespi D', 'Puricelli S', 'Pelucco L']","['Unita Operativa Medicina Generale III, Ospedale, Busto Arsizio.']",['ita'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Recenti Prog Med,Recenti progressi in medicina,0401271,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/complications', 'Breast Neoplasms/complications', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hepatitis C/complications', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy/etiology', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/complications"", 'Time Factors']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Recenti Prog Med. 1998 Feb;89(2):74-8.,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],,,Leucemia linfatica cronica a grandi linfociti granulari.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A detailed analysis of the type and frequency of chromosome 2 aberrations in murine bone marrow cells at an early stage after irradiation is provided here. A total of 40 male C3H/He mice was exposed to 137Cs gamma-ray at a dose of 1, 2 or 3 Gy, and sacrificed 24 hours after irradiation. Metaphase samples prepared from bone marrow cells were Q-banded for karyotyping or painted with DNA probes specific to chromosome 2. In 5 mice analyzed by karyotyping, one mouse showed high frequency of the marker aberrations as well as other chromosome 2 aberrations. Chromosome painting analysis for the rest of the mice also detected 3 animals showing significantly high frequencies of chromosome 2 aberrations. Dose-dependence of the frequencies was observed even among those mice that tended to be sensitive. The results indicated that there was a subgroup of mice carrying hypersensitive chromosome 2. The subgroup could be leukemia-sensitive if radiation-induced chromosome aberrations are responsible for an early change in myeloid leukemogenesis.","['Ban, N', 'Kai, M', 'Kusama, T']","['Ban N', 'Kai M', 'Kusama T']","['Department of Radiological Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan. ban@nile.gen.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*radiation effects', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1269/jrr.38.219 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiat Res. 1997 Dec;38(4):219-31. doi: 10.1269/jrr.38.219.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It consists of a local and a systemic reaction. The latter is characterized by dramatic changes in the concentration of some plasma proteins called acute phase proteins. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been identified in vitro and in vivo as the major hepatocyte stimulating factor. Subsequently, additional hepatocyte stimulating factors, such as leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin-M, interleukin-11 and ciliary neurotrophic factor have been discovered. IL-t and related cytokines belong to the so-called alpha-helical cytokine family characterized by four antiparallel helices. IL-6 and IL-6-type cytokines exert their action via plasma membrane receptor complexes consisting of specific cytokine binding subunits and a common signal transducing protein gp130. In this presentation we focus on structure/function studies of IL-6, its receptor subunits gp80 and gp130, the internalization of the ligand/receptor complex and a recently elucidated signal transduction pathway. We have shown that protein tyrosine kinases of the JAK family are associated with the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 and are activated in response to IL-6. Subsequently, the transcription factors--named STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription)--STAT1 alpha and STAT3 are transiently recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of gp130, where they become tyrosine phosphorylated by JAK kinases. In addition to the tyrosine phosphorylation we have observed that IL-6 also induces a serine phosphorylation of STAT3. This modification occurs with a delayed time-course as compared to the tyrosine phosphorylation and is inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor H7. We propose that the STAT3 serine phosphorylation is required for transactivation of IL-6 target genes which is also inhibited by H7.","['Heinrich, P C', 'Horn, F', 'Graeve, L', 'Dittrich, E', 'Kerr, I', 'Muller-Newen, G', 'Grotzinger, J', 'Wollmer, A']","['Heinrich PC', 'Horn F', 'Graeve L', 'Dittrich E', 'Kerr I', 'Muller-Newen G', 'Grotzinger J', 'Wollmer A']","['Institut fur Biochemie, RWTH Aachen, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Z Ernahrungswiss,Zeitschrift fur Ernahrungswissenschaft,0413632,IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/chemistry/*physiology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/chemistry/physiology']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Z Ernahrungswiss. 1998;37 Suppl 1:43-9.,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary end points were acute GvHD (aGvHD) and transplant-related mortality (TRM); secondary end points were relapse and survival. The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and fractionated total body irradiation (3.3 Gy/d for 3 consecutive days). The actuarial risk of developing aGvHD grade II-III was 61% for IdCSA alone and 34% for IdCSA + IdMTX (P = .02). The actuarial risk of TRM at 1 year was 11% versus 13%, respectively, and older patients (>/= 29 years) had higher TRM than younger patients (22% v 5%, P = .01). The age effect was significant in the IdCSA group (P = .04) but not in the IdCSA + IdMTX group (P = .1). The median follow-up is 4.4 years, with an overall actuarial survival of 78% for CR1 patients and 36% for patients with advanced disease. For patients in CR1 the outcome of the two regimens was as follows: survival 77% versus 80% (P = .6), relapse 20% versus 9% (P = .1), and TRM 13% versus 17% (P = .6). This study suggests that TRM can be reduced in AML patients undergoing allogeneic marrow transplants with a mild conditioning regimen and low-dose immunosuppression, and this translates in a 78% 5-year survival for CR1 patients. Beyond CR1 the major obstacle remains leukemia relapse, which is not prevented by low-dose in vivo immunosuppression.","['Zikos, P', 'Van Lint, M T', 'Frassoni, F', 'Lamparelli, T', 'Gualandi, F', 'Occhini, D', 'Mordini, N', 'Berisso, G', 'Bregante, S', 'De Stefano, F', 'Soracco, M', 'Vitale, V', 'Bacigalupo, A']","['Zikos P', 'Van Lint MT', 'Frassoni F', 'Lamparelli T', 'Gualandi F', 'Occhini D', 'Mordini N', 'Berisso G', 'Bregante S', 'De Stefano F', 'Soracco M', 'Vitale V', 'Bacigalupo A']","['Divisione Ematologia II Ospedale San Martino, Istituto Medicina Legale, Universita, Servizio Radioterapia Istituto Tumori, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55262-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 1;91(9):3503-8.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis included cyclosporine alone (68%), cyclosporine-methotrexate (26%), or T-cell depletion (6%). The probability of relapse was calculated as a function of the absolute lymphocyte count (10(9)/L) on days 27 to 30 posttransplant (<0.1 v >/=0.1, <0.2 v >/=0.2, and <0.3 v >/=0.3). In each of these 12 comparisons, the probability of relapse was higher for the group with the lower lymphocyte count. Because the difference was most significant (P = .004) for an absolute lymphocyte count of <0.2 on day 29 (3-year relapse probability, 42%) versus >/= 0.2 (16%), this variable was included in a Cox model to determine factors independently affecting relapse. Multivariate analysis showed that conditioning regimens other than melphalan-TBI, a low lymphocyte count on day 29, French-American-British (FAB) subtypes M4-7, and a nucleated cell dose of > 2.42 x 10(8)/kg was associated with a higher risk of relapse. We conclude that slow lymphocyte recovery after allogeneic BMT, to < 0.2 x 10(9)/L 29 days in this analysis, appears to be associated with a higher risk of relapse in patients with AML. This group of patients may benefit from posttransplant immune manipulations such as abbreviated GVHD prophylaxis, or donor cell or cytokine administration to enhance graft-versus-leukemia reactions to reduce relapse.","['Powles, R', 'Singhal, S', 'Treleaven, J', 'Kulkarni, S', 'Horton, C', 'Mehta, J']","['Powles R', 'Singhal S', 'Treleaven J', 'Kulkarni S', 'Horton C', 'Mehta J']","['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55259-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 1;91(9):3481-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may be related to the unresponsiveness of CML progenitors to beta1 integrin adhesion receptor-mediated inhibition of progenitor proliferation by the marrow microenvironment. In hematopoietic cell lines, the BCR-ABL oncogene product, p210(BCR-ABL), interacts with a variety of cytoskeletal elements important for normal integrin signaling. We studied the role of p210(BCR-ABL) in abnormal integrin function in CML by evaluating the effect of inhibition of BCR-ABL expression with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) on integrin-mediated adhesion and proliferation inhibition of malignant primary progenitors from CML marrow. Preincubation of CML CD34(+)HLA-DR+ (DR+) cells with breakpoint-specific AS-ODNs significantly increased adhesion of CML progenitors to stroma and fibronectin (FN). Pretreatment with breakpoint-specific ODNs also resulted in significant inhibition of CML progenitor proliferation after ligand or antibody-mediated beta1 integrin engagement. Breakpoint-specific ODNs were significantly more effective in restoring CML progenitor adhesion and proliferation inhibition than control ODNs. BCR-ABL mRNA and p210(BCR-ABL) levels in CML CD34(+) cells were significantly reduced after incubation with breakpoint-specific AS-ODN.

The expression of variant isoforms is highly restricted and correlated with specific processes, such as leukocyte activation and malignant transformation. We have herein studied CD44v expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and, for comparison, in normal myelopoiesis. Protein expression of total CD44 and of CD44-3v, -6v, and -9v isoforms has been measured using specific monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. The composition of variant exon transcripts has been analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern hybridization with exon-specific probes. Our data show that (1) CD44-6v isoforms are expressed on 12.0% +/- 2.5% of normal CD34(+) cells; this expression is sharply upregulated through monopoiesis and, inversely, downregulated during granulopoiesis. Also, CD44-3v and CD44-9v isoforms are detected on 10% and 14% of normal monocytes, respectively.

The exquisitely tissue-specific distribution of different Src family members suggests that a fine tuning of their expression might be a key prerequisite for cell homeostasis. We tested B cells from patients affected by B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) for expression of Src family kinases. The T-cell-specific tyrosine kinase Lck was found to be expressed at significant levels in CLL B-cells. This finding could be accounted for either by ectopic expression of Lck in B-CLL or by specific expression of this kinase in normal B-1 cells, which are believed to be the normal counterpart of CLL B cells. To answer this question B cells from different sources, characterized by a different size of the B-1 subpopulation, were tested for Lck expression.

Defects in the PCD pathway also contribute to chemoresistance. The expression of several apoptosis-regulating proteins, including the Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, Bax, Bak, and BAD; the Bcl-2-binding protein BAG-1; and the cell death protease Caspase-3 (CPP32), was evaluated by immunoblotting using 58 peripheral blood B-CLL specimens from previously untreated patients. Expression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, BAG-1, Bax, Bak, and Caspase-3 was commonly found in circulating B-CLL cells, whereas the Bcl-XL and BAD proteins were not present. Higher levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 were strongly correlated with failure to achieve complete remission (CR) after single-agent therapy (fludarabine or chlorambucil) (P = .001), but the presence of only seven CRs among the 42 patients for whom follow-up data were available necessitates cautious interpretation of these observations. Higher levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BAG-1 were also marginally associated with failure to achieve CR (P = .04). Apoptosis-regulating proteins were not associated with patient age, sex, Rai stage, platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, or lymph node involvement, although higher levels of Bcl-2 and a high Bcl-2:Bax ratio were correlated with high numbers (>10(5)/microL) of white blood cells (WBC) (P = .01; .007) and higher levels of Bak were weakly associated with loss of allelic heterozygosity at 13q14 (P = .04). On the basis of measurements of apoptosis induction by fludarabine using cultured B-CLL specimens, in vitro chemosensitivity data failed to correlate with in vivo clinical response rates (n = 42) and expression of the various apoptosis-regulating proteins. Although larger prospective studies are required before firm conclusions can be reached, these studies show the expression in B-CLLs of multiple apoptosis-regulating proteins and suggest that the relative levels of some of these, such as Mcl-1, may provide information about in vivo responses to chemotherapy. In vitro chemosensitivity data, however, do not appear to be particularly useful in predicting responses in B-CLL.","['Kitada, S', 'Andersen, J', 'Akar, S', 'Zapata, J M', 'Takayama, S', 'Krajewski, S', 'Wang, H G', 'Zhang, X', 'Bullrich, F', 'Croce, C M', 'Rai, K', 'Hines, J', 'Reed, J C']","['Kitada S', 'Andersen J', 'Akar S', 'Zapata JM', 'Takayama S', 'Krajewski S', 'Wang HG', 'Zhang X', 'Bullrich F', 'Croce CM', 'Rai K', 'Hines J', 'Reed JC']","['Burnham Institute, Cancer Research Center, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55247-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 1;91(9):3379-89.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,['U01-CA-60421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of the neutropenia is unclear. We report reversal of severe neutropenia associated with T-LGL leukemia in five patients treated with cyclosporine (CSA). All five had persistent neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 10(9)/L, two had agranulocytosis, and four had recurrent infections. Increased populations of LGL were present in blood and marrow, with a T-LGL immunophenotype (CD3(+)CD8(+)CD16(+/-)CD56(+/-)CD57(+)) shown by multiparameter flow cytometry, and clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements in two of two pretreatment blood samples studied. CSA was initiated at doses of 1 to 1.5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours, with subsequent dose adjustments based on trough serum levels. Four patients attained normal neutrophil counts with CSA alone; one required addition of low-dose granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Time to attainment of 1.5 x 10(9)/L neutrophils ranged from 21 to 75 days. Attempts to taper and withdraw CSA resulted in recurrent neutropenia. Three patients have maintained normal neutrophil counts on continued CSA therapy for 2, 8, and 8.5 years. Two patients died 1.7 and 4.6 years after initiation of CSA despite normal neutrophil counts-one of metastatic melanoma and one of complications after aortofemoral bypass surgery. Despite resolution of neutropenia, increased populations of T-LGL cells have persisted in all patients during CSA therapy, as shown by morphology and flow cytometry and by the presence of clonal TCR gene rearrangements in four patients' posttreatment blood samples. We conclude that CSA is an effective therapy for neutropenia associated with T-LGL leukemia, and that resolution of neutropenia despite persistence of abnormal cells implies that CSA may inhibit T-LGL secretion of yet unidentified mediators of neutropenia.","['Sood, R', 'Stewart, C C', 'Aplan, P D', 'Murai, H', 'Ward, P', 'Barcos, M', 'Baer, M R']","['Sood R', 'Stewart CC', 'Aplan PD', 'Murai H', 'Ward P', 'Barcos M', 'Baer MR']","['Departments of Hematologic Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, the Division of Medicine, Laboratory of Flow Cytometry, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cyclosporine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/complications/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/etiology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55246-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 1;91(9):3372-8.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",,,,,,['CA73773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

D-FISH patterns were abnormal in 30 of 30 specimens with classic, simple, complex, and masked Ph chromosomes. Based on 200 nuclei from each of 30 normal specimens, the mean percentage of false-positive cells was 0.25 +/- 0.39. Thirty-seven specimens from 10 patients were studied before treatment and two or more times at 4-month intervals after treatment with interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) with or without ara-C. Based on 200 nuclei, the results of D-FISH in these specimens correlated closely with quantitative cytogenetics and accurately quantified disease within a few percent. We studied 6, 000 nuclei for each of six specimens, three normal and three from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in cytogenetic remission. The normal cutoff for 6,000 nuclei was 0.079% and patients in cytogenetic remission had residual disease ranging from 7 (0.117%) to 53 (0.883%) Ph-positive nuclei.

To address these issues, the 'short' (S) and 'long' (L) isoforms of PML-RARalpha were constitutively expressed in the factor-dependent human erythroleukemia cell line, TF1. Expression of the L, but not the S, isoform inhibited growth of these cells in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In the absence of GM-CSF, the S isoform partially protected against apoptosis, while the L isoform accelerated cell death. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) inhibited cell growth and caused apoptosis only in PML-RARalpha-expressing cells, and these effects of ATRA were more marked in cells expressing the L isoform. ATRA treatment also led to downregulation of bcl-2 and endogenous RARalpha in PML-RARalpha-expressing cells, but had little effect on the level of exogenously expressed PML-RARalpha. We conclude that (1) subtle differences exist in the biologic activities of the L and S isoforms of PML-RARalpha, and (2) both isoforms are capable of transducing an ATRA-mediated signal that leads to downregulation of bcl-2 and induction of programmed cell death.","['Slack, J L', 'Yu, M']","['Slack JL', 'Yu M']","['Division of Medicine and the Departments of Hematologic Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55243-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 1;91(9):3347-56.,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A key hypothesis for how the TEL/PDGFRbeta fusion protein would function as an oncogene is that it represents a constitutively active version of the normal PDGFRbeta. A link between the function of the t(5;12)-encoded TEL/PDGFRbeta fusion protein and Myc expression is suggested by the fact that Myc is induced by PDGF and is essential for entry of cells into the S phase of the cell cycle. We here show that the kinase activity of TEL/PDGFRbeta is necessary for Ba/F3 cells to acquire interleukin-3 (IL-3) independence and that, in contrast to their untransfected counterpart, Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with TEL/PDGFRbeta maintain a high level of Myc expression after removal of IL-3. Using dominant negative mutants of Myc, we show that a threshold of active Myc is essential for TEL/PDGFRbeta to transform Ba/F3 and Rat-1 cells. The findings that the kinase activity of TEL/PDGFRbeta and a threshold of active Myc are involved in TEL/PDGFRbeta transformation may allow for the development of therapeutic strategies in patients with t(5;12)+ CMML using specific inhibitors of the PDGFRbeta kinase as well as compounds designed to interfere specifically with Myc.","['Bourgeade, M F', 'Defachelles, A S', 'Cayre, Y E']","['Bourgeade MF', 'Defachelles AS', 'Cayre YE']","['U417 Institut de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genes, myc', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*physiology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55241-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 1;91(9):3333-9.,"['0 (CGP 53716)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",,,,,,['CA43225-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The highest levels of amphotropic retrovirus receptor (amphoR) mRNA were found in cryopreserved human cord blood HSC. The level of amphoR mRNA in Lin- CD34(+) CD38(-) cells isolated from frozen cord blood was 12-fold higher than the level in fresh cord blood Lin- CD34(+) CD38(-) cells. In mice, the level of amphoR mRNA in HSC from the bone marrow (BM) of mice treated with stem cell factor and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor was 2.8- to 7.8-fold higher than in HSC from the BM of untreated mice.

Electrophysiological and biochemical studies have indicated expression of the P2X1 receptor, an ATP-gated cation channel, in human and rat platelets, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-differentiated HL-60 myeloid cells. Although these findings suggest that P2X1 receptors are present in both blood leukocytes and blood platelets, the relative levels of P2X1 receptor expression and function in human blood leukocytes and platelets have not been directly characterized. On the basis of both immunoblot analysis and functional assays of P2X1 receptor-mediated ionic fluxes, we report that there is significant expression of P2X1 receptors in human platelets, but not in neutrophils, monocytes, or blood lymphocytes. Thus, unlike platelets and myeloid progenitor cell lines, fully differentiated human blood leukocytes do not express functionally significant numbers of P2X1 receptors, suggesting the downregulation of P2X1 receptor gene expression during the differentiation of phagocytic leukocytes. By contrast, P2X1 receptor expression is strongly maintained during megakaryocytic differentiation and platelet release. Immunoblot analysis indicated that the platelet P2X1 receptor migrates as an approximately 60-kD protein during SDS-electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Treatment of platelet membranes with endoglycosidase-F causes the P2X1 receptor band to migrate as a 46-kD protein, verifying the highly glycosylated nature of the mature receptor protein.

However, the most significant morbidity and mortality in CML are caused by progression to blast crisis, about which comparatively little is known at the molecular level. Genomic imprinting is a chromosomal modification leading to parental-origin-specific gene expression in somatic cells. Recently, we and others have described loss of imprinting (LOI) of the insulin-like growth factor-II gene (IGF2), leading to biallelic rather than monoallelic expression in a wide variety of solid tumors. We have now examined the imprinting status of IGF2 in samples from CML patients in stable phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis. Five of six stable-phase patients showed normal imprinting, but LOI was found in all six cases of advanced disease (three accelerated phase, three blast crisis), which was statistically highly significant (P < .01). Thus, LOI represents a novel type of genetic alteration in CML that appears to be specifically associated with disease progression.","['Randhawa, G S', 'Cui, H', 'Barletta, J A', 'Strichman-Almashanu, L Z', 'Talpaz, M', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Deisseroth, A B', 'Champlin, R C', 'Feinberg, A P']","['Randhawa GS', 'Cui H', 'Barletta JA', 'Strichman-Almashanu LZ', 'Talpaz M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Deisseroth AB', 'Champlin RC', 'Feinberg AP']","['Departments of Medicine, Oncology, and Molecular Biology & Genetics, and the Graduate Program in Human Genetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55219-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 1;91(9):3144-7.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",,,,,,"['CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

To directly investigate the role of AML1-ETO in leukemogenesis, we used gene targeting to create an AML1-ETO ""knock-in"" allele that mimics the t(8;21). Unexpectedly, embryos heterozygous for AML1-ETO (AML1-ETO/+) died around E13.5 from a complete absence of normal fetal liver-derived definitive hematopoiesis and lethal hemorrhages. This phenotype was similar to that seen following homozygous disruption of either AML1 or CBFbeta. However, in contrast to AML1- or CBFbeta-deficient embryos, fetal livers from AML1-ETO/+ embryos contained dysplastic multilineage hematopoietic progenitors that had an abnormally high self-renewal capacity in vitro. To further document the role of AML1-ETO in these growth abnormalities, we used retroviral transduction to express AML1-ETO in murine adult bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors. AML1-ETO-expressing cells were again found to have an increased self-renewal capacity and could be readily established into immortalized cell lines in vitro. Taken together, these studies suggest that AML1-ETO not only neutralizes the normal biologic activity of AML1 but also directly induces aberrant hematopoietic cell proliferation.","['Okuda, T', 'Cai, Z', 'Yang, S', 'Lenny, N', 'Lyu, C J', 'van Deursen, J M', 'Harada, H', 'Downing, J R']","['Okuda T', 'Cai Z', 'Yang S', 'Lenny N', 'Lyu CJ', 'van Deursen JM', 'Harada H', 'Downing JR']","[""Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Tumor Cell Biology, and Genetics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Lethal', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Heterozygote', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Liver/embryology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Yolk Sac/cytology']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55218-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 May 1;91(9):3134-43.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA71907-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In Moloney murine leukemia virus, a stem-loop structure (H1) located in the encapsidation domain Psi (nucleotides 215-564) was postulated to trigger RNA dimerization through base pairing between auto complementary sequences. The Psi domain also contains two other stem-loop structures (H2 and H3) that are essential for RNA packaging. Since it was suspected than H1 is not the only element involved in RNA dimerization, we systematically investigated the dimerization capacity of several subdomains of the first 725 nucleotides of genomic RNA. The efficiency of dimerization of the various RNAs was estimated by measuring their apparent dissociation constants, and the specificity was tested by competition experiments. Our results indicate that the specificity of dimerization of RNA nucleotides 1-725 is driven by motifs H1-H3 in domain Psi. To define the relative contributions of these elements, RNA deletion mutants containing different combinations of H1-H3 were constructed and further analyzed in competition and kinetic experiments. Our results confirm the importance of H1 in triggering dimerization and shed new light on the mechanism of dimerization. H1 is required to provide a stable dimer, probably through the formation of extended intermolecular interactions. However, H1-mediated association is a slow process that is kinetically enhanced by H3, and to a lesser extent by H2. We suggest that they facilitate the recognition between the two RNAs, most likely through their conserved GACG loops. Our results reinforce the idea that dimerization and packaging are two closely related processes.","['De Tapia, M', 'Metzler, V', 'Mougel, M', 'Ehresmann, B', 'Ehresmann, C']","['De Tapia M', 'Metzler V', 'Mougel M', 'Ehresmann B', 'Ehresmann C']","['Unite Propre de Recherche 9002 du CNRS, Institut de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Dimerization', 'Genome, Viral', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi9800303 [doi]', 'bi9800303 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1998 Apr 28;37(17):6077-85. doi: 10.1021/bi9800303.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that the p51 subunit, in addition to providing structural support to the p66 subunit, may be involved in facilitating the loading of the p66 subunit on to the template-primer (TP). This possibility is supported by following observations: (i) Upon binding to the TP, the p51 subunit can be dissociated by acetonitrile treatment and the template-primer-bound p66 monomer alone is capable of catalyzing DNA synthesis. (ii) Photo-cross-linking of template-primer to HIV-1 RT is abolished by dissociation of the p51 subunit prior to the TP binding but remains unaffected after the TP binding step. (iii) The p66-TP covalent complex selectively generated by UV irradiation and separated by gel electrophoresis can incorporate a single nucleotide in situ upon its renaturation in the gel.

A stretch of amino acids named region A was identified in Pit1 (residues 550 to 558 in loop 4) as critical for GALV and FeLV-B receptor function. We have here investigated the role of region A in A-MuLV and 10A1 entry. Insertion of a single amino acid in region A of mouse Pit1 resulted in a functional A-MuLV receptor, showing that region A plays a role in A-MuLV infection. Moreover, the downregulation of 10A1 receptor function by changes in region A of human Pit1 indicates that this region is also involved in 10A1 entry. Therefore, region A seems to play a role in infection by all viruses utilizing Pit1 and/or Pit2 as receptors.","['Lundorf, M D', 'Pedersen, F S', ""O'Hara, B"", 'Pedersen, L']","['Lundorf MD', 'Pedersen FS', ""O'Hara B"", 'Pedersen L']","['Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus, Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/*physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.5.4524-4527.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 May;72(5):4524-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.5.4524-4527.1998.,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",,,,,,,PMC109699,,,,,,,,

Additionally, we show that artificial targeting of PITALRE to a nascent RNA element, in the absence of Tat, activated HIV-1 LTR expression.

A chimera between Ty3 and a Neo(r)-marked Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) was constructed. The C-terminal domain of M-MuLV integrase (IN) was replaced with the C-terminal domain of Ty3 IN. The chimeric retroviruses were expressed from an amphotrophic envelope packaging cell line. The virus generated was used to infect the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, and cells in which integration had occurred were selected by G418 resistance. Three independently integrated viruses were rescued. In each case, the C-terminal Ty3 IN sequences were maintained and short direct repeats of the genomic DNA flanked the integration site. Sequence analysis of the genomic DNA flanking the insertion did not identify a tRNA gene; therefore, these integration events did not have Ty3 position specificity. This study showed that IN sequences from the yeast retrovirus-like element Ty3 can substitute for M-MuLV IN sequences in the C-terminal domain and contribute to IN function in vivo. It is also one of the first in vivo demonstrations of activity of a retrovirus encoding an integrase chimera.

In this report, we present evidence that mutation of a highly conserved Leu at matrix amino acid 20 blocks or markedly delays virus replication in a range of cell types, including T-cell lines, primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and monocyte-derived macrophages. These mutations do not impair virus assembly and release, RNA encapsidation, or envelope glycoprotein incorporation into virions but rather cause significant defects in an early step in the virus life cycle, as measured by single-cycle infectivity assays and the analysis of viral DNA synthesis early postinfection. This infectivity defect is independent of the type of envelope glycoprotein carried on mutant virions; similar results are obtained in pseudotyping experiments using wild-type or truncated HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope, or the vesicular stomatitis G protein. Intriguingly, matrix residue 20 mutations also increase the apparent binding of Gag to membrane, accelerate the kinetics of Gag processing, and induce defects in endogenous reverse transcriptase activity without affecting virion density or morphology.

The B10.D2 (H-2d), B10.Br (H-2k), B10.Q (H-2q), and B10.RIII (H-2r) strains exhibited a TI phenotype in which almost all tumors contained type I recombinants. These recombinants characteristically acquire envelope gene sequences from the endogenous polytropic viruses but retain the 5' p15E (TM) gene sequences from the ecotropic virus. The parental B10 (H-2b) strain, however, had a novel phenotype that was designated NS for nonselective. Only 30% of the B10 tumors had detectable type I recombinants, whereas a proportion of the others appeared to contain type II recombinants that lacked the type I-specific ecotropic p15E gene sequences. Studies of other B10 congenic strains with hybrid H-2 loci and selected F1 animals revealed that the NS phenotype was regulated by a dominant gene(s) that mapped to the A region of H-2b.

THP (Tax-helping protein) was previously determined to enhance the transactivation by Tax protein. Here we report novel forms of the human homolog of a member of the Gli oncogene family, Gli2 (also termed Gli2/THP), an extended form of a zinc finger protein, THP, which was described previously. Four possible isoforms (hGli2 alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) are formed by combinations of two independent alternative splicings, and all the isoforms could bind to a DNA motif, TRE2S, in the LTR. The longer isoforms, alpha and beta, were abundantly expressed in various cell lines including HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Fusion proteins of the hGli2 isoforms with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 activated transcription when the reporter contained a Gal4-binding site and one copy of the 21-bp sequence, to which CREB binds. This activation was observed only in the presence of Tax. The 21-bp sequence in the reporter was also essential for the activation. These results suggest that simultaneous binding of hGli2 and CREB to the respective sites in the reporter seems to be critical for Tax protein to activate transcription. Consequently, it is probable that the LTR can be regulated by two independent signals through hGli2 and CREB, since the LTR contains the 21-bp and TRE2S sequences in the vicinity.","['Tanimura, A', 'Dan, S', 'Yoshida, M']","['Tanimura A', 'Dan S', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', '*Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogenes', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Finger Protein Gli2']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.5.3958-3964.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 May;72(5):3958-64. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.5.3958-3964.1998.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GLI2 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein Gli2)']",,,,,"['GENBANK/AB007295', 'GENBANK/AB007296', 'GENBANK/AB007297', 'GENBANK/AB007298']",,PMC109622,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate an association of PML bodies with P proteins by indirect immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, providing the first evidence of nucleic acid-binding proteins associated with PML bodies. We show that unlike PML, the P proteins are not redistributed upon infection. Immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation studies indicate that the viral Z protein binds the nuclear, but not the cytoplasmic, fraction of P0. The nuclear fraction of P0 has been associated with translationally coupled DNA excision repair and with nonspecific endonuclease activity; thus, P0 may be involved in nucleic acid processing activities necessary for LCMV replication. During the infection process, PML, P1, and P2 are downregulated but P0 remains unchanged. Further, P0 is present in virions while PML is not, indicating some selectivity in the assembly of LCMV.","['Borden, K L', 'Campbelldwyer, E J', 'Carlile, G W', 'Djavani, M', 'Salvato, M S']","['Borden KL', 'Campbelldwyer EJ', 'Carlile GW', 'Djavani M', 'Salvato MS']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. kathyb@inka.mssm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', '*Protozoan Proteins', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Zinc Fingers']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.5.3819-3826.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 May;72(5):3819-26. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.5.3819-3826.1998.,"['0 (L12E protein, Trypanosoma cruzi)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protozoan Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,,"['R01 AI032107/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI32107/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 AI25522/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC109605,,,,,,,,

Incorporation of a DNA fragment from the scaffold attachment region (SAR) of the human beta interferon gene into the vector improved transgene expression, particularly in quiescent cells. The SAR element functioned in an orientation-dependent manner and enhanced expression of Moloney murine leukemia virus- and murine embryonic stem cell-based vectors. Clonal analysis of transduced T cells showed that the SAR sequence did not confer position-independent expression on a transgene but rather prevented the decrease of expression when cells became quiescent.

Although most mice remained healthy, one mouse developed splenomegaly and polycythemia at 67 days; the virus from this mouse reproducibly caused the same symptoms in secondary recipients by 2 to 3 weeks postinfection. This disease, which was characterized by extramedullary erythropoietin-independent erythropoiesis in the spleens and livers, was also reproduced in long-term bone marrow cultures. Viruses from the diseased primary mouse and from secondary recipients converted an erythropoietin-dependent cell line (BaF3/EpoR) into factor-independent derivatives but had no effect on the interleukin-3-dependent parental BaF3 cells. Most of these factor-independent cell clones contained a major Env-related glycoprotein with an Mr of 60,000.

For this purpose, two human leukemia, well-characterized parental cell lines, HL60 and CEM, and their derived multidrug-resistant cells, HL60/DNR and CEM/VBL, were cultured with or without different anti-cancer agents. To evaluate the comet test, two DNA-damaging agents were used: daunorubicin (DNR), which is involved in MDR, and ambamustine (AMBA), which is independent from MDR. Moreover, in order to evaluate the specificity of the comet test, the activity of vinblastine (VBL), an MDR-related, DNA-independent anti-cancer drug, was also tested. Finally, the specificity of the comet test in detecting MDR was confirmed by culturing parental or resistant cells with DNR with or without the revertant agent verapamil (VER). Results confirm that the comet test is able to predict cellular chemoresistance when DNA damaging agents are tested. Finally, experiments on the role of the comet test in evaluating certain aspects of DNA repair are discussed.","['Mattii, L', 'Barale, R', 'Petrini, M']","['Mattii L', 'Barale R', 'Petrini M']","['UO Ematologia, Universita di Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Electrophoresis/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400976 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):627-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400976.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, myeloma cells expressed a similar density of CD28 antigen to that of normal T cells. The myeloma CD28 molecules were able to bind B7-Ig molecules as well as L cells transfected with a B7-1 cDNA, and anti-CD28 mAb inhibited the binding. Myeloma cells did not express B7-1 antigens but a low density of B7-2 antigens. The myeloma B7-2 molecules of two HMCL were able to bind CTLA-4 protein. No autocrine CD28:B7-2 activation could be evidenced as we found no spontaneous binding of the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase to CD28 molecules. In addition, a blocking anti-CD28 mAb did not affect the IL-6-dependent or autonomous proliferation of the HMCL. The activation of myeloma CD28 molecules with or without TPA stimulation did not affect the proliferation, survival, differentiation, expression of activation antigens and cytokine receptors or cytokine production of myeloma cells. However, the triggering of myeloma CD28 molecules by B7-1 transfectant cells resulted in binding of the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase to CD28 molecules as previously shown for T cell CD28 molecules.

N nucleotide addition was found at two Vkappa-Jkappa and five Vlambda-Jlambda junctions. The lambda-chain complementarity determining region (CDR)-3 was longer and more variable than the kappa-chain CDR-3 mainly due to junctional flexibility of Vlambda and Jlambda segments. Somatic mutations were more frequent in the Jlambda than the Jkappa segments, and were distributed in the CDR-3 as well as the frame work region (FWR)-4. Those of the Jkappa segments, however, were limited to FWR-4. In FWR-4, replacement mutations were clustered at codon 106 of kappa-chain and 103 of lambda-chain.

A comprehensive analysis of all the available data permitted characterization of three cases of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) associated with HTLV-I (one definitive case, of leukemic type, with demonstration of clonal integration of HTLV-I proviral genome and two probable ATL cases), three cases of Sezary syndrome (SS), two cases of mycosis fungoides (MF) and five cases of pleomorphic cutaneous lymphoma. In one case, the differentiation between MF and pleomorphic cutaneous lymphoma could not be established. HTLV-I serological and/or molecular markers were restricted to the three ATL cases. From the unique definitive ATL case, a T cell line was established from culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and sequence analysis of the env gene and the U3-LTR region demonstrated that the virus present in this patient belonged to the cosmopolitan subtype A. Thus, we report here the first evidence of HTLV-I infection and associated ATL in Mali. This is the second ATL case described for the whole Sahelian region (one ATL of the lymphoma type was reported previously in a Mauritanian patient). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the main types of CTCL described in Europe and North America are also present in this African area and that the prevalence of these diseases is greatly underestimated in such regions. Furthermore, no association was observed between HTLV-I/II infection and SS, MF or pleomorphic cutaneous lymphoma in Mali in contrast to other studies.","['Fouchard, N', 'Mahe, A', 'Huerre, M', 'Fraitag, S', 'Valensi, F', 'Macintyre, E', 'Sanou, F', 'de The, G', 'Gessain, A']","['Fouchard N', 'Mahe A', 'Huerre M', 'Fraitag S', 'Valensi F', 'Macintyre E', 'Sanou F', 'de The G', 'Gessain A']","[""Unite d'Epidemologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Mali', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Sezary Syndrome/immunology/*pathology/virology']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400956 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):578-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400956.,,,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,

The released progenitor cells are predominantly in G0/G1 and show a relatively high percentage of rhodamine dull cells. Within the BM these last two features are characteristic of the more primitive progenitors. Although the mobilized PB cells can give rise to long-term repopulation and thus contain stem cells, the frequency of stem cells is not much higher if long-term initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays are used. To determine whether quiescent stem cells are selectively released or the low-cycle status of PB progenitors is related to the release from the BM microenvironment, the cell cycle status and rhodamine content in the PB and BM during mobilization were studied and compared with steady-state BM. More differentiated and more primitive progenitors were separated based on differentiation markers and cloned in single cell assay. In mobilized PB 54% of the CD34+ cells (n=5) were rhodamine dull compared to 22% in steady-state BM (P=0.014) [n=6]. The percentage of CD34+ cells in the S/G2M phases of the cell cycle was 2.1% in the mobilized PB (n=11), and 18% in steady-state BM (n=11) [P=0.002]. During mobilization the fraction of cells in the S/G2M phase of the cell cycle was 16% in BM (n=7), similar to steady-state BM (P=0.34). The released progenitors represented a selection of BM progenitors, with significantly more primitive progenitors (CD34+/13+/33dim) and less lymphoid precursors (CD34+/19+). Within the more differentiated CD34+113+/33bright, myelomonocytic precursors, both in PB as well as in BM, the percentage S/G2M was relatively higher than in the CD34+/13+/33dim subfraction: in normal BM: median 18% vs 8% (P=0.006) [n=8]; in mobilized PB 3% vs 2% (P=0.03) [n=10]; and in BM during mobilization 24% vs 7% (P=0.01) [n=6]. The cycle status of mobilized PB progenitors was low both in the primitive and more differentiated subfractions. During the mobilization period the BM progenitors are cycling as in steady-state BM. The low-cycle status of the mobilized PB progenitors may be related to the loss of contact with the micro-environment.","['Croockewit, A J', 'Raymakers, R A', 'Smeets, M E', 'vd Bosch, G', 'Pennings, A H', 'de Witte, T J']","['Croockewit AJ', 'Raymakers RA', 'Smeets ME', 'vd Bosch G', 'Pennings AH', 'de Witte TJ']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*blood/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacokinetics', 'G1 Phase/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Propidium', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/pharmacokinetics', 'S Phase/physiology', 'Staining and Labeling/methods']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400981 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):571-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400981.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that TF-1 cells may be induced to megakaryocytic differentiation by phorbol ester (phorbol dibutyrate, PDB) addition, particularly when combined with thrombopoietin (Tpo). RT-PCR studies showed that Tpo induces Tpo receptor (TpoR or c-mpl), whose expression was further potentiated by PDB addition. When the cells are induced with both PDB and Tpo erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) expression was inhibited. In the absence of Zn2+-induced PML/RARalpha expression, PDB and Tpo induced megakaryocytic differentiation of TF-1 MTPR clones as observed in 'wild-type' TF-1 cells. Conversely, when PML/RARalpha expression was induced by Zn2+, PDB and Tpo treatment of these clones caused only a reduced level of megakaryocytic differentiation. These observations indicate that: (1) TF-1 cells as well as other erythroleukemic cells, possess the capacity to differentiate to megakaryocytic cells when grown in the presence of protein kinase (PKC) activators and more efficiently when combined with Tpo; (2) the PML/RARalpha gene has a wide capacity to interfere with the program of hematopoietic differentiation, including megakaryocytic differentiation. Finally, we also observed that PML/RARalpha expression in TF-1 cells induces an up-modulation of interleukin-3 receptor, c-kit and c-mpl, a phenomenon which may offer these cells a growth advantage.","['Testa, U', 'Grignani, F', 'Hassan, H J', 'Rogaia, D', 'Masciulli, R', 'Gelmetti, V', 'Guerriero, R', 'Macioce, G', 'Liberatore, C', 'Barberi, T', 'Mariani, G', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Peschle, C']","['Testa U', 'Grignani F', 'Hassan HJ', 'Rogaia D', 'Masciulli R', 'Gelmetti V', 'Guerriero R', 'Macioce G', 'Liberatore C', 'Barberi T', 'Mariani G', 'Pelicci PG', 'Peschle C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400967 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):563-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400967.,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ligand-binding properties of RARalpha/VDR are equivalent to that of VDR, with an observed Kd for 1alpha,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (D3) of 0.5 nM. In CV-1 cells, both RARalpha and RARalpha/VDR induce comparable levels of ligand-mediated transcriptional activity from the retinoic acid responsive reporter gene, beta(RARE)3-TK-luciferase, in the presence of the ligand predicted from the receptor ligand-binding domain. Two chimeric RAR receptors were constructed which contained the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER): RARalpha/ER and ER/RARalpha/ER. Both RARalpha/ER and ER/RARalpha/ER bind beta-estradiol with high affinity, and are transcriptionally active only from palindromic RAREs (TREpal and/or (TRE3)3). Only RARalpha/VDR matched in kind and degree the functional characteristics of RARalpha: (1) maximally active from the beta(RARE); (2) moderately active from the TREs; (3) inactive from the retinoic X receptor response elements (RXREs) ApoA1 and CRBP II; (4) forms heterodimers with RXRalpha; and (5) binds to the betaRARE. F9 embryonal carcinoma cell lines were generated which express RARalpha/VDR mRNA (F9RARalpha/VDR cells) and compared with F9 wild-type (F9-Wt) cells, which do not express VDR mRNA. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (tRA) inhibits cell growth and induces the differentiation morphology in both F9-Wt and F9-RARalpha/VDR cells; whereas, treatment with D3 is similarly effective only for F9-RARalpha/VDR cells. It is concluded RARalpha/VDR is an useful 'tool' to pinpoint, or to augment transcription from RAREs in gene pathways controlled by RAR without inhibiting the retinoid responsiveness of endogenous RARs.","['Pemrick, S M', 'Abarzua, P', 'Kratzeisen, C', 'Marks, M S', 'Medin, J A', 'Ozato, K', 'Grippo, J F']","['Pemrick SM', 'Abarzua P', 'Kratzeisen C', 'Marks MS', 'Medin JA', 'Ozato K', 'Grippo JF']","['Department of Metabolic Diseases, Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Nutley, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cholecalciferol/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Estradiol/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/physiology', 'Transfection']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400937 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):554-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400937.,"['0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All reconstituted mice developed leukemia with a short latency period (5-11 weeks). In addition to hyperproliferation associated with elevated levels of PCNA, extensive apoptosis was also observed in all leukemic animals with p53 accumulating in the apoptotic cells. Whereas bax encoded protein, an effector of p53 apoptotic activity was detected in apoptotic cells, p21Waf1 protein, a potential mediator of p53 growth suppression was not detected in these cells suggesting that v-myc-induced apoptosis was independent of the ability of p53 to induce p21Waf1. These results indicate that apoptosis, a part of the cellular response to v-myc expression, does not prevent leukemia development and that hyperproliferation rather than abrogation of oncogene-induced apoptosis appears to be a critical event in v-myc-induced leukemia.","['Dolnikov, A', 'Shounan, Y', 'Millington, M', 'Mackenzie, K', 'Symonds, G']","['Dolnikov A', 'Shounan Y', 'Millington M', 'Mackenzie K', 'Symonds G']","[""Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology/*virology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Genes, myc/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Virus Integration']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400968 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):542-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400968.,"['0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, cell lines which constitutively express nbl at low levels appear not to undergo typical apoptotic death in response to Act D. Apoptotic induction by Act D in cells which normally express nbl at high levels was found in this study to be closely associated with a decline in nbl mRNA levels, raising the possibility that apoptosis could be induced by lowering nbl expression levels in such cells. Transient expression of nbl antisense sequences in HL-60 cells decreased cell viability, and induced typical apoptotic morphology such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Incubation with nbl antisense oligomers also induced similar features in HL-60 cells and in another high nb-expressing cell line, Jurkat, but had little effect in HepG2 cells which constitutively express nbl at low levels.

The hnRNP C and AUF-1 (hnRNP D) proteins were determined to be two of the IL-3 ARE binding proteins. Incubation of protein extracts with antibodies to hnRNP C and AUF-1 significantly decreased the protein binding to the IL-3 ARE. Treatment of IL-3 dependent cells with calcium ionophores eliminated the proteins binding to the ARE in wild-type IL-3-dependent FL5.12 cells and also resulted in the accumulation of IL-3 mRNA transcripts with a long half-life. These results indicated that there was a specific complex which bound the IL-3 mRNA 3' ARE.

The diagnosis was acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 10 patients, two each with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and the remaining three with malignant lymphoma (ML). Seven cosmid probes (D17S34, cCI17-624, cCI17-453, D17S379, cCI17-636, cCI17-732 and TP53) which mapped on 17p13 were used to analyze the allelic deletion. Eighty percent (19 out of 24) of the informative leukemia patients exhibited allelic loss in 17p13.3 at cC17-624. The smallest region of an overlapping deletion was observed on chromosome band 17p13.3 between cCI17-624 and cCI17-453. Patients with translocation involving 17p also showed deletion at cCI17-624 and cCI17-453. We hypothesize that this region contains a novel tumor suppressor gene(s) that is involved in leukemogenesis.","['Sankar, M', 'Tanaka, K', 'Kumaravel, T S', 'Arif, M', 'Shintani, T', 'Yagi, S', 'Kyo, T', 'Dohy, H', 'Kamada, N']","['Sankar M', 'Tanaka K', 'Kumaravel TS', 'Arif M', 'Shintani T', 'Yagi S', 'Kyo T', 'Dohy H', 'Kamada N']","['Department of Cancer Cytogenetics, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alleles', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase/physiology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Male', 'Metaphase/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400973 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):510-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400973.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclosporins inhibit drug transport mechanisms, particularly the multidrug transporter p-glycoprotein 170, leading to their use as chemosensitizers. In myeloma, clonotypic blood B cells represent the major drug-resistant subset. This study compares the ability of cyclosporin A analogues and metabolites to inhibit cellular transporter(s) in myeloma and normal B cells in vitro, and evaluates their potential role in vivo. Cyclosporin A (CsA), CsG, PSC 833 or SDZ 280-446, and primary CsA and CsG metabolites, were tested for their ability to inhibit drug transport mechanisms of ex vivo malignant B cells from 81 patients with multiple myeloma as compared to B cells from normal donors, as measured by the export of the dye rhodamine 123 (Rh123) using multiparameter flow cytometry. The majority of myeloma B and normal B cells had efficient transporter function as measured by their CsA-sensitive export of Rh123. CsA and CsA analogues mediated efficient inhibition of this transport. Inhibition of dye transport by normal B cells required an approximately six-fold greater concentration of the synthetic peptolide SDZ 280-446 than was needed to optimally inhibit transport by myeloma B cells. PSC 833 and CsG were inhibitory at concentrations approximately five-fold lower than were required for CsA. Assessment of inhibitory potency in vivo indicated that the in vivo chemosensitizer levels of CsA and PSC 833 exceeded the transporter inhibitory concentration by four- and 20-fold respectively. In vivo, cyclosporins are rapidly and almost completely converted to metabolites. AM1 and AM4N, primary metabolites of CsA, mediated inhibition of transport, as did CsG metabolites GM1, GM4N and GM9. AM1 and GM9 are known to reach steady-state in vivo levels that exceed the inhibitory concentration identified here by 1.1- to 1.9-fold. Thus, cyclosporin metabolites, which accumulate in the blood during infusion of CsA and other cyclosporins, are shown here to be effective chemosensitizers for normally drug-resistant myeloma cells in vitro. Cyclosporin metabolites are considered to be less toxic than the parent drugs, suggesting that novel chemosensitization strategies designed to minimize concentrations of parent drug and maximize accumulation of primary metabolites in vivo may optimize cytotoxicity to the malignant clone in myeloma.","['Pilarski, L M', 'Yatscoff, R W', 'Murphy, G F', 'Belch, A R']","['Pilarski LM', 'Yatscoff RW', 'Murphy GF', 'Belch AR']","['Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400984 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):505-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400984.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) phenotype is seen in a few cases. Since DP generally occurs in thymic T cells, whether the DP T leukemia cells represent thymic or peripheral T cells has been a matter of controversy. To address this issue, we studied phenotypical features in eight cases of DP T cell leukemia. Thymic DP T cells and peripheral CD8+ T cells have CD8 of alphabeta subunit, while CD8alphaalpha is induced in CD4+ T cells on activation with IL-4. We found that two patients with DP T large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGLL) showed dim expression of CD8alphaalpha, identical to the phenotype on IL-4-activated DP-T cells. The leukemic cells of these patients expressed IL-4 mRNA and produced high levels of IL-4. These findings suggest that they may be derived from peripheral CD4+ T cells. Three patients with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) showed CD8alphaalpha, suggestive of an activated peripheral T cell origin. One case expressed CD8alphaalpha dim and IL-4 mRNA, while the other two cases expressed no IL-4 mRNA and showed CD8alphaalpha bright phenotype, features not found in normal T cell populations. Three patients with T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) expressed CD8alphabeta. The DP phenotype is relatively common in T-PLL, and CD4+CD8alphabeta+ is characteristic of thymic T cells. The DP T-PLL cells did not express TdT,CD1 or recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1), which is down-regulated at the late stage of thymic T cell development. On the basis of these findings, we propose a late thymic origin for DP T-PLL. The phenotype of DP T cells differed for each entity and appeared to correlate with minor normal DP T cell population.","['Mizuki, M', 'Tagawa, S', 'Machii, T', 'Shibano, M', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Tsubaki, K', 'Tako, H', 'Yokohama, A', 'Satou, S', 'Nojima, J', 'Hirota, T', 'Kitani, T']","['Mizuki M', 'Tagawa S', 'Machii T', 'Shibano M', 'Tatsumi E', 'Tsubaki K', 'Tako H', 'Yokohama A', 'Satou S', 'Nojima J', 'Hirota T', 'Kitani T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Phenotype']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400978 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):499-504. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400978.,['207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LT enhances the proliferation of activated B cells and augments B cell proliferation induced by IL-2. It functions as an autocrine growth factor for EBV-infected B cell lines and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of B cell malignancies. We tested the expression of LT mRNA in B-CLL and found that LT was expressed in highly purified leukemic cells in 11 out of 11 patients examined. Regulation of expression of LT mRNA is aberrant in B-CLL cells, since LT mRNA expression was not detected in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells or B cells identified in seven out of seven normal individuals. In addition, LT mRNA expression was detected for up to 6 days in purified unstimulated in vitro cultures of B-CLL cells. Glucocorticosteroids, that have been effectively used in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies, were added to the cultures and abrogated the LT mRNA expression after an incubation time of 12 h. Addition of recombinant LT to cultures increased proliferation of B-CLL cells while proliferation of these cells was inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides against LT mRNA. B-CLL cells cultured with LT antisense oligonucleotides (asLT) as well as glucocorticoid-treated cells showed reduced viability and a DNA fragmentation ladder characteristic of apoptosis suggesting a relationship between down-regulation of LT mRNA expression and the induction of apoptosis. These studies support the role of LT in the growth regulation and development of B-CLL cells.","['Kulmburg, P', 'Radke, M', 'Digel, W']","['Kulmburg P', 'Radke M', 'Digel W']","['Department of Internal Medicine I (Haematology/Oncology), Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/physiology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/blood/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400954 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):493-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400954.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall mean percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was about 17% in the bone marrow of MDS, while bone marrow from control cases exhibited a mean of 3.4% (P < 0.001). To elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis in bone marrow cells of MDS, the expression of Fas antigen and Fas ligand (FasL) was examined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. All MDS cases showed expression of Fas mRNA (12/12) and most exhibited an expression of FasL mRNA (10/12) by RT-PCR. Basically, control cases did not show positive signals for Fas and FasL mRNA, however, a very weak band was detected in three cases (3/10) for Fas and in one case (1/10) for FasL mRNA by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical examination revealed positive staining for Fas (11/12) and FasL (12/12) in the bone marrow of MDS, while all the bone marrow samples from control cases were negative for anti-Fas (0/15) and for anti-FasL (0/15) antibody. Double staining clarified that TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells expressed Fas antigen on the cell surface, although not all Fas-positive cells were TUNEL positive. The Fas-positive cells of MDS bone marrow included hematopoietic cells expressing CD34 antigen, neutrophil elastase, a marker for myeloid series of cells, or glycophorin A, a marker for erythroid cells. However, CD68-positive cells which were macrophage lineage cells, did not express Fas antigen strongly. In contrast, positive staining for FasL was detected in hematopoietic cells and CD68-positive cells in the bone marrow of MDS. These results suggest that the Fas-FasL system plays an important role in inducing apoptosis in the bone marrow of MDS and works in an autocrine (hematopoietic cell-hematopoietic cell interaction) and/or paracrine (hematopoietic cell-stromal cell interaction) manner.","['Kitagawa, M', 'Yamaguchi, S', 'Takahashi, M', 'Tanizawa, T', 'Hirokawa, K', 'Kamiyama, R']","['Kitagawa M', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Takahashi M', 'Tanizawa T', 'Hirokawa K', 'Kamiyama R']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400980 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):486-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400980.,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction failures, deaths in remission and bone marrow relapses increased significantly with age. Analysis of clinical and biological features showed dominance of early B-ALL in childhood and increasing incidence of the Ph' chromosome with age. Over 80% of eligible children, but a much lower proportion of adults especially those over 40, was entered. Compliance was stricter in the paediatric trial but most deviations in adults involved giving more treatment. Analysis of results in a proportional hazards model confirmed the overwhelming independent influence of age; with all other factors equal a 10 year old had half the risk of treatment failure of a 20 year old and a 44 year old double the risk. Selective entry to therapeutic trials and increased treatment-related toxicity are features of adult ALL but age itself remains a dominant prognostic factor. While improved supportive care and refinements of conventional therapy may have some effect on prognosis, new understandings and treatment approaches to adult ALL are needed.","['Chessells, J M', 'Hall, E', 'Prentice, H G', 'Durrant, J', 'Bailey, C C', 'Richards, S M']","['Chessells JM', 'Hall E', 'Prentice HG', 'Durrant J', 'Bailey CC', 'Richards SM']","['Institute of Child Health, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aging/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400959 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):463-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400959.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cells bearing rearrangement of BCR/ABL can still be detected many years after achieving a CCR despite the absence of clinical evidence of active disease. It has been suggested that the disease is kept in a dormant state by immune mechanisms. How this is achieved is not known, but it has been speculated that p210BCR/ABL might be presented by malignant cells through HLA molecules, thus making them the target for specific immune cell killing. Because specific peptides will be expressed in association with certain HLA molecules, different HLA phenotypes could be associated with different response rates to IFN-A. The response to IFN-A-based therapies in 239 patients with chronic phase CML was analyzed according to their HLA phenotype. One hundred and ninety-four (81%) achieved complete hematologic response, 142 (59%) had a cytogenetic response which was major (MCR) in 93 patients (39%): complete (CCR) in 71 (30%) and partial (PCR) in 22 (9%). Patients with an HLA-B27 phenotype had the best response rate to IFN-A: 10 of 14 (71%) had an MCR, including eight (57%) with a CCR (P=0.02). Patients with HLA-B35, -A3, and -A31 also showed a trend towards a higher response rate, whereas patients with HLA-B18 had the lowest response rate (MCR 17%). Patients with HLA-B27 and those with HLA-A31 showed a trend for better survival, whereas patients with HLA-A2, -B7, or -B18 had a trend for shorter survival. We conclude that response to IFN-A in patients with CML may be associated with the HLA phenotype. However, a much larger population would be required to determine if the impact of HLA phenotype on survival is independent of other clinical prognostic features. These findings could be relevant for the understanding of immune mechanisms of control of CML and possibly the design of immune therapy for this disease.","['Cortes, J', 'Fayad, L', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Lee, M S', 'Talpaz, M']","['Cortes J', 'Fayad L', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Lee MS', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/immunology/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400965 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):455-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400965.,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighteen patients were treated with ATRA at a dose of 80 mg/m2/day (p.o.), divided into two equal doses after meals, for 7 consecutive days every other week for a maximum of 12 courses (1 course = 1 week on and 1 week off). Pharmacokinetic profiles of ATRA were evaluated during intermittent therapy on days 1 and 7 of course 1; on day 1 of course 2; on day 1 of course 6. Out of the 18 patients treated with ATRA, 11 (61%) went off study before the sixth course of treatment because of progressive hyperleukocytosis (seven cases), or thrombocytosis (one case), or refusal (three cases). Seven (39%) patients completed the first six courses (12 weeks) of treatment with ATRA and two of them (11%) maintained a white blood cell (WBC) <10 x 10[9]/l which was induced by the pretreatment with hydroxyurea. One patient completed the 12th course of ATRA maintaining WBC <10 x 10(9)/l, platelets <500 x 10(9)/l and spleen not palpable. The treatment with ATRA was well tolerated and only one patient discontinued the therapy because of non-hematological side-effects. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) decreased significantly (P< 0.001) during the first week of therapy. By adopting an intermittent dosing regimen, 1 week on/ 1 week off (1 course), at the start of courses 2 and 6, we obtained the ATRA AUCs equivalent to the ones achieved on day 1 of course 1. In conclusion, our results showed that ATRA alone appeared to be unable to control the WBC expansion in the CML patients in chronic phase. Moreover, it did not induce any remarkable cytoreductive effects on the platelet count and on the hemoglobin level. The major interest of ATRA would be in combination with other therapies. If ATRA was given in combination with IFNalpha or other agents, dose reduction of these would not be planned. On the basis of the pharmacokinetic profile, ATRA should be administered intermittently rather than continuously.","['Russo, D', 'Regazzi, M', 'Sacchi, S', 'Visani, G', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Avvisati, G', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Dastoli, G', 'Grandi, C', 'Iacona, I', 'Candoni, A', 'Grattoni, R', 'Galieni, P', 'Rupoli, S', 'Liberati, A M', 'Maiolo, A T']","['Russo D', 'Regazzi M', 'Sacchi S', 'Visani G', 'Lazzarino M', 'Avvisati G', 'Pelicci PG', 'Dastoli G', 'Grandi C', 'Iacona I', 'Candoni A', 'Grattoni R', 'Galieni P', 'Rupoli S', 'Liberati AM', 'Maiolo AT']","['Gruppo Ematologico Retinoidi, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400988 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Apr;12(4):449-54. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400988.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These secondary acute myeloid leukaemias (sAML) possess some common biological and clinical features of the corresponding de novo disorders. The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is known to have a role in haematopoiesis, and modulation of its action might contribute to the deregulation of proliferation seen in leukaemia. It has recently been reported that a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene is closely associated with the severity of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and may also play a role in the pathogenesis of sAML. We sought to confirm this finding in a large group of patients classified as having sAML. We found no differences in either the genotypic or allele frequencies of the polymorphism studied when compared with those of normal controls or other haematological disorders. No differences were observed in allele frequencies between younger and older patients, or between those patients who had an antecedent myelodysplasia and those who had received prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: St. Elisabeth Hospital, Curacao. METHODS: A total of 2531 sera were randomly collected from a total population of approximately 145,000 over a period of three months (of seven the sex was not known). An initial ELISA test was performed to detect anti-HTLV-I antibodies. If this test was positive an ELISA re-test (in duplicate) was performed. If one of these re-tests was found positive a western blot confirmation test was performed. The association with age, sex, social class and history of syphilis were analysed with multiple logistic regression models and adjusted for confounding. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of HTLV-I was 1.9% (49/2524). No significant sex differences were observed (odds ratio (OR): 1.13; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.62-2.05). Increasing age (p for trend = 0.0003) and lower social class (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.03-3.38) were important predictive factors for HTLV-I infection.

The transcribed texts were subjected to phenomenological-hermeneutic analysis. The spouses felt they were in a situation of overall severe crisis (i.e., experiencing feelings of distress, restrictions, and limited or lack of support). The analysis revealed three family types: the couple acting as a unit, the couple acting independently on equal terms, and the couple acting separately with the spouse in a subordinate position. The spouses' evaluation of the entire experience varied according to the family type and the spouses' personal resources, which influenced the availability and utilization of their social network as well as the support of health-care staff. Contentment was related to the couple acting as a unit or the couple acting independently on equal terms and taking control over the situation, actively asking for support and requiring the staff to meet their needs. Discontentment was related to subordination of the spouse to the partner or to health-care staff, and failure of the couple to obtain support between them or from others. Empowering the spouses may mean helping them develop their skills, providing them with opportunities and authority, and assisting them in gaining access to resources based on knowledge of the family type, the consent of the partner, and the spouse's freedom to make choices.

It is not known, however, if and how these components are connected. We have previously reported that GSH inhibits, in vitro, the neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) from Molt-4 leukemia cells. In this study, GSH was found to reversibly inhibit the N-SMase from human mammary carcinoma MCF7 cells. Treatment of MCF7 cells with TNFalpha induced a marked decrease in the level of cellular GSH, which was accompanied by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and generation of ceramide. Pretreatment of cells with GSH, GSH-methylester, or N-acetylcysteine, a precursor of GSH biosynthesis, inhibited the TNFalpha-induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation as well as cell death. Furthermore, no significant changes in GSH levels were observed in MCF7 cells treated with either bacterial SMase or ceramide, and GSH did not protect cells from death induced by ceramide. Taken together, these results show that GSH depletion occurs upstream of activation of N-SMase in the TNFalpha signaling pathway. TNFalpha has been shown to activate at least two groups of caspases involved in the initiation and ""execution"" phases of apoptosis. Therefore, additional studies were conducted to determine the relationship of GSH and the death proteases. Evidence is provided to demonstrate that depletion of GSH is dependent on activity of interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-like proteases but is upstream of the site of action of Bcl-2 and of the execution phase caspases. Taken together, these studies demonstrate a critical role for GSH in TNFalpha action and in connecting major components in the pathways leading to cell death.","['Liu, B', 'Andrieu-Abadie, N', 'Levade, T', 'Zhang, P', 'Obeid, L M', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Liu B', 'Andrieu-Abadie N', 'Levade T', 'Zhang P', 'Obeid LM', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Glutathione/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingolipids/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.18.11313 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)38347-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 May 1;273(18):11313-20. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.18.11313.,"['0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,"['F32 GM017426-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 GM017426/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AG-12467/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-17426/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Evidence for the presence of ELL-associated proteins that suppress the transcriptional inhibitory activity of ELL.,11212-7,"The human ELL gene on chromosome 19 undergoes frequent translocation with the trithorax-like MLL gene on chromosome 11 in acute myeloid leukemia. Recently, it was demonstrated that the product of the human ELL gene encodes an RNA polymerase II elongation factor (Shilatifard, A., Lane, W. S., Jackson, K. W., Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (1996) Science 271, 1873-1876). In addition to its elongation regulatory activity, ELL contains a novel type of RNA polymerase II interaction domain that is capable of negatively regulating polymerase activity in promoter-specific transcription in vitro (Shilatifard, A., Haque, D., Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 22355-22363). Here, we report the identification and purification of a large ELL-containing complex that contains three proteins in addition to ELL and that we have named the Holo-ELL complex. The Holo-ELL complex can increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. However, unlike the ELL polypeptide alone, the Holo-ELL complex is not capable of negatively regulating polymerase activity in promoter-specific transcription in vitro. The inability of the Holo-ELL complex to negatively regulate polymerase activity in promoter-specific transcription suggests that one or more of the ELL-associated proteins regulate this activity, possibly through an interaction with the N-terminal domain of the ELL protein, which was shown to be required for the transcriptional inhibitory activity of ELL. Characterization of these ELL interacting proteins should help define the regulation of the biochemical activities of ELL and how loss of this regulation leads to the development of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Shilatifard, A']",['Shilatifard A'],"['St. Louis University School of Medicine, Edward A.

No translocations involving bcl-2 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene were identified; two cases had translocations involving the bcl-1 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes.

The salivary smears showed to be reproducible and more sensitive than mucosal smears for the demonstration of Candida organisms. The salivary smear method was applied to another group of 10 patients with acute myeloid leukemia during a 28-day period. According to swab cultures, 8 patients were colonized with Candida spp. on day 0, whereas 2 patients were unclonized on day 0, and remained so. All colonized patients developed acute oral candidiasis. According to the salivary smear method, 5 patients were colonized with pseudohyphae as early as on day 0, whereas 3 patients became colonized with pseudohyphae within the first 7 days. Pseudohyphae were detected with a median of 4 days prior to the emergence of acute oral candidiasis, and the detection of acute oral candidiasis was associated with an increase in the quantity of pseudohyphoae. The study suggests that the demonstration of candidal pseudohyphae in salivary smears is an early indicator of subsequent development of acute oral candidiasis. Further studies are neded to clairfy whether early treatment based on this finding will reduce the occurrence of acute oral candidiasis and disseminated candidiasis in these patients.","['Bergmann, O J']",['Bergmann OJ'],"['Department of Medicine and Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Oral Microbiol Immunol,Oral microbiology and immunology,8707451,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Candida/cytology/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis, Oral/complications/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa/microbiology', 'Saliva/*microbiology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-302x.1996.tb00195.x [doi]'],ppublish,Oral Microbiol Immunol. 1996 Oct;11(5):362-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-302x.1996.tb00195.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined Na+-dependent Pi transport in immortalized mouse distal convoluted tubule (MDCT) cells. Pi uptake by MDCT cells is Na+-dependent and, under initial rate conditions, is inhibited by phosphonoformic acid (41 +/- 3% of control), a competitive inhibitor of Na+-Pi cotransport. The transport system has a high affinity for Pi (Km = 0.46 mM) and is stimulated by lowering the extracellular pH from 7.4 to 6.4 and inhibited by raising the pH from 7.4 to 8.4. Exposure to Pi-free medium for 21 h increased Na+-Pi cotransport from 2.1 to 5.5 nmol/mg of protein/5 minutes (p < 0.05) while parathyroid hormone, forskolin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate failed to alter Pi uptake in MDCT cells. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of MDCT cell RNA provided evidence for the expression of the Npt1 but not the Npt2 Na+-Pi cotransporter gene. However, preincubation of MDCT cells with Npt1 antisense oligonucleotide led to only 20% inhibition of Na+-Pi cotransport, suggesting that other Na+-Pi cotransporters are operative in MDCT cells. Indeed, we showed, by ribonuclease protection assay, that MDCT cells express the ubiquitous cell surface receptors for gibbon ape leukemia virus (Glvr-1) and amphoteric murine retrovirus (Ram-1) that also function as Na+-Pi cotransporters. In summary, we demonstrate that the pH dependence and regulation of Na+-Pi cotransport in MDCT cells is distinct from that in the proximal tubule and suggest that different gene products mediate Na+-Pi cotransport in the proximal and distal segments of the nephron.","['Tenenhouse, H S', 'Gauthier, C', 'Martel, J', 'Gesek, F A', 'Coutermarsh, B A', 'Friedman, P A']","['Tenenhouse HS', 'Gauthier C', 'Martel J', 'Gesek FA', 'Coutermarsh BA', 'Friedman PA']","[""Department of Pediatrics, McGill University-Montreal Children's Hospital Research Institute, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colforsin', 'Gene Expression', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kidney Tubules, Distal/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Parathyroid Hormone', '*Phosphate Transport Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type I', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', '*Symporters', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.4.590 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1998 Apr;13(4):590-7. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.4.590.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Phosphate Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Slc17a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc17a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc20a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc20a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type I)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,['GM34399/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In investigating the sequence and function of the CyRE, we found a region of DNA with homology to the distal NFAT site in the IL-2 promoter. In this paper we characterize this sequence and show that the VIP NFAT site recognizes T cell NFAT with similar affinity to the previously characterized IL-2 NFAT site. However, despite its location in the middle of the CyRE, we find no CNTF/LIF induced binding to it. Instead we show that in NBFL neuroblastoma cells, the calcium ionophore A23187 induces a protein to bind to the VIP NFAT site. This A23187-mediated induction of nuclear protein binding to an NFAT oligonucleotide is dependent on extracellular calcium but not dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Thus, this protein has the characteristics of an NFAT-like protein and is recognized by an NFAT3-specific antiserum suggesting that it is indeed an NFAT protein.

Drugs, chemical exposure, radiation, and viruses are implicated as etiologic agents, although the majority of community-acquired SAA is idiopathic. Regardless of the inciting event, most cases of SAA result from immune-mediated destruction of bone marrow progenitor cells, which spares pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. SAA is treated by either allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or immunosuppressive therapy. BMT restores normal hematopoiesis and cures the disease in 60% to 80% cases, with the major causes of failure being graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Most patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy recover hematopoiesis sufficiently to not require transfusions and are free of infection, although in many, recovery is incomplete. Moreover, up to 50% of SAA patients successfully treated with immunosuppressive therapy relapse or develop a secondary clonal disorder, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelodysplastic syndrome, or leukemia. High-dose cyclophosphamide without BMT is capable of restoring normal hematopoiesis with little or no risk of relapse or secondary clonal disorders.

The most impressive structural modification of this vinorelbine derivative was the selective introduction of two fluorine atoms at the 20' position, a part of the molecule previously inaccessible by classic chemistry. The antitumor activity of vinflunine was evaluated against a range of transplantable murine and human tumors. Vinflunine exhibited marked activity against murine P388 leukemia grafted i.v. when given i.p. in single or multiple doses according to various schedules or in single i.v. or p.o. doses. Increases in life span achieved with vinflunine, as assessed by T/C ratios, ranged from 200% to 457% and proved markedly superior to those of 129-186% obtained with the other Vinca alkaloids tested. Against s.c.-implanted B16 melanoma, multiple i.p. administration of vinflunine proved active in terms of both survival prolongation and tumor growth inhibition, with optimal T/C values and relative areas under the tumor growth curves (rAUC) being 24% and 36%, respectively. The extent of this activity was superior to that noted for vinorelbine under the same experimental conditions. Growth inhibition of human tumor xenografts LX-1 (lung) and MX-1 (breast) was also observed following four weekly i.p. injections of vinflunine as reflected by optimal T/C values of 23% and 26%, respectively, and significant differences in the rAUCs noted for treated versus control animals. It was also noticeable that vinflunine induced considerably more prolonged inhibitory effects on tumor growth than did vinorelbine. These results demonstrate that vinflunine is well tolerated and is definitively active against a range of experimental animal tumor models. Vinflunine activity has been documented in terms of both survival prolongation and tumor growth inhibition, with definite superiority over vinorelbine being shown in each tumor model evaluated.","['Kruczynski, A', 'Colpaert, F', 'Tarayre, J P', 'Mouillard, P', 'Fahy, J', 'Hill, B T']","['Kruczynski A', 'Colpaert F', 'Tarayre JP', 'Mouillard P', 'Fahy J', 'Hill BT']","['Division of Experimental Cancer Research I, Pierre Fabre Research Center, Castres, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vinorelbine']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050764 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;41(6):437-47. doi: 10.1007/s002800050764.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5BF646324K (vinflunine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q6C979R91Y (Vinorelbine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Phase II study (CALGB 9031) was conducted to determine the effectiveness of and toxicities that would result from adding cisplatin to DHAC administered to the same patient population. METHODS: Thirty-six patients were treated with concurrent DHAC at 1500 mg/m2/day for 5 days by continuous infusion and cisplatin 15 mg/m2 daily for 5 days. Therapy was repeated every 3 weeks. Cisplatin was to be increased to 20 mg/m2 daily in subsequent cycles if toxicity was minimal. Therapy was continued until disease progression or excessive toxicity mandated discontinuation. RESULTS: Overall, 5 objective responses were observed in 29 evaluated patients (objective response rate, 17%). The median duration of response was 6.6 months. Median survival was 6.4 months, with a median time to clinical failure of 2.7 months. The major toxicity noted was significant chest/pericardial pain, as was observed with DHAC alone. There were 2 early deaths of unknown cause on Days 9 and 17 of therapy, respectively. Significant leukopenia was observed in 29% of patients, but there were no neutropenic fevers. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of cisplatin to DHAC did not increase the response rate over that observed with DHAC alone in patients with mesothelioma; however, it did increase toxicity, especially leukopenia. This combination is not recommended for further studies involving mesothelioma patients.","['Samuels, B L', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Harmon, D C', 'Carey, R', 'Aisner, J', 'Corson, J M', 'Suzuki, Y', 'Green, M R', 'Vogelzang, N J']","['Samuels BL', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Harmon DC', 'Carey R', 'Aisner J', 'Corson JM', 'Suzuki Y', 'Green MR', 'Vogelzang NJ']","['Lutheran General Hospital, Park Ridge, Illinois 60068, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Chest Pain/chemically induced', 'Cisplatin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Pleural Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/04/29 06:33,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/04/29 06:33'],"['1998/04/29 06:33 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/04/29 06:33 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980415)82:8<1578::AID-CNCR21>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Apr 15;82(8):1578-84.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0627D8VG1C (5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,"['CA 12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Worldwide, several million HTLV-I carriers are at risk for disease, with an estimated lifetime cumulative risk of 1%-5%. However, the determinants of disease progression are relatively unknown. We studied human leukocyte antigens (HLA class II) that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HTLV-I-related diseases. METHODS: We analyzed HLA class II alleles among asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers (n = 45), patients with ATL (n = 49) or HAM/TSP (n = 54), and HTLV-I seronegative control subjects (n = 51). All participants were of African descent and were enrolled in epidemiologic studies conducted at the University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica. We used standard microlymphocytotoxicity assays for HLA antigen serotyping and polymerase chain reaction-based methods to examine HLA class II DRB1 and DQB1 alleles. RESULTS: Two antigens determined by serotyping, DR15 and DQ1, occurred at significantly increased frequency among HTLV-I carriers compared with seronegative control subjects (42% versus 22% for DR15 [odds ratio [OR] = 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-7.2] and 78% versus 53% for DQ1 [OR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.2-8.5]). Asymptomatic carriers were shown to have an HLA class II allele distribution similar to that of patients with ATL, and the frequencies of the alleles DRB1*1501, DRB1*1101, and DQB1*0602 were significantly greater in patients with ATL and asymptomatic carriers than in patients with HAM/TSP. In addition, haplotypes DRB1*1101-DQB1*0301 and DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 were significantly increased among patients with ATL compared with patients with HAM/TSP. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that host genetic background is an important factor in determining whether HTLV-I carriers develop either ATL or HAM/TSP.","['Manns, A', 'Hanchard, B', 'Morgan, O S', 'Wilks, R', 'Cranston, B', 'Nam, J M', 'Blank, M', 'Kuwayama, M', 'Yashiki, S', 'Fujiyoshi, T', 'Blattner, W', 'Sonoda, S']","['Manns A', 'Hanchard B', 'Morgan OS', 'Wilks R', 'Cranston B', 'Nam JM', 'Blank M', 'Kuwayama M', 'Yashiki S', 'Fujiyoshi T', 'Blattner W', 'Sonoda S']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Alleles', 'Blacks/*genetics', 'Carrier State/*virology', 'Genes, MHC Class II/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/90.8.617 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Apr 15;90(8):617-22. doi: 10.1093/jnci/90.8.617.,,,,,,,['N01-CP40548/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

This case-control study, nested in a cohort of members of a meatcutters' union in Baltimore, Maryland, investigated whether occupational exposures are associated with death from tumors of the hemopoietic and lymphatic systems. Cases of these tumors represent all deaths which occurred in the cohort between 1949 and 1980. Excess risks of tumors of the hemopoietic and lymphatic systems were observed throughout the meat industry, except in meatpacking plants. Slaughtering activities involving heavy exposure to oncogenic viruses were strongly associated with these tumors, especially with lymphomas. Thus, elevated risks were observed for butchers who killed animals (odds ratio (OR) = 5.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-27.0); workers in chicken-slaughtering plants (OR = 3.3, 95% CI 0.8-13.1); and workers in cattle/sheep/pig abattoirs (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 0.8-9.5). Among supermarket workers, wrapping meat (mainly a female activity) was associated with increased risk of tumors of the hemopoietic and lymphatic systems (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.0-14.3), with the odds of both lymphomas and tumors of the myeloid stem cell being elevated. On the other hand, meatcutting in supermarkets (almost exclusively a male activity) was associated with multiple myeloma; the odds ratio for men was 18.0 (95% CI 1.6-207.5), with no myeloma cases being recorded in women. These associations persisted after limited control for exposures outside the industry that have also been observed to be associated with excess risk, such as exposure to pesticides, working/living on pig farms, and exposure to X-rays. The findings provide evidence that workers in the meat industry may be at elevated risk of tumors of the hemopoietic and lymphatic systems. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to identify more conclusively which exposures play an etiologic role in the occurrence of the different histologic types of these tumors.","['Metayer, C', 'Johnson, E S', 'Rice, J C']","['Metayer C', 'Johnson ES', 'Rice JC']","['Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, LA 70112-2699, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Baltimore/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cattle', 'Death Certificates', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', '*Meat-Packing Industry', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*classification', 'Poultry', 'Probability', 'Sheep', 'Swine']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009517 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1998 Apr 15;147(8):727-38. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a009517.,,,,,,,['R01 CA-30410/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we characterize NS cells in human BM. NS activity was found in a fraction of low density (1.055-1.065 g/ml) BM cells that had been depleted of T cells, B cells, and monocytes. The NS activity was significantly decreased by the depletion of CD34+ or CD33+ cells but not CD56+ cells. The NS activity was indeed detected in isolated CD34+ cells and further enriched in CD34+CD33+ cells. Hematopoietic progenitor cells committed to the myeloid lineage were also enriched in the CD34+CD33+ cells, which significantly correlated to the NS activity. From these findings, it is strongly suggested that NS activity in human BM is exerted by the myeloid hematopoietic progenitors.

CD73 participates in purine salvage through this enzymatic activity, supplying cells with precursors for energy metabolism and nucleic acid biosynthesis. As an enzyme that produces adenosine, CD73 can also regulate adenosine receptor engagement in many tissues. However, CD73 also has functions independent of its enzyme activity. Like many glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecules, it transmits potent activation signals in T cells when ligated by antibodies. Less compelling evidence suggests that CD73 may function as a cell adhesion molecule. In the human immune system, CD73 is expressed on subsets of T and B cells, on germinal center follicular dendritic cells, and on thymic medullary reticular fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Many challenging areas remain to be explored before the role of CD73 in the immune system will be fully understood. These include an evaluation of the role of adenosine receptors in lymphoid development, the identification of physiological CD73 ligands, a functional assessment of the GPI anchor, and an analysis of the intricate cell-type-specific and developmental regulation of CD73 expression.","['Resta, R', 'Yamashita, Y', 'Thompson, L F']","['Resta R', 'Yamashita Y', 'Thompson LF']","['Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/genetics/*immunology/metabolism"", 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/enzymology', '*Signal Transduction']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-065x.1998.tb01574.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 1998 Feb;161:95-109. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065x.1998.tb01574.x.,"[""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",,,,133,,"['AI18220/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA6180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM39699/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II trial in elderly AML patients was conducted to determine the efficacy of two induction courses of a moderately-dosed combination of aclarubicin (25 mg/m2, 30 min i.v., days 1-4), etoposide (100 mg/m2, 30 min i.v., days 1-3) and conventional-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C, 100 mg/m2, c.i.v., days 1-3 and 30 min i.v., q 12 hours, days 4-7) (AVA-7), followed by one consolidation treatment using a reduced-dose schedule over five days (AVA-5) after three months in CR. RESULTS: Thirty-two AML patients with a median age of 66.2 years (range 60-76) were included in the study: three of them had histories of preexisting myelodysplasia and one of polycythemia vera. Following 1-2 courses of AVA-7 17 patients (53%) achieved CR, two PR (6%), and nine had resistant disease (28%); the overall response rate was thus 59%. Toxicity was significant but acceptable, with an overall treatment-related death rate of five of 32 patients (16%) after 63 courses of AVA. The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 12 months, and the median survival of all patients was 16.6 months. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the combination of aclarubicin, etoposide and conventional-dose ara-C is effective in elderly AML patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to define the clinical relevance of the bcl-2 mRNA expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its correlation to therapy outcome and prognosis, we analyzed 219 AML bone marrow (BM) samples, including 119 patients with de novo AML at presentation, 37 with AML following myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as 42 BM samples of AML in relapse and 21 in complete remission (CR) using RT-PCR. For performing quantitative measurements of bcl-2 mRNA, we developed a quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Bcl-2 mRNA was detectable in 133 of 156 (84%) patients at diagnosis and 40 of 42 (95%) at relapse. AML patients with high bcl-2 mRNA expression achieved lower CR rates than those with no or low expression.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive AML patients (pts) (including 11 children < 15 years), with a median age of 32 years, were analyzed. After achievement of CR with cytarabine-mitoxantrone (7 + 3) in adults and a BFM-like protocol in children, pts were intensified with cytarabine 2 g/m2 x six doses plus mitoxantrone for adults, or, 3 g/m2 x six doses plus etoposide for children, followed by G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg SC daily. The ablative regimens used were busulfan and cyclophosphamide (Bu/Cy) in standard-risk pts plus etoposide (2400 mg/m2) for high-risk pts. RESULTS: For the 54 pts who underwent autologous transplant, the median time to reach > 1.0 x 10(9)/l neutrophils was 13 days (8-48), and to reach platelets > 25 x 10(9)/l 32 days (8-364), and the median numbers of red blood cell and platelet units transfused were 3 and 5, respectively. Six pts had treatment-related deaths (11%). The disease-free survival and overall survival at 30 months (mos) for the 56 eligible pts were 61% and 62%, respectively. Only two relapses were observed after 21 mos, while there were 12 relapses within 12 mos. CONCLUSIONS: The above treatment results in a similar DFS rate as does rescue with bone marrow cells, with faster neutrophil and platelet recovery.","['Pavlovsky, S', 'Fernandez, I', 'Milone, G', 'Martinez Rolon, J', 'Corrado, C', 'Desmery, P', 'Dignani, C', 'Michelet, M', 'Juni, M']","['Pavlovsky S', 'Fernandez I', 'Milone G', 'Martinez Rolon J', 'Corrado C', 'Desmery P', 'Dignani C', 'Michelet M', 'Juni M']","['Angelica Ocampo Hospitalization and Clinical Research Center-FUNDALEU, Buenos Aires, Argentina. fundaleu@datamarkets.com.ar']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1008271624978 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1998 Feb;9(2):151-7. doi: 10.1023/a:1008271624978.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",['Ann Oncol. 1998 Feb;9(2):129-30.

Biological and clinical considerations. Part III: The chronic leukemias and myelofibrosis.,383-90,"The different therapeutic options available for the treatment of chronic leukemias and myelofibrosis are discussed. In reference to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the choice of the most appropriate treatment must take into account not only the clinical condition but also the age of the patient. While subjects under 50 might benefit from the options offered by alpha-interferon, bone marrow and peripheral stem cell transplant, in older age groups treatment of the chronic phase must still rely on standard treatment. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and its variants is a disease of mostly middle and late life, with a variable clinical course. Patients show wide differences in morbidity and mortality. Many features have been shown to influence the prognosis, and the most important ones are incorporated into the staging systems currently in use. The results obtained from the study of large trials support the concept that treatment of patients with stable stage A CLL should be postponed until progression of disease. Treatment relies principally on alkylating agents, corticosteroids and radiation therapy; the new nucleoside analogues, such as fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, have recently acquired established value in improving overall survival. With regard to myelofibrosis, the histological and biological features that influence the natural course of the disease are described, as well as the choice of the most appropriate treatment, which ranges from the use of alkylating agents and androgens, to splenectomy and splenic irradiation.","['Quaglino, D', 'Di Leonardo, G', 'Furia, N', 'Pasqualoni, E', 'Campitelli, A']","['Quaglino D', 'Di Leonardo G', 'Furia N', 'Pasqualoni E', 'Campitelli A']","[""Department of Internal Medicine, University of L'Aquila, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Aging (Milano),"Aging (Milan, Italy)",9102503,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy/pathology']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03339619 [doi]'],ppublish,Aging (Milano). 1997 Dec;9(6):383-90. doi: 10.1007/BF03339619.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,52,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies raised against the extracellular domain of human gp130, we were able to show that the small form of the urinary gp130 probably contained only the hemopoietin domain.

Here, we characterized the basal, parathyroid hormone regulatory regions of the rat collagenase-3 gene and the proteins involved in this regulation. The minimal parathyroid hormone-responsive region was observed to be between base pairs -38 and -148. Deleted and mutated constructs showed that the activator protein-1 and the runt domain binding sites are both required for basal expression and parathyroid hormone activation of this gene. The runt domain site is identical to an osteoblast-specific element-2 or acute myelogenous leukemia binding sequence in the mouse and rat osteocalcin genes, respectively. Overexpression of an acute myelogenous leukemia-1 repressor protein inhibited parathyroid hormone activation of the promoter, indicating a requirement of acute myelogenous leukemia-related factor(s) for this activity. Overexpression of c-Fos, c-Jun, osteoblast-specific factor-2, and core binding factor-beta increased the response to parathyroid hormone of the wild type (-148) promoter but not with mutation of either or both the activator protein-1 and runt domain binding sites. In summary, we conclude that there is a cooperative interaction of acute myelogenous leukemia/polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein-2-related factor(s) binding to the runt domain binding site with members of the activator protein-1 transcription factor family binding to the activator protein-1 site in the rat collagenase-3 gene in response to parathyroid hormone in osteoblastic cells.","['Selvamurugan, N', 'Chou, W Y', 'Pearman, A T', 'Pulumati, M R', 'Partridge, N C']","['Selvamurugan N', 'Chou WY', 'Pearman AT', 'Pulumati MR', 'Partridge NC']","['Department of Pharmacological and Physiological Science, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Collagenases/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 13', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Osteoblasts/*enzymology', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.17.10647 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)44782-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Apr 24;273(17):10647-57. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.17.10647.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (run protein, Drosophila)', '0 (transcription factor PEA3)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (MMP13 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinase 13)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Mmp13 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Mmp13 protein, rat)']",,,,,,"['R01 DK047420/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK47420/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK48109/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['NASA'],['Non-programmatic'],,,

We also analyzed 100 cases, including 84 of the 409 referred patients for whom the diagnostic outside bone marrow slide had been sent for review. RESULTS: The overall concordance rate was 73%. In 18% discordances were present and considered of major importance (affecting treatment and/or prognosis) while in 9% there were minor discordances. Major discordance rates were 2% for chronic lymphocytic leukemic leukemia and 5% for chronic myelogenous leukemia, but 29% for acute myelogenous leukemia (79 patients), 43% for acute promyelocytic leukemia (7 patients), 19% for acute lymphocytic leukemia (42 patients), 57% for hairy cell leukemia (7 patients), and 23% for the myelodysplastic syndromes (75 patients). The concordance rate was 76% in the 100 cases in which bone marrow specimens permitted comparison of the morphologic diagnosis made by M.D. Anderson and the referring physician using the same slide, with a rate of 75% in the acute leukemias as finally diagnosed at our institution.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood and/or bone marrow samples from 18 CML patients maintained in continuous cytogenetic remission by IFN-alpha for at least 1 year were studied for residual BCR-ABL mRNA by single-step reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR methodology, followed by detection of the amplification product by the hybridization protection assay (HPA). RESULTS: Ten of 18 patients showed RT-PCR negativity for BCR-ABL. The median duration of continuous complete cytogenetic remission at the time of sample collection for the negative patients was 42 months versus 21 months for the patients whose tests remained positive (P = .05). CONCLUSION: Very long-term follow-up of IFN-alpha-treated CML patients in continuous complete cytogenetic remission is associated with a decrease in the number of BCR-ABL transcripts to a level below that detectable by the RT-PCR assay used in this study.","['Kurzrock, R', 'Estrov, Z', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Talpaz, M']","['Kurzrock R', 'Estrov Z', 'Kantarjian H', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.4.1526 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Apr;16(4):1526-31. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.4.1526.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Competitive PCR showed a gradual decline by at least 4 orders of magnitude after 7 to 9 months in patients in continuous CR (CCR), while one patient who relapsed after 13.5 months only achieved a reduction by 2 orders of magnitude at the end of consolidation therapy. A rapid decrease below the detection limit was observed within 1 month in two patients after MUD-BMT. A temporary reappearance of molecular MRD was observed in these patients during immunosuppression for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). After reduction of immunosuppression, the level of MRD dropped again below the PCR detection limit. Molecular monitoring by conventional two-step RT-PCR yielded comparable results only when multiple assays per time point were performed, while single-assay RT-PCR gave misleading results. CONCLUSION: Competitive RT-PCR is a valuable tool for molecular monitoring during postremission chemotherapy, as well as after BMT.","['Laczika, K', 'Novak, M', 'Hilgarth, B', 'Mitterbauer, M', 'Mitterbauer, G', 'Scheidel-Petrovic, A', 'Scholten, C', 'Thalhammer-Scherrer, R', 'Brugger, S', 'Keil, F', 'Schwarzinger, I', 'Haas, O A', 'Lechner, K', 'Jaeger, U']","['Laczika K', 'Novak M', 'Hilgarth B', 'Mitterbauer M', 'Mitterbauer G', 'Scheidel-Petrovic A', 'Scholten C', 'Thalhammer-Scherrer R', 'Brugger S', 'Keil F', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Haas OA', 'Lechner K', 'Jaeger U']","[""Department of Medicine I, Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnosis, University of Vienna, St Anna Children's Hospital, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Remission Induction']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.4.1519 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Apr;16(4):1519-25. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.4.1519.,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow biopsies from 40 adult patients with AML were stained with the argyrophilic method. The mean AgNOR number (AgNOR count) was calculated for each case. After induction therapy, patients who achieved CR received intensive consolidation; two underwent autologous and four allogeneic bone marrow transplantations (BMT). RESULTS: The mean AgNOR count for the whole series was 6.6 (SD = 1.35); it was higher in CR patients than in resistant ones (P = .02). The median duration of CR was 26 months for patients with an AgNOR count greater than 6.6, but only 6 months for those with lower counts (P = .01). Sixteen patients who achieved a CR relapsed and 14 reached a second CR; the median duration of second CR was 16 months for patients with AgNOR count greater than 6.6, but only 5 months for those with lower counts (P = .01). The median survival time for the whole series was 14 months, with 30% of patients alive and in continuous CR at 103 months. Survival was longer for patients with an AgNOR count greater than 6.6 (33 months) than for those with lower counts (6 months; P = .0009). In multivariate analysis, when CR was excluded from the model, AgNOR count appeared as an independent prognostic variable (P = .005). CONCLUSION: AgNOR analysis is a suitable method to assess cell proliferation in bone marrow biopsies and can predict CR, remission duration, and survival in AML patients.","['Pich, A', 'Chiusa, L', 'Audisio, E', 'Marmont, F']","['Pich A', 'Chiusa L', 'Audisio E', 'Marmont F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Turin, S.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients treated on the Medical Research Council United Kingdom ALL trial no. 11 (MRC UKALL XI) were studied. The trial randomized patients at the presymptomatic CNS treatment (PCNS) phase to receive (1) intrathecal methotrexate and cranial radiotherapy (CRTX); (2) high-dose intravenous methotrexate with folinic acid rescue and continuing intrathecal methotrexate (HDMTX); and (3) continuing intrathecal methotrexate alone (ITMTX). Serial CSF samples were collected throughout treatment and concentrations of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MTF), methionine (MET), SAM, and myelin basic protein (MBP) were measured. The results were grouped into treatment milestones and compared with an age-matched reference population. RESULTS: There was a highly significant effect of both treatment milestones and trial arm on the metabolite and MBP concentrations. CSF MTF reached a nadir during the induction phase of treatment, while SAM and MET reached their nadir during the consolidation phase. CSF MBP mirrored SAM concentration and there was a significant inverse relationship between the two. MTF, SAM, and MBP returned to normal values by the end of treatment, while MET was increased significantly. The effect of treatment was decremental across the ITMTX, HDMTX, and CRTX groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment of ALL causes marked abnormalities in the single-carbon transfer pathway and subclinical demyelination. Methotrexate is one cause of this. Whether these abnormalities contribute to the late cognitive deficits requires further study.","['Surtees, R', 'Clelland, J', 'Hann, I']","['Surtees R', 'Clelland J', 'Hann I']","['Institute of Child Health, University College London Medical School, Department of Haematology and Oncology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service Trust, United Kingdom. r.surtees@ich.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Antidotes/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System/drug effects/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Demyelinating Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Methionine/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Myelin Basic Protein/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/radiotherapy', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/cerebrospinal fluid/*deficiency', 'Tetrahydrofolates/cerebrospinal fluid']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.4.1505 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Apr;16(4):1505-11. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.4.1505.,"['0 (Antidotes)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'TYK22LML8F (5-methyltetrahydrofolate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients were treated. The median age was 55 years (range, 30 to 73). Six were older than 60 years. Eight had progressed after intensive combination chemotherapy and three after allogeneic or autologous transplantation. For the first course, 16 patients received 2CDA at 15 mg/m2/d intravenously (i.v.) over 1 hour for 5 days. Two received 18 mg/m2 and one received 21.5 mg/m2 daily. The second course was escalated to 20 mg/m2/d in five patients. RESULTS: Rapid cytoreduction of leukemia occurred in the blood, with the nadir at 10 to 12 days. The median WBC count decreased from 36,900/microL before treatment to 500/microL at the nadir and recovered to 5,200/microL at day 30. The median platelet count changed from 113,000/microL to 24,000/microL at the nadir and 71,000/microL at day 30. The complete remission (CR) plus partial remission (PR) rate was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23% to 72%). One 64-year-old man with lymphoid blast phase of CML had a morphologic and cytogenetic CR that lasted 9 months. The median survival for all patients was 34 weeks, and the median survival for the eight responders was 56 weeks (range, 11 to 167). The median number of days spent in hospital over the entire treatment period was 19 (range, 4 to 60). CONCLUSION: High-dose 2CDA therapy provides effective palliation for CML in accelerated or blast phases, even for heavily pretreated patients.","['Dann, E J', 'Anastasi, J', 'Larson, R A']","['Dann EJ', 'Anastasi J', 'Larson RA']","['Department of Medicine, Cancer Research Center, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.4.1498 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Apr;16(4):1498-504. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.4.1498.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",,,,,,['CA 14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 304 men with advanced disseminated germ cell tumors were randomly allocated to receive four courses of BEP or VIP. Two hundred ninety-nine patients were assessable for toxicity and 286 were assessable for response. Complete response rates, favorable response (complete remission, surgical free of disease, continuous partial remission for 2+ years), time to treatment failure, and overall survival were assessed. RESULTS: Overall complete remission rate (VIP, 37%; BEP, 31%), favorable response rate (VIP, 63%; BEP, 60%), failure-free at 2 years (VIP, 64%; BEP, 60%), and 2-year overall survival (VIP, 74%; BEP, 71%) were not significantly different between the two treatments. Grade 3 or worse toxicity, particularly hematologic and genitourinary toxicity, was significantly more common in patients who received VIP. CONCLUSION: BEP and VIP produce comparable favorable response rate and survival in patients with poor-risk germ cell tumors. The substitution of ifosfamide for bleomycin, however, was associated with significantly greater toxicity.

Specific translocations, such as t(4;11) and t(9;22), identify subgroups of B-lineage ALL patients who have an increased risk of treatment failure. The current study was conducted to determine the prognostic significance of chromosomal translocations in T-lineage ALL patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 169 children with newly diagnosed T-lineage ALL enrolled between 1988 and 1995 on risk-adjusted protocols of the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) who had centrally reviewed cytogenetics data. Outcome analyses used standard life-table methods. RESULTS: Presenting features for the current cohort were similar to those of concurrently enrolled patients for whom cytogenetic data were not accepted on central review. The majority of patients (80.5%) were assigned to CCG protocols for high-risk ALL and 86.4% had pseudodiploid (n = 80) or normal diploid (n = 66) karyotypes; modal chromosome number was not a significant prognostic factor. Overall, 103 of 169 (61%) patients had an abnormal karyotype, including 31 with del(6q), 29 with 14q11 breakpoints, 15 with del(9p), 11 with trisomy 8, nine with 11q23 breakpoints, nine with 14q32 translocations, and eight with 7q32-q36 breakpoints. Thirteen patients had the specific 14q11 translocation t(11;14)(p13;q11) and all were classified as poor risk. Patients with any of these translocations had outcomes similar to those with normal diploid karyotypes. CONCLUSION: Chromosomal abnormalities, including specific nonrandom translocations, were frequently observed in a large group of children with T-lineage ALL, but were not significant prognostic factors for this cohort. Thus, contemporary intensive treatment programs result in favorable outcomes for the majority of T-lineage ALL patients, regardless of karyotypic abnormalities, and such features do not identify patients at higher risk for relapse.","['Heerema, N A', 'Sather, H N', 'Sensel, M G', 'Kraft, P', 'Nachman, J B', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Lange, B J', 'Hutchinson, R S', 'Reaman, G H', 'Trigg, M E', 'Arthur, D C', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Uckun, F M']","['Heerema NA', 'Sather HN', 'Sensel MG', 'Kraft P', 'Nachman JB', 'Steinherz PG', 'Lange BJ', 'Hutchinson RS', 'Reaman GH', 'Trigg ME', 'Arthur DC', 'Gaynon PS', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5251, USA. nheerema@medgen.iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification/*genetics', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.4.1270 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Apr;16(4):1270-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.4.1270.,,,,,,,"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The generation of such CTL epitopes has traditionally been thought to be from the primary open reading frame encoding the viral or tumor-associated proteins. In this report it is demonstrated that a viral CTL epitope can also be generated from an alternative reading frame. Using a combination of synthetic peptides and Sindbis or vaccinia expression systems, MHC class I Kd-restricted BALB/cByJ CTL directed against defective gag gene constructs of the LP-BM5 virus complex that causes murine AIDS were shown to have specificity for the antigenic peptide SYNTGRFPPL. This epitope is generated in a novel fashion from the second open reading frame (ORF2) of both the defective and ecotropic helper virus components of LP-BM5. Importantly, lysis of target cells expressing BM5 ecotropic helper, and/or defective viral gag, demonstrated that the SYNTGRFPPL epitope is generated during the course of a normal retroviral infection. Furthermore, MAIDS-resistant BALB/cByJ mice also generated secondary restimulated CTL specific for SYNTGRFPPL following in vivo priming with the LP-BM5 retroviral complex. These data suggest that retroviruses, and potentially other viruses and foreign genes, are capable of expressing T cell epitopes from alternative open reading frames.

The mutation frequency in the Ig VH (3.96 x 10(-2) and 2.41 x 10(-2) change/bp) and Vkappa and Vlambda (6.67 x 10(-2) and 1.74 x 10(-2) change/bp) genes of two CLLs (1.19 and 1.32, respectively) was similar, and higher than that in the corresponding gene segments of the third CLL (1.69; 3.4 x 10(-3) and 6.67 x 10(-3) change/bp).

In all three CLLs, the somatic mutations were all identical in multiple Ig VHDJH transcripts at any given time point, and were all conserved at multiple time points throughout a 2-yr period. The lack of concentration of R mutations in the complementarity-determining regions and the lack of intraclonal heterogeneity suggest that Ag may no longer be able to play a significant role in the clonal expansion of these cells. This conclusion would be strengthened further by the germline configuration of the bcl-1 and bcl-2 proto-oncogenes that are translocated in neoplastic B cells that display significant traces of intraclonal diversification and Ag-dependent selection, such as B-prolymphocytic leukemia and low grade follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","['Schettino, E W', 'Cerutti, A', 'Chiorazzi, N', 'Casali, P']","['Schettino EW', 'Cerutti A', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Casali P']","['Department of Pathology, Cornell University Medical College, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'CD5 Antigens/*genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, bcl-1/immunology', 'Genes, bcl-2/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Jan 15;160(2):820-30.,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)']",,,,,"['GENBANK/U31936', 'GENBANK/U31937', 'GENBANK/U31962', 'GENBANK/U31963', 'GENBANK/U31964', 'GENBANK/U31965']","['R01 AR040908/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 10811/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AR 40908/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4625536,,,,,,['NIHMS727909'],,

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether in vitro treatment with 4-HC will allow selection of K562 cells expressing higher levels of ALDH-1, and whether these selected cells are more resistant to 4-HC. Stably transfected or transduced K562 cells with retroviral pLXSN vector containing ALDH-1 cDNA (ALDH-1 cells) were treated repeatedly with 4-HC and then allowed to grow to confluence in liquid culture. Subsequently, the resistance to 4-HC of ALDH-1 cells treated once (ALDH-1+) or twice (ALDH-1++) with 4-HC was compared to ALDH-1 cells or wild-type K562 cells (WT cells). The results show significant increase in 4-HC resistance of ALDH-1+ (2- to 16-fold, p < 0.005) over ALDH-1 or WT cells. No difference was detected between ALDH-1+ and ALDH-1++. In addition, higher ALDH-1 mRNA and enzyme activity were found in ALDH-1+ compared to ALDH-1 cells. Southern analysis of DNA extracted from the different experimental groups demonstrated an eight-fold increase in ALDH-1 cDNA in ALDH-1+ versus the ALDH-1 cells. This was confirmed by sequential FISH analysis using biotin labeled pLXSN/ALDH-1 vector. Positive signals consistently localized to the centromeric region of chromosome 9 and the long arm of chromosome 17 were demonstrated only in the ALDH-1+ cells and represented a fusion product of multiple copies of the pLXSN/ALDH-1 vector. In summary, we have demonstrated that in vitro treatment with 4-HC results in the selection of K562 cells with multiple copies of ALDH-1 gene that are clustered in two main integration sites. These cells demonstrate significantly higher resistance to 4-HC when compared to previously untreated cells. Such successful in vitro selection could have significant implications for future cancer gene therapy protocols.","['Moreb, J S', 'Schweder, M', 'Gray, B', 'Zucali, J', 'Zori, R']","['Moreb JS', 'Schweder M', 'Gray B', 'Zucali J', 'Zori R']","['Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville 32610-0277, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Separation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1998.9.5-611 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Mar 20;9(5):611-9. doi: 10.1089/hum.1998.9.5-611.,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,['R29-CA59684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

At various times after infection, cells were fixed and stained for Tag by indirect immunofluorescence, and for DNA using propidium iodide. Tag immunofluorescence and DNA content were both quantified by flow cytometry. The results showed that Tag expression was first detected exclusively in the late G1 and early S phases of the cell cycle, approximately 12 h postinfection. The infection was synchronous in that Tag-expressing cells detected at 12 h, in late G1 and early S, moved as a discrete population through S phase, into the G2 + M phases of the cell cycle and then back into G1 during the next 8-10 h. The presence of a synchronous Tag-expressing cell population suggests that, at time of infection, cells in certain phases of the cell cycle were more susceptible to infection than cells in other phases. This may be related to synchronizing events that must occur before viral genes are expressed in infected cells; one such event may be integration of viral DNA into cellular chromosomes (i.e., provirus formation) that requires cells to pass through an M phase.","['Sladek, T L', 'Jacobberger, J W']","['Sladek TL', 'Jacobberger JW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Finch University of Health Sciences/The Chicago Medical School, North Chicago, Illinois 60064, USA. sladekt@mis.finchcms.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/immunology/pathogenicity']",1998/04/29 06:28,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/04/29 06:28'],"['1998/04/29 06:28 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/04/29 06:28 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19980401)31:4<235::AID-CYTO2>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1998 Apr 1;31(4):235-41.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,"['CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL41945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The mutant L1210/PMEA-1 cell line was characterized by an unusual specificity in that the cytostatic activity was severely impaired only for PMEA and the closely related 2,6-diaminopurine derivative PMEDAP, but not for its guanine counterpart PMEG or for 9-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (HPMPA). The L1210/PMEA-1 cell line showed poor resistance to the cytostatic activity of the lipophilic PMEA prodrug bis(POM)PMEA and virtually kept its PMEA resistance profile in the presence of indomethacin, excluding resistance of the cells of PMEA and PMEDAP by an increased efflux of the drugs. Intracellular purine nucleotide pool labelling studies with adenine, hypoxanthine and glycine revealed that PMEA/PMEDAP resistance did not originate from a defect in the enzymatic pathways of purine nucleotides. ATP, AMP and cAMP, but not adenosine, adenine, HPMPA and inhibitors of nucleoside transport carriers markedly interfered with PMEA uptake in L1210/0 cells.

The best studied family member, Raf-1, is expressed ubiquitously and constitutively, and its activity is regulated by post-translational mechanisms. Raf-1 can be activated by many signals that include growth factors, tumor promoters, inflammatory cytokines, calcium mobilization, DNA damaging agents, and oxygen radicals. Ras-mediated translocation of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane is a crucial step in its activation process, and is thought to facilitate phosphorylation by membrane-bound kinases. Raf-1 has also been reported to undergo intracellular redistribution following its activation: to the perinuclear space in murine NIH3T3 cells and rat hepatic Ito cells, and into the nucleus in gerbil hippocampal pyramidal cells and human MO7 leukemia cells. In contrast to the translocation to the plasma membrane, the perinuclear and/or nuclear translocation of Raf-1 has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, we report an examination of the subcellular localization of endogenous Raf-1 in a fibroblastic cell line (Rat-1) commonly used in transformation assays. Using the methods of cellular fractionation as well as in situ immunofluorescence, we show that no detectable movement of Raf-1 to the perinuclear or nuclear space can be observed. Tethering of activated Raf to the plasma membrane does not interfere with its transforming activity.","['Prouty, S M', 'Maroo, A', 'Maucher, C', 'Mischak, H', 'Kolch, W', 'Sedivy, J M']","['Prouty SM', 'Maroo A', 'Maucher C', 'Mischak H', 'Kolch W', 'Sedivy JM']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gerbillinae', 'Hippocampus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyramidal Cells/metabolism', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4889(97)00136-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4889(97)00136-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 Mar 12;1402(1):6-16. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4889(97)00136-5.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)']",,,,,,['GM-R01-55435/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Remission-induction therapy with an anthracycline derivative and cytarabine results in complete remission rates of approximately 50% in older patients; 15-20% of these remain free of leukaemia beyond 2-3 years and have a good quality of life. The clinical use of hematopoietic growth factors as adjuncts to chemotherapy to reduce complications and improve survival has not (yet) fulfilled his promise.

Application of allogeneic BMT from a matched unrelated donor is increasing, but the outcome is still inferior to that of sibling BMT, largely due to more severe and more frequent complications.

Whether control is exercised at this level depends critically on the amount of kinase available to the receptors and on the potential for redistribution of the kinase during signaling. This study demonstrates that the high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilonRI) on rat basophilic leukemia cells is regulated by its initiating kinase. We present a mathematical model that allows for the reversible recruitment of extrinsic kinases to phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. By comparing model predictions to experimental time courses of phosphorylation, we infer that Lyn is limiting, that redistribution occurs after receptors are aggregated, and that the redistribution makes the relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation and receptor aggregation nonlinear.","['Wofsy, C', 'Torigoe, C', 'Kent, U M', 'Metzger, H', 'Goldstein, B']","['Wofsy C', 'Torigoe C', 'Kent UM', 'Metzger H', 'Goldstein B']","['Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', '*Models, Immunological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Dec 15;159(12):5984-92.,"['0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",,,,,,['GM35556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

This has prompted the Working Group on CD34-Positive Hematopoietic Cells to evaluate the current utilization of allogeneic PBSC in clinical hematology. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The method employed for preparing this review was that of informal consensus development. Members of the Working Group met three times, and the participants at these meetings examined a list of problems previously prepared by the chairman. They discussed the single points in order to reach an agreement on different opinions and eventually approved the final manuscript. Some of the authors of the present review have been working in the field of stem cell transplantation and have contributed original papers in peer-reviewed journals. In addition, the material examined in the present review includes articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. STATE OF THE ART: Review of the current literature shows that unmanipulated allogeneic PBSC give prompt and stable engraftment in HLA-identical sibling recipients. Despite the much higher number of T-cells infused, the incidence and severity of acute GVHD after PBSC transplant seems comparable to that observed with bone marrow (BM) cells. In comparison to the latter, PBSC probably ensure faster immunologic reconstitution in the early post-transplant period. Controversial results on the incidence and severity of acute-GVHD have been reported when CD34+ selection methods are used. Prospective randomized trials are underway to compare the results of PBSC and BM allogeneic transplantation. In mismatched family donor transplants, T-cell depleted PBSC successfully engraft immune-myeloablated recipients through a megacell-dose effect able to overcome the HLA barrier. Experience with PBSC in the context of unrelated donor transplants is currently anecdotal and prospective trials should be completed before that practice becomes routine. Finally, there is also limited evidence that, following induction chemotherapy, the addition of PBSC to donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for treatment of leukemia relapse after BMT may improve the safety and effectiveness of DLI itself. Concerning cord blood (CB) transplants, the most interesting aspects are the ease of CB collection and storage, the low risk of viral contamination and the low immune reactivity of CB cells. This last property has its clinical counterpart in an apparently reduced incidence and severity of acute GVHD both in sibling and unrelated CB transplants, probably making the level of donor/recipient HLA disparity acceptable a greater degree with respect to what is required for transplants from other sources.","['Arcese, W', 'Aversa, F', 'Bandini, G', 'De Vincentiis, A', 'Falda, M', 'Lanata, L', 'Lemoli, R M', 'Locatelli, F', 'Majolino, I', 'Zanon, P', 'Tura, S']","['Arcese W', 'Aversa F', 'Bandini G', 'De Vincentiis A', 'Falda M', 'Lanata L', 'Lemoli RM', 'Locatelli F', 'Majolino I', 'Zanon P', 'Tura S']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Blood Cells/cytology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Feb;83(2):159-82.,,,,,207,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the progressive aging of the general population, the frequency of the disease will further increase, especially in very old individuals. In a cohort of 70 consecutive AML patients aged over 75 years, we investigated the clinico-hematological characteristics and treatment results. DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventy patients aged > 75 were diagnosed at our institutions as having AML between January 1987 and December 1996. This figure represents 8% of the whole AML patient population observed during the same period. These patients were studied concerning the main clinical and hematological features at presentation, therapeutic approach and clinical outcome. RESULTS: A myelodysplastic syndrome preceded the onset of AML in 10 patients (14%). Trilinear myelodysplasia was present in 28 patients (40%). Hypocellular leukemia was diagnosed in 12 cases (17%). An active infection was found in 12 patients (17%). Aggressive chemotherapy was given to 22 patients (31%), low-dose ARA-C (LDARA-C) to 7 patients (10%), while 41 (58%) were managed with supportive care and/or hydroxyurea (HU). Therapeutic choice was significantly influenced by performance status (p = .03), infections (p = .0001), severe co-morbid disease (p = .0001), and hypocellular AML diagnosis (p = .0001). Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 7/22 patients aggressively treated (32%), 0/7 in the LD-ARA-C group, and in one patient treated with HU. The median survival for the whole patient population was 18 weeks. There was no significant difference among the three treatment groups. However, patients achieving CR experienced significantly longer survival as did those with hypocellular leukemia. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In spite of a relevant selection at diagnosis, intensive chemotherapy is not appropriate for the majority of very old patients with AML. However, since a minority of patients takes substantial advantage from an aggressive approach, any effort should be made to preliminarily identify this subset at diagnosis.","['Ferrara, F', 'Annunziata, M', 'Copia, C', 'Magrin, S', 'Mele, G', 'Mirto, S']","['Ferrara F', 'Annunziata M', 'Copia C', 'Magrin S', 'Mele G', 'Mirto S']","['Division of Hematology, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy. ferrara@itb.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged/*physiology', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Terminal Care', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Feb;83(2):126-31.,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the characterization of CAM phenotypic profiles of the neoplastic clones in LPD may help to identify distinct subtypes with prognostic implications. In this work we sought to investigate whether the expression of CAM by circulating malignant cells in patients with B-cell LPD differed from that of normal peripheral blood B-lymphocytes (PBL) and whether the observed phenotypic patterns could be correlated to other biological and clinical parameters of known clinical relevance. DESIGN AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 148 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), 52 with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and 10 with hairy cell leukemia (HCL). The expression of CAM was analyzed by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies against CD49d, CD29, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, CD62L, CD54 and CD44. RESULTS: All CAM were detected in normal peripheral blood B-lymphocytes, except CD11c and CD54, which were present in only a minority of cells. Fluorescence mean channel values (FMC) showed that all molecules, with the exception of CD44, were expressed with dim intensity. Emerging patterns of CAM expression, as assessed by FMC values, were observed in different LPD: thus, B-CLL is characterized by a very low expression of CD49d/CD29 and beta 2 integrins. In this disorder, CD49d/CD29, CD11a, and CD54 increase with tumor burden; NHL show high expression of CD29 and CD54; strong expression of all molecules (except CD11a) was found in HCL, particularly CD11c (FMC values 60 times higher than normal). CD62L was faintly expressed in all diagnostic groups, whereas CD11c showed consistently high FMC values. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The data shows that the phenotypic characterization of LPD can be further refined by the analysis of their patterns of CAM expression which may help to identify distinct subsets within each nosological group.","['Lucio, P J', 'Faria, M T', 'Pinto, A M', 'da Silva, M R', 'Correia Junior, M E', 'da Costa, R J', 'Parreira, A B']","['Lucio PJ', 'Faria MT', 'Pinto AM', 'da Silva MR', 'Correia Junior ME', 'da Costa RJ', 'Parreira AB']","['Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de Francisco Gentil, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'CD18 Antigens/biosynthesis/blood', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/blood', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/biosynthesis/blood', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/blood', 'L-Selectin/biosynthesis/blood', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/biosynthesis/blood']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Feb;83(2):104-11.,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is most frequently found in smokers over 40 years of age. This neoplasm is presently the object of cytogenetic studies in an attempt to identify a specific chromosome pattern. In a study of 29 cases of malignant primary laryngeal tumor, Nawroz (1993) found a loss of alleles in different loci mapped in the short arm of chromosome 9 (9p) in more than two-thirds of the cases. In the same chromosome region, the loss of heterozygotes (LOH) was previously described in other neoplasms (leukemia, hematic tumors, melanomas). In an attempt to verify the predominant chromosome pattern and the loss of heterozygotes in chromosome 9, a cytogenetic, genetic-molecular study was performed on ten cases of laryngeal carcinoma. Among these subjects, two showed a hyperdiploid chromosome pattern (metaphase with more than 46 chromosomes per cell), five had a hypodiploid pattern (with less than 46 chromosomes per cell) while, for the remaining three cases, it was not possible to identify any metaphase. Numerous structural and numerical karyotype defects were found in chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, and Y. In 6 of the cases abnormality was found in chromosome 9 while in 10 it was apparently a homozygote. The study was performed with the use of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using a chromosome library specific for chromosome 9. A loss of the 9p segment could be found as a result of different types of alterations: deletion (case 1, 2, 5, 7); non uniform transfer between chromosome 2 and chromosome 9 (case 2); other transfers involving the 9p segment (case 1, 4, 5, 7, 10). In six cases, analysis was further detailed at the molecular level by means of DNA amplification methods (PCR) and electrophoresis on denatured 10% polyacrylammide gels. LOH was studied using a polymorphic system specific for the short arm of chromosome 9. Four of the cases examined showed LOH for the system used while one case (case 4) gave no information. Case 9 did not show any loss of alleles. The present study suggests that the loss of a DNA sequence on chromosome 9p is primary to the neoplastic progression in laryngeal cancer.","['Brunelli, M', 'Baroli, P', 'Bianchi, B']","['Brunelli M', 'Baroli P', 'Bianchi B']","['Presidio Ospedaliero di Cuggiono, Regione Lombardia, Legnano.']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital,Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale,8213019,IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Y Chromosome/genetics']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital. 1997 Oct;17(5):339-46.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,Indagine genetica nel cancro della laringe: contributo sperimentale.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The temperature at which isotropic 31P NMR signals for monomethyldioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (MeDOPE) first occurred is lowered by the FeLV peptide. The amount of isotropic signal seen at 40 degrees C is directly correlated to the peptide:lipid molar ratio. In the peptide-containing samples, more lipid remains in the isotropic state over the whole recorded temperature range. Isotropic 31P NMR signals were observed for DiPoPE in the presence of the FeLV peptide for the entire recorded temperature range of 35-50 degrees C, while pure DiPoPE showed no significant amount of isotropic signal. X-ray studies of DiPoPE show the formation of a new lipid phase with peptide, which is not seen in the pure lipid samples. Disordering of the Lalpha phase is evidenced by broadening of the diffraction peaks, and the hexagonal cell parameter is decreased with peptide present. Our results suggest that the FeLV peptide is increasing the negative curvature of the lipid system, which is thought to be crucial to the formation of highly bent, high-energy structural fusion intermediates, such as the ""stalk"" model. Fusion activity for this putative fusogenic peptide was also demonstrated, using a resonance energy transfer (RET) lipid mixing assay. To our knowledge, this work provides the first published experimental evidence of both fusogenic activity and effects on lipid polymorphism for the FeLV fusion peptide.","['Davies, S M', 'Epand, R F', 'Bradshaw, J P', 'Epand, R M']","['Davies SM', 'Epand RF', 'Bradshaw JP', 'Epand RM']","['Department of Preclinical Veterinary Sciences, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/chemistry/*physiology', 'Lipid Bilayers/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', '*Membrane Fusion/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/chemistry', 'Phosphorus Isotopes', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi980227v [doi]', 'bi980227v [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1998 Apr 21;37(16):5720-9. doi: 10.1021/bi980227v.,"['0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Phosphorus Isotopes)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '96687-23-9 (N-methyl-1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine)']",,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,

We postulated that these results reflect some form of cross-regulation between PKC-alpha and -delta rather than their functional redundancy. In this report, we show that overexpression of PKC-alpha in Baf3 and 32D leads to an elevation of the endogenous PKC-delta mRNA and protein levels. The elevated steady-state PKC-delta mRNA level results from a combination of increased PKC-delta transcription and mRNA stability. Upregulation of PKC-delta mRNA by PKC-alpha occurs even after a selective depletion of the PKC-delta protein. In addition, phorbol ester-induced elevation of PKC-delta mRNA and protein levels can be prevented by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, an indication of the requirement for PKC kinase activity. Inhibition of new protein synthesis by cycloheximide showed that upregulation of PKC-delta mRNA, as opposed to delayed downregulation of the PKC-delta protein, is primarily responsible for the accumulation of this isoform by PKC-alpha. In parental Baf3 and 32D cells and PKC-alpha overexpressers, PKC-alpha and PKC-delta are uniquely involved in cross-regulation, while PKC-epsilon, PKC-eta, and PKC-mu are not.","['Romanova, L Y', 'Alexandrov, I A', 'Nordan, R P', 'Blagosklonny, M V', 'Mushinski, J F']","['Romanova LY', 'Alexandrov IA', 'Nordan RP', 'Blagosklonny MV', 'Mushinski JF']","['Laboratory of Genetics and Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Stability/drug effects/genetics', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi9731807 [doi]', 'bi9731807 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1998 Apr 21;37(16):5558-65. doi: 10.1021/bi9731807.,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Prkcd protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Prkca protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are two forms of the receptor that have been previously cloned, and both are generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. Here we report the cloning of a third, alternatively spliced isoform of the human SR-A gene (type III hSR-A). The novel isoform is expressed in the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and also in primary human monocyte derived macrophages. When expressed in CHO-K1 cells, type III hSR-A does not internalize AcLDL despite having the domain shown to mediate this function in type I and II hSR-A. We show that type III protein has altered intracellular processing and is trapped within the endoplasmic reticulum, making it unable to perform endocytosis. Type III protein acts as a dominant negative isoform by reducing modified LDL uptake in CHO cells stably expressing either type I or type II SR-A. The demonstration that a naturally occurring splice variant of SR-A mRNA can act as a dominant negative isoform suggests a novel mechanism for regulation of scavenger receptor activity in macrophages.","['Gough, P J', 'Greaves, D R', 'Gordon, S']","['Gough PJ', 'Greaves DR', 'Gordon S']","['Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Carbocyanines', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Immunologic/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Scavenger', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class A', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/21 00:00,1998/04/21 00:01,['1998/04/21 00:00'],"['1998/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-2275(20)33292-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Lipid Res. 1998 Mar;39(3):531-43.,"['0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (MSR1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Scavenger)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class A)', '0 (acetyl-LDL)', ""40957-95-7 (3,3'-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine)""]",,,,,['GENBANK/AF037351'],,,,,,,,,,

Here, we analyzed the effect of CD40 triggering on cytokine production by HUVEC. CD40-L-transfected fibroblasts, in contrast to their untransfected counterparts, as well as a soluble recombinant human CD40-L/murine CD8alpha chimeric molecule were able to importantly increase (by a mean of fourfold) the production of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) by HUVEC. CD40-L displayed an additive effect with IL-4, IL-1alpha, and TNF-alpha on the enhancement of LIF secretion. Cyclosporin A did not affect LIF synthesis by resting or CD40-L-activated HUVEC, whereas dexamethasone diminished the basal level of LIF production and abrogated the CD40-L effect. The secretions of two other proinflammatory cytokines, granulocyte-macrophage CSF and IL-6, were also increased in the presence of CD40-L. However, CD40-L neither affected HUVEC proliferation nor rescued them from IFN-gamma- and TNF-alpha induced apoptosis. Together, these results indicate that endothelial cell activation by CD40-L may play an important role not only in leukocyte recruitment through enhancement of adhesion molecule expression, but also in the maintenance of an inflammatory loop through the increase in proinflammatory cytokine secretion.","['Dechanet, J', 'Grosset, C', 'Taupin, J L', 'Merville, P', 'Banchereau, J', 'Ripoche, J', 'Moreau, J F']","['Dechanet J', 'Grosset C', 'Taupin JL', 'Merville P', 'Banchereau J', 'Ripoche J', 'Moreau JF']","['Unite Mixte de Recherche CMRS 5540, Universite Bordeaux, France.

Sharing a single upstream primer derived from a homologous sequence in cyclins D1, D2 and D3, each PCR product serves as a competitor and cyclin D1 overexpression is determined by comparing the intensities of the three amplified products. We analyzed cyclin D1 in clinical specimens from 104 patients with lymphoid malignancies. Cyclin D1 overexpression was evident in 13 of 104 (7/72 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 0/6 adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemias, 0/4 Hodgkin's diseases, 0/11 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 3/4 multiple myelomas, 1/2 Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemias, 1/2 prolymphocytic leukemias and 1/3 chronic lymphocytic leukemias). Among 72 patients for whom cytogenetic studies had been done, all 7 patients with t(11;14) were positive. The relative expression levels of D-type cyclins altered dramatically in the presence of t(11;14). Thus, this RT-PCR assay can identify tumors with cyclin D1 overexpression. Cyclin D1 overexpression was frequent in extranodal specimens (11 out of 32 vs. 2 of 72 lymph nodes) and was restricted to specific types of lymphoid malignancies, as observed using other methods.

Such a separation of functional domains raises the possibility that mutations occurring at these regions may contribute to cell proliferation in the absence of differentiation, this being the most important characteristic in acute leukemia cells. Therefore, we analysed the structural abnormalities at the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region of G-CSFR in a significant number of patients with various myeloid malignancies. When we examined the genomic DNA of G-CSFR obtained from 41 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 18 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 7 with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 2 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and 1 with chronic neutrophilic leukemia, we found a polymorphism in 3 patients, but no significant pathogenic mutations in any patients. The screening for this polymorphism in 100 hematologically normal controls revealed that it may be useful as a linkage marker for population and family studies, because the heterozygosity index is at a high level (0.055). While there have been several reports discussing the leukemogenic potential of mutations in the cytokine/hematopoietin receptor superfamily, genetic alterations in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region of G-CSFR do not seem to play a pathogenic role in leukemia.","['Shibata, S', 'Asano, Y', 'Yokoyama, T', 'Shimoda, K', 'Nakashima, H', 'Okamura, S', 'Niho, Y']","['Shibata S', 'Asano Y', 'Yokoyama T', 'Shimoda K', 'Nakashima H', 'Okamura S', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics']",1998/04/21 00:00,1998/04/21 00:01,['1998/04/21 00:00'],"['1998/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01022.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1998 Mar;60(3):197-201. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01022.x.,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, it has been reported that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with inv(16) abnormality show a better prognosis, especially in case of treatment with high-dose Ara-C (HD Ara-C) containing regimens. In this study we aimed at testing whether leukemic cells from patients showing the inv(16) were more sensitive to Ara-C in vitro, compared to AML blasts from patients with normal karyotype or chromosomal abnormalities other than t(15;17) or t(8;21). We analyzed blast cells from 30 patients who were diagnosed and treated in our institution. The IC50 of Ara-C, as tested by the XTT colorimetric assay, was significantly lower in cases with inv(16) (18.5+/-15.88 micromol/l vs. 38+/-14.6 micromol/l,in cases with other abnormalities, p=0.01). This result was confirmed by a higher incorporation of [3H]-Ara-C into DNA (p=0.02 and p=0.001 compared to samples with normal and abnormal karyotype, respectively). All the same, Ara-C induced apoptosis was significantly increased in cells from patients with inv(16). Our data suggest a possible interaction between the molecular background of inv(16) and a modification of intracellular metabolism of Ara-C, and could thus provide a rationale for HD-Ara-C-based schedules for patients with inv(16) AML.","['Tosi, P', 'Visani, G', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Testoni, N', 'Pellacani, A', 'Tura, S']","['Tosi P', 'Visani G', 'Ottaviani E', 'Testoni N', 'Pellacani A', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology L. and A.

The data reviewed herein provides substantial evidence to suggest that B-CLL cells in fact can interact, not only with T-cells but also with endothelial cells and stromal cells in the bone marrow. These interactions, in particular signaling through CD40, contribute to extended survival and proliferation of B-CLL cells and, thereby, the risk of complete malignant transformation of the clone. Therefore, this review would suggest that the answers to how B-CLL is initiated may be found in molecules responsible for the normal regulation of immunopoiesis. Transformation to malignancy, by contrast, is likely to be caused by loss of control over the G1 restriction in the cell cycle in B-CLL cells.","['Jurlander, J']",['Jurlander J'],"['Department of Hematology, Finsencenter, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",1998/04/21 00:00,1998/04/21 00:01,['1998/04/21 00:00'],"['1998/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(97)10008-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(97)10008-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1998 Jan;27(1):29-52. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(97)10008-7.,,,,,266,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies from this and other laboratories suggest a novel sphingomyelin signal transduction pathway (1-4). Ceramide, which is generated by sphingomyelinase action, can be deacylated to sphingoid bases, which are potential inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC). Ceramide appears to have bioeffector properties. Cell-permeable ceramide analogs stimulate monocytic differentiation of human leukemia (HL60) cells (1), as well as the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at Thr669 in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells (2). Further studies (3,4) demonstrate the existence of a ceramide-activated protein kinase (CAPK) that may mediate some of these aspects. The present studies aim to investigate the mechanism of TGF beta 1 signaling and to explore whether TGF beta 1's pathway involves activation of PKC by 1,2-Diacylglycerol (DAG) and/or stimulation of a CAPK by ceramide. Ceramide and DAG levels of A431 cells are determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC) after treatment with either TGF beta 1 or with EGF. 100 pM TGF beta 1 treatment for 1 hr increases the cellular contents of DAG 2-fold. 20 nM EGF treatment for 15 min decreases it 0.5-fold. Ceramide levels are reduced 2-fold by TGF beta 1 and almost unaffected by EGF. To evaluate the involvement of other components of signal transduction, the effects of TGF beta 1 and EGF on PKC activity are studied. 20 nM EGF decreases membrane PKC activity to 0.5-fold of controls, whereas 100 pM TGF beta 1 treatment of A431 cells increases this activity 4-fold. Modulation of PKC activity is paralled by translocation of the enzyme between the cytosol and the membrane as determined by Western immunoblot analysis. These studies suggest that TGF beta 1 and EGF may have regulatory effects on both sphingolipid and phospholipid metabolisms which could transmodulate both the CAPK and the PKC mediated signal tranduction pathways.","['Goldkorn, T', 'Ding, T']","['Goldkorn T', 'Ding T']","['Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/drug effects/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'Second Messenger Systems/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Triglycerides/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/04/21 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4615-5325-0_62 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1997;400A:461-72. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-5325-0_62.,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the identity of the isoform of PGH synthase, i.e., PGH synthase-1 or -2, that is induced under these conditions has not been established. Northern and Western analyses revealed a dramatic increase in levels of PGH synthase-1 mRNA and protein levels within 24 hr after treatment of THP-1 cells with phorbol ester. No significant increase in PGH synthase-2 mRNA or protein was observed. The increases in PGH synthase-1 were accompanied by an enhanced capacity of the cells to produce PGE2.

We show that ET-18-OCH3-induced apoptosis is associated with activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. The addition of ET-18-OCH3 to distinct human leukemic cells (HL-60, U937, and Jurkat), which undergo rapid apoptosis on treatment with ET-18-OCH3, induced a dramatic and sustained increase in the of c-jun mRNA level that was associated with activation of activator protein-1 transcription factor. We found that ET-18-OCH3 induced a persistent activation of JNK in HL-60 cells that was detected before the onset of apoptosis, the latter being assessed by DNA fragmentation and by the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the external leaflet of the plasma membrane. The inductions of JNK after HL-60 monocyte/macrophage differentiation and ET-18-OCH3-mediated apoptosis were distinguished by the different activation patterns, transient versus persistent, respectively. ET-18-OCH3 analogues unable to induce apoptosis failed to activate JNK. ET-18-OCH3-dependent JNK activation was not detected in K562 cells, which did not undergo apoptosis on treatment with ET-18-OCH3. Phorbol myristate acetate inhibited both ET-18-OCH3-induced apoptosis and sustained JNK activation; thus, persistent JNK activation by ET-18-OCH3 is associated with the capacity of this ether phospholipid to induce apoptosis. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides directed against c-jun blocked ET-18-OCH3-induced apoptosis, indicating a role for c-Jun in this apoptotic response. These data indicate that JNK activation and c-Jun are involved in the induction of apoptosis by ET-18-OCH3.","['Gajate, C', 'Santos-Beneit, A', 'Modolell, M', 'Mollinedo, F']","['Gajate C', 'Santos-Beneit A', 'Modolell M', 'Mollinedo F']","['Instituto de Biologia y Genetica Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad de Valladolid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Genes, jun/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/09 00:00,1998/05/09 00:01,['1998/05/09 00:00'],"['1998/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.53.4.602 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1998 Apr;53(4):602-12. doi: 10.1124/mol.53.4.602.,"['0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 25 patients, 21 were infants. Fifteen cases were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), eight were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and two cases were biphenotypic. Nineteen cases were studied at diagnosis and six at time of relapse. p53 mutations were absent in all 19 cases studied at the time of diagnosis. The only mutation was a TGC-->TTC transversion (cys-->phe) at codon 141 in exon 5 in a case of infant ALL at relapse that occurred by subclone evolution after MLL gene translocation. We previously showed that p53 mutations are also absent in pediatric treatment-related leukemias with MLL gene translocations. The absence of p53 mutations at initial transformation may suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect of mutant p53 is not important in leukemias with MLL gene translocations. Alternatively, exogenous DNA damage may be the common feature in treatment-related and de novo cases. Since MLL gene translocations may occur through DNA repair and wild-type p53 is central to DNA repair, the absence of p53 mutations raises the possibility that wild-type p53, not mutant p53, may be important in the genesis of leukemias with these translocations.","['Megonigal, M D', 'Rappaport, E F', 'Nowell, P C', 'Lange, B J', 'Felix, C A']","['Megonigal MD', 'Rappaport EF', 'Nowell PC', 'Lange BJ', 'Felix CA']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', '*Models, Genetic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recurrence', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",1998/04/18 00:00,1998/04/18 00:01,['1998/04/18 00:00'],"['1998/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201637 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Mar 12;16(10):1351-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201637.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,"['1R29CA66140-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

CML is also relatively resistant to chemotherapy and the disease is difficult to cure using conventional therapeutic routes. CML is associated with increased abl oncogene protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that these aberrant responses to MIP-1alpha and the relative resistance to chemotherapy are directly related to this increased abl PTK activity in primitive haemopoietic cells. To do this we have expressed a temperature sensitive abl PTK in a growth factor dependent, multipotent stem cell line (FDCP-Mix) in which growth is normally suppressed by MIP-1alpha. In FDCP-Mix cells expressing the ts v-abl PTK and grown at the restrictive temperature for PTK activity the cells were relatively sensitive to cytotoxic agents such as cytosine arabinoside and 5-fluorouracil but MIP-1alpha could induce growth inhibition and confer some degree of protection from these agents. At the permissive temperature for abl PTK, the cells were relatively resistant to cytotoxic drugs and MIP-1alpha treatment neither induced growth inhibition nor protected the cells from cytotoxic drug induced cell death. This lack of response to MIP-1alpha was not due to receptor down modulation as neither the affinity nor the number of 125I-MIP-1alpha binding sites was altered by activating Abl PTK. However, MIP-1alpha mediated increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels were abrogated by switching cells to the permissive temperature for Abl PTK activity. These data suggest that the relative resistance of CML progenitor cells to therapeutic drugs and the lack of response to MIP-1alpha occurs as a direct consequence of abl PTK activity and involves desensitisation of signal transduction events stimulated by MIP-1alpha receptors. Thus one contributory mechanism to transformation of primitive haemopoietic cells is abrogation of response to a growth inhibitor.","['Wark, G', 'Heyworth, C M', 'Spooncer, E', 'Czaplewski, L', 'Francis, J M', 'Dexter, T M', 'Whetton, A D']","['Wark G', 'Heyworth CM', 'Spooncer E', 'Czaplewski L', 'Francis JM', 'Dexter TM', 'Whetton AD']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Cellular Development Unit, UMIST, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1998/04/18 00:00,1998/04/18 00:01,['1998/04/18 00:00'],"['1998/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201914 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Mar 12;16(10):1319-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201914.,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on earlier work, we have recently found functional evidence of their presence in human and mouse bone marrow. In this study we studied the cell-type association of the gap junction channel-forming protein, connexin, in mouse and human bone marrow under different physiological and pathological conditions and tested the pathway of communication in bone marrow cultures. For high-resolution antigen demonstration we took advantage of semi-thin resin sections, antigen retrieval methods, immunofluorescence, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Connexin43 (Cx43) and its mRNA were consistently expressed in human and rodent marrow. Cx37 was found only in the arteriolar endothelium, but neither Cx32 nor -26 were expressed. In tissue sections, the immunostained junctions appeared as dots, which were digitally measured and counted. Their average size was 0.40 mm in human and 0.49 mm in mice marrow. There were at least twice as many gap junctions in the femoral midshaft of 6-week-old mice (1.75 x 10(5)/mm3) as in those older than 12 weeks (0.89 x 10(5)/mm3). Most Cx43 was associated with collagen III+ endosteal and adventitial stromal cells and with megakaryocytes. Elsewhere, they were few and randomly distributed between all kinds of hematopoietic cells. In the femoral epiphysis of juvenile mice, stromal cell processes full of Cx43 enmeshed three to six layers of hematopoietic cells near the endosteum. The same pattern was seen in the midshaft of regenerating mouse marrow 3 to 5 days after cytotoxic treatment with 5-fluorouracil. Functional tests in cultures showed the transfer of small fluorescent dyes, Lucifer Yellow and 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5, 6-carboxyfluorescein, between stromal cells and in rare cases between stromal and hematopoietic cells too. The stromal cells were densely packed with Cx43 and we found aggregates of connexon particles in their membrane replicas. In normocellular human bone marrow, gap junctions were as rare as in adult mouse and similarly distributed, except that they were also on adipocytic membranes. In a few leukemic samples, characterized by an increased stromal/hematopoietic cell ratio, there were two- to fourfold more Cx43 (2.8 x 10(5) to 3.9 x 10(5)/mm3) than in the normal (1.0 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(5)/mm3). The cases included a hypoplastic acute lymphoblastic leukemia, an acute myeloid leukemia (French-American-British classification M4-5), a case of myelodysplastic syndrome with elevated number of megakaryocytes, and a CD34+ acute hemoblastosis, probably acute myeloid leukemia (French-American-British classification M7). Taken together, our results indicate that direct cell-cell communication may be involved in hematopoiesis, ie, in developmentally active epiphyseal bone marrow and when there is a demand for progenitors in regeneration. However, gap junctions may not play as important a role in resting adult hematopoiesis and in leukemias.","['Krenacs, T', 'Rosendaal, M']","['Krenacs T', 'Rosendaal M']","['Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, University College London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Connexin 43/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Freeze Fracturing', 'Gap Junctions/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Middle Aged', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",1998/04/18 00:00,1998/04/18 00:01,['1998/04/18 00:00'],"['1998/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1998 Apr;152(4):993-1004.,"['0 (Connexin 43)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",['Am J Pathol. 1998 Apr;152(4):851-4.

To determine whether phenotypic differences exist between these corresponding cell types, we investigated samples of normal pediatric bone marrow (n=30) as well as of B-precursor ALL at diagnosis (n=53; common and pre-B subtype). Using three-color multiparameter flow cytometric analysis, we compared the leukemic populations with the physiologic BCPs of corresponding maturity with respect to the intensity with which they expressed a series of antigens. In some of these antigens, leukemia-associated aberrations were frequently observed. In particular, overexpression of CD10 was displayed by 65% of ALL samples, whereas 58% of leukemic cases aberrantly exhibited very low or no CD45RA expression. Regarding CD11a and CD44, 47% and 35% of ALL populations were aberrant as defined by either the absence or significant overexpression of the antigen. In contrast, antigen densities of CD49d, CD49e, and CD99 on leukemic cells were in the normal range of values for BCPs. Combining the patterns of frequently aberrant markers in a comprehensive analysis, we were able to identify individual phenotypic leukemic cell aberrations in up to 98% of investigated cases. CD10 and/or CD45RA were aberrant in 86% of cases overall, emphasizing the high discriminative potential of these two markers. Using comparative phenotype mapping based on quantitatively aberrant, leukemia-associated antigenic patterns, we were able to detect leukemic blasts among normal bone marrow cells at frequencies as low as 10(-5). We speculate that our approach may have a profound impact on the development of new strategies for minimal residual disease investigations in patients with BCP-ALL.","['Dworzak, M N', 'Fritsch, G', 'Fleischer, C', 'Printz, D', 'Froschl, G', 'Buchinger, P', 'Mann, G', 'Gadner, H']","['Dworzak MN', 'Fritsch G', 'Fleischer C', 'Printz D', 'Froschl G', 'Buchinger P', 'Mann G', 'Gadner H']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'CD11 Antigens/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/analysis', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",1998/04/18 00:00,1998/04/18 00:01,['1998/04/18 00:00'],"['1998/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Apr;26(4):305-13.,"['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, since RNA degradation by RNase H appears to generate RNA fragments too large to spontaneously dissociate from the minus strand, we have investigated the possibility that RNA displacement by RT during plus strand synthesis contributes to the removal of RNA fragments. By using an RNase H- mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) RT, we demonstrate that the polymerase can displace long regions of RNA in hybrid duplex with DNA but that this activity is approximately 5-fold slower than DNA displacement and 20-fold slower than non-displacement synthesis. Furthermore, we find that although certain hybrid sequences seem nearly refractory to the initiation of RNA displacement, the same sequences may not significantly impede synthesis when preceded by a single-stranded gap. We find that the rate of RNA displacement synthesis by wild-type M-MuLV RT is significantly greater than that of the RNase H- RT but remains less than the rate of non-displacement synthesis. M-MuLV nucleocapsid protein increases the rates of RNA and DNA displacement synthesis approximately 2-fold, and this activity appears to require the zinc finger domain.","['Kelleher, C D', 'Champoux, J J']","['Kelleher CD', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.16.9976 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)46226-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Apr 17;273(16):9976-86. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.16.9976.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,,,,['R37 CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We initiated a series of experiments to examine the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating AChE expression during hematopoiesis. Differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells using dimethyl sulfoxide resulted in a 5- and 10-fold increase in intracellular and secreted AChE enzyme activity, respectively. Interestingly, these increases resulted from a preferential induction of the globular molecular form G1 and a slight increase in G4 instead of an increase in the levels of the G2 membrane-bound form, a molecular form expressed in mature erythrocytes. Concomitantly, expression of the two predominant AChE transcripts (R and T, for read-through and tail, respectively) in MEL cells was induced to a similar extent with differentiation. Nuclear run-on assays performed with nuclei isolated from induced versus uninduced MEL cells revealed that in contrast to the large increases seen in the transcription of the beta-globin gene, the transcriptional activity of the AChE gene remained largely unaffected after differentiation. Determination of the half-lives of the R and T transcripts demonstrated that they both exhibited an increase in stability in induced MEL cells. Taken together, results from these studies indicate that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms account for the increased expression of AChE in differentiated hematopoietic cells.","['Chan, R Y', 'Adatia, F A', 'Krupa, A M', 'Jasmin, B J']","['Chan RY', 'Adatia FA', 'Krupa AM', 'Jasmin BJ']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8M5, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/*biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Isoenzymes/*biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.16.9727 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)46191-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Apr 17;273(16):9727-33. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.16.9727.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induces the activation of Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways through glycoprotein (gp) 130 in cardiac myocytes. However, whether PI 3-kinase is involved in regulation of gp130 signaling and the activation mechanisms by which it associates with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins remain unknown. We found that LIF induced the activation of PI 3-kinase in cardiac myocytes. Moreover, JAK1 binds to PI 3-kinase, and LIF stimulation increases the PI 3-kinase activity in JAK1 immunoprecipitates. Activation of MAP kinase and protein kinase B by LIF was attenuated by wortmannin. LIF-induced p70 S6 kinase activation, protein synthesis, and c-fos mRNA expression were inhibited by wortmannin and rapamycin. Both inhibitors failed to appreciably affect the phosphorylation of STAT3. In conclusion, PI 3-kinase is activated with LIF in cardiac myocytes, and JAK1 is found to associate with this enzyme. PI 3-kinase provides a crucial link between gp130, MAP kinase, protein kinase B, and p70 S6 kinase in cardiac myocytes.","['Oh, H', 'Fujio, Y', 'Kunisada, K', 'Hirota, H', 'Matsui, H', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Yamauchi-Takihara, K']","['Oh H', 'Fujio Y', 'Kunisada K', 'Hirota H', 'Matsui H', 'Kishimoto T', 'Yamauchi-Takihara K']","['Department of Medicine III, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genes, fos/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Myocardium/cytology/*enzymology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Wortmannin']",1998/05/23 00:00,1998/05/23 00:01,['1998/05/23 00:00'],"['1998/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.16.9703 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)46188-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Apr 17;273(16):9703-10. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.16.9703.,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A T-cell receptor (TCR) gene analysis of the PB leukocytes demonstrated rearrangements of TCRalpha, TCRbeta, and TCRgamma genes. Therefore, the phenotype and genotype appeared to be consistent with an NK-like T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. However, when the PB lymphocytes were separated by size, it was found that 80% of NK marker positive cells were in the smaller cell population, while the neoplastic cells were in the large cell gate. A diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma with reactive NK-like T-cells was finally confirmed by demonstrating the presence of both large atypical lymphoid cells and large granular lymphocytes (LGL) on PB smears. Although immunoperoxidase stain of bone marrow and colon showed positive T-cell markers in the tumor cell population, cytoplasmic granules could not be identified in tissue sections and, thus, a distinction between T-cell lymphoma and NK-like T-cell lymphoma could not be made by light microscopy until NK markers were studied. CD57 was demonstrated immunohistochemically in small lymphocytes but not in the large tumor cells in the colon. Electron microscopy, however, demonstrated LGL reaction to the lymphoma cells in the colonic biopsy. NK-like T-cell lymphoma usually carries a poorer prognosis than peripheral T-cell lymphoma, thus the distinction of these neoplasms is important. This study emphasizes that T-cell lymphoma may cause an LGL reaction or proliferation. If the lymphoma cells were of the same size as LGL, flow cytometric studies may have misled the diagnosis to NK-like T-cell-lymphoma.","['Sun, T', 'Susin, M', 'Brody, J', 'Tack, K', 'Marsh, J', 'Teichberg, S', 'Koduru, P', 'Schwartz, P']","['Sun T', 'Susin M', 'Brody J', 'Tack K', 'Marsh J', 'Teichberg S', 'Koduru P', 'Schwartz P']","['VA Medical Center, Department of Pathology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver 80220, USA. jsun@calvin.UCHSC.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Colon/pathology', 'Female', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intestinal Mucosa/pathology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",1998/04/17 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/04/17 02:03'],"['1998/04/17 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/04/17 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199804)57:4<331::AID-AJH11>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199804)57:4<331::aid-ajh11>3.0.co;2-b [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1998 Apr;57(4):331-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199804)57:4<331::aid-ajh11>3.0.co;2-b.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another 50 patients receiving conventional anti-emetic therapies in bone marrow transplantation served as control.

The mean number of episodes of vomiting in the tropisetron and dexamethasone group was also significantly lower than in the control group (0.97+/-1.65 vs 3.50+/-2.45 and 1.30+/-1.40 vs 4.44+/-2.91 respectively, both P < 0.001). Control of vomiting in the two groups was not significantly different during days 3-6.

Patients given tropisetron and dexamethasone combination more frequently suffered from dizziness and burning sensation of the chest. However, diarrhea and extrapyramidal symptoms were the most frequent adverse effects seen after using conventional anti-emetic combination. The combination of tropisetron and dexamethasone was thus superior to conventional anti-emetic combinations in preventing vomiting during preconditioning period of bone marrow transplantation. The adverse effects of this combination were minimal and well tolerated by patients.","['Yen, C C', 'Hsieh, R K', 'Chiou, T J', 'Liu, J H', 'Fang, F S', 'Wang, W S', 'Tung, S L', 'Tzeng, C H', 'Chen, P M']","['Yen CC', 'Hsieh RK', 'Chiou TJ', 'Liu JH', 'Fang FS', 'Wang WS', 'Tung SL', 'Tzeng CH', 'Chen PM']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei and National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antiemetics/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Carmustine/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dizziness/chemically induced', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Headache/chemically induced', 'Heartburn/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Podophyllotoxin/adverse effects', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Tropisetron', 'Vomiting/*prevention & control', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1998/04/17 00:00,1998/04/17 00:01,['1998/04/17 00:00'],"['1998/04/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jjco/28.2.129 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1998 Feb;28(2):129-33. doi: 10.1093/jjco/28.2.129.,"['0 (Antiemetics)', '0 (Indoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6I819NIK1W (Tropisetron)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'BEAM protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nature of tumor promotion is multifaceted and has recently been shown to include suppression of programmed cell death (apoptosis) as a mechanism by which a tumor promoter can prolong cell viability. The ability of tumor promoters to suppress apoptosis prompted us to address the question of whether heptachlor is capable of effecting the expression of genes involved in lymphocyte apoptosis, in particular, the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Experiments with a CEM x 174 cell line, a hybrid of human T and B cells, revealed that heptachlor downregulated p53 gene expression at the post-transcriptional level without changing levels of mRNA in the cells. The heptachlor-induced reduction in the basal levels of expression of this gene was both in a concentration and time-dependent manner.","['Rought, S E', 'Yau, P M', 'Schnier, J B', 'Chuang, L F', 'Chuang, R Y']","['Rought SE', 'Yau PM', 'Schnier JB', 'Chuang LF', 'Chuang RY']","['Department of Medical Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, p53/*drug effects/genetics', 'Heptachlor/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Insecticides/*toxicity', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",1998/04/17 00:00,1998/04/17 00:01,['1998/04/17 00:00'],"['1998/04/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-4274(97)00096-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-4274(97)00096-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 1998 Jan 16;94(1):29-36. doi: 10.1016/s0378-4274(97)00096-9.,"['0 (Insecticides)', '7GLS9ACN3L (Heptachlor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to this probability, a mixture model with possibility of cure provides a predictive probability of cure given that a patient has survival to a period of time. Such probabilities are more realistic in measuring the effectiveness of the treatment and predicting the long-term survival of the patient than the 5-year survival rate. An extension of the cure model to the competing risks data is developed. The extended model is a finite mixtures model, where the independence of cause-specific failure times is not assumed. A data set consisting of leukemia with bone marrow transplant is used for illustration. Patients have three possible statuses after transplant: cured by the treatment, relapse of leukemia, or non-relapse-related death. Only the last two events are observable. Patients observed with these endpoints are uncensored cases and the transplant is not successful for them. A case is censored if the case is relapse-free and still alive at the end of its follow-up. Only censored cases have the possibility of being cured, but cure is not assumed to be observable. The status of cure is imputed by the posterior predictive probability of cure given the lifetime and is implemented in the Gibbs sampling. Cure is defined by assuming the risk for failure of a cured patient to be approximately zero. The probability of cure for the leukemia patients after the bone marrow transplant is about 27% for patients with the acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and 46% for the non-GVHD group. The probability of relapse, given that one is not cured, is 0.50 for the non-GVHD group and 0.34 for the GVHD group. The non-GVHD group has a better chance of survival, while the GVHD group has a lower chance for relapse. This is known as the GVHD-versus-leukemia effect.","['Chao, E C']",['Chao EC'],"['MathSoft, Inc., Seattle, Washington 98109, USA. echao@statsci.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biometry', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Models, Statistical', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', '*Risk', '*Survival Analysis']",1998/04/17 00:00,1998/04/17 00:01,['1998/04/17 00:00'],"['1998/04/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biometrics. 1998 Mar;54(1):350-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred pediatric patients with cancer treated at the Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland, died during 1987-92. Seventy children died while in organized terminal care. The underlying diagnoses were brain tumors (21), other solid tumors (24), and leukemias (25). The method was a retrospective analysis of patients' records and autopsy reports, in addition to a structured interview of the two parents separately. RESULTS: Autopsy was performed in 40 (57%) of these 70 cases. It was more often performed on children dying in hospital (69%) than in those dying at home (39%). The autopsy rate also varied with the underlying disease: 68% of patients with leukemia, 50% of those with solid tumors, and 52% of those with brain tumors were autopsied. Autopsy afforded totally new medical information in 20% of cases, and important additional information in 55%. Nothing unexpected was found in 25%. Almost all the parents (94%) who agreed to autopsy felt that it was appropriate. Of both mothers and fathers, 50% felt that knowing the findings at autopsy was helpful for them, and all the parents except one mother thought that the autopsy of their child would at least be helpful to other patients. CONCLUSIONS: Autopsy often provides important and even unexpected information in those dying after terminal care. The majority of our parents felt that autopsy was an acceptable and appropriate practice. We recommend that autopsies should be performed, with the parents' consent, even after terminal care.","['Sirkia, K', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, U M', 'Hovi, L', 'Sariola, H']","['Sirkia K', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Hovi L', 'Sariola H']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Autopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Terminal Care']",1998/04/17 02:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/04/17 02:02'],"['1998/04/17 02:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/04/17 02:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199805)30:5<284::AID-MPO4>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199805)30:5<284::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-b [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1998 May;30(5):284-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199805)30:5<284::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most promising lead molecule was 21 that had the highest activity toward L1210 and human tumor cells. In addition, 21 exerted preferential toxicity to human tumor lines compared to transformed human T-lymphocytes. Other compounds of interest were 38, with a huge differential in cytotoxicity between P388 and L1210 cells, and 42, with a high therapeutic index when cytotoxicity to P388 cells and Molt 4/C8 T-lymphocytes were compared. In general, the Mannich bases were more cytotoxic than the corresponding chalcones toward L1210 but not P388 cells. A ClusCor analysis of the data obtained from the in vitro human tumor screen revealed that the mode of action of certain groups of compounds was similar. For some groups of compounds, cytotoxicity was correlated with the sigma, pi, or molar refractivity constants in the aryl ring attached to the olefinic group. In addition, the IC50 values in all three screens correlated with the redox potentials of a number of Mannich bases. X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling of representative compounds revealed various structural features which were considered to contribute to cytotoxicity. While a representative compound 15 was stable and unreactive toward glutathione (GSH) in buffer, the Mannich bases 15, 18, and 21 reacted with GSH in the presence of the pi isozyme of glutathione S-transferase, suggesting that thiol alkylation may be one mechanism by which cytotoxicity was exerted in vitro. Representative compounds were shown to be nonmutagenic in an intrachromosomal recombination assay in yeast, devoid of antimicrobial properties and possessing anticonvulsant and neurotoxic properties. Thus Mannich bases of chalcones represent a new group of cytotoxic agents of which 21 in particular serves as an useful prototypic molecule.","['Dimmock, J R', 'Kandepu, N M', 'Hetherington, M', 'Quail, J W', 'Pugazhenthi, U', 'Sudom, A M', 'Chamankhah, M', 'Rose, P', 'Pass, E', 'Allen, T M', 'Halleran, S', 'Szydlowski, J', 'Mutus, B', 'Tannous, M', 'Manavathu, E K', 'Myers, T G', 'De Clercq, E', 'Balzarini, J']","['Dimmock JR', 'Kandepu NM', 'Hetherington M', 'Quail JW', 'Pugazhenthi U', 'Sudom AM', 'Chamankhah M', 'Rose P', 'Pass E', 'Allen TM', 'Halleran S', 'Szydlowski J', 'Mutus B', 'Tannous M', 'Manavathu EK', 'Myers TG', 'De Clercq E', 'Balzarini J']","['College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, Department of Chemistry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chalcone/*analogs & derivatives', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mannich Bases/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/04/17 00:00,1998/04/17 00:01,['1998/04/17 00:00'],"['1998/04/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm970432t [doi]', 'jm970432t [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1998 Mar 26;41(7):1014-26. doi: 10.1021/jm970432t.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mannich Bases)', '5S5A2Q39HX (Chalcone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the issues involved in this complication of ALL treatment, two recent cases are presented. PATIENTS: Two 15-year-old girls with ""high risk"" ALL became pregnant while receiving maintenance therapy. RESULTS: In one case, the patient experienced a spontaneous abortion at approximately 5 to 6 weeks gestation. The patient completed maintenance therapy and is in remission 8 months after the end of treatment. The second patient, known to be non-compliant during therapy, was found to be 5 months pregnant at the end of maintenance therapy. She developed HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count), was induced at approximately 34 weeks, and delivered an apparently normal baby girl. Both the patient and her baby continue to do well 10 months after delivery. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of factors may influence the incidence of pregnancy during ALL therapy. Gonadal function, which is likely to return to normal during maintenance therapy, may also be affected by alterations in the dose intensity of treatment. Social factors may also alter the incidence of pregnancy. Adverse effects on the fetus are more likely to occur in the first trimester, depending on the drug or drugs used. Although all chemotherapies may have mutagenic and teratogenic effects, they do not invariably cause abnormalities. Survival of adolescents who become pregnant during treatment does not appear to be adversely affected when therapy is not modified or discontinued.","['Bergstrom, S K', 'Altman, A J']","['Bergstrom SK', 'Altman AJ']","[""Connecticut Children's Medical Center, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics 06106, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic']",1998/04/17 00:00,1998/04/17 00:01,['1998/04/17 00:00'],"['1998/04/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199803000-00014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Mar-Apr;20(2):154-9. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199803000-00014.,,,,,31,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five pediatric patients with CML were monitored post-allogeneic transplant (two of them also had received donor lymphocyte infusions) using the combined approach of RT-PCR and metaphase FISH. Both the transplants and the follow-up were carried out in a single institution setting. RESULTS: During the posttransplant evaluation, a transiently positive signal for the Philadelphia chromosome but no transcription of the bcr/abl-fusion message was detected in one patient currently in remission. A posttransplant relapse was detected in two patients who demonstrated the Philadelphia chromosome and the bcr/abl-fusion transcript; one was successfully treated with donor lymphocyte infusions. The two patients consistently negative for both the Philadelphia chromosome and the bcr/abl-fusion transcript and currently in remission. CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients with CML may transiently demonstrate cells positive for the Philadelphia chromosome but not actively transcribing the bcr/abl-fusion message in their marrow during their posttransplant evaluation but remain in remission. Recurrence is highly likely in patients demonstrating positivity for both; these patients may be considered candidates for donor lymphocyte transfusion therapy.","['Vettenranta, K', 'Huhta, T', 'Lindlof, M', 'Knuutila, S', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, U M']","['Vettenranta K', 'Huhta T', 'Lindlof M', 'Knuutila S', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/*therapy', 'Metaphase/physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/04/17 00:00,1998/04/17 00:01,['1998/04/17 00:00'],"['1998/04/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199803000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Mar-Apr;20(2):108-11. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199803000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As higher serum levels of LIF have been reported in septicemia, we measured LIF values in biological fluids by RIA. Immunoreactive LIF was detected in 303 of 428 human serum samples. Circulating LIF detection rates were 69% in acute inflammatory diseases, 83% in chronic inflammatory diseases, 61% in noninflammatory diseases, and 90% in cancer patients. Serum concentrations of human LIF was higher in patients with inflammatory disease than in noninflammatory disease (0.80 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.02 ng/mL; P < 0.05) or in cancer patients (0.44 +/- 0.06; P < 0.05). Higher serum human LIF levels were found in septicemia (0.78 +/- 0.14 ng/mL), pneumonia (0.80 +/- 0.10 ng/mL), acute bronchitis (0.88 +/- 0.09 ng/mL), other infections (1.01 +/- 0.17 ng/mL), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 0.79 +/- 0.06 ng/mL). In 7 septicemia patients, Gram-negative infection was associated with higher LIF levels (1.06 +/- 0.16 ng/mL) than was Gram-positive infection (0.58 +/- 0.14 ng/mL). In patients with acute inflammatory disease, serum LIF levels decreased within several days after hospitalization. To test circulating mouse (m) LIF changes in response to inflammatory stress, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected ip to mice. LPS increased serum mLIF values concordantly with ACTH levels. After i.p. injection of 80 microg LPS, serum mLIF increased by 144% (P < 0.05), 173% (P < 0.05), and 134% at 30, 90, and 120 min respectively. In vitro, however, LPS did not increase ACTH and mLIF secretion from dispersed mouse primary pituitary cells. These results suggest that LIF is an important participant in the pathogenesis of the acute inflammatory response. The elevated serum LIF levels observed in inflammation do not appear to originate from the pituitary.","['Ren, S G', 'Seliktar, J', 'Li, X', 'Braunstein, G D', 'Melmed, S']","['Ren SG', 'Seliktar J', 'Li X', 'Braunstein GD', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, University of California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Growth Inhibitors/*analysis/blood', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*analysis/blood', 'Mice', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.83.4.4702 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1998 Apr;83(4):1275-83. doi: 10.1210/jcem.83.4.4702.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,['DK-42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical, laboratory, and hematologic data of four patients with myeloid leukemia who developed SS after chemotherapy. Three of these patients were neutropenic. METHODS: A retrospective study of four patients with SS and hematologic malignancies was undertaken. Three patients had de novo acute myelogenous leukemia and one was in the acute blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. RESULTS: Sweet's syndrome was not originally suspected in these patients because of the low peripheral white blood cell counts caused by chemotherapy. All of the patients presented with fevers, arthralgias, and an eruption. They had been treated with antibiotics because of a presumed infection. Once the correct diagnosis was made and oral prednisolone was started, a rapid response followed. CONCLUSIONS: Sweet's syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis when acute myeloid leukemic patients develop skin lesions and unexplained fevers regardless of the peripheral blood counts.","['Probert, C', 'Ehmann, W C', 'al-Mondhiry, H', 'Ballard, J', 'Helm, K F']","['Probert C', 'Ehmann WC', 'al-Mondhiry H', 'Ballard J', 'Helm KF']","['Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Eruptions/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications/pathology', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/pathology', 'Sweet Syndrome/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-4362.1998.00270.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 1998 Feb;37(2):108-12. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-4362.1998.00270.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to investigate the role of the saturation index in primary carcinoma of the gallbladder. METHODS: This paper describes the results of the stearic to oleic acid ratio determination in 26 subjects with either cholelithiasis or carcinoma of the gallbladder, also including a group of age- and sex-matched controls, using gas chromatography. This is the first report of the saturation index in carcinoma of the gallbladder. RESULTS: A significantly lower saturation index was observed in patients with carcinoma of the gallbladder than with cholelithiasis (t = 2.19, P = 0.043, T = 47, P < 0.05, Wilcoxon P < 0.001, F = 2192.23, P < 0.001; 95% CI 18.45-30.44) and controls (t = 2.5, P = 0.024, T = 36, P < 0.05, F = 10904.11, P < 0.001, Wilcoxon P < 0.001; 95% CI 52.42-63.39). Among the carcinoma patients a further lowering was noted in stage IV disease compared with stage III (T = 6, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These changes are probably due to a marked increase in oleic acid content at the expense of stearic acid.

Patients usually present with chronic cytopenias which gradually worsen due to progressive bone marrow failure or transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. Disease prevention is more cost-effective than therapeutic intervention and the establishment of the etiology and pathogenesis of MDS therefore assumes considerable importance. This review will outline current concepts of the pathobiology of MDS, putative etiological insults and the mechanisms of disease initiation as well as recent contributions to the descriptive epidemiology of these disorders. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The authors of the present review have a long-standing interest in the pathogenesis, etiology and epidemiology of MDS. Journal articles covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline have been reviewed and personal experience and discussion with international experts collated. STATE OF THE ART AND PERSPECTIVES: The initiation processes for the development of MDS remain unknown. A poorly defined transforming event affects a pluripotent or multipotent progenitor cell in the bone marrow, conferring a growth advantage upon it and eventually establishing clonal hematopoiesis. An important pathogenetic mechanism in MDS is premature intramedullary cell death via excessive apoptosis, explaining the apparent paradox of a cellular marrow in combination with peripheral cytopenias (ineffective hematopoiesis). Therapy-related MDS/AML following exposure to alkylating agents is the only clear etiological factor thus identified. Increasing evidence for exposure to benzene and radiation and the development of MDS is emerging. Benzene hematotoxicity is mediated via both genotoxic and non-genotoxic mechanisms, leading to aplasia, apoptosis and initiation (via genetic mutation) of clonal disorders such as MDS. Further studies of benzene hematotoxicity and therapy-related MDS should provide models for the elucidation of initiation events in MDS pathogenesis. The importance of such studies is emphasized by the rising frequency of MDS which largely reflects improved diagnostic criteria, increased physician awareness and extended use of diagnostic procedures in the elderly. Demographic changes will lead to a marked increase in MDS over the next few decades.","['Aul, C', 'Bowen, D T', 'Yoshida, Y']","['Aul C', 'Bowen DT', 'Yoshida Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology/*etiology']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Jan;83(1):71-86.,,,,,109,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few patients receiving an allograft in the early stage of their disease have been described so far. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with early stage hematologic malignancies were transplanted with cryopreserved allogeneic PBSC from HLA-identical siblings. PBSC were collected after priming with 10 micrograms/kg/day of glycosylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, lenograstim). Outcomes were compared to a historical control group of 15 patients who received conventional bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from HLA-identical sibling donors. The two groups were matched for diagnosis, stage of disease, age, preparative regimen, graft-versus host (GVHD) prophylaxis, patients' and donors' gender and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology. Diagnoses in both groups were: chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in first chronic phase (= 5), acute leukemia in first complete remission (CR) (= 5), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in CR (= 1) and multiple myeloma (MM) with sensitive disease (= 4). All patients were given cyclosporin-A (CsA) and methotrexate (MTX) for GVHD prophylaxis. Preparative regimens varied according to diagnosis and included either busulfan/cyclophosphamide combination (BU/Cy) or total body irradiation/cyclophosphamide +/- melphalan (TBI/Cy +/- Mel). RESULTS: The patients in the PBSC group showed a more rapid hematopoietic reconstitution with a significant difference in the median times to 1 x 10(9) neutrophils/L (19 days vs. 26 days; p = 0.03) and to platelet transfusion independence (18 days versus 22 days; p = 0.02). This finding was associated with a significantly shorter hospitalization (28 days versus 33 days after transplantation; p = 0.01). In the PBSC series, grade II-IV acute GVHD occurred in 3 patients (20%) and grade III-IV in 1 patient (7%). In the BMT control group, grade II-IV aGVHD was reported in 2 cases (13%; p = NS) and 1 case had grade III-IV GVHD. Chronic GVHD developed in 7 patients (47%) (limited = 6; extensive = 1) undergoing PBSC transplantation and 5 patients (33%) (limited = 4; extensive = 1) in the BMT series (p = NS). No difference was found in the incidence of grade II-IV (according to the World Health Organization) mucositis, whereas PBSC recipients did have a significantly lower incidence of additional severe (grade III-IV) organ toxicity. After a median follow-up of 300 days (range 180-630), all PBSC patients are still alive with a median Karnofsky score of 100% (range 80%-100%). Thirteen patients are in CR and 2 myeloma patient are in good partial remission (PR). Also, in the BMT group the peritransplant mortality was absent; two MM patients died due to progressive disease at day +796 and +1,023, respectively; one leukemic patient died of chronic GVHD 407 days after transplantation and one additional leukemic individual relapsed 1,140 days after BMT. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective comparison suggests that allogeneic PBSC transplantation performed in the early stage of the disease is safe and may be associated with a more rapid hematopoietic reconstitution than BMT, as well as lower transplant-related toxicity and earlier hospital discharge with apparently no increased risk of acute and chronic GVHD.","['Lemoli, R M', 'Bandini, G', 'Leopardi, G', 'Rosti, G', 'Bonini, A', 'Fortuna, A', 'Rondelli, D', 'Mangianti, S', 'Motta, M R', 'Rizzi, S', 'Tassi, C', 'Cavo, M', 'Remiddi, C', 'Curti, A', 'Conte, R', 'Tura, S']","['Lemoli RM', 'Bandini G', 'Leopardi G', 'Rosti G', 'Bonini A', 'Fortuna A', 'Rondelli D', 'Mangianti S', 'Motta MR', 'Rizzi S', 'Tassi C', 'Cavo M', 'Remiddi C', 'Curti A', 'Conte R', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology L. & A.

We report the results of a tailored treatment approach in all consecutive AML patients older than 60 years diagnosed at our institution during the last 2 years. DESIGN AND METHODS: Between December 1994 and December 1996, 43 AML patients over 60 years of age (median, 72; range 61-89) were managed according to their performance status (PS) and associated diseases. Twenty patients (46%) were eligible for intensive chemotherapy and received combination chemotherapy including an anthracycline (Idarubicin or daunorubicin), ara-C and VP-16. After complete remission (CR), consolidation chemotherapy with mitoxantrone and intermediate-high-dose ara-C was given to 13 of the 15 patients in remission (65% of all patients candidates for intensive treatment). Twenty-three patients who were not eligible for intensive chemotherapy received palliative measures. RESULTS: Patients treated with one course of intensive chemotherapy had a CR rate of 70% (95% CI: 48-92%)(n = 14) with a mortality rate of 20% (n = 4) and a resistance of 10% (n = 2). An additional patient reached CR after rescue therapy. Median CR duration was 10.5 months. Median survival was 10.5 months. Patients above 70 years had a median survival of 5 months compared to the median not reached for those aged between 60 and 70 years (p = 0.03). This latter group had a probability of survival of 52 +/- 18% at 18 months. None of the patients treated with palliative measures achieved CR and the median survival in this group was only 1.5 months. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AML aged 70 years or less with good PS and without severe associated diseases should be intensively treated due to the high probability of achieving CR and an acceptable median-term survival. By contrast, results in patients 70 years or older and in those suitable only for palliative treatment because of a poor PS or severe associated diseases are very poor. Alternative treatment approaches for these patients should be investigated.","['Hernandez-Boluda, J C', 'Sierra, J', 'Esteve, J', 'Nomdedeu, B', 'Montserrat, E']","['Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Sierra J', 'Esteve J', 'Nomdedeu B', 'Montserrat E']","['Department of Hematology, Postgraduate School of Hematology Farreras Valenti, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care', 'Remission Induction']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Jan;83(1):34-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This multicentric study was performed in order to: i) analyze the sensitivity of interphase FISH with respect to conventional chromosome analysis (CCA) in detecting +8; ii) compare the results of FISH and CCA in the quantitation of the frequency of +8-positive cells; iii) analyze the possible role of FISH in the cytogenetic follow-up of patients with +8. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety-eight nonconsecutive patients with a diagnosis of AML seen at five centers over a 3-year period were studied by CCA and FISH with a chromosome 8-specific centromeric probe. Two hundred interphase cells were scored in each test and the cut-off for the recognition of +8 was set at 3%. An irrelevant pericentromeric probe was used as negative control in those cases with an apparently normal karyotype and trisomy 8 in interphase cells. FISH studies were conducted at diagnosis and, in 14 cases with +8, on 1.5 occasions during follow-up. RESULTS: Karyotype aberrations were seen in 121 cases (61.1%), with +8 being present in 38 of them (16 as the sole aberration). Interphase FISH detected +8 in 37/38 cases; in a patient with 1/10 metaphases with +8, 2.3% interphase cells with 3 signals were seen. Fourteen additional cases with occult +8 were detected by FISH, which showed 4-22% interphase cells with three signals; 6 patients had an abnormal karyotype without +8, 3 had a normal karyotype, 5 had no analyzable mitoses. In 24 cases with > 15 analyzable metaphases, percent variations between CCA and FISH in the estimation of the size of the trisomic clone ranged between 0.4% and 51%, median value 22%. Underestimation of the percent of trisomy 8 by FISH occurred in all 10 cases with > 90% +8 metaphases. In 7/14 cases investigated sequentially, FISH detected 5-35% trisomic cells in the BM after induction therapy (4 CR, 3 PR); 4 cases relapsed with +8 at 8-15 months. The absence of +8 in remission marrows was documented in the remaining 7 cases, 4 of which relapsed at 20-32 months. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that FISH was a valuable method in this multicentric study since it showed greater sensitivity than CCA in detecting minor clones with +8, in patients with both normal and abnormal karyotypes. The role of FISH in the cytogenetic follow-up of trisomies in AML patients may be promising.","['Cuneo, A', 'Bigoni, R', 'Roberti, M G', 'Bardi, A', 'Rigolin, G M', 'Piva, N', 'Mancini, M', 'Nanni, M', 'Alimena, G', 'Mecucci, C', 'Matteucci, C', 'La Starza, R', 'Bernasconi, P', 'Cavigliano, P', 'Genini, E', 'Zaccaria, A', 'Testoni, N', 'Carboni, C', 'Castoldi, G']","['Cuneo A', 'Bigoni R', 'Roberti MG', 'Bardi A', 'Rigolin GM', 'Piva N', 'Mancini M', 'Nanni M', 'Alimena G', 'Mecucci C', 'Matteucci C', 'La Starza R', 'Bernasconi P', 'Cavigliano P', 'Genini E', 'Zaccaria A', 'Testoni N', 'Carboni C', 'Castoldi G']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Trisomy/*diagnosis']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Jan;83(1):21-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On an individual basis taking the age factor into consideration, the hprt-Mfs of 3 patients with solid tumors, i.e., two patients with Hodgkin's disease and one patient with Askin tumor, were found to be well above the 95% confidence limit. There were no patients with a TCR-Mf exceeding the 95% confidence limit.

It induces cytogenetic damage as well as cytostatic effects on a variety of cell systems. Folinic acid (Leucovorin) is generally administered along with MTX as a rescue agent to decrease MTX-induced toxicity. However, information regarding the inhibitory effect of folinic acid against cytogenetic damage caused by MTX is limited. This study was conducted to assess the cytogenetic effect of MTX and its inhibition by folinic acid (FA) using the micronucleus and chromosomal aberration assays concurrently. Exponentially growing V79 cells were treated with MTX at five different concentrations (5-100 micrograms ml-1) with S9 microsomal fraction for 6 h and post-treated with two concentrations of FA (5 or 50 micrograms) for 40 h. Results indicate that MTX alone induced a concentration-related increase in % micronucleated binucleated cells (MNBN) and % aberrant cells (Abs). There was a decrease in nuclear division index (NDI) with increase in MTX concentration. Similarly, the mitotic index (MI) also decreased in all concentrations of MTX tested. The addition of FA at 50 micrograms ml-1 significantly reduced % MNBN (40-68%) and % Abs (36-77%). Inhibition was also seen at 5 micrograms FA (12 to 54% for MNBN and 20 to 61% for Abs).

We examined effects of MTX on cell proliferation during tooth morphogenesis in organ culture by exposing hamster molar tooth germs to 10(-7) to 10(-3) M MTX for 24 h. In the presence of serum, only the highest concentration of MTX (10(-3) M) induced a small, nonsignificant decrease in cell mass without histological changes but, unexpectedly, increased uptake of [3H]thymidine. In serumless conditions increase in cell mass (dry weight) and incorporation of [3H]thymidine was lower than in serum-supplemented conditions. Exposure to MTX in serumless conditions reduced the increase in cell mass even further without histological changes and, again, strongly enhanced incorporation of [3H]thymidine to the same proportion as measured in the serum-supplemented cultures exposed to MTX. The data suggest that only exposure to high levels of MTX reduces proliferation activity, shown by reduction in cell mass. The enhanced [3H]thymidine uptake under MTX exposure was explained by blockage of the internal biosynthesis of thymidine, by which action more radiolabel was taken up from the medium. The data also suggest that serum contains (growth) factors that stimulate cell proliferation, thereby increasing cell mass and [3H]thymidine incorporation.","['Woltgens, J H', 'Lyaruu, D M', 'Bronckers, A L', 'van Duin, M A', 'Bervoets, T J']","['Woltgens JH', 'Lyaruu DM', 'Bronckers AL', 'van Duin MA', 'Bervoets TJ']","['Department of Oral Cell Biology, ACTA Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. jhm.woltgens.ocb.acta@med.vu.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Oral Sci,European journal of oral sciences,9504563,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cricetinae', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Molar/cytology/drug effects/growth & development', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tooth Germ/cytology/*drug effects/*growth & development']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0722.1998.tb02169.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Oral Sci. 1998 Jan;106 Suppl 1:156-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0722.1998.tb02169.x.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In megakaryocytic cell lines, polyploidization can be obtained by using colchicine, an inhibitor of the tubulin spindle. The nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs) are parts of nucleolar DNA transcribed into ribosomal RNA and are detected by the silver-staining technique. Their number is proportional to protein synthesis. RESULTS: To estimate protein synthesis in polyploid megakaryocytes, AgNORs are measured in three cell lines with megakaryocyte properties (DAMI, HEL and K562) after a 4-day culture in the presence or absence of colchicine. The mean number of AgNORs per cell was 16+/-4 (mean+/-SEM), 24+/-3 and 14+/-3 for DAMI, HEL and K-562 cell lines respectively. The addition of colchicine (10 ng mL[-1]) significantly increased the number of AgNORs per cell (DAMI 556%, HEL 338% and K-562 300% of controls, P < 0.05 using the t-test). Moreover, the number of nucleoles per cell after the addition of colchicine was augmented significantly (DAMI 246%; HEL 237% and K-562 148% of controls, P < 0.05 using the t-test). The total protein content estimated by Bradford's method increased significantly to 226%, 215% and 304% of controls in DAMI, HEL and K562 respectively (P < 005 using the t-test). After treatment with colchicine, the endomitotic index (EI) [mean of (log2 DNA content expressed in N)-1] measured by flow cytometry (and reflecting ploidy) increased to 234%, 255% and 301%, respectively, in DAMI, HEL and K-562 cell lines (P < 0.05 using the t-test). Concomitantly, the number of AgNORs per unit of DNA increased in the DAMI and HEL cell lines (P < 0.05 using the t-test) from 48+/-8 and 39+/-5, respectively, to 79+/-11 and 61+/-10. In contrast, the number of nucleoles and the total protein content per endomitotic index were not affected by colchicine (P > 0.05 using the t-test), but the number of nucleoles per endomitotic index of DAMI cells was affected. CONCLUSION: The increase in the number of the NORs induced by an agent known to stimulate polyploidization of megakaryocytic cell lines suggests that polyploidization occurs by a proportional increase in protein synthesis per DNA unit.","['Baatout, S', 'Chatelain, B', 'Staquet, P', 'Symann, M', 'Chatelain, C']","['Baatout S', 'Chatelain B', 'Staquet P', 'Symann M', 'Chatelain C']","['UCL, Brussels, Belgium. sbaatout@sckcen.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,IM,"['Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleolus/drug effects', 'Colchicine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Microtubules/*drug effects/genetics', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/*drug effects/genetics', '*Polyploidy', 'Proteins/drug effects', 'Silver Staining', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2362.1998.00250.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 1998 Feb;28(2):138-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2362.1998.00250.x.,"['0 (Proteins)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified four mutations of p53 gene in BLV-infected cattle with lymphosarcoma and demonstrated clearly the existence of two functionally distinct groups of mutants: (i) the mutant forms with substitutions at codons 241 and 242, which were mapped within an evolutionally conserved region and corresponded to the human ""hot-spot"" mutations, had completely lost the capacities for transactivation and growth suppression and gained transdominant repression activity in p53-null SAOS-2 cells; and (ii) the mutations at codons 206 and 207 were located outside the evolutionally conserved regions. These mutants partially retained the capacity for transactivation and growth suppression and failed to inhibit the transactivation activity of coexpressed wild-type p53, instead showing an enhancement of this activity. In addition, protein analysis using an antibody specific for the mutant form revealed that the mutations at codons 206 and 242 induced a ""mutant"" conformation of the bovine p53 proteins. Collectively, these results show that mutations of p53 gene in BLV-infected cattle with lymphosarcoma can potentially alter its physiological function and may play an important role in BLV-induced leukemogenesis.","['Tajima, S', 'Zhuang, W Z', 'Kato, M V', 'Okada, K', 'Ikawa, Y', 'Aida, Y']","['Tajima S', 'Zhuang WZ', 'Kato MV', 'Okada K', 'Ikawa Y', 'Aida Y']","['Tsukuba Life Science Center, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/*virology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Virology. 1998 Mar 30;243(1):735-46.,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a sensitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, we identified several abnormally spliced transcripts in which MLL exons were joined in an order different from the genomic orientation (scrambled exons). Mis-splicing of MLL was present in both normal and malignant tissues. Although the majority of these scrambled transcripts were joined accurately at consensus splice sites, there were several examples in which the junctions of exons spliced in aberrant order were at non-consensus sites. A number of features differentiate mis-splicing of MLL from the previously described cases of scrambled exons and circular RNAs. Some scrambled transcripts appear to be present in the polyadenylated fraction of RNA. No correlation of exon scrambling with exon skipping was found, and there was no particular tendency for the exons involved to be near large introns. Our data show that splicing of MLL is extremely complex. The presence of scrambled transcripts in both normal and leukemic cells, indistinguishable from transcripts resulting from genomic MLL rearrangements, precludes the use of nested RT-PCR as a screening method for detection of tandem duplication of tandem duplication of MLL.","['Caldas, C', 'So, C W', 'MacGregor, A', 'Ford, A M', 'McDonald, B', 'Chan, L C', 'Wiedemann, L M']","['Caldas C', 'So CW', 'MacGregor A', 'Ford AM', 'McDonald B', 'Chan LC', 'Wiedemann LM']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre at the Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Exons', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Multigene Family', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111997006409 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(97)00640-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1998 Feb 27;208(2):167-76. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(97)00640-9.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transformation is related to aberrant activation of growth-regulatory genes by insertion of intracisternal A-particle (IAP) genomes. To elucidate the transformation process further, a subtracted cDNA library was constructed from a factor-independent leukemic FDC-P1 variant and the parental FDC-P1 cells. Screening for clones that were preferentially recognized by a total cDNA probe from the transformed cell line (in comparison to a similar probe from untransformed FDC-P1 cells) led to the isolation of 14 clones, of which six contained cDNA inserts encoding so-called B2 repeats, a class of short interspersed nucleotide elements. The expression of B2 repeats was significantly increased not only in the cell line from which the subtracted library was constructed, but also in all other leukemic FDC-P1 variants analyzed. B2 repeats can act as insertional mutagens and may have a role in the stabilization of certain oncogene and cytokine mRNAs. Interestingly, B2 repeats contain a 14-nucleotide region that is almost completely complementary to an AU-rich sequence in a region of the IAP mRNA encoding the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Although preliminary experiments to demonstrate stabilization of IAP mRNA by hybridization to B2 repeat sequences remained inconclusive, it is intriguing to speculate that B2 repeat sequences may have a causative role in the transformation process.","['Blumenstein, M', 'Hossfeld, D K', 'Duhrsen, U']","['Blumenstein M', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Duhrsen U']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Universitatskrankenhaus Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Probes', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle/*genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050363 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1998 Feb;76(2):53-60. doi: 10.1007/s002770050363.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When ondansetron was employed, it was administered in an i.v. infusion at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg before and after chemotherapy or as an oral dose of 4 mg or 8 mg before chemotherapy. Courses of IC without antiemetics were analyzed to determine the emetogenic potential of IC. For patients receiving IC both with and without ondansetron, courses were compared with each patient used as their own control to determine the influence of ondansetron upon survey responses. Statistical analysis consisted of nonparametric Friedman 2-way ANOVA for ordinal variables and a paired t-test for continuous variables. The binomial test was employed to analyze for differences between ondansetron and no antiemetic in the number of patients with complete control of both nausea and vomiting or vomiting alone. A total of 63 children with a mean age of 7.6 +/- 4.2 years were each studied on one or more occasions. Thirty-seven children were surveyed for 87 IC treatments without antiemetics (group I), and 17 children from this group were surveyed for 48 IC courses with i.v. ondansetron (group IA). An additional 18 children were subsequently surveyed for 39 IC courses with i.v. ondansetron (group II). Fifteen patients (7 of whom were members of group I) were surveyed following 33 IC courses with oral ondansetron (group III). The survey scores for group I patients were: nausea severity 1.3 +/- 1.1, vomiting severity 1.2 +/- 1.1, DAI 1.2 +/- 1.0 and mean number of emetic episodes 4.7 +/- 8.4. The mean appetite score was 1.5 +/- 1.1. For patients in group IA, nausea severity (0.8 +/- 0.9), vomiting severity (0.5 +/- 0.8), DAI (0.7 +/- 0.8), and the number of emetic episodes (1.4 +/- 2.8) were all significantly lower than with prior IC treatments without ondansetron. For complete protection, children receiving i.v. ondansetron had greater complete protection rates from both nausea and vomiting or vomiting alone than did patients receiving no antiemetic. Survey responses were also lower for patients receiving oral ondansetron, but insufficient control data did not allow for statistical analysis. IC results in mild to moderate nausea and vomiting in children. The emetogenic potential of IC is significantly reduced by i.v. ondansetron.","['Holdsworth, M T', 'Raisch, D W', 'Winter, S S', 'Chavez, C M']","['Holdsworth MT', 'Raisch DW', 'Winter SS', 'Chavez CM']","['College of Pharmacy, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque 87131-1066, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Antiemetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Nausea/*chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Ondansetron/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s005200050147 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 1998 Mar;6(2):132-8. doi: 10.1007/s005200050147.,"['0 (Antiemetics)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '4AF302ESOS (Ondansetron)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All patients who received IVIg infusions in four major hospitals in Auckland in 1996 were identified from blood bank records. Clinical details were recorded from case notes. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-five cases were identified and 131 records were available for review. Hypogammaglobulinaemia (n = 38) and thrombocytopenia (n = 38) were the two most common indications for 44% of Primary hypogammaglobulinaemia accounted for IVIg. the IVIg prescribed. IVIg was only used in one patient with hypogammaglobulinaemia secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and in one case of graft-versus-host disease. Adverse reactions were noted in 13 cases (10%). Headache (n = 4) and fever (n = 4) were the most commonly recorded side-effects. One patient developed acute renal failure after IVIg infusion. Written consent was documented in 7 patients (5%). CONCLUSIONS: The indications for IVIg prescription were generally consistent with the recommendations of the Australasian Society of Blood Transfusion. Use of IVIg in haematological conditions other than immune thrombocytopaenic purpura was infrequent. Most of the IVIg infusions were administered uneventfully but some minor side effects were recorded and one significant clinical event may have been causally related to IVIg infusion.","['Lee, Y C', 'Woodfield, D G', 'Douglas, R']","['Lee YC', 'Woodfield DG', 'Douglas R']","['Green Lane Hospital, Auckland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,N Z Med J,The New Zealand medical journal,0401067,IM,"['Agammaglobulinemia/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Blood Banks/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Thrombocytopenia/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Utilization Review']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,N Z Med J. 1998 Feb 27;111(1060):48-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This suppression of apoptosis by A23187 or TG was associated with suppression of caspase activation but not with suppression of wild-type-p53-induced expression of WAF-1, mdm-2, or FAS. In contrast to suppression of apoptosis by the cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interferon gamma, a protease inhibitor, or an antioxidant, suppression of apoptosis by A23187 or TG required extracellular Ca2+ and was specifically abolished by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A. IL-6 induced immediate early activation of junB and zif/268 (Egr-1) but A23187 and TG did not. A23187 and TG also suppressed induction of apoptosis by doxorubicin or vincristine in M1 cells that did not express p53 by a cyclosporin A-sensitive mechanism. Suppression of apoptosis by A23187 or TG was not associated with autocrine production of IL-6. Apoptosis induced in IL-6-primed M1 cells after IL-6 withdrawal was not suppressed by A23187 or TG but was suppressed by the cytokines IL-6, IL-3, or interferon gamma. The results indicate that these Ca2+-mobilizing compounds can suppress some pathways of apoptosis suppressed by cytokines but do so by a different mechanism.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, p53', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis', 'Vincristine/toxicity', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.8.4601 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Apr 14;95(8):4601-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.8.4601.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,PMC22536,,,,,,,,

The twin leukemic DNA shared the same unique (or clonotypic) but nonconstitutive TEL-AML1 fusion sequence. The most plausible explanation for this finding is a single cell origin of the TEL-AML fusion in one fetus in utero, probably as a leukemia-initiating mutation, followed by intraplacental metastasis of clonal progeny to the other twin. Clonal identity is further supported by the finding that the leukemic cells in the two twins shared an identical rearranged IGH allele.

Using the differential display method, we isolated a gene that is down-regulated in All1 double-knockout mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The gene, designated ARP1 (also termed RIEG, Ptx2, or Otlx2), is a member of a family of homeotic genes containing a short motif shared with several homeobox genes. Using a bacterially synthesized All1 polypeptide encompassing the AT-hook motifs, we identified a 0.5-kb ARP1 DNA fragment that preferentially bound to the polypeptide. Within this DNA, a region of approximately 100 bp was protected by the polypeptide from digestion with ExoIII and DNase I. Whole-mount in situ hybridization to early mouse embryos of 9.5-10.5 days indicated a complex pattern of Arp1 expression spatially overlapping with the expression of All1. Although the ARP1 gene is expressed strongly in bone marrow cells, no transcripts were detected in six leukemia cell lines with 11q23 translocations. These results suggest that ARP1 is up-regulated by the All1 protein, possibly through direct interaction with an upstream DNA sequence of the former. The results are also consistent with the suggestion that ALL1 chimeric proteins resulting from 11q23 abnormalities act in a dominant negative fashion.","['Arakawa, H', 'Nakamura, T', 'Zhadanov, A B', 'Fidanza, V', 'Yano, T', 'Bullrich, F', 'Shimizu, M', 'Blechman, J', 'Mazo, A', 'Canaani, E', 'Croce, C M']","['Arakawa H', 'Nakamura T', 'Zhadanov AB', 'Fidanza V', 'Yano T', 'Bullrich F', 'Shimizu M', 'Blechman J', 'Mazo A', 'Canaani E', 'Croce CM']","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.8.4573 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Apr 14;95(8):4573-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.8.4573.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein PITX1)', '0 (homeobox protein PITX3)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '184787-43-7 (homeobox protein PITX2)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)']",,,,,"['GENBANK/AF048720', 'GENBANK/AF048721', 'GENBANK/AF048722', 'GENBANK/AF048723', 'GENBANK/AF048724']","['P01 CA050507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 50507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC22531,,,,,,,,

Its Drosophila homolog trithorax (trx) is a member of the trx-Polycomb gene family, which maintains correct spatial expression of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes during embryogenesis. The C-terminal SET domain of ALL-1 and TRITHORAX (TRX) is a 150-aa motif, highly conserved during evolution. We performed yeast two hybrid screening of Drosophila cDNA library and detected interaction between a TRX polypeptide spanning SET and the SNR1 protein. SNR1 is a product of snr1, which is classified as a trx group gene. We found parallel interaction in yeast between the SET domain of ALL-1 and the human homolog of SNR1, INI1 (hSNF5). These results were confirmed by in vitro binding studies and by demonstrating coimmunoprecipitation of the proteins from cultured cells and/or transgenic flies. Epitope-tagged SNR1 was detected at discrete sites on larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes, and these sites colocalized with around one-half of TRX binding sites. Because SNR1 and INI1 are constituents of the SWI/SNF complex, which acts to remodel chromatin and consequently to activate transcription, the interactions we observed suggest a mechanism by which the SWI/SNF complex is recruited to ALL-1/trx targets through physical interactions between the C-terminal domains of ALL-1 and TRX and INI1/SNR1.","['Rozenblatt-Rosen, O', 'Rozovskaia, T', 'Burakov, D', 'Sedkov, Y', 'Tillib, S', 'Blechman, J', 'Nakamura, T', 'Croce, C M', 'Mazo, A', 'Canaani, E']","['Rozenblatt-Rosen O', 'Rozovskaia T', 'Burakov D', 'Sedkov Y', 'Tillib S', 'Blechman J', 'Nakamura T', 'Croce CM', 'Mazo A', 'Canaani E']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Biological Evolution', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'SMARCB1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.8.4152 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Apr 14;95(8):4152-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.8.4152.,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SMARCB1 Protein)', '0 (SMARCB1 protein, human)', '0 (Snr1 protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Trl protein, Drosophila)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,PMC22457,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We studied the clonogenic survival and DNA repair of irradiated (0.36, 0.73, and 1.46 Gy) CD34+ cord blood (CB) cells after short-term incubation (24 h) with GFs. CD34+ cells were stimulated with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), stem cell factor/c-kit ligand (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) alone or in combination in short-term serum-free liquid suspension cultures (LSC) immediately after irradiation and then assayed for clonogenic progenitors. DNA repair was evaluated by analysis of DNA strand breaks using the comet assay. Survival of CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-Mix was determined and dose-response curves were fitted to the data. RESULTS: The radiobiological parameters (D[0] and n) showed significant GF(s) effects. Combination of IL-3 with IL-6, SCF or GM-CSF resulted in best survival for CFU-GM BFU-E and CFU-Mix, respectively. Combinations of three or more GFs did not increase the survival of clonogenic CD34+ cells compared to optimal two-factor combinations. The D[0] values for CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-Mix ranged between 0.56-1.15, 0.41-2.24, and 0.56-1.29 Gy, respectively. As for controls, the curves remained strictly exponential, i.e., all survival curves were strictly exponential without any shoulder (extrapolation numbers n=1 for all tested GF(s). DNA repair capacity of CD34+ cells determined by comet assay, was measured before, immediately after irradiation, as well as 30 and 120 min after irradiation at 1 Gy. Notably, after irradiation the 2-h repair of cytokine-stimulated and unstimulated CD34+ cells was similar. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that increased survival of irradiated CB CD34+ cells after short-term GF treatment is mediated through proliferative GF effects on the surviving fraction but not through improved DNA repair capacity.","['Ziegler, B L', 'Sandor, P S', 'Plappert, U', 'Thoma, S', 'Muller, R', 'Bock, T', 'Thomas, C A', 'Nothdurft, W', 'Fliedner, T M']","['Ziegler BL', 'Sandor PS', 'Plappert U', 'Thoma S', 'Muller R', 'Bock T', 'Thomas CA', 'Nothdurft W', 'Fliedner TM']","['Department of Medicine, Eberhard-Karls-University Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(97)00945-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(97)00945-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Mar 15;40(5):1193-203. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(97)00945-0.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition using an IGF-II antibody showed that tumor cell-derived IGF-II accounts for a significant 25% (P < 0.001) increase in IGFBP-2 secretion and enhanced growth (P < 0.01) of leukemic T-cells after 7 days in culture. IGFBP-2 secretion, but not IGFBP-2 mRNA was specifically increased by IGFs, while no specific effect of insulin was detectable. The addition of 100 ng/ml IGF-II enhanced the IGFBP-2 secretion 2.8-fold, while the use of IGF-I only enhanced IGFBP-2 secretion 1.7-fold, although IGF-I enhanced IGF-II action. Through inhibition using JB1, a peptide inhibiting the IGF signal transduction by blocking the IGF-I-R, we demonstrated the involvement of the IGF-I-R in IGFBP-2 and -4 expression and leukemic cell growth. However, only slight differences in the IGF-I-R mRNA expression were seen for T- and B-cells compared with the differences found for the IGFBP-2 and -4 mRNA or IGFBP-2 secretion. Thus, although IGF-I-R mediates the autocrine/paracrine effects of the IGFs, IGF-I-R mRNA expression is most probably not involved in the differential IGFBP-2/IGFBP-4 expression in leukemic cells.","['Elmlinger, M W', 'Sanatani, M S', 'Bell, M', 'Dannecker, G E', 'Ranke, M B']","['Elmlinger MW', 'Sanatani MS', 'Bell M', 'Dannecker GE', 'Ranke MB']","[""Paediatric Endocrinology, University Children's Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 4/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*analysis/drug effects/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1530/eje.0.1380337 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 1998 Mar;138(3):337-43. doi: 10.1530/eje.0.1380337.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 4)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cDNA has a 1,305 bp sequence that encodes a polypeptide of 301 amino acid residues. The protein, named JKTBP, contains two repeats of a putative RNA binding domain (RBD), each composed of canonical RNP-2 and RNP-1 motifs, and a glycine- and tyrosine-rich carboxyl terminus. The sequences of these two repeats are highly homologous with those of the 2 x RBD-Gly rich group of hnRNPs. Northern blotting showed that two mRNAs of approximately 1.4 and 2.8 kb were present in most cultured cells examined. The recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli interacted with the double-stranded form of JKT41 as well as with its single-stranded form. This interaction was competitively inhibited by the same unlabeled JKT41 and to nearly the same extent by unrelated oligonucleotides. Moreover, the recombinant protein interacted with poly(G) and poly(A), but not with poly(U) or poly(C). Transient expression of the protein in SKM-1 cells repressed the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter genes located downstream of the intron 9 element of JKT41 or intron 7 element of FERE27.

At a dose of 20 mg/kg, the terminal half-lives were comparable, however, conventional paclitaxel displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics with disproportionate increase in AUC. At the two dose levels studied, LET demonstrated linear kinetics. Tissue distribution of paclitaxel after administration of LET showed levels 10-fold higher in spleen and 3.5-fold higher in liver as compared to conventional paclitaxel.

The possible relationships of perturbations in PTP metabolism and reduction in lactate formation during differentiation were investigated utilizing sodium orthovanadate, Na3VO4, primarily an inhibitor of PTP phosphatases, and levamisole, considered an alkaline phosphatase inhibitor. Both of these compounds were found to effectively inhibit the TCD-associated differentiation induced by DMSO, HMBA, and Na butyrate and to abrogate the differentiation-associated reduction in lactate accumulation due to these agents. However, they were found not to inhibit hemin-induced hemoglobin synthesis which is independent of TCD and does not alter lactate metabolism. Two brominated levamisole analogs, L-p-bromotetramisole and D-p-bromotetramisole, were also found to be inhibitors of TCD-associated differentiation and to be effective at even lower concentrations than levamisole. The changes in TCD-associated differentiation and lactate production exhibited the same concentration-dependence with respect to the inhibitors. These findings strengthened the theory that TCD-associated differentiation, decreased lactate production, and sensitivity to phosphatase inhibitors are all associated. Since the induction of MEL cell differentiation has been shown to be associated with, and is thought to be due to, the induction of PTP phosphatase activity and Na3VO4 is thought to inhibit the differentiation by inhibiting PTP phosphatase activity, the effect of levamisole on PTP levels was determined. Levamisole, like Na3VO4, was found to increase the tyrosine phosphate levels of proteins of similar molecular weights in intact cells in both the presence and absence of a differentiation inducer. Several phosphotyrosine-containing, similarly sized proteins were particularly affected by differentiation induction and by Na3VO4 and levamisole treatment. Changes in the levels of tyrosine phosphate-containing proteins of approximately 92-96, 60, and 38 kd were particularly noticeable. The induction of differentiation reduced PTP levels and inhibition of differentiation due to treatment with either Na3VO4 or levamisole increased their levels. These data suggest relationships between signal transduction pathways involved in differentiation and TCD, the regulation of lactate and F-2,6-P2 metabolism, and PTP levels.","['Scher, B M', 'Fuksina, I', 'Hellinger, N', 'Waxman, S', 'Scher, W']","['Scher BM', 'Fuksina I', 'Hellinger N', 'Waxman S', 'Scher W']","['Department of Microbiology, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Box 1194, 1 Gustave L.

Entacapone did not stimulate respiration in the L1210 murine T cell lymphoma cell line at the concentrations studied (5-40 microM). Furthermore, entacapone neither increased mitochondrial respiration nor impaired cardiac function at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (< 10 microM). In fact, the threshold concentration for increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption was 20 microM and half-maximal stimulation of respiration was not detected until 58 microM. Surprisingly, tolcapone, another catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, which acts both peripherally and centrally, stimulated respiration in L1210 cells at the lowest concentration studied (5 microM). In addition, 1 microM tolcapone increased mitochondrial respiration, indicating that it caused uncoupling at a much lower concentration than that of 2,4-dinitrophenol, a well-known uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Tolcapone also impaired the mechanical function and oxygen consumption of the isolated guinea-pig heart at 1 microM.

We have found previously an overrepresentation (3.4%) of ATM mutations in a subset of 88 selected breast cancer patients with a family history of breast cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma. This prevalence is comparable to the estimated value (3.8%) from epidemiological study. To further examine the possibility that ATM is correlated to breast cancer, we screened for ATM germ-line mutations in another 100 breast cancer patients with a family history of breast cancer. We used the protein truncating test and found one new germ-line mutation. This figure (1%) is consistent with the observed 0.2-1% carrier frequency for AT. We also studied breast tumors from ATM mutants, and three showed retention of both alleles, whereas the fourth showed loss of the mutant allele. We conclude that the contribution of heterozygous ATM mutations to familial breast cancer is minimal. Even if the ATM gene were causative in these cases, it is not likely to act as a tumor suppressor.","['Chen, J', 'Birkholtz, G G', 'Lindblom, P', 'Rubio, C', 'Lindblom, A']","['Chen J', 'Birkholtz GG', 'Lindblom P', 'Rubio C', 'Lindblom A']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Germ-Line Mutation', '*Heterozygote', 'Humans']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Apr 1;58(7):1376-9.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients who achieved complete remission could receive three additional consolidation courses limited to 4 to 6 doses of ara-C every 12 hours, depending on marrow cellularity. Thirty patients were evaluable. Twenty-two patients had one or more unfavorable prognostic factors, including antecedent hematologic disorders (10), cytogenetic abnormalities (17), or hyperleucocytosis (5). Fourteen patients (47%) achieved complete remission. Four patients did not receive consolidation as planned because of medical contraindication or refusal, and three patients relapsed during consolidation. The median duration of complete remission was 326 days. Sixteen patients failed induction because of relative or absolute drug resistance in nine patients, or death in seven patients. Median survival for the entire group was 6 months. Toxicity was significant, with a median initial hospitalization of 29 days.

Incubation of these cells with 80 microM menadione at 37 degrees C resulted in depletion of intracellular glutathione, increased intracellular Ca2+, and increased lipid peroxidation, events leading to cell degeneration. The sensitivity of these cells to menadione, in order, was: Hep G2 cells > Hep 3B cells > CCRF-CEM cells and MOLT-3 cells. The extent of menadione-induced lipid peroxidation in different cell types followed the same order as did their susceptibility to menadione-induced cell degeneration. The menadione-induced depletion in glutathione level was in the following sequence: Hep G2 cells > MOLT-3 and CCRF-CEM cells > Hep 3B cells. The extent of the menadione-induced increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration was: Hep G2 cells > Molt-3 cells > CCRF-CEM cells and Hep 3B cells. Pre-treatment of Hep G2 cells with 20 mM deferoxamine mesylate, an iron chelator, reduced both the menadione-induced cell degeneration and lipid peroxidation; however, it did not prevent the menadione-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ nor the depletion of glutathione. These data suggest that menadione-induced cell degeneration is directly linked to lipid peroxidation, and that it is less related to the rise in intracellular Ca2+ and the depletion in glutathione content. Dicumarol (an inhibitor of DT diaphorase) enhanced the capacity of menadione to induce Hep 3B cell degeneration from 71.3% to 86.2% after 120 min of menadione treatment at 37 degrees C, but did not have this effect in Hep G2, CCRF-CEM or MOLT-3 cells. The activities of DT diaphorase were 52.4, 39.6, 1.5 and 1.8 nmol cytochrome c reduced/min/mg protein in Hep G2, Hep 3B, CCRF-CEM and MOLT-3 cells, respectively. The activity of DT diaphorase was much higher in Hep G2 cells than in the other cells.

METHODS: ILA mRNA was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting in human articular chondrocytes and fibroblasts. ILA protein expression was examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The proinflammatory stimuli interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interferon (IFN) gamma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced ILA mRNA in primary human articular chondrocytes. TGF beta and dexamethasone inhibited IL-1 induced ILA expression. Chondrocytes expressed the 4.8, 4.0 and 1.9 kb isoforms of ILA mRNA which had previously been observed in lymphocytes and additional isoforms at 3.2, 1.5 and 1.2 kb. Cycloheximide alone induced ILA mRNA in primary chondrocytes while the combination of IL-1 and cycloheximide resulted in ILA superinduction. In contrast to primary chondrocytes, activated human synovial or skin fibroblasts did not express ILA mRNA. Furthermore, ILA was no longer inducible by IL-1 in subcultured, dedifferentiated chondrocytes. However, repression of ILA in fibroblasts and dedifferentiated chondrocytes was overcome by cycloheximide and IL-1 further increased ILA mRNA levels in the presence of cycloheximide. Flow cytometric analysis of ILA protein expression with monoclonal antibodies revealed increased cell-surface expression on IL-1 or TNF alpha, but not on TGF beta stimulated chondrocytes. CONCLUSION: ILA is not only expressed in the immune system but also in mesenchymal cells. ILA expression is induced by specific stimuli and modulated by the differentiation status of the cells. ILA can serve as a model and marker to analyze differentiation-dependent gene expression in mesenchymal cells.","['von Kempis, J', 'Schwarz, H', 'Lotz, M']","['von Kempis J', 'Schwarz H', 'Lotz M']","['Department of Medicine, UCSD, La Jolla, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,9305697,IM,"['Cartilage, Articular/cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Chondrocytes/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/immunology', 'Mesoderm/*cytology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Skin/cytology', 'Synovial Membrane/cytology']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1063-4584(97)80044-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s1063-4584(97)80044-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1997 Nov;5(6):394-406. doi: 10.1016/s1063-4584(97)80044-1.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (ILA receptor)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)']",,,,,,"['AR 39799/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR 43872/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Epidemiological studies published after the last detailed review by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 1982 were reviewed. 12 cohort studies in nine countries that examined distinct populations of workers in the rubber industry, seven industry based nested case-control studies, 48 community based case-control studies in 16 countries, and 23 studies based on administrative data that reported risks for employment in the rubber industry were identified. RESULTS: Excess risks of bladder cancer, lung cancer, and leukaemia were found in most studies, with risks above 1.5 in about half of the studies. A moderate excess risk for laryngeal cancer was consistent across studies. Excess risks were found in a few studies for cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, colon, liver, pancreas, skin, prostate, kidney, brain, and thyroid, and for malignant lymphoma and multiple myeloma, but overall results were not consistent for these neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: Magnitude of the observed risks varied considerably between studies, but overall the findings indicate the presence of a widespread moderate increased cancer risk among rubber workers. The most consistent results were for bladder, laryngeal, and lung cancer and for leukaemia. Excess risks were also found for other neoplasms but an evaluation of the consistency of the findings is difficult because of the possible selective reporting of results. Recent studies do not provide information associating specific exposures with cancer risk. The preventive measures taken in the rubber industry in recent years may decrease risks, but this has not been documented yet in epidemiological studies.","['Kogevinas, M', 'Sala, M', 'Boffetta, P', 'Kazerouni, N', 'Kromhout, H', 'Hoar-Zahm, S']","['Kogevinas M', 'Sala M', 'Boffetta P', 'Kazerouni N', 'Kromhout H', 'Hoar-Zahm S']","[""Respiratory and Environmental Health Research Unit, Institut Municipal d'Investigacio Medica, Barcelona, Spain.

The majority of breakpoints in BCR occur within a 5 kb major breakpoint cluster region, M-Bcr. Here, we show that the 3' part of M-Bcr recombined within, or immediately adjacent to, Alu elements at the additional sites in all five complex BCR-ABL rearrangements that have been examined so far. This is a new finding which suggests that Alu sequences have an affinity for the BCR-ABL recombination process in complex rearrangements, and provides additional evidence for the association of these elements with somatic rearrangements which cause human leukaemia. We further show that sequence motifs similar to IgH switch pentamers and consensus binding sites of the lymphoid-associated Translin protein are present on one or more participating strands at 3'M-Bcr recombination sites. Motifs similar to Translin-binding sites were also identified within the Alu consensus.

The dose-response and time-course analyses of effects on CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isozymes revealed that maximal inhibition was reached after 48 hr of exposure of human hepatocytes to 25 units/ml oncostatin M. Reductions in CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 activity produced by oncostatin M correlated with decreases in protein content, de novo protein synthesis and specific mRNA levels, thus suggesting that oncostatin M could down-regulate CYP expression at the transcriptional level. The inhibitory potency of oncostatin M on CYP expression was compared with that of other cytokines belonging to the interleukin-6 receptor family (interleukin-6, interleukin-11 and leukemia inhibitory factor), and interferon-gamma, which is recognized to inhibit human CYP expression, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, a cytokine that shares structural homology with the interleukin-6 family but has a different transduction signal. Maximal reductions in CYP1A2 activity were reached after 48 hr of treatment with cytokines. At that time, oncostatin M showed the highest inhibitory effects on CYP1A2 activity (38% of control), followed by interferon (49% of control) and interleukin-6 (60% of control), whereas minor effects were produced by the other cytokines (74-80%). Comparable decreases were observed for CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 activities. Enzymatic activity and de novo protein synthesis of 3-methylcholanthrene-induced CYP1A2 and dexamethasone-induced CYP3A4 were also reduced to a much greater extent by oncostatin M than by other cytokines. The results show that oncostatin M is the most effective cytokine in down-regulating CYP isozymes in human hepatocytes, and its effects were evident even after removal of the cytokine from the culture medium.","['Guillen, M I', 'Donato, M T', 'Jover, R', 'Castell, J V', 'Fabra, R', 'Trullenque, R', 'Gomez-Lechon, M J']","['Guillen MI', 'Donato MT', 'Jover R', 'Castell JV', 'Fabra R', 'Trullenque R', 'Gomez-Lechon MJ']","['Unidad de Hepatolog-ia Experimental, Centro de Investigaci-on, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Liver/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Nitrites/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/drug effects']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1998 Apr;285(1):127-34.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression is a marker for the granulocytic lineage and for certain stages of differentiation and is not known to be inducible in mature cells under physiological conditions. Low level of transcription also occurs in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and is greatly activated upon drug-induced granulocytic maturation and by low doses of retinoic acid, in a strictly cell-specific manner (Herwig, S., Su, Q., Ma, Y., and Tempst, P.

We have analyzed a 10-kilobase pair region, upstream of the defensin-1 cap site, for the presence of control elements, and we describe a minimal promoter (position -83 to +82) required to drive transcription in HL-60 cells in a quasi cell-specific manner. Our data also suggest the presence of negative regulatory elements in the -416/-191 region that may further contribute to cell specificity in a chromosomal context. The basal promoter contains two functionally essential, ETS-like (GGAA core sequence) elements. The proximal site (-22/-19) constitutively binds the PU.1 transcription factor in vitro and could function, together perhaps with an adjacent TA-rich sequence (-32/-25), in assembly of a myeloid-restricted, basal transcription factor complex. The distal site (-62/-59) interacts in vitro with an unidentified activity, distinct from PU.1, ETS-1, PEA3, and ELK-1 (factors with definite binding site similarities), and is greatly stimulated by phosphorylation during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Identification of this protein will be important to resolve the molecular mechanisms controlling temporal, granulocytic restricted gene expression.","['Ma, Y', 'Su, Q', 'Tempst, P']","['Ma Y', 'Su Q', 'Tempst P']","['Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Cornell University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Proteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Defensins', 'HL-60 Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.15.8727 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)49559-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Apr 10;273(15):8727-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.15.8727.,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Defensins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,,['F32 CA71163/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In this report, the p53-null human leukemia HL60 cells were used to investigate phosphorylation and degradation of lamin B during apoptosis. We found that lamin B was phosphorylated within 1 h after addition of the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, and that lamin B phosphorylation preceded lamin B degradation and DNA fragmentation. Using a cell-free system we also found that cytosol from camptothecin-treated cells induced lamin B phosphorylation and degradation in isolated nuclei from untreated HL60 cells. Lamin B phosphorylation was prevented by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) but not by the Cdc2 inhibitor, flavopiridol. Phosphorylation of lamin B was inhibited by immunodepletion of PKCalpha from activated cytosol and was restored by addition of purified PKCalpha. PKCalpha activity also increased rapidly as lamin B was phosphorylated after initiation of the apoptotic response in HL60 cells.

However, the signaling events responsible for the execution of this form of death are poorly understood. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades are involved in the cellular response to extracellular stimuli. Specifically, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) have been associated with proliferation and differentiation, whereas the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPKs) have been implicated in cell arrest and death. We report the use of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in the inhibition of apoptosis in HL-60 cells stimulated with the JNK/SAPK activator anisomycin. This anti-apoptotic effect was accompanied by a sustained increase in ERK activity. Furthermore, the use of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors suggested that PKC was involved in the induction of ERK activity and in the inhibition of apoptosis by TPA since the inhibition of apoptosis was attenuated when cells were pretreated with PKC inhibitors. Lastly, we observed that the use of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 inhibited TPA-mediated ERK activity and abrogated the anti-apoptotic effects of TPA. However, apoptotic inhibition was not solely ERK-dependent since cells lacking JNK/SAPK stimulation did not undergo apoptosis. Therefore, we conclude that TPA inhibits the induction of apoptosis in anisomycin-treated HL-60 cells through an ERK-dependent pathway and that this effect can be reversed by the attenuation of ERK activity accompanied with the stimulation of JNK/SAPK activity.","['Stadheim, T A', 'Kucera, G L']","['Stadheim TA', 'Kucera GL']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Anisomycin/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(98)98410-8 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1998.8410 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1998 Apr 7;245(1):266-71. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1998.8410.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '6C74YM2NGI (Anisomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",,,,,,"['R29 CA58944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA9433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

Many of the most well-defined effects have come from gene expression studies; several attempts have been made recently to repeat these key findings. This review analyses these studies and summarizes other reports of major cellular responses to EMFs and the published attempts at replication.

Other investigators have studied this combination in the phase II setting. In our phase I study involving 42 patients, the recommended phase II dose was vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 with ifosfamide 1.6 g/m2, each given on 3 consecutive days, followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The overall response rate was 40%, with a median survival of 50 weeks. Myelosuppression proved to be dose limiting for this regimen, without other major toxicities. Other groups have studied the ifosfamide/vinorelbine combination, and studies adding cisplatin to this regimen have been conducted as well. Given the tolerable toxicity and encouraging response rates and 1-year survival rate seen with this regimen, further investigation of the ifosfamide/vinorelbine regimen has continued in a phase II Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial.

The PML-RAR alpha fusion gene plays an important role in leukemogenesis through antagonizing retinoic acid signalling and the regulatory pathways mediated by PML. APL is the first example of a human cancer that can be effectively treated with the differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The therapeutic effect of ATRA in APL has been associated with the direct modulation of PML-RAR alpha, the restoration of the differentiation pathways regulated by wild-type RAR/retinoid X receptor heterodimer and PML. More recently, a second drug, arsenic trioxide (As2O3), has been discovered in China that also has a strong therapeutic effect against APL. As2O3 can induce clinical remission in de novo or relapsed APL patients and has no cross-resistance with ATRA. It has dual effects on APL cells: preferential apoptosis at high concentration (0.5-2 microM) and partial differentiation at low concentration (0.1-0.5 microM). Modulation and degradation of PML-RAR alpha proteins can be induced by As2O3 and probably contribute to these two effects. These studies lead to a model in which PML-RAR alpha could be the target of both ATRA differentiation therapy and As2O3 apoptosis therapy.","['Chen, Z', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Chen, S J']","['Chen Z', 'Wang ZY', 'Chen SJ']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Pharmacol Ther,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0163-7258(97)00090-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacol Ther. 1997 Oct-Dec;76(1-3):141-9. doi: 10.1016/s0163-7258(97)00090-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,56,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the cellular mechanisms underlying the augmentation effect of thymidine. It was found that thymidine did not increase the cytotoxicity of BCNU for B16/F10 melanoma or L1210 leukemia cells in vitro. Instead, thymidine appeared to augment the activity of tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cells in tumor-bearing mice, which specifically rejected a secondary challenge with the B16/F10 tumor. Thus, development of an antitumor immune response is facilitated by thymidine in BCNU-induced immunosuppressed mice. These preclinical studies suggested that combination therapy with alkylating agents and thymidine may be a more efficacious and less toxic anticancer therapy. The potential efficacy of the sequential administration of dacarbazine (DTIC), BCNU, and thymidine in patients with advanced malignant melanoma was investigated. As predicted from animal studies, sequential administration of DTIC, BCNU, and thymidine is a relatively nontoxic therapy for metastatic melanoma. This treatment induced durable responses in up to 35% of patients, and hence is superior to many commonly used toxic combination chemotherapies. The mechanism of action, although not well characterized, is thought to be mediated through protection of the cellular immune process, as well as organ function, from alkylating agent toxicity through modulation of DNA repair enzymes such as O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase in normal tissue. Thus, thymidine is a biomodulator, which not only protects patients from hematologic, pulmonary, and hepatic toxicities associated with DTIC and BCNU chemotherapy, but also potentiates therapeutic efficacy.","['Hwu, W J', 'Mozdziesz, D E']","['Hwu WJ', 'Mozdziesz DE']","['Department of Medicine, Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Pharmacol Ther,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*antagonists & inhibitors/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Thymidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0163-7258(97)00087-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacol Ther. 1997 Oct-Dec;76(1-3):101-16. doi: 10.1016/s0163-7258(97)00087-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,79,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigation was performed to determine the implications of mixed hematopoietic chimerism (MC) with regard to the clinical outcome in patients with acute leukemias after allo-BMT. Analysis of chimerism was performed by PCR of variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences with a maximum sensitivity of 0.8%. Thirteen male patients transplanted with the marrow of a female donor were also studied by amplification of a Y-chromosome-specific alphoid repeat (0.1-0.01% sensitivity). VNTR analysis in 55 patients revealed complete chimerism (CC) in 36 cases, MC in 18 follow-ups and autologous recovery in one patient. Quantitative analysis of MC identified 10/18 patients with increasing autologous patterns in whom 9/10 subsequently relapsed. The patient with autologous recovery relapsed as well. Eight of 18 patients with MC showed decreasing amounts of autologous DNA and became CC upon further follow-up. In contrast, only 7/36 patients with CC in the prior analysis of chimerism status relapsed. However, in 4/7 patients the interval between last CC confirmation and relapse was more than 4 months. In 2/7 patients autologous DNA was not detectable in peripheral blood but in bone marrow aspirates. One of these seven patients developed a fulminant relapse within 3 weeks. The probability of relapse-free survival for patients with CC is 0.67 (n = 36), for patients with decreasing MC 1.0 (n = 8) and for patients with increasing MC 0.1 (n = 10). In summary, the results demonstrate that serial and quantitative chimerism analysis at short time intervals by PCR provides a reliable and rapid screening method for the early detection of recurrence of underlying disease and is therefore a prognostic tool to identify patients at highest risk of relapse.","['Bader, P', 'Beck, J', 'Frey, A', 'Schlegel, P G', 'Hebarth, H', 'Handgretinger, R', 'Einsele, H', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Benda, N', 'Faul, C', 'Kanz, L', 'Niethammer, D', 'Klingebiel, T']","['Bader P', 'Beck J', 'Frey A', 'Schlegel PG', 'Hebarth H', 'Handgretinger R', 'Einsele H', 'Niemeyer C', 'Benda N', 'Faul C', 'Kanz L', 'Niethammer D', 'Klingebiel T']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Minisatellite Repeats/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', '*Transplantation Chimera/genetics', 'Y Chromosome']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701119 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Mar;21(5):487-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701119.,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocyte reconstitution was characterized by the early appearance of natural killer cells and a low percentage of both T and B cells. During the first year after BMT, the number of NK cells remained constant while T and B cells gradually returned to normal numbers and proportions. Response to the lymphocyte mitogen phytohemagglutinin returned to normal over the course of 2 years, while the response to concanavalin A was slightly depressed and the response to pokeweed mitogen became supranormal at about 1.5 years and continued to increase.

Determining the indications, optimal timing and method for this procedure remains controversial. One approach has been the mobilisation of Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) peripheral blood stem cells following high-dose chemotherapy as a method of purging the graft. We have described a mobilisation regimen of 7 days of hydroxyurea followed by G-CSF and have shown it to be substantially less toxic than other methods. We now report further experience with this technique in a total of 18 patients and the outcome of transplantation in seven patients using cells so-derived. Following mobilisation, approximately a third of patients had 100% Ph-collections and half had less than 50% Ph+ collections. All patients were 100% Ph+ prior to mobilisation. Six out of seven transplanted patients showed sustained engraftment and two of these patients became 18 and 34% Ph+ 3 months post-transplant. Five patients remain alive and well 13 to 25 months post-autograft.

The main object of this report is to analyze the prognostic value of the karyotype in patients with MDS, in relation to the evolution to acute leukemia and the survival time. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic studies were performed in 93 untreated cases of MDS between 1985 and 1994. Overall survival and the evolution to acute leukemia were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 93 patients who were examined at the time of diagnosis, 40 had an abnormal karyotype (43%). The highest frequency of chromosome abnormalities was observed in refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) (65.7%) and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) (40%) and the lowest in refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (10%). The chromosomes most frequently involved were: 5, 7, 8, 11, 12 and 17. No relationship was found between FAB subtypes and the type of chromosomal abnormalities. In respect to the prognosis, an abnormal karyotype, and a complex karyotype were related with a higher frequency of evolution to acute leukemia. A model based on karyotype could divide patients in two groups: poor prognosis (patients with an abnormal karyotype, with involvement of chromosome 7, trisomy 8 or with a complex karyotype), and a good prognosis (patients with normal karyotype). CONCLUSIONS: The cytogenetic studies are very useful in the study of MDS for their clinical implications.","['Sole, F', 'Woessner, S', 'Florensa, L', 'Perez-Losada, A', 'Acin, P', 'Besses, C', 'Garcia-Eroles, L', 'Sans-Sabrafen, J']","['Sole F', 'Woessner S', 'Florensa L', 'Perez-Losada A', 'Acin P', 'Besses C', 'Garcia-Eroles L', 'Sans-Sabrafen J']","[""Laboratori de Citologia Hematologica, Hospital Central L'Alianca, Barcelona.""]",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1998 Jan 31;110(3):94-8.,,,,Estudio citogenetico en 93 sindromes mielodisplasicos.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hehlmann) was held in Mannheim and Heidelberg, Germany, July 13 - 18, 1997. Comparative research in cancer was systematically established in the 1950s. Similarities in morphology, biology and pathology between animal and human leukemias and related diseases and the viral origin of a variety of animal leukemias and related diseases (lymphomas, sarcomas, breast tumors etc.) led to the concept that comparative research should promote the understanding of human leukemias and related diseases. In 1960 the World Health Organization inaugurated the establishment of a World Committee for Comparative Leukemia Research. The first symposium took place in Hannover, Germany, in 1963. After the fifth symposium in Padova, Italy, in 1971 the International Association for Comparative Research on Leukemia and Related Diseases (IACRLRD) was founded to complement the World Committee and to expand the international effort. The history of the symposium shows the evolution from a meeting on animal leukemia viruses into one dealing with viral and genetic aspects of human and animal leukemia and related diseases. The scientific evolution of the Abelson murine leukemia virus with its abl oncogene in the 1970s to what currently appears as the most reliable marker for human chronic myeloid leukemia is merely one example. Comparative research has reached a new dimension with the the recent advances in sequencing of the genomes of a variety of species and of humans. Many genes identified in the human genome and relevant for disease can be found in the genomes of animal species and even in the genomes of bacteria and of yeast. This reminds us that not just human and animal biology but also pathology must be regarded as a continuum of evolution and that much can be learned from comparing the genetic information of different species. Comparative genome research will allow conclusions to be drawn from principles recognized in animal species which are relevant to human diseases. It is likely that the application of comparative research to genome analysis will provide basic new insights in molecular medicine into the function of living beings for both animal species and humans. The current revolution in genomics is the latest phase in a rich history of medical progress related to the comparative approach. Meetings and organizations that have grown out of IACRLRD, include, at least to some extent: the Meeting of the International Human Retrovirology Association, the Gallo Lab Meeting , the Feline Retrovirus Meeting, the Cold Spring Habor Retrovirus Meeting, international and regional AIDS meetings, and many others. The XIX symposium in Mannheim included five memorial lectures, seven plenary sessions, 18 parallel sessions, two round table discussions and a public forum. In addition, six associated satellite symposia were held. The general meeting, attended by participants from 27 countries, integrated thematically contributions of genetic, cellular, and viral factors toward the development of leukemia and lymphoma and sought unifying concepts in leukemogenesis.","['Hochhaus, A', 'Berger, U', 'Kramer, A', 'Reiter, A', 'Seifarth, W', 'Willer, A', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Hochhaus A', 'Berger U', 'Kramer A', 'Reiter A', 'Seifarth W', 'Willer A', 'Hehlmann R']","['III.

Here, we report that sensitivity of various solid tumor cell lines for drug-induced cell death corresponds to activation of the CD95 system. Upon drug treatment, strong induction of CD95 ligand (CD95-L) and caspase activity were found in chemosensitive tumor cells (Hodgkin, Ewing's sarcoma, colon carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma) but not in tumor cells which responded poorly to drug treatment (breast carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma). Blockade of CD95 using F(ab')2 anti-CD95 antibody fragments markedly reduced drug-induced apoptosis, suggesting that drug-triggered apoptosis depended on CD95-L/receptor interaction. Moreover, drug treatment induced CD95 expression, thereby increasing sensitivity for CD95-induced apoptosis. Drug-induced apoptosis critically depended on activation of caspases (ICE/Ced-3-like proteases) since the broad-spectrum inhibitor of caspases zVAD-fmk strongly reduced drug-mediated apoptosis. The prototype substrate of caspases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, was cleaved upon drug treatment, suggesting that CD95-L triggered autocrine/paracrine death via activation of caspases. Our data suggest that chemosensitivity of solid tumor cells depends on intact apoptosis pathways involving activation of the CD95 system and processing of caspases. Our findings may have important implications for new treatment approaches to increase sensitivity and to overcome resistance of solid tumors.","['Fulda, S', 'Los, M', 'Friesen, C', 'Debatin, K M']","['Fulda S', 'Los M', 'Friesen C', 'Debatin KM']","[""Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",1998/04/09 02:04,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/04/09 02:04'],"['1998/04/09 02:04 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/04/09 02:04 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19980330)76:1<105::AID-IJC17>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980330)76:1<105::aid-ijc17>3.0.co;2-b [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1998 Mar 30;76(1):105-14. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980330)76:1<105::aid-ijc17>3.0.co;2-b.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the effect of PA on topoisomerase (topo) activity was evaluated using yeast strains lacking functional topo I or II, mammalian cell nuclear extracts, purified samples of mammalian topo I and topo II, and intact mammalian tissue culture cells. Clonogenic assays revealed that PA cytotoxicity in yeast strains was unaffected by selective loss of topo I or topo II activity. On the other hand, enzyme assays revealed that 2-4 microM PA abolished the catalytic activity of both topo I and topo II in vitro. In contrast to topotecan and etoposide, PA did not stabilize covalent topo-DNA complexes. Instead, PA inhibited topotecan-induced stabilization of covalent topo I-DNA complexes and etoposide-induced stabilization of topo II-DNA complexes in vitro and in intact cells. Consistent with these results, colony-forming assays indicated that short-term PA exposure inhibited the cytotoxicity of topotecan and etoposide, whereas prolonged PA exposure was itself toxic to these cells. Accumulation studies revealed that PA was concentrated as much as 250-fold in drug-treated cells, resulting in intranuclear concentrations that far exceeded those required to inhibit topo I and topo II. Collectively, these results not only suggest that PA can target both topo I and topo II at clinically achievable concentrations but also indicate that its mechanism is distinct from topo I and topo II poisons presently licensed for clinical use.","['Adjei, A A', 'Charron, M', 'Rowinsky, E K', 'Svingen, P A', 'Miller, J', 'Reid, J M', 'Sebolt-Leopold, J', 'Ames, M M', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Adjei AA', 'Charron M', 'Rowinsky EK', 'Svingen PA', 'Miller J', 'Reid JM', 'Sebolt-Leopold J', 'Ames MM', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Acridines/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/drug effects/growth & development', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/14 00:00,1998/05/14 00:01,['1998/05/14 00:00'],"['1998/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Mar;4(3):683-91.,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'L24XJN68OW (NSC 366140)']",,,,,,"['CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA73709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA69912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

At gene level they show strong homology to the human MDR1 gene and the tissue distribution of their gene product is very similar to P-glycoprotein expression in humans. In vivo studies have shown the physiological roles of P-glycoprotein, including protection of the organism from damage by xenobiotics. Tumors with intrinsic P-glycoprotein expression, induced MDR or transfected with an mdr gene, can be used as syngeneic or xenogenic tumor models. Ascites, leukemia, and solid MDR tumor models have been developed. Molecular engineering has resulted in transgenic mice that express the human MDR1 gene in their bone marrow and in knockout mice missing a murine mdr gene. The data on pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity of chemosensitizers of P-glycoprotein in vivo are described. Results from studies using monoclonal antibodies directed against P-glycoprotein and other miscellaneous approaches for modulation of MDR are mentioned.

They are classified as Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin types, and these two are divided into subtypes, according to cell morphology and the characteristics of concurrent elements. Parotid salivary gland lymphomas are rare primary tumours of this region, although 80% of all salivary gland lymphomas, appear in parotid. They originate from intraparotid or periparotid lymph nodes, or from lymphoid elements of other pathological states in the gland such as sialadenitis, cysts with the presence of lymphoid tissue, parenchymal neoplasms with lymphoid component present and autoimmune illnesses, esp. Sjogren syndrome. Many authors (2-15) who have issued publications on this topic in foreign professional literature in the past ten years, agree that the primary localization of lymphomas in parotid salivary gland is very rare, although in recent decades more frequent than earlier (5). In majority of cases they appear on one side, although there are very rare cases of described parotid salivary glands on both sides. The illness most often starts as painless, soft knob in the region of parotid salivary gland. Other discomforts are very rare, and mostly appear as a feeling of pressure and mild painful sensations in the region of the change. In case of facial nerve paresis and/or strong pains, as well as adenopathy, there is a justified suspicion of carcinoma (20). The treatment is surgical. The method chosen is parotidectomy. According to histological type and clinical stadium, it includes radiotherapy or polychemotherapy. The prognosis depends on histological type of tumour, that is clinical stadium, and shows no specific characteristics compared with other forms of disease appearing outside parotid salivary gland. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient aged 66 was admitted to the ward with a tumefaction in the right parotid region. Family case history: negative. Personal case history excerpt: over 20 years of rheumatism, chronic bronchitis and hypertension. Present discomfort: tumefaction in the right parotid region, noticed about a year and a half earlier. The tumefaction was about 3 cm in diameter, painless to palpation, rubbery and smooth. She came to the Otolaryngology ward on May 31, 1995, when it was established that she had a tumour of the right parotid region and chronic otitis media on the left side. She was admitted on August 7, 1995. Local test results: the right parotid region contained a tumor of irregular round shape, about 6 cm in diameter, soft and painless to palpation, with smooth surface, the skin over the tumor was hyperaemic and sporadically livid. ORL status excerpt: subtotal reniform perforation of the left tympanic membrane enclosing all parts except the attic, with slight transparent secretion. Enlarged lymph nodes were not palpable. On August 10, 1995, under general endotracheal anaesthesia, a pre-operative aspiration of tumor was performed in three positions. The obtained substance contained blood, after which it was decided to perform an excision biopsy, which was done in the lower portion of the tumor. Histopathological analysis did not give a clearly defined character of tumor, so that hospitalisation was indicated and scheduled for further treatment. On the second admission on October 10, 1995, general condition and local results remain unchanged. On October 12, 1995, total parotidectomy was performed under general endotracheal anaesthesia. A tumor of about 5 cm in diameter and the removed salivary gland were sent to histopathological tests. The post-operative course was normal, the function of the facial nerve was preserved. Histopathological results: well-differentiated malignant lymphocyte lymphoma. The patient was sent to polychemotherapy on Cyclophosphamide Oncovin Pronisin (COP) protocol. One year after the surgery, the local findings are regular.

METHODS: Bone marrow direct method and/or short-term culture were used to prepare the chromosomes and karyotype analysis was performed with R-banding technique. RESULTS: 30 cases (5%) were Ph negative; 570 cases (95%) were Ph positive. 535 cases (93.8%) had standard Ph translocation;34 cases(5.9%) had variant translocation, including 13 cases (2.2%) with simple variant translocation, 13 cases (2.2%) with complex variant translocation and 8 cases (1.4%) with masked Ph chromosome. 526 cases (92.2%) had 100% of Ph positive cells; 44 cases (7.7%) had normal karyotype in partial or all metaphases after treatment such as allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, interferon and pulse hydroxyurea therapy, but conventional chemotherapy had no effect on the percentage of Ph positive cells. 50.6% of Ph positive CML with blast crisis had extra chromosomal abnormalities, of which, the most common ones were +8(46.1%),2 Ph(33.9%) and i(17q) (23%) in descending order. CONCLUSION: These facts indicate that chromosome examinations not only help diagnose and differentiate CML,but also help predict the blast crisis, evaluate the therapeutic effect, and make a cytogenetic classification for CML.","['Xie, X', 'Guo, Y', 'Xue, Y']","['Xie X', 'Guo Y', 'Xue Y']","['First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou Medical College, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006 P.

Deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 can be a primary aberration that promotes malignancy and also confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Recently, studies of Bax-deficient mice have indicated that the pro-apoptotic BAX molecule can function as a tumor suppressor. Consequently, we examined human hematopoietic malignancies and found that approximately 21% of lines possessed mutations in BAX, perhaps most commonly in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia subset. Approximately half were nucleotide insertions or deletions within a deoxyguanosine (G8) tract, resulting in a proximal frame shift and loss of immunodetectable BAX protein. Other BAX mutants bore single amino acid substitutions within BH1 or BH3 domains, demonstrated altered patterns of protein dimerization, and had lost death-promoting activity. Thus, mutations in the pro-apoptotic molecule BAX that confer resistance to apoptosis are also found in malignancies.","['Meijerink, J P', 'Mensink, E J', 'Wang, K', 'Sedlak, T W', 'Sloetjes, A W', 'de Witte, T', 'Waksman, G', 'Korsmeyer, S J']","['Meijerink JP', 'Mensink EJ', 'Wang K', 'Sedlak TW', 'Sloetjes AW', 'de Witte T', 'Waksman G', 'Korsmeyer SJ']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital ""St. Radboud"" Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55308-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Apr 15;91(8):2991-7.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports suggest frequent methylation of the p15(INK4b) gene promoter in leukemias, and it has been proposed that this methylation could be necessary for leukemic cells to escape TGF beta regulation. We investigated the methylation status of p15(INK4b) gene in 53 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) cases, including nine that had progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), using a recently described sensitive method where polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is preceded by bisulfite modification of DNA (methylation specific PCR). p15(INK4b) methylation was observed in 20 of 53 (38%) of the cases. Twenty of the 24 patients with greater than 10% bone marrow blasts had p15(INK4b) methylation (including all nine patients who had progressed to AML) as compared with none of MDS patients with <10% bone marrow blasts. No correlation between karyotypic abnormalities and methylation status was found. Patients with p15(INK4b) methylation had a worse prognosis, but the prognostic significance of p15(INK4b) methylation was no more found by multivariate analysis, due to its strong correlation to the percentage of marrow blasts. In 10 MDS cases, sequential DNA samples were available. In five of them, methylation of the p15(INK4b) gene was detected at leukemic transformation, but not at diagnosis. Our results showed that methylation of the p15(INK4b) gene in MDS is correlated with blastic bone marrow involvement and increases with disease evolution toward AML. It suggests that proliferation of leukemic cells might require an escape of regulation of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and possibly of TGF beta inhibitory effect.","['Quesnel, B', 'Guillerm, G', 'Vereecque, R', 'Wattel, E', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Bauters, F', 'Vanrumbeke, M', 'Fenaux, P']","['Quesnel B', 'Guillerm G', 'Vereecque R', 'Wattel E', 'Preudhomme C', 'Bauters F', 'Vanrumbeke M', 'Fenaux P']","[""Service des maladies du sang and the Laboratoire d'hematologie, CHU Lille, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA Methylation', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55307-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Apr 15;91(8):2985-90.,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the role of p16(INK4a) gene alterations in the pathogenesis of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) and the histological progression of indolent variants, we have analyzed the expression, deletions, and mutations of this gene in a series of 112 NHLs. Hypermethylation of the gene was also examined in a subset of tumors with lack of protein expression but without mutations or deletions of the gene. p16(INK4a) gene alterations were detected in 3 out of 64 (5%) indolent lymphomas but in 16 out of 48 (33%) primary or transformed aggressive variants. In the low-grade tumors, p16(INK4a) alterations were detected in 1 (4%) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (hemizygous missense mutation), 1 (6%) follicular lymphoma (homozygous deletion), and 1 (5%) typical mantle cell lymphoma (homozygous deletion). The two later cases followed an aggressive clinical evolution. In the aggressive tumors, p16(INK4a) gene alterations were observed in 2 (29%) Richter's syndromes (2 homozygous deletions), 3 (33%) transformed follicular lymphomas (1 homozygous deletion and 2 nonsense mutations), 3 (43%) blastoid mantle cell lymphomas (2 homozygous and 1 hemizygous deletions), 5 (28%) de novo large-cell lymphomas (1 homozygous deletion and 4 hypermethylations), 2 lymphoblastic lymphomas (2 homozygous deletions), and 1 of 2 anaplastic large cell lymphomas (hypermethylation). Protein expression was lost in all tumors with p16(INK4a) alterations except in the typical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with hemizygous point mutation. Sequential samples of the indolent and transformed phase of three cases showed the presence of p16(INK4a) deletions in the Richter's syndrome but not in the CLL component of two cases, whereas in a follicular lymphoma the deletion was present in both the follicular tumor and in the diffuse large-cell lymphoma. In conclusion, these findings indicate that p16(INK4a) gene alterations are a relatively infrequent phenomenon in NHLs. However, deletions, mutations, and hypermethylation of the gene with loss of protein expression are associated with aggressive tumors and they may also participate in the histological progression of indolent lymphomas.","['Pinyol, M', 'Cobo, F', 'Bea, S', 'Jares, P', 'Nayach, I', 'Fernandez, P L', 'Montserrat, E', 'Cardesa, A', 'Campo, E']","['Pinyol M', 'Cobo F', 'Bea S', 'Jares P', 'Nayach I', 'Fernandez PL', 'Montserrat E', 'Cardesa A', 'Campo E']","['Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', 'Point Mutation']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55306-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Apr 15;91(8):2977-84.,['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that the WT1 gene is strongly expressed in leukemia cells with an increase in its expression levels at relapse and an inverse correlation between its expression levels and prognosis, thus making it a novel tumor marker for leukemic blast cells. Furthermore, WT1 antisense oligomers have been found to inhibit the growth of leukemic cells. These results strongly suggested the involvement of the WT1 gene in human leukemogenesis. The present study was performed to prove our hypothesis that the WT1 gene plays a key role in leukemogenesis and performs an oncogenic function in hematopoietic progenitor cells, rather than a tumor-suppressor gene function. 32D cl3, an interleukin-3-dependent myeloid progenitor cell line, differentiates into mature neutrophils in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). However, when transfected wild-type WT1 gene was constitutively expressed in 32D cl3, the cells stopped differentiating and continued to proliferate in response to G-CSF. As for signal transduction mediated by G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR), Stat3alpha was constitutively activated in wild-type WT1-infected 32D cl3 in response to G-CSF, whereas, in WT1-uninfected 32D cl3, activation of Stat3alpha was only transient. However, most interesting was the fact that G-CSF stimulation resulted in constitutive activation of Stat3beta only in wild-type WT1-infected 32D cl3, but not in WT1-uninfected 32D cl3. Thus, WT1 expression constitutively activated both Stat3alpha and Stat3beta. A transient activation of Stat1 was detected in both wild-type WT1-infected and uninfected 32D cl3 after G-CSF stimulation, but no difference in its activation was found. No activation of MAP kinase was detected in both wild-type WT1-infected and uninfected 32D cl3 after G-CSF stimulation. These results demonstrated that WT1 expression competed with the differentiation-inducing signal mediated by G-CSFR and constitutively activated Stat3, resulting in the blocking of differentiation and subsequent proliferation. Therefore, the data presented here support our hypothesis that the WT1 gene plays an essential role in leukemogenesis and performs an oncogenic function in hematopoietic progenitor cells and represent the first demonstration of an important role of the WT1 gene in signal transduction in hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Inoue, K', 'Tamaki, H', 'Ogawa, H', 'Oka, Y', 'Soma, T', 'Tatekawa, T', 'Oji, Y', 'Tsuboi, A', 'Kim, E H', 'Kawakami, M', 'Akiyama, T', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Sugiyama, H']","['Inoue K', 'Tamaki H', 'Ogawa H', 'Oka Y', 'Soma T', 'Tatekawa T', 'Oji Y', 'Tsuboi A', 'Kim EH', 'Kawakami M', 'Akiyama T', 'Kishimoto T', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Medicine III, Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neutrophils/pathology/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'WT1 Proteins']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55305-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Apr 15;91(8):2969-76.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now extended this study to a total of 67 cases (34 acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 23 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], 10 acute undifferentiated leukemia [AUL]/biphenotypic) and find that WT1 mutations occur in 14% of AML and 20% of biphenotypic leukemia, but are rare in ALL (one case). In contrast to the findings in Wilms' tumor, where mutations in the WT1 gene usually behave according to Knudson's two hit model for tumor suppressor genes, seven of eight leukemia-associated WT1 mutations are heterozygous, implying a dominant or dominant-negative mode of action in hematopoietic cells. In AML, the presence of a WT1 mutation is associated with failure to achieve complete remission and a lower survival rate. These data (1) confirm that WT1 mutations underlie a similar proportion of cases of AML to that seen in Wilms' tumors and (2) show for the first time that WT1 mutations can contribute to leukemogenesis of lymphoid as well as myeloid origin, suggesting that its normal role in hematopoiesis lies at a very early progenitor stage. The relationship of WT1 mutation to chemoresistance merits further investigation.","['King-Underwood, L', 'Pritchard-Jones, K']","['King-Underwood L', 'Pritchard-Jones K']","['Section of Paediatric Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, Belmont, Sutton, Surrey, UK. kpj@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'WT1 Proteins']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55304-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Apr 15;91(8):2961-8.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have measured serum sFasL concentrations in other hematological disorders, including severe aplastic anemia (SAA), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). The serum sFasL concentration of age-matched healthy controls was 0.16 +/- 0.11 ng/mL (mean +/- SD, n = 22).

Groupe Ouest Est Leucemies Aigues Myeloblastiques (GOELAM).,2722-30,"The complete remission (CR) rate after intensive chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) remains low in elderly patients, mainly because of a higher infectious mortality rate related to neutropenia and an increased incidence of adverse prognostic factors. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been shown to potentially recruit leukemic blasts into cell cycle and improve cytotoxic effects when given during chemotherapy, and to shorten the duration of neutropenia when administered after chemotherapy. Two hundred forty patients aged 55 to 75 years who had newly diagnosed AML were randomly assigned to receive placebo or Escherichia coli-derived GM-CSF (5 micrograms/kg/d by 6-hour intravenous infusion) starting during induction chemotherapy on day 1 and continued through and after chemotherapy until recovery of neutrophils, or evidence of regrowth of leukemia, or up to day 28. Induction chemotherapy consisted of idarubicin (8 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 5) and cytarabine (100 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 7). The study drug was not administered subsequent to the induction course. Patients who achieved a CR received continuous maintenance therapy for 1 year with four quarterly reinduction courses; in the 55- to 64-year age subgroup, patients were randomly assigned to receive or not a consolidation course before maintenance therapy. The CR rate was similar in the GM-CSF and placebo groups (63% and 60.5%, respectively; P = .79). The mortality, rate of resistant disease, and rate of regrowth of leukemia were also similar in both groups. The time to neutrophil recovery was shorter in patients who received GM-CSF (24 v 29 days; P = .0001), but the incidence and characteristics of infectious events were not different. The 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was significantly improved in the GM-CSF group (48% v 21% in the placebo group; P = .003). This effect was highly significant in the cohort of patients aged 55 to 64, but only marginal in patients >/=65 years of age. There was a trend toward a longer overall survival (OS) in the GM-CSF group (P = .082). In summary, the administration of GM-CSF, concomitantly with chemotherapy and thereafter during induction course in AML, shortened the time to neutrophil recovery, but did not improve the CR rate in patients aged 55 to 75. Nonetheless, DFS and OS were significantly prolonged in patients aged 55 to 64 treated with GM-CSF. These results are promising and further evaluation of myeloid growth factors in AML is warranted.","['Witz, F', 'Sadoun, A', 'Perrin, M C', 'Berthou, C', 'Briere, J', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Lioure, B', 'Witz, B', 'Francois, S', 'Desablens, B', 'Pignon, B', 'Le Prise, P Y', 'Audhuy, B', 'Caillot, D', 'Casassus, P', 'Delain, M', 'Christian, B', 'Tellier, Z', 'Polin, V', 'Hurteloup, P', 'Harousseau, J L']","['Witz F', 'Sadoun A', 'Perrin MC', 'Berthou C', 'Briere J', 'Cahn JY', 'Lioure B', 'Witz B', 'Francois S', 'Desablens B', 'Pignon B', 'Le Prise PY', 'Audhuy B', 'Caillot D', 'Casassus P', 'Delain M', 'Christian B', 'Tellier Z', 'Polin V', 'Hurteloup P', 'Harousseau JL']","['Clinical Hematology Units of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nancy, Nancy, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55278-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Apr 15;91(8):2722-30.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 1987 through 1992, 195 patients in the Benelux with recent untreated CML were randomized between low-dose IFN-alpha2b (3 MIU, 5 days/wk) or hydroxyurea alone (control group). The white blood cell count had to be kept less than 10 x 10(9)/L in both arms; to this end, the IFN group received additional hydroxyurea, if necessary. The complete hematologic responses at 6 months in the IFN group were 62%, versus 38% in the control group. In the IFN group, a complete hematologic response at 6 months predicted a better survival (P = .001), but such a tendency was also seen in the control group (P = .07). Cytogenetic responses in the IFN group yielded 9% complete responders, 7% partial responders (<35% Ph+), and 24% minor responders (36% to 95% Ph+). The quality of cytogenetic response within the first 24 months was highly predictive for survival (P = .002). Twenty-four patients discontinued IFN-alpha because of side effects, but they did this at a long median interval of 17.6 months; the remaining patients did not require dose adaptations. Although the hematologic and cytogenetic responses in the IFN group were higher than in the control group, the duration of chronic phase from randomization was not statistically different with 53 and 44 months in the IFN and control group, respectively.

Under most circumstances, CLL B cells do not proliferate in culture and express a limited repertoire of surface antigens, including CD19, CD20, CD23, CD27, CD40, and CD70. In this report, we demonstrate that freshly isolated B cells from a subset of CLL cases constitutively express CD40 ligand (CD40L, CD154), a member of the tumor necrosis factor family which is normally expressed by activated CD4(+) T cells and mediates T-cell-dependent B-cell proliferation and antibody production. The degree of CD40L expression varied considerably among the CLL cases examined. CD40L was detected in purified CLL B cells by immunofluorescence flow cytometry, by RT-PCR, and by immunoprecipitation. To demonstrate that CD40L in the CLL B cells is functional, we used irradiated CLL cells to stimulate IgG production by target, nonmalignant B cells in coculture. The CLL B cells induced IgG production by normal B cells to a similar degree as did purified T cells in a process which was partially inhibited by monoclonal antibody to CD40L. This is one of the first reports of CD40L expression in a B-cell tumor. The data suggest that CD40L in the tumor cells may be a factor in the generation of pathologic antibodies by normal B cells in some patients with CLL.","['Schattner, E J', 'Mascarenhas, J', 'Reyfman, I', 'Koshy, M', 'Woo, C', 'Friedman, S M', 'Crow, M K']","['Schattner EJ', 'Mascarenhas J', 'Reyfman I', 'Koshy M', 'Woo C', 'Friedman SM', 'Crow MK']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation/*immunology', 'Paracrine Communication', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55274-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Apr 15;91(8):2689-97.,['0 (CD40 Antigens)'],,,,,,"['P50 AR42588/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R29CA71589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

A rare, but recurrent, APL has been described that does not respond to ATRA treatment and is associated with a variant chromosomal translocation and expression of the PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein. Both PML- and PLZF-RARalpha possess identical RAR sequences and inhibit ATRA-induced gene transcription as well as cell differentiation. We now show that the above-mentioned oncogenic fusion proteins interact with the nuclear receptor corepressor N-CoR and, in comparison with the wild-type RARalpha protein, their interactions display reduced sensitivities to ATRA. Although pharmacologic concentration of ATRA could still induce dissociation of N-CoR from PML-RARalpha, it had a very little effect on its association with the PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein. This ATRA-insensitive interaction between N-CoR and PLZF-RARalpha was mediated by the N-terminal PLZF moiety of the chimera. It appears that N-CoR/histone deacetylase corepressor complex interacts directly in an ATRA-insensitive manner with the BTB/POZ-domain of the wild-type PLZF protein and is required, at least in part, for its function as a transcriptional repressor.

This deregulated tyrosine kinase selectively causes hematopoietic disorders resembling human leukemias in animal models and transforms fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells in culture. Bcr-Abl also protects cells from death induced on cytokine deprivation or exposure to DNA damaging agents. In addition, the antiapoptotic function of Bcr-Abl is thought to play a necessary role in hematopoietic transformation and potentially in leukemogenesis. The transcription factor NF-kappaB has been identified recently as an inhibitor of apoptosis and as a potential regulator of cellular transformation. This study shows that expression of Bcr-Abl leads to activation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription by causing nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB as well as by increasing the transactivation function of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-kappaB. Importantly, this activation is dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl and partially requires Ras. The ability of Bcr-Abl to protect cytokine-dependent 32D myeloid cells from death induced by cytokine deprivation or DNA damage does not, however, require functional NF-kappaB. However, using a super-repressor form of IkappaBalpha, we show that NF-kappaB is required for Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenicity in nude mice and for transformation of primary bone marrow cells. This study implicates NF-kappaB as an important component of Bcr-Abl signaling. NF-kappaB-regulated genes, therefore, likely play a role in transformation by Bcr-Abl and thus in Bcr-Abl-associated human leukemias.","['Reuther, J Y', 'Reuther, G W', 'Cortez, D', 'Pendergast, A M', 'Baldwin, A S Jr']","['Reuther JY', 'Reuther GW', 'Cortez D', 'Pendergast AM', 'Baldwin AS Jr']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/09 02:10,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/05/09 02:10'],"['1998/05/09 02:10 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 02:10 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.12.7.968 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1998 Apr 1;12(7):968-81. doi: 10.1101/gad.12.7.968.,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,"['CA61033/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC316671,,,,,,,,

Immune dysfunction in solid tumours has been attributed to abnormal signal transduction, possibly through altered expression of intracellular components of the TCR/CD3 complex (e.g. CD3-zeta), receptors on NK cells and their associated protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs; p56lck, p59fyn and ZAP-70). Using a flow cytometric method to detect dual-expression of surface proteins and intracellular components of the TCR/CD3 complex, we have studied 46 patients with myeloid malignancies. CD3-zeta expression was abnormal in 64% of patients, and was more prominent in those with advanced disease. Three patients with reduced CD3-zeta were analysed both pre- and post-treatment, and recovery of CD3-zeta expression was associated with successful remission induction (expression of PTKs was variable and reduced levels were seen all disease stages). The results of this study suggest that loss of signalling proteins is not a result of direct contact of leukaemic cells with lymphocytes per se or the extent of the leukaemia burden, but to a specific property of some myeloid malignancies, which is more frequently acquired with greater malignant transformation.","['Buggins, A G', 'Hirst, W J', 'Pagliuca, A', 'Mufti, G J']","['Buggins AG', 'Hirst WJ', 'Pagliuca A', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, London.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD3 Complex/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1998/04/08 00:00,1998/04/08 00:01,['1998/04/08 00:00'],"['1998/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00654.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Mar;100(4):784-92. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00654.x.,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the binding of 125I-TPO to the human megakaryocytic cell line, CMK, and to primary human megakaryocytes. Scatchard analysis of TPO binding to its cognate receptor in megakaryocytic cells suggested the existence of a single class of c-Mpl receptors. CMK cells exhibited 1223 receptors per cell with a dissociation constant (Kd) of Kd = 223 pM, whereas primary human megakaryocytes exhibited 12140 receptors per cell and a dissociation constant of Kd = 749 pM. The pretreatment of CMK cells and primary bone marrow megakaryocytes with TPO resulted in a decreased binding of TPO to the c-Mpl receptors. This down-regulation was observed within 3 h and was not inhibited by cycloheximide. Phorbol ester, an activator of protein kinase C, also inhibited TPO binding to the c-Mpl receptors by reducing the number of these receptors. The pretreatment of CMK cells with IL-3, IL-6 and DMSO, all of which induced the differentiation of CMK cells, did not affect the binding of TPO to the c-Mpl receptors.

Correlation of CD34+ cells/kg to CFU-GM/kg in the harvests was good (correlation coefficient = 0.72, P < 0.001). We demonstrated significant associations between the CFU-GM content of the harvest and the following: time to platelets >50 x 10(9)/l post final induction course (P < 0.001), days to harvest from day 1 of intensification/mobilization (correlation coefficient = -0.73, P < 0.001), platelets >20 x 10(9)/l at time of harvest (P = 0.02), time to WBC >1.0 x 10(9)/l post intensification/mobilization (correlation coefficient = -0.70, P < 0.001), and WBC on day of harvest (correlation coefficient = 0.60, P < 0.001).

Haemopoietic recovery after reinfusion of PBSC was highly correlated to the number of CFU-GM infused (neutrophils >0.5 x 10(9)/l rs = -0.72, P = 0.001; platelets >20 x 10(9)/l unsupported rs = -0.71, P = 0.001). Our results show that the number of induction courses received, and thus exposure to cytotoxic agents received, made no significant difference to subsequent CFU-GM harvest content. We collected superior harvests from those patients with faster platelet recovery following mobilization therapy. We also found that faster platelet recovery following the final induction therapy was a better predictor of the CFU-GM harvest following mobilization than was the neutrophil recovery following final induction.","['Jowitt, S N', 'Chang, J', 'Morgenstern, G R', 'Howe, T', 'Ryder, W D', 'Testa, N G', 'Scarffe, J H']","['Jowitt SN', 'Chang J', 'Morgenstern GR', 'Howe T', 'Ryder WD', 'Testa NG', 'Scarffe JH']","['Department of Haematological Oncology, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils', 'Platelet Count', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",1998/04/08 00:00,1998/04/08 00:01,['1998/04/08 00:00'],"['1998/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00614.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Mar;100(4):688-94. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00614.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 942 patients who achieved complete remission (CR); seven developed a SHM: four AMLs and three NHLs. The median latency from onset of ALL and of secondary haematological neoplasm was 69 months for AML and 61 months for NHL. Three out of four patients with secondary AML were unresponsive to the new chemotherapy and died, whereas the fourth patient achieved a new CR. Among the three NHL cases, two patients are presently alive in CR, whereas the third patient was refractory to chemotherapy and died. The relative risk of haematological malignancy among the GIMEMA trials population, as compared to that of the Italian Cancer Registries, was 15.25-fold higher, and the actuarial estimated cumulative proportion of ALL patients with a secondary haematological neoplasm at 5 and 10 years were 0.59% and 3.63% respectively. The incidence of adult ALL who developed a SHM, although apparently lower than in the paediatric ALL series, was higher when compared to the normal population. The difference between paediatric and adult ALL is probably due to the lack of craniospinal radiotherapy and to the lower doses of epipodoxiphyllotoxins used in adult trials. The higher percentage of childhood ALL with a prolonged event-free survival could result in an increase of secondary neoplasms in these cases, which suggests that secondary haematological neoplasms in adult ALL patients are real, although rare, events.","['Pagano, L', 'Annino, L', 'Ferrari, A', 'Camera, A', 'Martino, B', 'Montillo, M', 'Tosti, M E', 'Mele, A', 'Pulsoni, A', 'Vegna, M L', 'Leone, G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Pagano L', 'Annino L', 'Ferrari A', 'Camera A', 'Martino B', 'Montillo M', 'Tosti ME', 'Mele A', 'Pulsoni A', 'Vegna ML', 'Leone G', 'Mandelli F']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Failure']",1998/04/08 00:00,1998/04/08 00:01,['1998/04/08 00:00'],"['1998/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00616.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Mar;100(4):669-76. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00616.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CR after remission induction treatment was achieved in 55% of the patients in the control group and in 56% of the patients in the GM-CSF group (P = NS). The duration of survival and disease-free survival at 2 years after randomization were estimated at 22% and 19% for the control group and 22% and 14% for the GM-CSF group (P = NS). Considering the short-term quality of life, the administration of GM-CSF resulted in more problems with regard to depressed mood, diarrhoea and rash/eczema. With regard to the long-term quality of life there were no significant differences between the two groups. The average costs of the primary treatment were higher in GM-CSF-treated patients than in the control group, i.e. US$40782 and US$34465, respectively (P < 0.01). The costs during the follow-up period did not differ between the two groups. The results of this randomized clinical trial indicate that daunomycin-cytosine arabinoside plus GM-CSF is not a cost-effective treatment strategy when compared with daunomycin-cytosine arabinoside alone.","['Uyl-de Groot, C A', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Vellenga, E', 'Suciu, S', 'Willemze, R', 'Rutten, F F']","['Uyl-de Groot CA', 'Lowenberg B', 'Vellenga E', 'Suciu S', 'Willemze R', 'Rutten FF']","['Institute for Medical Technology Assessment/Department of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Hospital Costs', 'Humans', 'Karnofsky Performance Status', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/economics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', '*Quality of Life', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/04/08 00:00,1998/04/08 00:01,['1998/04/08 00:00'],"['1998/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00635.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Mar;100(4):629-36. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00635.x.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence quenching can be used to study the kinetics of DNP-BSA binding to FITC-IgE. We observe that DNP-BSA binds more slowly to IgE than does an equimolar amount of a monovalent DNP ligand, suggesting that the average effective number of DNP groups per BSA is less than one. The binding data are well described by a transient hapten exposure model in which most of the DNP groups are unavailable for binding but have some probability of becoming exposed and available for binding during the time of the binding measurement. Additional experiments indicate that, for suboptimal to optimal concentrations of DNP-BSA, most of the FITC fluorescence quenching on the cell surface is due to cross-linking events. With these concentrations at 15 degrees C, the kinetics of FITC fluorescence quenching by DNP-BSA correlates with the kinetics of DNP-BSA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc epsilon RI. At 35 degrees C, the phosphorylation kinetics are biphasic during the time period in which cross-linking continues to increase. Our results establish a quantitative relationship between the time-course for cross-linking by multivalent Ag and Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling, and they provide the means to predict the kinetics of cross-linking under a wide variety of conditions.","['Xu, K', 'Goldstein, B', 'Holowka, D', 'Baird, B']","['Xu K', 'Goldstein B', 'Holowka D', 'Baird B']","['Department of Chemistry, Baker Laboratory, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Dinitrophenols/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/metabolism', 'Haptens/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Models, Immunological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1998/04/08 00:00,1998/04/08 00:01,['1998/04/08 00:00'],"['1998/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Apr 1;160(7):3225-35.,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",,,,,,"['AI22449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM35556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Clear patterns of dominance were observed between peptides in the mixture, with the CTL response focusing on the Sendai virus nucleoprotein 324-332 and vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein 52-59 epitopes. The dominance of these epitopes correlated with high CTL availability. Subdominance of the OVA(257-264) and the MCF1233 murine leukemia virus envelope 574-581 peptides could not be explained by inferior ability to bind and stabilize MHC class I molecules. Interestingly, immunodominance was broken if the peptide mixture was pulsed on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, a mode of immunization allowing efficient recognition of a broader set of specificities.

Flow cytometric analysis clearly demonstrated that Bt2-cAMP and PMA both induced the cell surface expression of uPAR. Northern analysis and nuclear run-on assay revealed that cAMP and PMA activated the uPAR gene transcription and both additively increased the uPAR mRNA level. However, actinomycin-D decay experiment showed that PMA, but not cAMP, prolonged the uPAR mRNA half-life. Furthermore, inhibition of the ongoing protein synthesis with cycloheximide abrogated completely the PMA-induced uPAR mRNA accumulation but only partially the induction by PMA plus cAMP, whereas the induction by cAMP alone was rather amplified, indicating that the de novo protein synthesis is necessary in the induction by PMA but not in the induction by cAMP and that the cAMP pathway may be dominant in uPAR gene expression in the PL-21 cells as compared to the PMA pathway.

Therefore, reduced activities of Gal-IL-1alpha are due, at least partially, to the decrease in their receptor binding affinities.","['Nabeshima, S', 'Chiba, T', 'Takei, Y', 'Watanabe, S', 'Okuyama, H', 'Onozaki, K']","['Nabeshima S', 'Chiba T', 'Takei Y', 'Watanabe S', 'Okuyama H', 'Onozaki K']","['Department of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Tanabe, Mizuho, Japan. konozaki@phar.nagoya-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Dinoprostone/biosynthesis', 'Galactose', 'Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/08 00:00,1998/04/08 00:01,['1998/04/08 00:00'],"['1998/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1006943500806 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycoconj J. 1998 Jan;15(1):69-74. doi: 10.1023/a:1006943500806.,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",,,,,,,,['Glycoconj J 1998 Apr;15(4'],,,,,,,

Caloric intakes are now recognized to be important uncontrolled variables in bioassays because rodents chronically fed ad libitum become obese, reproductively senile and have increased incidences of age-related diseases, higher tumor burdens and decreased survival. The available literature suggests that ad libitum feeding neither optimizes the health and well-being of rodents nor provides the best model for use in evaluation of pharmacological and toxicological profiles. Use of an optimized diet, restricted in terms of caloric intakes, has been proposed for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. It is suggested that limiting caloric intakes to 50-80% of ad libitum consumption would result in lower body weights, decreased tumor incidences and prolonged survival in the controls. To evaluate the influence of diet on chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rats, two 104-week studies were conducted. These studies consisted of 280 CD Sprague-Dawley and 280 Fischer-344 rats fed ad libitum, and 140 CD Sprague-Dawley and 140 Fischer-344 rats fed a diet that was optimized by limiting caloric intakes by 15-35%. Both diets consisted of certified commercial diet in meal form. The optimized diet reduced weight gain approximately 50% after 100 weeks. Clinical chemistry and hematology parameters showed negligible effects of reduced diet, with the exception that serum triglycerides were lower in males and females in both strains at weeks 52 and 104. The ad libitum-fed animals had a higher incidence of pseudopregnancy, aggressiveness, foot sores and abscesses than the animals fed an optimized diet. These effects were more pronounced in the CD Sprague-Dawley rats than in the Fischer-344 rats. At the completion of the 104-week study, survival in the ad libitum fed CD Sprague-Dawley rats was approximately one-half that of the animals fed an optimized diet (39% versus 76%). The difference in survival between Fischer-344 rats fed ad libitum and those fed an optimized diet was less pronounced (78% versus 89%). A reduced incidence of palpable tissue masses in the ad libitum-fed CD Sprague-Dawley rats versus the animals fed an optimized diet reflected inability to detect small masses in the obese ad libitum-fed animals. In contrast, the leaner Fischer-344 ad libitum-fed animals had an increased incidence of palpable tissue masses. After 52 weeks, 40 animals from each strain and feeding regimen were killed and subjected to complete necropsy and histopathological examination; the remainder of the survivors was examined at the completion of the study (104 weeks). Use of an optimized diet substantially reduced the incidences of endocrine-mediated tumors in both rat strains and delayed the onset of leukemia in Fischer-344 rats. These results indicate the need to further investigate the relationship of increased caloric intakes and endocrine-mediated or strain specific tumors and support FDA's and others' positions that use of diet optimization in chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity rodent bioassays has the potential to remarkably improve the scientific quality and relevance of these studies. It also identified that the small increases in cost associated with diet optimization are far exceeded by the advantages of increased survival of animals, reduced intercurrent disease and rumor burdens, and increased ease of histopathological processing and evaluation.","['Christian, M S', 'Hoberman, A M', 'Johnson, M D', 'Brown, W R', 'Bucci, T J']","['Christian MS', 'Hoberman AM', 'Johnson MD', 'Brown WR', 'Bucci TJ']","['GTC Argus Research Laboratories, Horsham, PA 19044, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Drug Chem Toxicol,Drug and chemical toxicology,7801723,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', '*Diet', 'Female', '*Growth', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rodent Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Sex Factors']",1998/04/08 00:00,1998/04/08 00:01,['1998/04/08 00:00'],"['1998/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/01480549809017854 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Chem Toxicol. 1998 Feb;21(1):97-117. doi: 10.3109/01480549809017854.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exact mechanisms by which mast cells might mediate an angiogenic response, however, are unclear and therefore, we have investigated the possible expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) in the human mast cell line HMC-1 and in human skin mast cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that mast cells constitutively express VEGF121, VEGF165, and VEGF189. After a prolonged stimulation of cells for 24 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the ionophore A23187, an additional transcript representing VEGF206 was detectable, as could be verified by sequence analysis. These results were confirmed at the protein level by Western blot analysis. When the amounts of VEGF released under unstimulated and stimulated conditions were compared, a significant increase was detectable after stimulation of cells. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) responded to the supernatant of unstimulated HMC-1 cells with a dose-dependent mitogenic effect, neutralizable up to 90% in the presence of a VEGF-specific monoclonal antibody. Flow cytometry and postembedding immunoelectron microscopy were used to detect VEGF in its cell-associated form. VEGF was exclusively detectable in the secretory granules of isolated human skin mast cells. These results show that both normal and leukemic human mast cells constitutively express bioactive VEGF. Furthermore, this study contributes to the understanding of the physiological role of the strongly heparin-binding VEGF isoforms, since these were found for the first time to be expressed in an activation-dependent manner in HMC-1 cells.","['Grutzkau, A', 'Kruger-Krasagakes, S', 'Baumeister, H', 'Schwarz, C', 'Kogel, H', 'Welker, P', 'Lippert, U', 'Henz, B M', 'Moller, A']","['Grutzkau A', 'Kruger-Krasagakes S', 'Baumeister H', 'Schwarz C', 'Kogel H', 'Welker P', 'Lippert U', 'Henz BM', 'Moller A']","['Department of Dermatology, Virchow Clinics, Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/analysis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphokines/analysis/drug effects/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Skin/cytology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.9.4.875 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1998 Apr;9(4):875-84. doi: 10.1091/mbc.9.4.875.,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,PMC25314,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate this issue further, colonies (n = 204) generated by mononuclear (MNC) or CD34+ CML cells were individually harvested, divided into two aliquots and analyzed both at the cytogenetic level to detect the Ph chromosome, and the molecular level to detect BCR-ABL transcripts. The mean (+/- s.d.) percentages of colonies analyzable by either SCK or RT-PCR were 74 +/- 16% and 86 +/- 16%, respectively. A significant percentage of colonies (67 +/- 19%) could be successfully analyzed by both SCK and RT-PCR. Although the majority of these colonies (97 +/- 5%) were Ph-positive and BCR-ABL-positive, a negligible percentage (4%) of progenitors were Ph-positive but BCR-ABL-negative. In order to test the influence of colony size on the outcome of molecular analysis, the efficiency of our RT-PCR assay in detecting BCR-ABL transcripts was investigated by means of experiments in which the number of cells used to start RNA extraction was serially reduced. These experiments showed that at least 150 cells were necessary to achieve a reproducible amplification of BCR-ABL transcripts. By correlating the size of harvested colonies with the outcome of molecular analysis, it was evident that BCR-ABL-negative but Ph-positive colonies represented false negative results occurring when a number of leukemic cells below the detection limit of our RT-PCR assay was analyzed. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that individual CML colonies grown in semisolid culture assays can be indifferently analyzed by SCK or RT-PCR, and support an extensive use of a carefully standardized RT-PCR assay to estimate the leukemic burden within samples which have been purged and selected in vitro.","['Savoldo, B', 'Sammarelli, G', 'Dotti, G', 'Garau, D', 'Regazzi, E', 'Cilloni, D', 'Tabilio, A', 'Rizzoli, V', 'Carlo-Stella, C']","['Savoldo B', 'Sammarelli G', 'Dotti G', 'Garau D', 'Regazzi E', 'Cilloni D', 'Tabilio A', 'Rizzoli V', 'Carlo-Stella C']","['Department of Hematology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyometry/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400942 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Mar;12(3):434-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400942.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason it is desirable to have a quick screening method identifying those with this type of hyperdiploidy. We therefore studied the bone marrow and/or blood cells of 278 children with ALL using double target fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on interphase. A combination of DNA probes (repetitive, centromere specific) was applied detecting chromosomes which are most frequently overrepresented in patients with hyperdiploidy (>50), at chromosomes 6, 10, 17 and 18. All patients showing hybridization signals differing from the normal signal distribution of two spots for each tested chromosome were analyzed cytogenetically as well. 102 children (102/278; 36.7%) were found to have a clone with aberrant FISH results. In 80 patients (80/278, 28.8%) the cytogenetic analysis detected a hyperdiploid karyotype >50 chromosomes, whereas the remaining patients (n=12) could be related to other ploidy subgroups, ie hyperdiploidy with 47-50 chromosomes, haploidy, triploidy/tetraploidy. Comparison of the FISH results with the measurements of the DNA content showed good agreement for 88.8% (208/234) of the investigated patients. The detected rate of 28.8% patients with a high hyperdiploid karyotype in our investigated cohort is comparable to the frequency of other studies. Only one patient was not identified as having a hyperdiploid karyotype with our combination of DNA probes. Our results indicate that FISH is a feasible and quick screening method for the detection of hyperdiploid karyotypes (>50 chromosomes) and other ploidy subgroups.","['Ritterbach, J', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Beck, J D', 'Schrappe, M', 'Janka-Schaub, G', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Harbott, J', 'Lampert, F']","['Ritterbach J', 'Hiddemann W', 'Beck JD', 'Schrappe M', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Ludwig WD', 'Harbott J', 'Lampert F']","[""Oncogenetic Laboratory, Children's Hospital, University of Giessen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'DNA Probes', 'Haploidy', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Infant', 'Interphase', 'Karyometry/methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/immunology/pathology']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400930 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Mar;12(3):427-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400930.,['0 (DNA Probes)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen previously untreated and 25 patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma were included. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. In the group of previously untreated patients the response rate was 53% and the median survival has not been reached at 59 months. For relapsed and refractory patients the response rate was 44% and the median survival 13 months. In the group of patients with truly refractory disease on prior chemotherapy a response rate of 47% was achieved, which appears superior to the results observed for VAD alone. The main toxicities were leukocytopenia WHO grade IV and infections grade III/IV with both toxicities being significantly more pronounced in pretreated patients. VECD appears to be an effective regimen for induction and salvage therapy in multiple myeloma. Based on the limited number of patients treated the results are comparable to those reported for VAD, with the advantage that the infusional application of vincristine and the anthracycline is omitted.","['Fossa, A', 'Muer, M', 'Kasper, C', 'Welt, A', 'Seeber, S', 'Nowrousian, M R']","['Fossa A', 'Muer M', 'Kasper C', 'Welt A', 'Seeber S', 'Nowrousian MR']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Cancer Research), West German Cancer Center, University of Essen.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400945 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Mar;12(3):422-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400945.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VAD protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three antibodies, WM85, CC9 and EB4 were produced, and were found to identify a 100-110 kDa antigen on bone marrow fibroblasts. Molecular cloning revealed the molecule to be MUC18 (CD146), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, previously described as a marker of metastatic melanoma. In addition to the expected expression on melanoma cell lines and endothelial cells, a number of human leukemic cell lines were found to express MUC18, including all six T leukemia lines tested, one of five B lineage lines and one of four myeloid lines. Analysis of bone marrow samples from patients revealed positivity in 20% of B lineage ALL (n = 20), one of three T-ALL, 15% of AML (n = 13) and 43% of various B lymphoproliferative disorders (n = 7). No apparent reactivity was observed with mononuclear cells from normal peripheral blood or bone marrow, including candidate hemopoietic stem cells characterized by their expression of the CD34 antigen. However, positive selection of bone marrow mononuclear cells labeled with MUC18 antibody revealed a rare subpopulation (<1%) containing more than 90% of the stromal precursors identified in fibroblast colony-forming assays.

Because physiological stress often causes hormone-free GC receptor activation, we have investigated if stress-induced apoptosis of lymphoid cells is also mediated by the activation of the GC receptor pathway. In S49 T lymphoma cells, heat shock and deprivation of growth factors or nutrients caused nuclear translocation and loss of agonist binding capacity of GC receptors, similar to that in cells incubated with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX). In variant S49 H.2 cells, cross-resistance to DEX, temperature shocks and growth factor deprivation were associated with a higher threshold for hormone-dependent and -independent receptor activation in situ and with impaired in vitro activation of cytosolic receptors. Cross-resistance to DEX, low serum and heat shock was abrogated, however, by pharmacological sensitization of GC receptor activation with the drug meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG). Sensitive S49 cells and resistant variants did not differ in the expression levels of the apoptosis-regulating genes bax, bad, bcl-X and bcl-2, the status of the p53 gene nor in a different requirement for the growth factors II-2, IL-4 or IL-9.

One acute undifferentiated leukemia had t(4;12)(q12;p13) as the sole anomaly. The second case, an acute myeloid leukemia (AML), displayed complex abnormalities involving, among others, chromosomes 9 and 12. The third case, also an AML, had an insertion of the distal part of ETV6 into chromosome arm 11q and into multiple ring chromosomes, which also contained chromosome 11 material, resulting in an amplification of a possible fusion gene. The fusion partners in these cases remain to be identified. Thirty-one additional breakpoints on 12p could be characterized in detail. The majority of these breaks were shown to result in interchromosomal rearrangements, possibly indicating the location of hitherto unrecognized genes of importance in the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies. The FISH analyses disclosed terminal or interstitial 12p deletions in 18 cases. Seven myeloid malignancies showed deletions restricted to a region, including ETV6 and CDKN1B, which has been reported to be frequently lost in leukemias. In four cases, the deletions involved both these genes, whereas two AML displayed loss of CDKN1B but not ETV6, supporting previously reported findings indicating a region of deletion not including this gene.

To address this issue we employed several complementary strategies including: serum free cloning of CD34+ cells, RT-PCR, FACS analysis, and mRNA perturbation with oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). In a serum-free culture model, both INS and IGF-I enhanced survival of CD34+ cells, but neither of these growth factors stimulated their proliferation. The influence of INS and IGF-I on erythroid colony development was dependent on a combination of growth factors used for stimulating BFU-E growth. When BFU-E growth was optimally stimulated with erythropoietin (EpO) + kit ligand (KL) the large erythroid colonies developed normally even in the absence of INS or IGF-I. However, the addition of both of these growth factors slightly enhanced colony size. On the other hand, if erythroid colonies were stimulated suboptimally with EpO + IL-3 only, INS or IGF-I increased the number of small erythroid bursts by approximately 30%. Both INS and IGF-I activated signal transduction in maturing human erythropoietic cells as determined by phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) protein. We also found by RT-PCR that mRNA coding for INS-R is expressed in FACS sorted CD34+, c-kit-R+ marrow cells, and in cells isolated from BFU-E and CFU-GM colonies. Expression of INS-R protein on these cells was subsequently confirmed by cytofluorometry. In contrast, the receptor for insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-IR) was not detected on CD34+ cells, and was first easily detectable on more differentiated cells derived from day 6 BFU-E and CFU-GM colonies. We conclude that INS and IGF-I may be survival factors for human CD34+ cells, but are not required during early erythropoiesis. In contrast, both growth factors may play some role at the final stages of erythroid maturation.","['Ratajczak, J', 'Zhang, Q', 'Pertusini, E', 'Wojczyk, B S', 'Wasik, M A', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Ratajczak J', 'Zhang Q', 'Pertusini E', 'Wojczyk BS', 'Wasik MA', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cricetinae', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*biosynthesis', 'Receptor, Insulin/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transfection']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400927 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Mar;12(3):371-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400927.,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A p100 subunit of NF-kappaB has IkappaB-like properties by sequestering the p65 transactivating subunit in the cytosol of cells. In transient transfection assays we demonstrated that p100 has an inhibitory effect on the NF-kappaB-dependent IL-6 promoter activity. In view of this finding, we studied the regulation of the p100 subunit in human monocytes in response to LPS, the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and lymphokines. The results demonstrate that LPS, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha induce p100 expression at mRNA and protein level while IFN-gamma, IL-3 and IL-4/IL-10 have no effect. The induction of p100 expression was shown to be mediated by a two-fold increase in the p100 transcription rate and a two-fold increase in p100 mRNA stability. Furthermore the p100 mediated upregulation was dependent on a tyrosine kinase dependent pathway rather than the protein kinase C pathway. NF-kappaB is a complex of either p50 homodimers or a p50/p65 heterodimer. The latter is known to strongly autoregulate p100 transcription. We therefore examined the composition of NF-kappaB induced by LPS vs the different lymphokines. LPS-induced NF-kappaB showed a distinct p65 supershift whereas the composition of NF-kappaB induced by different lymphokines did not show a change in p65. We conclude that the p100 subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappaB is induced by different inflammatory mediators while lymphokines fail to induce p100 expression which may be caused by the induction of NF-kappaB predominantly consisting of p50 homodimers.","['de Wit, H', 'Dokter, W H', 'Koopmans, S B', 'Lummen, C', 'van der Leij, M', 'Smit, J W', 'Vellenga, E']","['de Wit H', 'Dokter WH', 'Koopmans SB', 'Lummen C', 'van der Leij M', 'Smit JW', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-10/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/*biosynthesis', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400950 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Mar;12(3):363-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400950.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The alveolar proteinosis of beta c -/- mice was not altered in GM-CSF transgenic beta c -/- mice. Levels of GM-CSF mRNA in transgenic GM-CSF beta c -/- were elevated but lower than in transgenic beta +/+ mice and the higher serum GM-CSF levels were traced in part to the longer serum half-life of GM-CSF in beta c -/- than in beta c +/+ mice although urinary loss of GM-CSF was higher in beta c -/- than in +/+ mice. The data indicate that the transgenic phenotype was due to stimulation by GM-CSF and not an insertional effect, that low-affinity receptors are not capable of initiating tissue pathology even in the presence of excess GM-CSF levels and that autocrine production of GM-CSF by GM-CSF-responsive cells also fails to induce changes in these cells.

Etoposide clearance, time that etoposide concentrations exceeded 10 microM, etoposide or etoposide catechol area-under-the-plasma-concentration vs time curve (AUC), serum albumin, and average methotrexate concentration did not differ significantly between the two groups; thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity tended to be lower in the eight children who did vs the 23 matched control children who did not develop AML (P=0.16). Further regression analyses likewise indicated that lower TPMT activity tended to be associated with shorter onset of secondary AML (P=0.11); it also tended to be lower among the eight index cases compared to the entire unmatched cohort of 105 identically treated children with ALL (P=0.10).

We immunophenotyped leukemia cells from 19 adult de novo AML patients with t(11q23) by multiparameter flow cytometry.

In particular, patients with t(9;11) survived longer than those with other t(11q23) (median not reached vs 7.6 months; P = 0.048), but antigen expression did not differ in the two groups. Thus frequencies of lymphoid antigen expression are similar in AML with t(11q23) and in other FAB M4 and M5 cases, treatment outcome does not differ in t(11q23) cases with and without lymphoid antigen expression, and better outcome of patients with t(9;11) compared to other t(11q23) does not correlate with differences in antigen expression.

Using this assay on bone marrow RNA samples from 12 patients with acute leukaemia, we observed a 4.4-fold mean increase in the level of DNA methyltransferase mRNA compared with normal bone marrow.

This biological function depends primarily on tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular targets that initiate several transduction cascades. These events return to their basal levels upon activation of specific phosphatases. We analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation events in response to FL, in human cell lines of different hematopoietic origins that express endogenous FLT3, namely the myelomonocytic, monocytic, pre-B and pro-B lineages. This study aimed at determining (1) the identity of FLT3 downstream substrates in physiologically relevant cells and (2) distinct substrate involvement in myeloid or early B cells. The two prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are p52SHC and p115CBL in myeloid cell lines and p52SHC and an uncharacterized p115 in early B cell lines. Following FL stimulation, a concomitant increase in both CBL phosphorylation and complex formation with p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase is observed. In contrast, the GRB2/CBL association observed in unstimulated cells is not modified after stimulation, and SHC is never detected in anti-CBL immunoprecipitates. FL-inducible binding of CBL to the CRKII adaptor molecule is also demonstrated. This study presents a picture of the signaling events triggered by activation of endogenous FLT3 receptor in human hematopoietic cells, including the existence of a B cell-specific FLT3 substrate.","['Lavagna-Sevenier, C', 'Marchetto, S', 'Birnbaum, D', 'Rosnet, O']","['Lavagna-Sevenier C', 'Marchetto S', 'Birnbaum D', 'Rosnet O']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, INSERM U119, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/analysis', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', '*Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3', 'src Homology Domains']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400921 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Mar;12(3):301-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400921.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (P11 (CBL))', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum TPO levels were measured by a newly developed and sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In all courses, serum TPO levels changed reciprocally with the platelet counts. When platelets were transfused into patients near the time of platelet nadir, the TPO levels dropped temporarily, while platelet counts temporarily increased. In addition, platelets obtained after transfusion in a thrombocytopenic patient showed lower binding to biotinylated TPO than donor platelets prior to the transfusion. The finding indicated that the TPO receptors were saturated with endogenous TPO of the patient with a high serum TPO level. These results suggest that the platelet mass directly regulates serum TPO levels by receptor-mediated absorption and is one of the major regulators of serum TPO levels in humans.","['Shinjo, K', 'Takeshita, A', 'Nakamura, S', 'Naitoh, K', 'Yanagi, M', 'Tobita, T', 'Ohnishi, K', 'Ohno, R']","['Shinjo K', 'Takeshita A', 'Nakamura S', 'Naitoh K', 'Yanagi M', 'Tobita T', 'Ohnishi K', 'Ohno R']","['Department of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', '*Platelet Count', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Thrombocytopenia/*blood/*chemically induced/therapy', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400946 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Mar;12(3):295-300. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400946.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",['Leukemia. 1998 Oct;12(10):1653-4.

Italian Cooperative Group on ET.,289-94,"The efficacy of alfa-interferon (alfa-IFN) in essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients has been reported by several authors. The aim of this study is to assess the magnitude of the effect of alfa-IFN on the neoplastic clone. As of December 1993, 11 ET patients received alfa-IFN at a dose of 3-6 MU/s.c./day for 6 months. Ten of 11 obtained complete hematological remission (CHR) and one achieved partial hematological remission. Megakaryocyte concentration was reduced in six cases. The spleen,which was enlarged in four patients, decreased in size in two patients. Seven of eight patients who were symptomatic at diagnosis obtained resolution of symptoms. In order to obtain indications about the structural modifications induced by alfa-IFN in ET megakaryocytes (Mks), Fourier-transform infra-red microspectroscopy analysis performed on 10 single Mks of each patient, was done in seven of 11 patients; the analysis showed a reduction of A1/A2 ratios (A1 integrated area of the band at 1080 cm(-1) due to the nucleic acids absorption; A2 integrated area of the band at 1540 cm(-1) due to proteic components absorption) in five cases, and in three of these five patients A1/A2 ratios achieved normal values. After alfa-IFN treatment we did not observe any change in the methylation pattern of DNA from the granulocyte fraction. Our results confirm the efficacy of alfa-IFN in ET patients, and the decrease of A1/A2 ratios in several patients is a demonstration of the depth of the effect of alfa-IFN on the neoplastic clone. The results of clonality studies showed the persistence of clonal hematopoiesis. Whether higher alfa-IFN dose and/or more prolonged alfa-IFN therapy may allow a restoration of polyclonal hematopoiesis remains to be determined and should be explored in future clinical trials.","['Sacchi, S', 'Gugliotta, L', 'Papineschi, F', 'Liberati, A M', 'Rupoli, S', 'Delfini, C', 'Ruggeri, M', 'Cavanna, L', 'Bucalossi, A', 'Benedetti, E', 'Ferrandina, C', 'Vinci, G', 'Morselli, M', 'Torelli, G']","['Sacchi S', 'Gugliotta L', 'Papineschi F', 'Liberati AM', 'Rupoli S', 'Delfini C', 'Ruggeri M', 'Cavanna L', 'Bucalossi A', 'Benedetti E', 'Ferrandina C', 'Vinci G', 'Morselli M', 'Torelli G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Radiologiche ed Oncologiche, Universita di Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'DNA/blood', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphoglycerate Kinase/genetics', 'Platelet Count', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Splenomegaly/therapy', 'Thrombocytosis/blood/*therapy', 'X Chromosome']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400931 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Mar;12(3):289-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400931.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.2.3 (Phosphoglycerate Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unknown whether cancer in infancy, which is biologically and clinically different from cancer in older children, also increased. METHODS: To evaluate changes in cancer incidence in infants in the U.S. age < 1 year, data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and the U.S. Bureau of the Census were used to construct age specific, population-based cancer incidence rates. RESULTS: Overall, the annual cancer rate in infants increased from 189 cases per million infants between 1979-1981 to 220 between 1989-1991. At both timepoints, female infants had higher cancer rates than male infants. Although the rates for female infants remained stable at 223 between 1979-1981 versus 236 between 1989-1991, rates for male infants increased from 158 to 205 during the same timepoints. Male infants had increased rates of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (P < 0.05), neuroblastoma, and retinoblastoma; female infants had increased rates of teratomas (P < 0.01) and hepatoblastomas. Between 1979-1981, the three most common types of cancer in infants were neuroblastoma, leukemia, and renal tumors (27%, 15%, and 14%, respectively), and were neuroblastoma, CNS tumors, and leukemia between 1989-1991 (27%, 15%, and 13%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the rate of certain types of cancer in infants in the U.S. is increasing. Studies of both genetic and environmental factors are needed to explain these increased rates and the changing distribution of cancer in the first year of life.","['Kenney, L B', 'Miller, B A', 'Ries, L A', 'Nicholson, H S', 'Byrne, J', 'Reaman, G H']","['Kenney LB', 'Miller BA', 'Ries LA', 'Nicholson HS', 'Byrne J', 'Reaman GH']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 06155, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Sex Distribution', 'United States/epidemiology']",1998/04/07 02:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/04/07 02:03'],"['1998/04/07 02:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/04/07 02:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980401)82:7<1396::AID-CNCR25>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19980401)82:7<1396::aid-cncr25>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Apr 1;82(7):1396-400. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19980401)82:7<1396::aid-cncr25>3.0.co;2-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite substantial improvements in therapy, cases in which relapse occurs are still more common than newly diagnosed cases of many other childhood cancers. The survival of patients who relapse despite improved therapy continues to be of interest. METHODS: One thousand one hundred forty-four relapses and 28 second malignant neoplasms were identified among the 3712 eligible patients enrolled on Children's Cancer Group trials between 1983 and 1989. The details of treatment after relapse were not accessible. Subsequent secondary event free survival and overall survival were examined by the site of and time to initial relapse. A variety of potential prognostic factors were examined employing the log rank statistic and Wilcoxon regression model. RESULTS: Rates of 6-year survival (+/- standard error) after isolated bone marrow, isolated central nervous system (CNS), and isolated testis relapse were 20%+/-2%, 48%+/-4%, and 70%+/-5%, respectively. Rates of survival after isolated bone marrow relapse at 0-17 months, 18-35 months, and after 36 months were 6%+/-2%, 11%+/-2%, and 43%+/-4%, respectively. Rates of survival after isolated CNS relapse at 0-17 months, 18-35 months, and after 36 months were 33%+/-4%, 59%+/-5%, and 72%+/-8%, respectively. Rates of survival after isolated testis relapse at 0-17 months, 18-35 months, and after 36 months were 52%+/-11%, 57%+/-10%, and 81%+/-5%, respectively. Rates of survival after combined bone marrow and CNS or testis relapse at 0-17 months, 18-35 months, and after 36 months were 9%+/-5%, 11%+/-6%, and 49%+/-7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial survival at 6 years is evident among several subsets of this unselected group of heterogeneously treated children, namely, those with isolated or combined bone marrow relapse after 36 months and those with isolated extramedullary relapse at any time.

Adjuvant chemotherapy is used routinely based on data from randomized trials. Although a percentage of children with locally advanced or metastatic tumors remain curable, few data exist regarding the tumor's natural history or response and survival in adults. METHODS: This Phase II study evaluated doxorubicin, dacarbazine, ifosfamide, and mesna (MAID) in adults with inoperable or metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or osteosarcoma. RESULTS: Between 1987-1991, 81 patients were entered; 69 patients were eligible. One patient died of neutropenic infection. Ten patients (14%) responded completely and 34 patients (49%) had a complete or partial response. Response rates were significantly higher for patients with Ewing's sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma than for those with osteosarcoma (77%, 64%, and 26%, respectively; P < 0.005). Although there were no significant differences in progression free survival by histology, survival for patients with Ewing's sarcoma was significantly longer than for patients with osteosarcoma (P = 0.004.) At the time of last follow-up, 7 patients (10%) were alive without progression: 3 with Ewing's sarcoma, 1 with osteosarcoma, and 3 with rhabdomyosarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: MAID chemotherapy is an active regimen in adults with advanced or metastatic Ewing's sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.

We thus proposed that CNP can control vascular tone and growth as an endothelium-derived relaxing peptide. We also revealed the marked elevation of plasma CNP concentration in patients with septic shock, in which TNF alpha plays a significant part. As the interaction between endothelial cells (EC) and monocytes-macrophages plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, we investigated the effect of coculture of EC and macrophages on endothelial production of CNP. We used a human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, which differentiates into macrophages when treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The coculture of EC and THP-1-derived macrophages enhanced CNP secretion by more than 10-fold compared with the single culture of EC or the coculture of EC and THP-1 without phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment. Prevention of direct contact between EC and THP-1-derived macrophages did not attenuate the increase in CNP secretion. Northern blotting revealed the augmentation of CNP messenger RNA expression in EC in the coculture. We detected TNF alpha in the conditioned medium from the coculture of EC and THP-1-derived macrophages. Furthermore, anti-TNF alpha antibody inhibited the stimulation of CNP secretion in the coculture. CNP at a concentration of 1 nM did not stimulate cGMP production in EC or THP-1-derived macrophages, but it elevated cGMP production significantly in vascular smooth muscle cells. These results indicate that endothelial production of CNP is stimulated mainly by TNF alpha released from THP-1-derived macrophages in the coculture. Endothelial CNP at the enhanced level may be one of the vascular mediators to regulate local vascular tone and growth through cGMP production by vascular smooth muscle cells, suggesting the potential significance of endothelial CNP in atherosclerosis.","['Suga, S I', 'Itoh, H', 'Komatsu, Y', 'Ishida, H', 'Igaki, T', 'Yamashita, J', 'Doi, K', 'Chun, T H', 'Yoshimasa, T', 'Tanaka, I', 'Nakao, K']","['Suga SI', 'Itoh H', 'Komatsu Y', 'Ishida H', 'Igaki T', 'Yamashita J', 'Doi K', 'Chun TH', 'Yoshimasa T', 'Tanaka I', 'Nakao K']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Animals', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/pharmacology', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cattle', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cyclic GMP/biosynthesis', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Natriuretic Peptide, C-Type', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.139.4.5918 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1998 Apr;139(4):1920-6. doi: 10.1210/endo.139.4.5918.,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '127869-51-6 (Natriuretic Peptide, C-Type)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) belongs to a gp130 pleiotropic family of growth factors that has recently been shown to enhance the survival of rat testicular gonocytes and Sertoli cells. In this study, we show the expression of gp130 and LIF messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the somatic (the Sertoli and Leydig cells) and specific germ cells (spermatogonia, pachytene, round, and elongated spermatids) of rodent testis, suggestive of cell-specific LIF-mediated functions. LIF receptor mRNA was demonstrated in rat somatic cells, rat elongating spermatids, and all of the mouse germ cells. In addition, we characterized the effects of LIF on the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-3 and STAT-1, c-fos gene expression, and activator protein-1 regulation in primary rat Sertoli cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blot analysis demonstrated that LIF translocates STAT-3 (and to a lesser extent STAT-1) transcription factor(s) to the nucleus within 2 min of exposure in a tyrosine but not serine/threonine phosphorylation-dependent pathway. Quantitative solution hybridization analysis revealed a transient increase in c-fos mRNA levels by 20-fold following 30-45 min of LIF treatment, an effect that was inhibited by the tyrosine, as well as serine/threonine kinase inhibitors, genistein, and H7. Subsequently, LIF treatment of the Sertoli cells increased nuclear activator protein-1 binding proteins at 2 h after its addition, an effect that was also sensitive to genistein and H7 pretreatments. In contrast, LIF treatment of primary rat germ cells did not alter c-fos mRNA levels. Species specificity in the expression of LIF receptor as well as ligand binding may play a role in LIF signaling in these germ cells. Thus, using a primary Sertoli cell model, we demonstrated that the testicular LIF signaling pathway is contingent on the phosphorylation of latent transcription factors. Our data are consistent with LIF-mediated signaling events involving both somatic and germ cells during spermatogenesis.","['Jenab, S', 'Morris, P L']","['Jenab S', 'Morris PL']","['Population Council, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genes, fos/*genetics', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytokine/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Sertoli Cells/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spermatozoa/metabolism', 'Testis/*chemistry', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.139.4.5871 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1998 Apr;139(4):1883-90. doi: 10.1210/endo.139.4.5871.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, rat)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",,,,,,"['R01 HD029428/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-29428/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD-16149/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

To date, eight different first exons have been reported in human aromatase, namely I.1., I.2, I.3. I.4, I.5, PII, 2a, and 1f. Recently, we have found a new putative exon I in a RACE-generated library of THP-1 cells and have conducted studies to characterize this new exon I. We confirmed that the constructs containing -1552/+17 or less flanking sequence of this exon function as a promoter in THP-1 cells, JEG-3 cells and osteoblast-like cells obtained from a human fetus. Results of transfection assays using a series of deletion constructs and mutation constructs indicate that a 1-bp mismatch of the consensus TATA-like box (TTTAAT) and the consensus sequence of the initiator site, which is located 45 bp downstream of the putative TATA box, were functioning cooperatively as a core promoter. The putative transcription site was confirmed by the results of RT-PCR southern blot analysis. We examined the regulation and the expression of this exon, I.6, in several human cells and tissues by RT-PCR Southern blot analysis. THP-1 cells (mononuclear leukemic origin) and JEG-3 cells (choriocarcinoma origin) expressed exon I.6 in serum-free media. The level of expression was increased by serum and phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA) in both cell lines. Adipose stromal cells also expressed exon I.6 in the presence of PMA. In fetal osteoblasts, the expression of exon I.6 was increased most effectively by serum and less so by dexamethasone (DEX) + IL-1beta and DEX + IL-11, whereas induction by serum was suppressed by the addition of DEX. The level of expression was low in granulosa cells in culture and did not change with forskolin. On the other hand, dibutyryl cAMP suppressed PMA-stimulated expression of exon I.6 in THP-1 cells and adipose stromal cells. This result supports the hypothesis that the expression of exon I.6 is regulated mainly via an AP-1 binding site that is found upstream of the initiator site of the promoter region. Expression of exon I.6-specific transcripts was examined in several human tissues. Testis and bone obtained from normal adults expressed exon I.6. Testicular tumor and hepatic carcinoma expressed high levels of exon I.6, whereas granulosa cell tumor did not. Fetal liver and bone also showed a significant level of exon I.6 expression, but not so much as testicular tumor and hepatic tumor. Several splicing variants of exon I.6 were detected especially in THP-1 and JEG-3 cells, and to a lesser extent in primary cultures and tissue samples. These variants were identified as an unspliced form, a form spliced at the end of exon I.4, a form spliced at the end of exon I.3 (truncated) and a form spliced 220 bp downstream of the 3' end of exon I.6. The last variant revealed a new splicing site. Because most of the splicing variants contain the sequence specific for exon I.3, RT-PCR specific for exon I.3 can coamplify these splicing variants of exon I.6 transcripts. These results suggests that it is necessary to examine the expression of I.6 in tissues that are known to express exon I.3 such as breast adipose tissue, in which promoter usage of exon I of the aromatase gene switches from exon I.4 to I.3 in the course of malignant transformation.","['Shozu, M', 'Zhao, Y', 'Bulun, S E', 'Simpson, E R']","['Shozu M', 'Zhao Y', 'Bulun SE', 'Simpson ER']","['Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences, and Department of Obstetrics/Gynecology, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9051, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Aromatase/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Choriocarcinoma', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Exons', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Osteoblasts', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.139.4.5878 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1998 Apr;139(4):1610-7. doi: 10.1210/endo.139.4.5878.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aromatase)']",,,,,,['5-R37-AG08174/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The size and properties of this enzyme are indistinguishable from the RING3 kinase that has a very high activity in leukocytes of patients with leukemia.

Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein occurred because of increased protein stability and enhanced gene expression. In addition, daunomycin induced the p53 promoter through the binding of p50/p65 NF-kappaB heterodimers to the kappaB site in the p53 promoter. Under our conditions, the free radical scavengers NAC and PDTC were not able to block NF-kappaB activation or p53 induction, indicating that reactive oxygen intermediates were not involved in the cellular response to daunomycin stimulation. Overexpression of a stable unresponsive IkappaBalpha mutant in HCT116 cells resulted in a complete inhibition of the NF-kappaB activation but only a partial impairment of the p53 protein accumulation induced by daunomycin.

Such cells differentiate exclusively into monocytes/macrophages in response to this ligand. Since 1,25(OH)2D3 transduces its hormone signal through the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR), a ligand-modulated transcription factor and member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, we sought to identify direct VDR target genes induced during this differentiation process. To do so, we applied a modified differential screen with a nascent-RNA purification strategy using biases for immediate-early-response genes induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in the myelomonocytic cell line U937. Using this screen, we had previously identified p21Waf1/Cip1 as a gene transcriptionally induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 and demonstrated that this induction facilitates the differentiation of U937 cells into monocytes/macrophages (24). Here, we describe in detail our differential screen strategy and the identification and isolation of 20 1,25(OH)2D3-inducible genes or unknown cDNAs by means of this screen. One gene newly identified as a target of VDR regulation in myeloid cells is the homeobox HoxA10 gene. HoxA10 protein may act as a general regulator of cell growth, since overexpression of HoxA10 facilitated the differentiation of U937 cells into monocytes/macrophages independent of 1,25(OH)2D3 and acted to strongly inhibit the growth of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 by arresting these cells in G1.","['Rots, N Y', 'Liu, M', 'Anderson, E C', 'Freedman, L P']","['Rots NY', 'Liu M', 'Anderson EC', 'Freedman LP']","['Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Female', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.4.1911 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Apr;18(4):1911-8. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.4.1911.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,"['DK-52621/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-45460/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC121420,,,,,,,,

In a colony-formation assay these sublines were 9- and 22-fold more resistant compared to L1210/0, respectively. Cisplatin-induced DNA modification was studied at the cellular level by immunocytochemistry with antiserum NKI-A59 raised against cisplatin-treated DNA. Levels of nuclear staining immediately after a 1-h treatment were similar to those seen after a 24-h post-incubation in drug-free medium. Clear differences in DNA platination were found between the cell lines: immediately after exposure, L1210/2 and L1210/5 showed only 32 and 14%, respectively, of the nuclear staining observed in L1210/0, and 48 and 13% after 24 h. In these experiments, adduct-specific nuclear staining was quantified as the area under the adduct versus concentration curves (AUC). The formation and repair in these cell lines of the bifunctional adducts cis-Pt(NH3)2d(pGpG) (Pt-GG), cis-Pt(NH3)2d(pApG) (Pt-AG) and cis-Pt(NH3)2(dGMP)2 (G-Pt-G) were studied with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No relation between repair and resistance was observed. The results suggest that differences in induced DNA platination levels, rather than in repair, are responsible--at least in part--for the differences in cisplatin resistance. A mechanism such as an increased tolerance of the resistant cells to plantinum-DNA damage may also be involved.","['Blommaert, F A', 'Floot, B G', 'van Dijk-Knijnenburg, H C', 'Berends, F', 'Baan, R A', 'Schornagel, J H', 'den Engelse, L', 'Fichtinger-Schepman, A M']","['Blommaert FA', 'Floot BG', 'van Dijk-Knijnenburg HC', 'Berends F', 'Baan RA', 'Schornagel JH', 'den Engelse L', 'Fichtinger-Schepman AM']","['Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The Netherlands Cancer Institute (Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Huis), Amsterdam, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bicarbonates/chemistry', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA Adducts/*metabolism', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Thiourea/chemistry']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279797001087 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(97)00108-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1998 Jan 30;108(3):209-25. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(97)00108-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bicarbonates)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (cisplatin-DNA adduct)', '45JP4345C9 (ammonium bicarbonate)', 'GYV9AM2QAG (Thiourea)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases such as AIDS and viral hepatitis, are induced by viral infection via blood. The main causative agents of blood-born viral infection are hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T cell leukemia virus type1 (HTLV1), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human parvovirus B19. They play the main role in viral hospital infections. The risk of them being transmitted by the transfusion of screened blood is very low, but it is always possible that infection may occur in a window period even after extensive blood screening tests. EBV has been recognized as a less serious infectious agent than CMV. Nowadays, biotechnology has revealed the broad spectrum of EBV related diseases as chronic active EBV infection, compromised lymphoma, gastric carcinoma and other lymphoproliferative disorders. There would be some immunocompromised cases needed monitoring after transfusion/transplantation as same as CMV infection. Double infection or co-infection of EBV and CMV are shown to be occasional. The most important tasks for risk control of hospital acquired infectious diseases are to prevent second drug related AIDS and prion infection due to the transplantation of dura mata derived from patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and to prevent of needle stick infections. Therefore it is necessary to establish a network communication between clinical laboratories, institutes and public health organizations for more rapid and adequate care with rapid diagnosis by molecular analysis.","['Nakamura, Y']",['Nakamura Y'],"['Department of Clinical Pathology, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

Genetics studies have shown that the SI locus encodes the Steel factor (SF), which is the ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit, the product of the W locus. SF is synthesized in membrane-bound form and can be processed to produce a soluble form. Cell-cell interaction is important in the production of normal blood cells in vivo and in vitro and in the cellular expansion of leukemic cells. We discuss here how SF decreases the requirements in cell interaction for blast colony formation in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and the presence of membrane-bound SF possibly contributes to the density-dependent growth of the AML blasts. We explain that SF is mainly a survival factor for hematopoietic cells, of little proliferative effect, which maintains CD34+ hematopoietic cells in an undifferentiated state. These properties would potentially allow the maintenance of hematopoietic cells in culture for the purpose of marrow purging or gene therapy. The activation of the c-kit signal transduction pathway may play a significant role in the development of many types of non-hematological malignancies by disrupting normal cell-cell interactions and allowing the growth of cancer cell populations. In summary, the properties of the SF indicate it has a role for survival signals during the process of normal differentiation, AML proliferation and in the maintenance of many c-kit+ tumors.","['Caceres-Cortes, J R']",['Caceres-Cortes JR'],"['Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal, Laboratoire de Hematopoiese et Leucemie, Quebec, Canada.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', '*Stem Cell Factor/biosynthesis/genetics']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 1997 Nov-Dec;49(6):507-14.,"['0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,El factor Steel.,62,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety seven patients with de novo AL were studied. Cell surface antigens were investigated with monoclonal antibodies directed to: B lymphoid (CD10, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22); T lymphoid (CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7); and myeloid (CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD41) cell lineages. Maturation cell-associated antigens (CD34, HLA-DR and TdT) were also studied. RESULTS: Twelve patients unclassified by cytomorphology could be classified by immunophenotype. Using cytomorphologic, cytochemical and immunophenotypic data, 54 cases corresponded to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 43 were acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). In All there were 63% B lineage, 15% T, 7% T/B, 6% undifferentiated and 9% mixed-lineage (coexpression of two or more myeloid-associated antigens). In AML, myeloid immunophenotype was observed in 86% undifferentiated in 2%, and mixed-lineage in 12% (coexpression of two or more lymphoid-associated antigens). In addition, 26% of ALL cases and 12% of AML cases expressed a single myeloid and lymphoid antigen respectively. The most common aberrant antigens in ALL and AML were CD13 and CD7 respectively. The highest frequency of CD34 antigen expression (90%) was detected in patients with AMLL. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis allowed to: a) establish diagnosis in cytomorphologically unclassified cases; b) identify AMLL with a frequency similar to that reported in other series; and c) confirm the heterogeneity of AL.","['Piedras, J', 'Lopez-Karpovitch, X', 'Cardenas, M R']","['Piedras J', 'Lopez-Karpovitch X', 'Cardenas MR']","['Departamento de Hematologia-Oncologia, Laboratorio de Biologia Celular, Instituto Nacional de la Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Vasco de Quiroga, Mexico, D.F.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology', 'Middle Aged']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 1997 Nov-Dec;49(6):457-64.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,Inmunofenotipos celulares en 97 adultos con leucemia aguda.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ig alpha/Ig beta heterodimers may associate with the mu/surrogate light chains (psi LC) complex and with membrane Immunoglobulins on the surface of pre-B and B cells, respectively. They play a crucial role in the signal transduction that follows pre-B and B cell receptor cross-linking. Previous works have shown that mb-1 and B29 transcripts are expressed in normal mouse and human pro-B cells. However, little is known about the expression of Ig alpha and Ig beta molecules in pro-B cells. To address this issue we first analysed the expression of the Ig alpha and Ig beta molecules in the RS4; 11 and Nalm16 human pro-B cell lines using specific monoclonal antibodies. We found that both cell lines expressed Ig alpha and Ig beta but this expression was limited to the cytoplasm compartment. Three forms (44, 40 and 36 kDa) of the Ig alpha molecule and a single form (36 kDa) of the Ig beta molecule were detected in these lines. The heterogeneity of the Ig alpha molecule was partly related to the presence of a truncated Ig alpha protein which is likely the product of a short mb-1 transcript expressed in these cell lines. This short transcript is generated by alternative splicing of the mb1 mRNA with loss of exon 2. Ig alpha heterogeneity was also related to the expression of different glycosylated forms of the Ig alpha molecule. Only a minor fraction of the Ig alpha and Ig beta molecules associate with each other to form Ig alpha/Ig beta heterodimers and Ig beta homodimers. In these pro-B cell lines Ig alpha and Ig beta were found to associate with the lyn tyrosine kinase, suggesting that they may play some functional role at this B cell differentiation stage. Transfection of muHC gene in the Nalm16 cells results in the assembly of the pre-B receptor and in its expression on the cell surface. The level of surface expression of the pre-B receptor was found to correlate with the level of muHC and psi LC synthesis and with the level of association of the different components of the pre-B receptor with each other. Analysis of the 697 and Nalm6 pre-B cells and of the Ramos B cells indicated that heterogeneity of Ig alpha and Ig beta increases as a function of B cell differentiation.","['Lassoued, K', 'Guglielmi, P', 'Benlagha, K']","['Lassoued K', 'Guglielmi P', 'Benlagha K']","[""Service d'immuno-hematologie, CNRS, Montpellier.""]",['fre'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Bull Acad Natl Med,Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine,7503383,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*biosynthesis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Acad Natl Med. 1997 Oct;181(7):1465-75.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,Analyse de l'expression des molecules Ig alpha et Ig beta dans les lignees leucemiques pro-B humaines.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified four mutations of p53 gene in BLV-infected cattle with lymphosarcoma and demonstrated clearly the existence of two functionally distinct groups of mutants: (i) the mutant forms with substitutions at codons 241 and 242, which were mapped within an evolutionally conserved region and corresponded to the human ""hot-spot"" mutations, had completely lost the capacities for transactivation and growth suppression and gained transdominant repression activity in p53-null SAOS-2 cells; and (ii) the mutations at codons 206 and 207 were located outside the evolutionally conserved regions. These mutants partially retained the capacity for transactivation and growth suppression and failed to inhibit the transactivation activity of coexpressed wild-type p53, instead showing an enhancement of this activity. In addition, protein analysis using an antibody specific for the mutant form revealed that the mutations at codons 206 and 242 induced a ""mutant"" conformation of the bovine p53 proteins. Collectively, these results show that mutations of p53 gene in BLV-infected cattle with lymphosarcoma can potentially alter its physiological function and may play an important role in BLV-induced leukemogenesis.

BLV transcription is regulated by cellular transcription factors and the virally encoded oncoprotein Tax. In this report, we investigated the functional role of the putative NF-kappa B binding site recently identified in the BLV promoter. Our studies indicate that the kappa B binding motif acts as a functional enhancer in the presence of the cellular NF-kappa B proteins. Furthermore, the kappa B site together with a single 21-bp repeat confers strong activation of BLV transcription in the presence the NF-kappa B proteins and Tax. These results suggest that cellular NF-kappa B may be involved in the regulation of BLV transcription and activation of the virus from latency.","['Brooks, P A', 'Cockerell, G L', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Brooks PA', 'Cockerell GL', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",1998/04/07 00:00,1998/04/07 00:01,['1998/04/07 00:00'],"['1998/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99035-3 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9035 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Mar 30;243(1):94-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9035.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",,,,,,['RR00091-03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The most frequent underlying illness was acute lymphoblastic leukemia, except in the patients aged 6 months to 2 years, of whom six were liver transplant recipients. The patients were treated with itraconazole at a dosage of 5 mg/kg of body weight once daily for 2 weeks. Blood samples were taken after the first dose, during treatment, and up to 8 days after the last itraconazole dose. On day 1, the mean peak concentrations in plasma after the first and last doses (Cmax) and areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) for itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were lower in the children aged 6 months to 2 years than in children aged 2 to 12 years but were comparable on day 14. The mean AUC0-24-based accumulation factors of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole from day 1 to 14 ranged from 3.3 to 8.6 and 2.3 to 11.4, respectively. After 14 days of treatment, Cmax, AUC0-24, and the half-life, respectively, were (mean +/- standard deviation) 571+/-416 ng/ml, 6,930+/-5,830 ng.h/ml, and 47+/-55 h in the children aged 6 months to 2 years; 534+/-431 ng/ml, 7,330+/-5,420 ng.h/ml, and 30.6+/-25.3 h in the children aged 2 to 5 years; and 631+/-358 ng/ml, 8,770+/-5,050 ng.h/ml, and 28.3+/-9.6 h in the children aged 5 to 12 years. There was a tendency to have more frequent low minimum concentrations of the drugs in plasma for both itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole for the children aged 6 months to 2 years. The oral bioavailability of the solubilizer hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin was less than 1% in the majority of the patients. In conclusion, an itraconazole oral solution given at 5 mg/kg/day provides potentially therapeutic concentrations in plasma, which are, however, substantially lower than those attained in adult cancer patients, and is well tolerated and safe in infants and children.","['de Repentigny, L', 'Ratelle, J', 'Leclerc, J M', 'Cornu, G', 'Sokal, E M', 'Jacqmin, P', 'De Beule, K']","['de Repentigny L', 'Ratelle J', 'Leclerc JM', 'Cornu G', 'Sokal EM', 'Jacqmin P', 'De Beule K']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Sainte-Justine Hospital and University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. louisr@globale.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antifungal Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Itraconazole/analogs & derivatives/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/metabolism']",1998/04/04 00:00,1998/04/04 00:01,['1998/04/04 00:00'],"['1998/04/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.42.2.404 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1998 Feb;42(2):404-8. doi: 10.1128/AAC.42.2.404.,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0X2BAV045O (hydroxyitraconazole)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)']",,,,,,,PMC105422,,,,,,,,

After a 5-minute BrdU pulse, this label is detected in 10-nm-wide fibers, organized as lacework and assumed to be replication units. In the early part of the S phase, DNA replication units are localized exclusively in the dispersed chromatin domains far from the nuclear envelope. In the middle S, replication occurs at the border between condensed and dispersed chromatin and, finally, in late S, it mainly occurs in perinuclear heterochromatin regions. After replication, the 10-nm fibers can condense in heterochromatin without translocation. Chromatin is highly dispersed in early S and computer image analysis shows an increase in condensed chromatin areas ranging from 13 to 18% at the end of the S phase with a temporal and morphological pattern of distribution characteristic for each cell type. Scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrates a regular and repetitive structure of dispersed chromatin, represented by a ring-like arrangement of the 10-nm fibers; assuming the same spatial distribution, gold particles that identify incorporated BrdU confirm this organization. By evaluating the organization and the distribution of DNA replication units during S phase, the results suggest that DNA replication occurs at a nucleosomal-like fiber level and that replicating enzymes machinery moves over a fixed template.","['Mazzotti, G', 'Gobbi, P', 'Manzoli, L', 'Falconi, M']","['Mazzotti G', 'Gobbi P', 'Manzoli L', 'Falconi M']","['Istituto Anatomia Umana Normale, Universita di Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Microsc Res Tech,Microscopy research and technique,9203012,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'DNA Replication', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Liver/cytology/ultrastructure', 'Liver Regeneration', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', '*S Phase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/04 03:14,2000/06/22 10:00,['1998/04/04 03:14'],"['1998/04/04 03:14 [pubmed]', '2000/06/22 10:00 [medline]', '1998/04/04 03:14 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19980301)40:5<418::AID-JEMT8>3.0.CO;2-M [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19980301)40:5<418::AID-JEMT8>3.0.CO;2-M [doi]']",ppublish,Microsc Res Tech. 1998 Mar 1;40(5):418-31. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19980301)40:5<418::AID-JEMT8>3.0.CO;2-M.,"['0 (Chromatin)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to investigate whether in humans the secretion of LIF during early pregnancy is under maternal control and whether its production is correlated with pregnancy hormones, progesterone and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta hCG). To exclude the possibility of paracrine interaction of decidua with trophoblast, we examined the secretion of LIF in women with extrauterine pregnancy. The present study was designed as a prospective, blinded, clinical and immunobiochemical study. The endometrial biopsies were performed on 12 women during surgery for ectopic pregnancy. On the same day, the level of progesterone and beta hCG in maternal plasma was examined. LIF concentration was determined in supernatants taken from cultured decidual explants. LIF production by decidual culture explants was found in all women with an ectopic pregnancy (Median 5015 pg, range 1389-19,304 pg). There was no correlation between the LIF production and the term of pregnancy, or with the level of circulated beta hCG (p > 0.05). However, when the concentration of progesterone in circulating plasma was less than 5 ng/ml, the secretion of LIF was 2.3-fold higher as compared to women who had progesterone levels of more than 5 ng/ml (p < 0.01). Therefore, we conclude that LIF is actively produced by human decidua and that the production of this cytokine does not depend on the presence of fetotrophoblast. This study demonstrates for the first time that progesterone downregulates the secretion of LIF in the decidua during early pregnancy.","['Hambartsoumian, E']",['Hambartsoumian E'],"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Antoine Beclere Hospital, Clamart, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Gynecol Endocrinol,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,8807913,IM,"['Adult', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/blood', 'Decidua/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Endometrium/surgery', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Ectopic/*metabolism/surgery', 'Progesterone/blood', 'Progestins/blood/*metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radioimmunoassay']",1998/04/04 00:00,1998/04/04 00:01,['1998/04/04 00:00'],"['1998/04/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/09513599809024965 [doi]'],ppublish,Gynecol Endocrinol. 1998 Feb;12(1):17-22. doi: 10.3109/09513599809024965.,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Progestins)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective antagonism of E2A basic helix-loop-helix protein associated with Id3-induced differentiation of erythroleukemia cells.,8278-86,"Accumulating evidence implicates functions of the Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in metazoa. Within the mammalian hematopoietic organ, expression of the Id3 gene is restricted to the lymphoid cell compartment. We show here that in non-lymphoid hematopoietic cells, repression of transcription is correlated with hypermethylation of sequences in the vicinity of the upstream regulatory region of the Id3 gene, suggestive of a strict developmental control of expression of this gene in lymphoid versus non-lymphoid hematopoietic cells. Enforced ectopic expression of Id3 in K562 erythroid progenitor cells promotes erythroid differentiation and is correlated with a quantitative/qualitative shift in the profile of interacting TAL1 and E protein heterodimers that bind to a consensus E box sequence in in vitro band shift assays, consistent with selective targeting of E2A E protein(s) by Id3 and suggesting a possible mechanism involving TAL1-mediated differentiation. By using a Gal 4-VP16 two-hybrid competition assay and an E box-dependent reporter assay, we demonstrate directly that the E2A protein E47 preferentially associates with Id3 in vivo. These observations provide a paradigm for understanding how overlapping but distinct specificities of individual Id proteins may constitute a developmentally regulated program underlying cell determination in diverse lineages.","['Deed, R W', 'Jasiok, M', 'Norton, J D']","['Deed RW', 'Jasiok M', 'Norton JD']","['CRC Department of Gene Regulation, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 9BX, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism']",1998/05/09 00:00,1998/05/09 00:01,['1998/05/09 00:00'],"['1998/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.14.8278 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)52555-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Apr 3;273(14):8278-86. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.14.8278.,"['0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147785-34-0 (ID3 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cAMP-responsive sequence (CRS1) from bovine CYP17 has previously been shown to be a binding site for Pbx1. A member of a second mammalian homeodomain family, Meis1, is now also demonstrated to be a CRS1-binding protein upon purification using CRS1 affinity chromatography. CRS1 binding complexes from Y1 adrenal cell nuclear extract contain both Pbx1 and Meis1. This is the first transcriptional regulatory element reported as a binding site for members of the Meis1 homeodomain family. Pbx1 and Meis1 bind cooperatively to CRS1, whereas neither protein can bind this element alone. Mutagenesis of the CRS1 element indicates a binding site for Meis1 adjacent to the Pbx site. All previously identified Pbx binding partners have Pbx interacting motifs that contain a tryptophan residue amino-terminal to the homeodomain that is required for cooperative binding to DNA with Pbx. Members of the Meis1 family contain one tryptophan residue amino-terminal to the homeodomain, but site-directed mutagenesis indicates that this residue is not required for cooperative CRS1 binding with Pbx. Thus, the Pbx-Meis1 interaction is unique among Pbx complexes. Meis1 also cooperatively binds CRS1 with the Pbx homologs extradenticle from Drosophila melanogaster and ceh-20 from Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that this interaction is evolutionarily conserved. Thus, CYP17 CRS1 is a transcriptional regulatory element containing both Pbx and Meis1 binding sites, which permit these two homeodomain proteins to bind and potentially regulate cAMP-dependent transcription through this sequence.","['Bischof, L J', 'Kagawa, N', 'Moskow, J J', 'Takahashi, Y', 'Iwamatsu, A', 'Buchberg, A M', 'Waterman, M R']","['Bischof LJ', 'Kagawa N', 'Moskow JJ', 'Takahashi Y', 'Iwamatsu A', 'Buchberg AM', 'Waterman MR']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0146, USA.

This cell line was 10-fold resistant to MTX in comparison to parental L1210 cells, yet the EC50 for 5-CHO-THF was increased by a factor of only 2. The initial uptake of MTX, at a concentration of 1 microM, was decreased by a factor of 40, whereas influx of 5-CHO-THF dropped by a factor of only 8. This difference in initial uptake rates was attributed solely to changes in influx Vmax without a significant change in Km. Whereas the RFC1 mRNA level in L1210-G1a cells was indistinguishable from that of parental L1210 cells, a serine to asparagine substitution was identified at amino acid 46 within the first predicted transmembrane domain. This was a result of a homozygous mutation of G-->A in the genome. Transfection of the mutated RFC1 cDNA into MTXrA cells, which lack functional endogenous carrier, resulted in a clonal derivative MTXrA-S46N. The increase in influx of 5-CHO-THF and 5-CH3THF was 5 and 13 times greater than that for MTX in the transfectant, consistent with the influx ratio in the L1210-G1a line. The functional expression of the mutated RFC1 reduced the growth requirement for 5-CHO-THF by a factor of 30, compared with only a 3-fold decrease in the MTX IC50. This represents the first reported RFC1 mutation that confers resistance to MTX due to a markedly impaired influx with relative conservation of reduced folate transport. The kinetic changes are consistent with a substrate-dependent alteration in carrier mobility that favors reduced folates over MTX. These changes may account for the development of MTX resistance due to impaired drug transport in vivo, allowing tumor cells to meet their folate requirement with 5-CH3THF, the predominant blood folate.","['Zhao, R', 'Assaraf, Y G', 'Goldman, I D']","['Zhao R', 'Assaraf YG', 'Goldman ID']","['Departments of Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology and the Albert Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Leucovorin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Substrate Specificity/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/09 00:00,1998/05/09 00:01,['1998/05/09 00:00'],"['1998/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.14.7873 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)52502-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Apr 3;273(14):7873-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.14.7873.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The t(3;8) results in promoter swapping between the PLAG1 gene, which encodes a novel zinc finger protein, and the constitutively expressed gene for beta-catenin (CTNNB1), a protein with roles in cell-cell adhesion and the WG/WNT signalling pathway. In order to assess the importance of other translocation partner genes of PLAG1, and their possible relationship to CTNNB1, we have characterized a second recurrent translocation, i.e. the t(5;8)(p13;q12). This translocation leads to ectopic expression of a chimeric transcript consisting of sequences from the ubiquitously expressed gene for the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and PLAG1. As for the t(3;8), the fusions occurred in the 5'-noncoding regions of both genes, exchanging regulatory control elements while preserving the coding sequences.

Wild-type HL-60, a transformed pro-myelocytic cell line, is very susceptible to apoptosis-inducing agents. We show here that expression of Bcr - Abl in HL-60 cells rendered them extremely resistant to apoptosis induced by a wide variety of agents. The anti-apoptotic effect of Bcr - Abl was found to be independent of the phase of the cell cycle. Treatment with antisense oligonucleotides directed to bcr decreased the expression of the ectopic bcr - abl and restored susceptibility to apoptosis. Double mutations affecting the autophosphorylation site and the phosphotyrosine-binding motif (FLVRES) have been previously shown to impair the transforming activity of Bcr - Abl in fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells, however HL-60 cells expressing this double mutant molecule exhibited the same level of resistance to apoptosis as those expressing the wild-type Bcr - Abl. Interestingly, wild type and mutant Bcr - Abl induced in HL-60 cells a dramatic down regulation of Bcl-2 and increased the levels of Bcl-xL. The level of Bax did not change in response to the presence of Bcr - Abl. Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to bcl-x downregulated the expression of Bcl-x, and increased the susceptibility of HL-60. Bcr - Abl cells to staurosporine.

In turn, these complexes are grouped into oligomers on the surfaces of the cell and of the virion. In the case of murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs), the SU moieties are polymorphic, with SU proteins of different viral isolates directed towards different cell surface receptors. During maturation of the released virus particle, the 16 C-terminal residues of TM (the R peptide or p2E) are removed from the protein by the viral protease; this cleavage is believed to activate the membrane-fusing potential of MuLV Env. We have tested the possibility that different MuLV Env proteins in the same cell can interact with each other, both physically and functionally, in mixed oligomers. We found that coexpressed Env molecules can be precipitated out of cell lysates by antiserum which reacts with only one of them. Furthermore, they can evidently cooperate with each other: if one Env species lacks the R peptide, then it can apparently induce fusion if the SU protein of the other Env species encounters its cognate receptor on the surface of another cell. This functional interaction between different Env molecules has a number of implications with respect to the mechanism of induction of membrane fusion, for the genetic analysis of Env function, and for the design of targeted retroviral vectors for gene therapy.","['Rein, A', 'Yang, C', 'Haynes, J A', 'Mirro, J', 'Compans, R W']","['Rein A', 'Yang C', 'Haynes JA', 'Mirro J', 'Compans RW']","['Retroviral Genetics Section, ABL Basic Research Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702, USA. rein@ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",1998/04/03 00:00,1998/04/03 00:01,['1998/04/03 00:00'],"['1998/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.4.3432-3435.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Apr;72(4):3432-5. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.4.3432-3435.1998.,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (murine leukemia virus protein p2E)']",,,,,,['CA18611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC109843,,,,,,,,

The distinct pathogenicities of PVC-441 and PVC-211 MuLVs were maintained in the viruses regenerated from their molecular clones, and the sequences responsible for the pathological differences observed can be localized to the env gene. The amino acid sequence of PVC-441 deduced from its nucleotide sequence revealed a number of differences from PVC-211, the most striking of which was a difference at position 129 of the SU proteins in the two viruses. Host range studies with a brain capillary endothelial cell line (RTEC-6) and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) revealed that PVC-441, like PVC-211, could infect these cells but its efficiency of infection was lower than that of PVC-211.

Mansky et al., J. Virol. 69:3282-3289, 1995). The global minimum-energy optimal folding for the entire BLV RNA, including the previously mapped primary and secondary encapsidation signal regions, was analyzed. Two stable stem-loop structures (located just downstream of the gag start codon) were predicted within the primary signal region, and one stable stem-loop structure (in the gag gene) was predicted in the secondary signal region. Based on these predicted structures, we introduced a series of mutations into the primary and secondary encapsidation signals in order to explore the sequence and structural information contained within these regions. The replication efficiency and levels of cytoplasmic and virion RNA were analyzed for these mutants. Mutations that disrupted either or both of the predicted stem-loop structures of the primary signal reduced the replication efficiency by factors of 7 and 40, respectively; similar reductions in RNA encapsidation efficiency were observed. The mutant with both stem-loop structures disrupted had a phenotype similar to that of a mutant containing a deletion of the entire primary signal region. Mutations that disrupted the predicted stem-loop structure of the secondary signal led to similar reductions (factors of 4 to 6) in both the replication and RNA encapsidation efficiencies. The introduction of compensatory mutations into mutants from both the primary and secondary signal regions, which restored the predicted stem-loop structures, led to levels of replication and RNA encapsidation comparable to those of virus containing the wild-type encapsidation signal. Replacement of the BLV RNA region containing the primary and secondary encapsidation signals with a similar region from human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) type 1 or type 2 led to virus replication at three-quarters or one-fifth of the level of the parental virus, respectively.

Some Nef is incorporated into particles, where it is cleaved by the viral protease between amino acids 57 and 58. The functional significance of this event, which liberates the C-terminal core domain of the protein from its membrane-associated N terminus, is unknown. To address this question, we examined the modalities of Nef virion association and processing. We found that although significant levels of Nef were detected in HIV-1 virions partly in a cleaved form, cell-specific variations existed in the efficiency of Nef proteolytic processing. The virion association of Nef was strongly enhanced by myristoylation but did not require other HIV-1-specific proteins, since Nef was efficiently incorporated into and cleaved inside murine leukemia virus particles. Substituting alanine for tryptophan57 decreased the efficiency of Nef processing, while mutating leucine58 had little effect. In contrast, replacing both of these residues simultaneously almost completely prevented this process. However, when the resulting mutants were compared with a wild-type control in viral infectivity assays, no correlation was found between the levels of cleavage and the ability to stimulate virion infectivity. Furthermore, simian immunodeficiency virus Nef, which lacks the sequence recognized by the protease and as a consequence is not cleaved despite its incorporation into virions, could stimulate the infectivity of a nef-defective HIV-1 variant as efficiently as HIV-1 Nef. On these bases, we conclude that the proteolytic processing of Nef is not required for the ability of this protein to enhance virion infectivity.","['Chen, Y L', 'Trono, D', 'Camaur, D']","['Chen YL', 'Trono D', 'Camaur D']","['Infectious Disease Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Products, nef/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Protease/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mutagenesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virion', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1998/04/03 00:00,1998/04/03 00:01,['1998/04/03 00:00'],"['1998/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.4.3178-3184.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Apr;72(4):3178-84. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.4.3178-3184.1998.,"['0 (Gene Products, nef)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HIV Protease)']",,,,,,['R37 AI34306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC109778,,,,,,,,

To examine the role of the cytokine microenvironment in this virus-induced B-lymphocyte expansion, the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-10, and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) mRNA, was measured in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from persistently lymphocytotic BLV-infected cows, nonlymphocytotic BLV-infected cows, and uninfected cows. IL-2 and IL-10 mRNA expression and IL-2 functional activity were significantly increased when peripheral blood mononuclear cells from persistently lymphocytotic cows were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA). Additionally, during persistent lymphocytosis, peak IL-2 and IL-10 mRNA expression was delayed, and elevated expression was prolonged. To determine the potential biologic importance of increased IL-2 and IL-10 expression, the response of isolated B lymphocytes from persistently lymphocytotic cows to human recombinant cytokines and to cytokine-containing supernatants from isolated T lymphocytes was examined. While recombinant human IL-10 (rhIL-10) did not consistently induce detectable changes, rhIL-2 increased viral protein (p24) and IL-2 receptor expression in isolated B lymphocytes from persistently lymphocytotic cows. Additionally, rhIL-2 and supernatant from ConA-stimulated T lymphocytes enhanced B-lymphocyte proliferation. The stimulatory activity of the T-lymphocyte supernatant could be completely inhibited with a polyclonal anti-rhIL-2 antibody. Finally, polyclonal anti-rhIL-2 antibody, as well as anti-BLV antibody, inhibited spontaneous proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from persistently lymphocytotic cows, demonstrating that the spontaneous lymphoproliferation characteristic of BLV-induced persistent lymphocytosis is IL-2 dependent and antigen dependent. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that increased T-lymphocyte expression of IL-2 in BLV-infected cows contributes to development and/or maintenance of persistent B lymphocytosis.","['Trueblood, E S', 'Brown, W C', 'Palmer, G H', 'Davis, W C', 'Stone, D M', 'McElwain, T F']","['Trueblood ES', 'Brown WC', 'Palmer GH', 'Davis WC', 'Stone DM', 'McElwain TF']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman 99164, USA. est@vetmed.wsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', '*Lymphocytosis', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Viral Core Proteins/biosynthesis']",1998/04/03 00:00,1998/04/03 00:01,['1998/04/03 00:00'],"['1998/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.4.3169-3177.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Apr;72(4):3169-77. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.4.3169-3177.1998.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (core protein p24, bovine leukemia virus)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",,,,,,"['T32 AI007025/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K11 AI01357-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI07025/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC109775,,,,,,,,

Analysis of MLV(Ebola) infection revealed that the host range conferred by Ebo-GP is very broad, extending to cells of a variety of species. Notably, all lymphoid cell lines tested were completely resistant to infection; we speculate that this is due to the absence of a cellular receptor for Ebo-GP on B and T cells.

Mutations were introduced into the adjacent binding sites for three transcription factors within the enhancer of the T-cell-lymphomagenic virus SL3-3. The sites that were tested were, in 5'-to-3' order, a binding site for core binding factor (CBF) called core II, a binding site for c-Myb, a site that binds members of the Ets family of factors, and a second CBF binding site called core I. Mutation of each site individually reduced transcriptional activity in T lymphocytes. However, mutation of the Myb and core I binding sites had larger effects than mutation of the Ets or core II site. The relative effects on transcription in T cells paralleled the effects of the same mutations on viral lymphomagenicity, consistent with the idea that the role of these sequences in viral lymphomagenicity is indeed to regulate transcription in T cells. Mutations were also introduced simultaneously into multiple sites in the SL3-3 enhancer. The inhibitory effects of these mutations indicated that the transcription factor in T cells that recognizes the core I element of SL3-3, presumably CBF, needed to synergize with one or more factors bound at the upstream sites to function. This was tested further by generating a multimer construct that contained five tandem core I elements linked to a basal long terminal repeat promoter. This construct was inactive in T cells. However, transcriptional activity was detected with a multimer construct in which the transcription factor binding sites upstream of the core were also present. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CBF requires heterologous transcription factors bound at nearby sites to function in T cells.","['Zaiman, A L', 'Nieves, A', 'Lenz, J']","['Zaiman AL', 'Nieves A', 'Lenz J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1998/04/03 00:00,1998/04/03 00:01,['1998/04/03 00:00'],"['1998/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.4.3129-3137.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Apr;72(4):3129-37. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.4.3129-3137.1998.,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,"['R01 CA044822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM7288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC109765,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the Env proteins were confined only to the somatic region. When the Gag and Env proteins were coexpressed, the Gag proteins were also excluded from the axons. This effect of the Env proteins was shown to be dependent on the concentration of the Gag proteins in the neuron and also to be specific for homologous pairs of retrovirus proteins.

In FeLV infections, as in other retroviral infections, it is less clear how virus variants that evolve from the transmitted virus affect pathogenesis. We previously reported an analysis of the genotypic changes that occur in the viral envelope gene (env) in cats infected with a prototype transmissible FeLV clone, 61E (J. Rohn, M. Linenberger, E. Hoover, and J. Overbaugh, J. Virol. 68:2458-2467, 1994). In one cat, each variant (81T) had evolved, in addition to scattered amino acid changes, a four-amino-acid insertion with respect to 61E. This insertion was located at the same site in the extracellular envelope glycoprotein where the immunodeficiency-inducing molecular clone 61C possesses a six-amino-acid insertion critical for its pathogenic phenotype, although the sequences of the insertions were distinct. To determine whether acquisition of the four-amino-acid insertion was associated with a change in the replication or cytopathic properties of the virus, we constructed chimeras encoding 81T env genes in a 61E background. One representative chimeric virus, EET(TE)-109, was highly cytopathic despite the fact that it replicated with delayed kinetics in the feline T-cell line 3201 compared to the parental 61E virus. The phenotype of this virus was also novel compared to other FeLVs, including both the parental virus 61E and the immunodeficiency-inducing variant 61C, because infection of T cells was associated with syncytium formation. Moreover, in single-cycle infection assays, the 81T-109 envelope demonstrated receptor usage properties distinct from those of both 61E and 61C envelope. Thus, these studies demonstrate the evolution of a novel T-cell cytopathic and syncytium-inducing FeLV in the host. The 81T virus will be valuable for dissecting the mechanism of T-cell killing by cytopathic variants in the FeLV model.","['Rohn, J L', 'Moser, M S', 'Gwynn, S R', 'Baldwin, D N', 'Overbaugh, J']","['Rohn JL', 'Moser MS', 'Gwynn SR', 'Baldwin DN', 'Overbaugh J']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Biological Evolution', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'DNA, Viral', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes, env', '*Genetic Variation', 'Giant Cells/virology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",1998/04/03 00:00,1998/04/03 00:01,['1998/04/03 00:00'],"['1998/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.4.2686-2696.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Apr;72(4):2686-96. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.4.2686-2696.1998.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (feline leukemia virus receptor)']",,,,,"['GENBANK/U58951', 'GENBANK/U70377', 'GENBANK/U70378']","['R01 CA051080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC109711,,,,,,,,

Although human FLY packaging cells expressed several classes of HERV transcripts (HERV-K, HuRT, type C, and RTVL-H), none was detectable in the MLV vector particles released from the cells. Nonspecific packaging of the MLV Gag-Pol expression vector transcripts was detected in the FLY virions at a low level (1 in 17,000 sequences). These findings indicate that human packaging cells produce retrovirus particles far less contaminated by endogenous viral sequences than murine packaging cells. Human teratocarcinoma cells (GH cells), which produce HERV-K particles, were transduced with an MLV-derived beta-Gal vector. Although both HERV-K and RTVL-H sequences were found in association with the particles, beta-Gal transcripts were not detected, indicating that HERV Gag proteins do not efficiently package MLV-based vectors.","['Patience, C', 'Takeuchi, Y', 'Cosset, F L', 'Weiss, R A']","['Patience C', 'Takeuchi Y', 'Cosset FL', 'Weiss RA']","['Chester Beatty Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom. clive@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, gag', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Virus Assembly']",1998/04/03 00:00,1998/04/03 00:01,['1998/04/03 00:00'],"['1998/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.4.2671-2676.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Apr;72(4):2671-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.4.2671-2676.1998.,,,,,,,,PMC109709,,,,,,,,

Replication-competent retroviruses have never previously been used in our laboratory, and stringent screening of all routinely used cell lines has not revealed the presence of any helper viruses. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that this virus represents an adventitious cross-contaminant or had been imported unknowingly with our cell line stocks.

Although epidemiological studies have shown that alpha particles emitted from 232Th and its decay products incorporated in the bone marrow cause leukemia, the use of these data for alpha particle induced leukemogenesis risk estimation has been criticized mainly for inhomogeneity of Thorotrast distribution. Four monkeys were injected with Thorotrast to investigate the degree of inhomogeneity in the thorium content of different bone marrow sites and the cellular localization of Thorotrast. Two were injected via an artery and two via a vein and sacrificed either at 1 wk or 3 to 4 y after injection. Microscopic, solid state autoradiography and back scatter electron imaging methods were applied to several bone sites to determine the degree of inhomogeneity. Quantification was performed using x-ray fluorescence for trabecular bone and bone marrow and neutron activation analysis for compact bones. At 1 wk Thorotrast was found to be distributed evenly in the red marrow; by 3 and 4 y conglomerates were seen which were restricted to macrophages. The monkey was found to be a good model for humans. The choice of injection route did not noticeably affect the Thorotrast distribution in bones of the skeletal system. Considering the even distribution of Thorotrast within the red bone marrow at early times after its injection, the inevitable diffusion of thorium progeny from the particles, the mobility of bone marrow macrophages, and the well established correction factor of self-absorption within conglomerates, these results suggest that data derived from Thorotrast patients are useful for risk estimation of alpha particle induced leukemia.","['Humphreys, J A', 'Priest, N D', 'Ishikawa, Y']","['Humphreys JA', 'Priest ND', 'Ishikawa Y']","['Biomedical Research, AEA Technology, Oxon, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Thorium Dioxide/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution']",1998/04/03 00:00,1998/04/03 00:01,['1998/04/03 00:00'],"['1998/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-199804000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 1998 Apr;74(4):442-7. doi: 10.1097/00004032-199804000-00004.,['9XA7X17UQC (Thorium Dioxide)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify this point, we examined the effects of various mouse tumor cells on OC recruitment using cocultures of tumor cells and mouse marrow cells. The mouse mammary tumor cell lines, MMT060562 (MMT), BALB/c-MC, Jyg-MC(A), or other nonmammary tumor cell lines, LLC and B16, were cocultured with mouse marrow cells, and OC recruitment from marrow cells was determined by counting the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells (TRAP(+) MNCs) formed. Of the tumor cells examined, MMT and BALB/c-MC stimulated OC formation, but other tumor cells did not. OC formation with MMT was dependent on the number of MMTs inoculated, and only ten cells per well were sufficient to induce OC development. OCs appeared on day 4, and the number reached a maximum on days 5-8 and decreased thereafter. TRAP(+) MNCs induced by MMT satisfied the major criteria of OCs, such as the presence of calcitonin receptors and the ability to resorb calcified tissues. The majority of OCs were formed adjacent to the stromal cells, which were positive for alkaline phosphatase. When spleen cells were cocultured with MMT, no OCs were formed. In contrast, when osteoblastic cells were added to cocultures of spleen cells and MMT, many OCs were formed. The cultured media (CM) of MMT induced OC formation in mouse marrow cultures. Neither parathyroid hormone-like nor interleukin 1-like activity was present in the CM. MMT constitutively produced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and OC formation in cocultures was completely inhibited by indomethacin. Fractionation of the CM of MMT by ultrafiltration indicated that the OC-inducing activities were present not only in the fraction with molecular weight below 3 kDa but also in the fraction with molecular weight above 3 kDa. OC-inducing activity with high molecular weight was eluted around 50 kDa by Bio-Gel P-60 column chromatography. The active fractions also possessed leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) activity, and OC-inducing activity of the peak fraction was inhibited in the presence of anti-LIF neutralizing antibody. The results of this study indicated that MMTs release PGE2 and LIF, which in turn stimulate OC formation via a stromal cell-dependent pathway. These culture systems will help to clarify the mechanisms by which tumor cells induce OC formation in a bone marrow microenvironment.","['Akatsu, T', 'Ono, K', 'Katayama, Y', 'Tamura, T', 'Nishikawa, M', 'Kugai, N', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Nagata, N']","['Akatsu T', 'Ono K', 'Katayama Y', 'Tamura T', 'Nishikawa M', 'Kugai N', 'Yamamoto M', 'Nagata N']","['The Third Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Bone Resorption/*metabolism', 'Calcitonin/analysis', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', '*Interleukin-6', 'Isoenzymes/analysis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology', 'Prostaglandins E/*biosynthesis', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/03 00:00,1998/04/03 00:01,['1998/04/03 00:00'],"['1998/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.3.400 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1998 Mar;13(3):400-8. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.3.400.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '7SFC6U2VI5 (salmon calcitonin)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acp5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HPLC stability studies at pH 5.0 with the related model compounds 5, 7, 8, and 9, in which chlorambucil was substituted by 4-phenylbutyric acid, demonstrated that the carboxylic hydrazone derivatives have acid-sensitive properties; the acid lability of 7 was particular prominent with a half-life of only a few hours. The alkylating activity of albumin-bound chlorambucil was determined with the aid of 4-(4-nitrobenzyl)-pyridine (NBP), demonstrating that on average three equivalents were protein-bound. Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of free chlorambucil and the respective albumin conjugates in the MCF7 mamma carcinoma and MOLT4 leukemia cell line employing a propidium iodide fluorescence assay demonstrated that the conjugate in which chlorambucil was bound to albumin through an ester bond was not as active as chlorambucil. In contrast, the conjugates in which chlorambucil was bound to albumin through carboxylic hydrazone bonds were as or more active than chlorambucil in both cell lines. In particular, the conjugate in which chlorambucil was bound to albumin through an acetaldehyde carboxylic hydrazone bond exhibited IC50 values which were approximately 4-fold (MCF7) to 13-fold (MOLT4) lower than those of chlorambucil. Preliminary toxicity studies in mice showed that this conjugate can be administered at higher doses in comparison to unbound chlorambucil.","['Kratz, F', 'Beyer, U', 'Roth, T', 'Schutte, M T', 'Unold, A', 'Fiebig, H H', 'Unger, C']","['Kratz F', 'Beyer U', 'Roth T', 'Schutte MT', 'Unold A', 'Fiebig HH', 'Unger C']","['Tumor Biology Center, Dept.

The MDV isolate, serologically identified as serotype 2 MDV and designated as the 2H strain, was free from ALV and reticuloendotheliosis virus. A serotype 2-specific antigen of MDV was detected in 44% of BK3A, but antigens of serotypes 1 and 3 were not detected in this cell line, by the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test using serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies. MDV antigens were undetectable in LSCC-BK3, clone 2C; both cell lines were established from the same chicken. Neither clinical signs nor macroscopic lesions were observed in any of 19 chicks inoculated with the 2H strain. Three out of 19 chicks histopathologically examined had no lesions.

Invasive aspergillosis most frequently was seen in the lung (71%), while candidiasis occurred mainly in the intestinal tract (42%). Cultures for mycology were collected from the autopsy material of 9 patients, of which 8 gave positive results. A previous fungal colonisation results was confirmed in 23 patients, but based on colonisation conclusions rarely could be driven concerning the species causing invasive infection.

Thus, thiolated human serum transferrin was conjugated with four maleimide derivatives of doxorubicin that differed in the stability of the chemical link between drug and spacer. Of the maleimide derivatives, 3-maleimidobenzoic or 4-maleimidophenylacetic acid was bound to the 3'-amino position of doxorubicin through a benzoyl or phenylacetyl amide bond, and 3-maleimidobenzoic acid hydrazide or 4-maleimidophenylacetic acid hydrazide was bound to the 13-keto position through a benzoyl hydrazone or phenylacetyl hydrazone bond. The acid-sensitive transferrin conjugates prepared with the carboxylic hydrazone doxorubicin derivatives exhibited an inhibitory efficacy in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line and U937 leukemia cell line comparable to that of the free drug (employing the BrdU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) incorporation assay and tritiated thymidine incorporation assay, respectively, IC50 approximately 0.1-1 mM), whereas conjugates with the amide derivatives showed no activity. Furthermore, antiproliferative activity of the most active transferrin conjugate (i.e. the conjugate containing a benzoyl hydrazone link) was demonstrated in the LXFL 529 lung carcinoma cell line employing a sulforhodamine B assay. In contrast to in vitro studies in tumor cells, cell culture experiments performed with human endothelial cells (HUVEC) showed that the acid-sensitive transferrin conjugates of doxorubicin were significantly less active than free doxorubicin (IC50 values approximately 10-40 higher by the BrdU incorporation assay), indicating selectivity of the doxorubicin-transferrin conjugates for tumor cells. Fluorescence microscopy studies in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell showed that free doxorubicin accumulates in the cell nucleus, whereas doxorubicin of the transferrin conjugates is found localized primarily in the cytoplasm. The differences in the intracellular distribution between transferrin-doxorubicin conjugates and doxorubicin were confirmed by laser scanning confocal microscopy in LXFL 529 cells after a 24 h incubation that revealed an uptake and mode of action other than intercalation with DNA. The relationship between stability, cellular uptake, and cytotoxicity of the conjugates is discussed.","['Kratz, F', 'Beyer, U', 'Roth, T', 'Tarasova, N', 'Collery, P', 'Lechenault, F', 'Cazabat, A', 'Schumacher, P', 'Unger, C', 'Falken, U']","['Kratz F', 'Beyer U', 'Roth T', 'Tarasova N', 'Collery P', 'Lechenault F', 'Cazabat A', 'Schumacher P', 'Unger C', 'Falken U']","['The Department of Medical Oncology, Clinical Research, Tumor Biology Center, Freiburg, Federal Republic of Germany. felix@tumorbio.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,IM,"['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Doxorubicin/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Transferrin/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/02 03:04,2000/07/19 11:00,['1998/04/02 03:04'],"['1998/04/02 03:04 [pubmed]', '2000/07/19 11:00 [medline]', '1998/04/02 03:04 [entrez]']","['10.1021/js970246a [doi]', 'S0022-3549(15)50527-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 1998 Mar;87(3):338-46. doi: 10.1021/js970246a.,"['0 (Transferrin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considerable efforts have been made to identify risk factors for these diseases, but only a minority of leukaemia cases can currently be attributed to identified or hypothesized factors. This review highlights recent epidemiological literature concerning adult leukaemia, discussing in detail the hereditary, environmental and medical risks. Chromosomal syndromes and genetically based diseases carry a high risk of leukaemia, but rarely occur in the population. Environmental and occupational exposures to chemicals including pesticides have been widely studied, although the results are not consistent, with the exception of benzene. Smoking seems to be a weak causal risk factor. The risk of ionizing radiation has further been quantified in recent studies, although the effects of low doses have not yet been clarified. The results for non-ionizing radiation continue to be inconsistent, but a large effect of electromagnetic fields on the risk of leukaemia appears to be unlikely. Medically applied radio- and chemotherapy are clearly associated with subsequent leukaemia development, and there are links between leukaemia and viral infections. Future research should emphasize the shortcomings in exposure assessment that pervade many studies, and interactions between different risk factors need to be taken into consideration.","['Zeeb, H', 'Blettner, M']","['Zeeb H', 'Blettner M']","['Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Abt.

These mediators include eicosanoids (e.g., lipoxins), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukins 4 and 13), antagonists of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 receptor antagonist), neuropoietic cytokines (leukemia inhibitory factor and interleukin 6), as well as deactivators of inflammatory macrophages (transforming growth factor beta and interleukin 10). They limit the effects of proinflammatory mediators by inhibiting their production, stability, or function. Recent attempts to reduce inflammatory lesions in experimental glomerulonephritis have focused on upregulating the expression of these anti-inflammatory mediators by using protein or gene transfer. In particular administration of interleukin 4, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, leukemia inhibitory factor, or interleukin 10 has been shown to be effective in the treatment of nephrotoxic nephritis. Of all the mediators already tested, interleukin 10 has the greatest potential because of its strong anti-inflammatory effects and weak adverse effects.","['Baud, L', 'Fouqueray, B', 'Suberville, S', 'Doublier, S']","['Baud L', 'Fouqueray B', 'Suberville S', 'Doublier S']","['INSERM U64, Hopital Tenon, Paris, France.

The effects of alpha-tocopherol (T) and alpha-tocopheryl succinate (TS) on transcriptional activation of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation were examined. Two stable transformants were used: TR-1 cells derived from THP-1 cells transfected with a vector contains the human TNF-alpha promoter (1.4-kb) joined to the human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) coding sequence, and B164 cells derived from the same cell line but carrying the vector containing the human beta-actin promoter (4.3-kb) as a control. The transfectants were cultured in the presence of TS, followed by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After stimulation, PLAP activity secreted into the culture medium was measured. TS reduced TNF-alpha transcriptional activity in a concentration-dependent manner, while no effect was observed on that of the beta-actin promoter. Gel shift assay revealed that THP-1 cells pretreated with TS and then with LPS showed inhibition of NF-kappa B activity by 43% at 50 microM versus the TS-untreated group. Since TS did not affect activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity under the same conditions, the inhibitory effect of TS on NF-kappa B activation might be specific. However, T had no effect on the results of the gel shift assay. Vitamin E transportation was analyzed by simultaneous determination of vitamin E and its derivatives using HPLC. The vitamin E recovered from culture pellets showed almost the same amounts of T and TS transferred and was recovered in unchanged form. These observations indicated that TS inhibited NF-kappa B activation and/or translocation to the nuclei in its unchanged form under the culture conditions used here. These results suggested that vitamin E is involved in signal transduction via an effect distinct from its antioxidant function. To explain the lack of activity with T, it remains to be clarified whether physiological incorporation of T occurred.","['Nakamura, T', 'Goto, M', 'Matsumoto, A', 'Tanaka, I']","['Nakamura T', 'Goto M', 'Matsumoto A', 'Tanaka I']","['Department of Post Marketing Research and Drug Information, Eisai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biofactors,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",8807441,IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/genetics', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Placenta/enzymology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tocopherols', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics', 'Vitamin E/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1998/04/02 00:00,1998/04/02 00:01,['1998/04/02 00:00'],"['1998/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/biof.5520070104 [doi]'],ppublish,Biofactors. 1998;7(1-2):21-30. doi: 10.1002/biof.5520070104.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'R0ZB2556P8 (Tocopherols)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these mediators seem to be very important in the pathogenesis of psoriasis since they are thought to stimulate keratinocyte proliferation and/or to drive the inflammatory changes associated with psoriasis. Among the proinflammatory modulators, hematopoietins, which are a family of cytokines sharing a receptor component (the gp130 subunit), have been under intensive investigation in recent years. The hematopoietin family includes interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-11 (IL-11,) leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin-M (OSM), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and cardiotrophin. Amounts of two of these molecules, IL-6 and IL-11, have been found to be increased in psoriatic lesions. The present study adds new information concerning the spontaneous release of two hematopoietins, namely LIF and OSM, in 48-h culture supernatants of lesional and nonlesional skin punch biopsies from psoriatic patients and normal subjects. The cytokine determinations were performed using commercially available ELISA kits. The results are expressed as picograms per milligram of tissue, after weight normalization. The levels of LIF released by lesional skin (median 2.4 pg/mg, range 0.05-13.4 pg/mg) were significantly higher than from nonlesional (median 0.4 pg/mg, range under detection limit (UDL)-4.4 pg/mg; P = 0.001) and normal skin (median 0.4 pg/mg, range UDL-0.9 pg/mg; P = 0.005). The OSM levels were also significantly higher in supernatants of lesional skin (median 0.9 pg/mg, range 0.4-5.2 pg/mg) than in supernatants of nonlesional (median 0.2 pg/mg, range UDL-0.8 pg/mg; P = 0.001) and normal skin (median 0.1 pg/mg, range UDL-0.4 pg/mg; P = 0.0001). In addition, interleukin-8 (IL-8), a cytokine involved in the pathomechanisms of psoriasis, showed a similar behaviour when measured in the same samples. Lesional skin showed a median value of 752.5 pg/mg, range 98.8-2063.8 pg/mg, nonlesional skin a median value of 58.3 pg/mg, range UDL-1252.5 pg/mg (P = 0.007) and normal skin a median value of 44.6 pg/mg, range UDL-176.7 pg/mg (P = 0.004). No significant differences were found between nonlesional and normal skin for the three molecules analyzed. Taken together with the fact that at least two other hematopoietins (namely IL-6 and IL-11) are also increased in supernatants of lesional psoriatic skin, these data point to a possible involvement of the hematopoietins in inflammatory processes associated with psoriasis.","['Bonifati, C', 'Mussi, A', ""D'Auria, L"", 'Carducci, M', 'Trento, E', 'Cordiali-Fei, P', 'Ameglio, F']","['Bonifati C', 'Mussi A', ""D'Auria L"", 'Carducci M', 'Trento E', 'Cordiali-Fei P', 'Ameglio F']","['Department of Dermatology, Istitute S.

METHODS: Between May 1985 and December 1994, 196 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase received marrow transplants from unrelated donors. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 5 years (range, 1.2 to 10.1). Graft failure occurred in 5 percent of patients who could be evaluated. Acute graft-versus-host disease of grade III or IV severity was observed in 35 percent of patients who received HLA-matched transplants, and the estimated cumulative incidence of relapse at five years was 10 percent. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at five years was 57 percent. Survival was adversely affected by an interval from diagnosis to transplantation of one year or more, an HLA-DRB1 mismatch, a high body-weight index, and an age of more than 50 years. Survival was improved by the prophylactic use of fluconazole and ganciclovir. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival at five years was 74 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 62 to 86 percent) for patients who were 50 years of age or younger who received a transplant from an HLA-matched donor within one year after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of marrow from an HLA-matched, unrelated donor is safe and effective therapy for selected patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Hansen, J A', 'Gooley, T A', 'Martin, P J', 'Appelbaum, F', 'Chauncey, T R', 'Clift, R A', 'Petersdorf, E W', 'Radich, J', 'Sanders, J E', 'Storb, R F', 'Sullivan, K M', 'Anasetti, C']","['Hansen JA', 'Gooley TA', 'Martin PJ', 'Appelbaum F', 'Chauncey TR', 'Clift RA', 'Petersdorf EW', 'Radich J', 'Sanders JE', 'Storb RF', 'Sullivan KM', 'Anasetti C']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', '*Tissue Donors']",1998/04/02 00:00,1998/04/02 00:01,['1998/04/02 00:00'],"['1998/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199804023381405 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1998 Apr 2;338(14):962-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199804023381405.,,['N Engl J Med. 1998 Apr 2;338(14):980-2.

Membrane lipid dynamics was measured by the steady-state fluorescence polarization (P) method utilizing either 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) or the trimethyl ammonium derivative of DPH (TMA-DPH), which ascertains anchorage of the label to the membrane-water-lipid interface. Decrease in membrane microfluidity was observed in HL-60 cells undergoing differentiation into macrophages by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and by K562 cells induced to differentiate by DMSO. Sodium butyrate caused an increase in membrane fluidity in K562 cells undergoing differentiation into erythroid-like cells while in HL-60 cells a dual effect was observed. At 0.4 mM concentration, in which the cells were induced to differentiate along the monocyte pathway, a decrease in membrane fluidity was observed, while at 1 mM concentration an increase in membrane fluidity occurred. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induced an increase in membrane fluidity in both cell lines. Using HL-60 cells fluorescently labeled by TMA-DPH, similar results indicating fluidization of the membrane following IFN-gamma treatment were obtained. Advanced fluorescence lifetime measurements, evaluated either by phase modulation spectrofluorometry or by single photon correlation fluorometry confirmed that the decrease in fluorescence polarization by IFN-gamma resulted from membrane fluidization and not from elongation of the probe's excited state lifetime. It is suggested that the inducer mode of action, and not the differentiation route, determine the outcome of changes in membrane microviscosity.","['Nathan, I', 'Ben-Valid, I', 'Henzel, R', 'Masalha, H', 'Baram, S N', 'Dvilansky, A', 'Parola, A H']","['Nathan I', 'Ben-Valid I', 'Henzel R', 'Masalha H', 'Baram SN', 'Dvilansky A', 'Parola AH']","['Unit of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Diphenylhexatriene/analogs & derivatives', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Fluidity/drug effects', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Succimer/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/04/02 00:00,1998/04/02 00:01,['1998/04/02 00:00'],"['1998/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(97)93914-8 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3914 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 Mar 15;239(2):442-6. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3914.,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '1720-32-7 (Diphenylhexatriene)', '71316-28-4 (1-(4-(trimethylamino)phenyl)-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'DX1U2629QE (Succimer)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro reconstitution of intact HeLa S3 nuclei and apoptotic U937 cytosolic extract (CE) revealed that (i) Ca2+/Mg(2+)-dependent, Zn(2+)-sensitive endonuclease activated in the apoptotic CE induced DNA ladder in HeLa nuclei at pH 6.8-7.4, (ii) activated caspase-3 cleaved PARP in HeLa nuclei, and (iii) when the apoptotic CE was treated with the caspase-3 inhibitor (1 microM Ac-DEVD-CHO) or the caspase-1 inhibitor (10 microM Ac-YVAD-CHO), the former, but not the latter, caused a 50% inhibition of DNA fragmentation and the complete inhibition of PARP cleavage in HeLa nuclei. Similarly, Ac-DEVD-CHO (100 microM) inhibited apoptosis and DNA ladder by 50% and PARP cleavage completely in UV-irradiated U937 cells, but Ac-YVAD-CHO (100 microM) did not. Thus, UV-induced apoptosis of U937 cells involves the Ca2+/Mg(2+)-dependent endonuclease pathway and the caspase-3-PARP cleavage-Ca2+/Mg(2+)-dependent endonuclease pathway. The former pathway produced directly 50% of apoptotic DNA ladder, and the latter involved activated caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, followed by formation of the remaining 50% DNA ladder by the activated endonuclease. In UV-irradiated B-cell lines, further, p53-dependent increase of Bax resulted in a greater caspase-3 activation compared to its absence. However, UV-induced activation of JNK1 and p38 was not affected by the caspase-1 and -3 inhibitors in U937 cells, so that caspases-1 and -3 do not function upstream of JNK1 and p38.","['Kimura, C', 'Zhao, Q L', 'Kondo, T', 'Amatsu, M', 'Fujiwara, Y']","['Kimura C', 'Zhao QL', 'Kondo T', 'Amatsu M', 'Fujiwara Y']","['Department of Radiation Biophysics and Genetics, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/radiation effects', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Caspase 1', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/radiation effects', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/enzymology/*pathology', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', '*Ultraviolet Rays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",1998/04/02 00:00,1998/04/02 00:01,['1998/04/02 00:00'],"['1998/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(97)93912-4 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3912 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 Mar 15;239(2):411-22. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3912.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '143313-51-3 (L 709049)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (calcium magnesium dependent endodeoxyribonuclease)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hyperresistance was accompanied by the overproduction of immunodetectable ferritin, predominantly the heavy (H) subunit, which exhibits ferroxidase activity. Cells that had been enriched in apoferritin via pinocytotic uptake showed similar hyperresistance to both types of oxidative challenge. On the other hand, preincubating cells with hemin in the presence of a phosphorothioate-linked antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against H-ferritin mRNA resulted in a strong diminution in both hyperresistance and H-ferritin induction. No effects were seen when a scrambled order oligodeoxynucleotide of the same base composition was used, confirming that the antisense oligomer had specifically inhibited H-ferritin translation. These results indicate that induced ferritin played a crucial role in the observed cytological responses. Enhanced oxidant resistance is attributed to the ability of this ferritin to rapidly sequester and incapacitate redox-active iron.","['Lin, F', 'Girotti, A W']","['Lin F', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,IM,"['Apoferritins/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Ferritins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', 'Singlet Oxygen']",1998/05/09 00:00,1998/05/09 00:01,['1998/05/09 00:00'],"['1998/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(98)90588-4 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1998.0588 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1998 Apr 1;352(1):51-8. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1998.0588.,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', '9013-31-4 (Apoferritins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,,,['CA70823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,

After treatment of K562 cells with sodium butyrate, the expression of transferrin receptor (TfR) increased initially, followed by an increase in the levels of both total iron and Hb as well as the ALAS activity. However, no increase could be found in the levels of non-heme iron, low-molecular-mass iron (LMMFe) and ferritin. Addition of diferric transferrin (FeTf) enhanced both delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and Hb synthesis. In contrast, addition of hemin elevated the levels of all iron species as well as the Hb synthesis but reduced the TfR expression and ALA contents in both butyrate treated and untreated cells.

Because Lmo2 null mutant mice die at embryonic day 9-10, it prevents an assessment of a role in other stages of hematopoiesis. We have now studied the hematopoietic contribution of homozygous mutant Lmo2 -/- mouse embryonic stem cells and found that Lmo2 -/- cells do not contribute to any hematopoietic lineage in adult chimeric mice, but reintroduction of an Lmo2-expression vector rescues the ability of Lmo2 null embryonic stem cells to contribute to all lineages tested. This disruption of hematopoiesis probably occurs because interaction of Lmo2 protein with factors such as Tal1/Scl is precluded. Thus, Lmo2 is necessary for early stages of hematopoiesis, and the Lmo2 master gene encodes a protein that has a central and crucial role in the hematopoietic development.","['Yamada, Y', 'Warren, A J', 'Dobson, C', 'Forster, A', 'Pannell, R', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Yamada Y', 'Warren AJ', 'Dobson C', 'Forster A', 'Pannell R', 'Rabbitts TH']","['Medical Research Council, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation']",1998/05/09 00:00,1998/05/09 00:01,['1998/05/09 00:00'],"['1998/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.7.3890 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Mar 31;95(7):3890-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.7.3890.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)']",,,,,,,PMC19933,,,,,,,,

These leukemias are classified either as T prolymphocytic leukemias, which occur very late in life, or as T chronic lymphocytic leukemias, which often arise in patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) at a young age. The TCL1 oncogene is activated in these leukemias by juxtaposition to the alpha or beta locus of the T cell receptor, caused by chromosomal translocations t(14:14)(q11:q32), t(7:14)(q35:q32), or by inversions inv(14)(q11:q32). To show that transcriptional alteration of TCL1 is causally involved in the generation of T cell neoplasia we have generated transgenic mice that carry the TCL1 gene under the transcriptional control of the p56(lck) promoter element. The lck-TCL1 transgenic mice developed mature T cell leukemias after a long latency period. Younger mice presented preleukemic T cell expansions expressing TCL1, and leukemias developed only at an older age. The phenotype of the murine leukemias is CD4-CD8+, in contrast to human leukemias, which are predominantly CD4+CD8-. These studies demonstrate that transcriptional activation of the TCL1 protooncogene can cause malignant transformation of T lymphocytes, indicating the role of TCL1 in the initiation of malignant transformation in T prolymphocytic leukemias and T chronic lymphocytic leukemias.","['Virgilio, L', 'Lazzeri, C', 'Bichi, R', 'Nibu, K', 'Narducci, M G', 'Russo, G', 'Rothstein, J L', 'Croce, C M']","['Virgilio L', 'Lazzeri C', 'Bichi R', 'Nibu K', 'Narducci MG', 'Russo G', 'Rothstein JL', 'Croce CM']","['Kimmel Cancer Institute and Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Thomas Jefferson University, 233 South 10th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA. lvirgil@lac.jci.tju.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1998/05/09 00:00,1998/05/09 00:01,['1998/05/09 00:00'],"['1998/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.7.3885 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Mar 31;95(7):3885-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.7.3885.,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,"['CA21124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC19932,,,,,,,,

Monosomy 7, occurring as the sole cytogenetic anomaly in a small but significant number of cases, may denote a dominant mechanism involving critical tumor suppressor gene(s). We have determined the extent of allele loss in cytogenetically prescreened MDS and AML patients for microsatellite markers from chromosome 7q22 and 7q31. Whereas >80% of these cases revealed allele loss for the entire region, a rare case of the 7q- chromosome showed allele loss for only the proximal 7q31.1 loci flanked by the markers D7S486 and D7S2456, and a case of monosomy 7 revealed allele loss for loci at both 7q31 and 7q22 with retention of sequences between these sets of loci. Furthermore, a case of AML with no cytogenetic anomaly of chromosome 7 revealed a submicroscopic allelic imbalance for a third distal locus, D7S677. These findings suggest the presence of three distinct critical loci that may contribute alone or in combination to the evolution of MDS and AML. The data also provide molecular evidence for unbalanced translocation with noncontiguous deletions, as an alternate mechanism underlying monosomy 7.","['Liang, H', 'Fairman, J', 'Claxton, D F', 'Nowell, P C', 'Green, E D', 'Nagarajan, L']","['Liang H', 'Fairman J', 'Claxton DF', 'Nowell PC', 'Green ED', 'Nagarajan L']","['Department of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, University of Texas M.

However, this has proven difficult because the viral RNA is spliced when it is synthesized in the nucleus of a producer cell. We describe a novel approach to avoid this problem. In our system the retroviral RNA is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the cell, not in the nucleus, in a reaction driven by the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) expression system. The approach was tested with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus genome containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in association with an intron. This was inserted into a SFV transcription plasmid and the corresponding SFV vector RNA was transcribed in vitro. BHK-21 cells were then transfected with this vector RNA together with two additional SFV vectors that encode the Moloney murine leukemia virus packaging proteins. Retrovirus vectors containing intron-CAT sequences were produced at titers up to 1.3 x 10(6) infectious particles per ml during a 5-hr incubation period. The vectors faithfully transduced the intron-containing CAT gene into NIH 3T3 cells, where the intron-CAT RNA was subjected to efficient splicing and used for high level enzyme expression. Thus, the results show that intron containing genes can be efficiently packaged into retrovirus vectors by the SFV expression system.","['Li, K J', 'Garoff, H']","['Li KJ', 'Garoff H']","['Department of Biosciences at Novum, Karolinska Institute, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Alphavirus/*genetics', 'Animals', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Introns/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice']",1998/05/09 00:00,1998/05/09 00:01,['1998/05/09 00:00'],"['1998/05/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.7.3650 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Mar 31;95(7):3650-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.7.3650.,,,,,,,,PMC19890,,,,,,,,

The crystal structure of human recombinant MTCP-1 protein has been determined at 2.0 A resolution by using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data from selenomethionine-enriched protein and refined to an R factor of 0.21. MTCP-1 folds into a compact eight-stranded beta barrel structure with a short helix between the fourth and fifth strands. The topology is unique. The structure of TCL-1 has been predicted by molecular modeling based on 40% amino acid sequence identity with MTCP-1. The identical residues are clustered inside the barrel and on the surface at one side of the barrel. The overall structure of MTCP-1 superficially resembles the structures of proteins in the lipocalin family and calycin superfamily. These proteins have diverse functions, including transport of retinol, fatty acids, chromophores, pheromones, synthesis of prostaglandin, immune modulation, and cell regulation. However, MTCP-1 differs in the topology of the beta strands.

The hematological features and the evidence for monoclonal integration of provirus DNA in the leukemic cells revealed that the leukemia was an ATL-like disease. The expression of surface markers on the leukemic cells indicated that they were defined as an activated CD8+ T cell subset. Together with the finding that seven in vitro spontaneously STLV-I-transformed cell lines were CD4-CD8+, it is likely that CD8+ T cells are transformed by STLV-I in AGMs, in contrast with human ATL. Finally, we assessed characteristics of the CD8 chains on these transformed cells. The result indicated that the leukemic cells expressed only the alpha chains but not the beta chains.

Thus, STLV-I may preferentially transform CD8+ (both alphaalpha+ and alphabeta+) T cells in AGMs.","['Akari, H', 'Ono, F', 'Sakakibara, I', 'Takahashi, H', 'Murayama, Y', 'Hiyaoka, A', 'Terao, K', 'Otani, I', 'Mukai, R', 'Adachi, A', 'Yoshikawa, Y']","['Akari H', 'Ono F', 'Sakakibara I', 'Takahashi H', 'Murayama Y', 'Hiyaoka A', 'Terao K', 'Otani I', 'Mukai R', 'Adachi A', 'Yoshikawa Y']","['Tsukuba Primate Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/immunology/*veterinary/*virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*veterinary/*virology', 'Monkey Diseases/immunology/*virology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/metabolism', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/virology']",1998/03/31 00:00,1998/03/31 00:01,['1998/03/31 00:00'],"['1998/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1998.14.367 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1998 Mar 1;14(4):367-71. doi: 10.1089/aid.1998.14.367.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intraperitoneal injection with SAGP (20 mg protein/kg/day for 4 consecutive days) prolonged the life span of mice inoculated i.p. with Ehrlich ascite carcinoma cells and methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma cells (Meth A) up to 244% and 169% of that of the control mice, respectively. These in vivo antitumor effects were reduced in immunosuppressed mice. The effector spleen cells from the Meth A-inoculated and SAGP-injected mice showed a considerable cytostatic activity on Meth A cells in vitro, and immunosuppression studies suggested that carrageenan-sensitive and/or asialo-GM1 positive spleen cells are responsible for the in vivo antitumor effect of SAGP. SAGP inhibited the cell growth of cultured cell lines including transformed hamster embryonic lung cells, murine leukemia L 1210, Meth A and human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells. The IC50s for the cell growth of these cells were all below 0.1 microg protein/ml. SAGP inhibited the incorporation of nucleic acid precursors into Meth A cells. It seems that sulfhydryl groups of the SAGP molecule are essential for the expression of the antitumor action of SAGP. The cell growth-inhibitory activity of SAGP was diminished in Meth A cells preincubated with pertussis toxin (IAP), whereas it was augmented in the cells preincubated with cholera toxin (CTX), suggesting the involvement of toxin-sensitive GTP (G)-proteins in the SAGP-action. IAP and CTX-catalyzed ADP ribosylation assays confirmed that SAGP augmented the activity of IAP-sensitive G-protein. In addition, this augmentation was detected neither in Meth A cells incubated with heat-inactivated SAGP nor in SAGP-insensitive L929 cells. SAGP induced apoptosis in Meth A and HL60 cells as assessed by DNA fragmentation. A single dose injection of SAGP (100 mg protein/kg, i.v., s.c., or i.p.) into mice produced no toxic signs except occasional pain responses observed for one week after the injection. Thus, SAGP is a low toxic substance that shows in vivo antitumor activity by modulating immune responses of the host, and also exhibits in vitro cell-growth inhibition through IAP-sensitive G-protein.","['Yoshida, J', 'Takamura, S', 'Nishio, M']","['Yoshida J', 'Takamura S', 'Nishio M']","['Department of Pharmacology, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa, Japan. yayuyo@kanazawa-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Bacterial Proteins/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glycoproteins/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Streptococcus pyogenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/03/31 00:00,1998/03/31 00:01,['1998/03/31 00:00'],"['1998/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0024320597011429 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(97)01142-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 1998;62(12):1043-53. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(97)01142-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)']",,,,43,,,,,,,,,,,

By utilizing a digoxigenin-labeled chromosome 7 probe, we demonstrate that, in patients with monosomy 7, both erythroid and myelomonocytic progenitors can be karyotypically aberrant. In addition, significant levels of diploid clonogenic cells persist (as reflected by the presence of between 14% and 43% diploid colonies) despite the detection of only monosomy 7-bearing bone marrow metaphases as assessed by standard cytogenetic techniques. Our observations demonstrate that digoxigenin-based DNA in situ hybridization (DISH) can be performed on individually microaspirated colonies for determination of lineage derivation.

Positive findings for BCR/ABL can be seen not only in patients who go on to relapse but also in patients who, after years of follow-up, remain in complete remission. The cause for the lack of concordance between PCR findings and relapse is not clear. We identified two patients with CML who had rare pseudo-Gaucher cells in their bone marrow aspirate specimens prior to, and at 1, and 6 or 12 months following syngeneic or allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation. After the transplant, the patients obtained clinical remission and were shown to be cytogenetically normal and to have germline MBCR in blood or bone marrow by Southern analysis. One patient was PCR-positive for BCR/ABL in the marrow at 12 months. In order to determine whether the pseudo-Gaucher histiocytes were BCR/ABL-positive, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization and probes for MBCR and ABL and analyzed Wright-stained smears to correlate molecular cytogenetic findings with cell type. On three aspirate smears from each patient (at 6 or 12 months post-transplant), all of the pseudo-Gaucher cells studied (10/10 in one patient and 12/12 in the other) showed the fusion for BCR/ABL. Other cells analyzed randomly (erythroid precursors, granulocytes and rare monocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells) did not. Our cases provide the first proof that pseudo-Gaucher cells carry the BCR/ABL fusion. Furthermore, they illustrate that these cells can be found in the marrow for up to 12 months following transplantation. Our results permit speculation that pseudo-Gaucher cells or other long-lived histocytes may be one cause of persistent PCR positivity after transplantation that is not predictive of disease relapse.","['Anastasi, J', 'Musvee, T', 'Roulston, D', 'Domer, P H', 'Larson, R A', 'Vardiman, J W']","['Anastasi J', 'Musvee T', 'Roulston D', 'Domer PH', 'Larson RA', 'Vardiman JW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medical Center, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histiocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male']",1998/03/31 00:00,1998/03/31 00:01,['1998/03/31 00:00'],"['1998/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400900 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Feb;12(2):233-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400900.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the patient sub-group on salvage chemotherapy. Pamidronate treatment was also significantly associated with prolonged survival. To test if this drug could induce direct antitumor effects, we exposed myeloma cells to increasing concentrations of Pamidronate or a more potent bisphosphonate, Zoledronate. A concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect was detected on four of five myeloma cell lines as well as three specimens obtained directly from myeloma patients. Zoledronate-induced cytotoxicity was significantly greater than that of Pamidronate. Cytotoxicity could not be explained by bisphosphonate-induced chelation of extracellular calcium or secondary decrease in production of the myeloma growth factor interleukin-6. Morphological examination, DNA electrophoresis and cell cycle analysis indicated that the bisphosphonate-induced cytotoxic effect consisted of a combination of cytostasis and apoptotic myeloma cell death. Enforced expression of BCL-2 protected against the apoptotic death but not against cytostasis. Most cytotoxic effects were seen between 10 and 100 microM of drug. The results suggest a possible direct anti-tumor effect in myeloma patients treated with bisphosphonates which may participate in their significantly increased survival.

Event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years were, respectively, 50 and 77%. Significant adverse prognostic factors were: histology (CD30- T cell lymphoma) and diffuse cutaneous disease (>10% of skin). The presence of nodal involvement was only significant for EFS. When compared to 140 non-cutaneous lymphoma patients included in the same trial and fully matched for the main clinical characteristics, OS was similar. In conclusion, PCLL behaves like other localized B or T cell extranodal lymphomas with the same prognostic factors (LDH, ECOG, age) except for CD30+ PCLL which have a very good prognosis.","['Brice, P', 'Cazals, D', 'Mounier, N', 'Verola, O', 'Neidhart-Berard, A M', 'Remenieras, L', 'Deconinck, E', 'Doyen, C', 'Hamelsand, J', 'Molina, T', 'Moulonguet, I', 'Gisselbrecht, C']","['Brice P', 'Cazals D', 'Mounier N', 'Verola O', 'Neidhart-Berard AM', 'Remenieras L', 'Deconinck E', 'Doyen C', 'Hamelsand J', 'Molina T', 'Moulonguet I', 'Gisselbrecht C']","[""Institut d' Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis and Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Vindesine/administration & dosage']",1998/03/31 00:00,1998/03/31 00:01,['1998/03/31 00:00'],"['1998/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400911 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Feb;12(2):213-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400911.,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'LNH 87 protocol', 'M-BACOD protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genesis was found to be a transcriptional repressor expressed almost exclusively in embryonic stem cells or embryonal carcinoma cells. This expression rapidly declined when these cells were stimulated to differentiate. This expression pattern suggested that Genesis may play a role in cellular differentiation. To explore that possibility in a heterologous system of differentiation, Genesis was stably transduced into the IL-3-dependent myeloid cell line 32D using a retroviral expression vector. 32D cells overexpressing Genesis failed to mature normally when stimulated with G-CSF but continued to proliferate and maintained a primitive phenotype. This finding implicates Genesis in the regulation of development, and also implies that there may be common transcription pathways for many developing tissues.","['Xu, D', 'Yoder, M', 'Sutton, J', 'Hromas, R']","['Xu D', 'Yoder M', 'Sutton J', 'Hromas R']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology and the Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis 46202-5121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/*physiology']",1998/03/31 00:00,1998/03/31 00:01,['1998/03/31 00:00'],"['1998/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400948 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Feb;12(2):207-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400948.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,['HL48915/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined SHP-1 protein and transcript in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of an FHLH family. Our results show that the FHLH patient and the parents express comparable levels of a single SHP-1 protein and that the SHP-1 cDNA clone from the patient contains no mutation in the coding region. Interestingly, a reduced association of SHP-1 with the Jak family kinase Tyk2 was detected in the patient and the defect appears to have been inherited from one of the parents. This reduced SHP-1/Tyk2 association is likely due to a defect in Tyk2 or in cellular factors regulating Tyk2, because we found no abnormalities in SHP-1 or in SHP-1 association with the other Jak kinases. These data demonstrate that the SHP-1 gene is intact in FHLH and that the defect in some cases with this disease may involve signaling molecules regulated by SHP-1.","['Tabrizi, M', 'Yang, W', 'Jiao, H', 'DeVries, E M', 'Platanias, L C', 'Arico, M', 'Yi, T']","['Tabrizi M', 'Yang W', 'Jiao H', 'DeVries EM', 'Platanias LC', 'Arico M', 'Yi T']","['Department of Cancer Biology, The Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'COS Cells/metabolism', 'Child', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/blood/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/enzymology', '*Mutation', 'Pedigree', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/blood/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'TYK2 Kinase']",1998/03/31 00:00,1998/03/31 00:01,['1998/03/31 00:00'],"['1998/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400949 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Feb;12(2):200-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400949.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty AML cell samples were tested for P-gp expression using MRK16 monoclonal antibody and flow cytometry. Among them, 12 samples were selected for sorting experiments according to the following two criteria: their clonogenic capacity in methylcellulose in the presence of 5637 conditioned medium, and the heterogeneity of P-gp distribution in leukemic cells. For each of these 12 samples, leukemic cells which displayed the highest P-gp expression level (P-gp++) and P-gp- leukemic cells were sorted after MRK16 staining and seeded into methylcellulose for primary clonogenic assay. In each case, the number of CFU-L in the P-gp fraction was significantly higher than that of the P-gp++ fraction (P < 0.01); the median number of CFU-L for 10(5) seeded cells being 147 (range 3-1855) and 495 (range 60-4100) for P-gp++ and P-gp- populations, respectively. Furthermore, in order to correlate clonogenic capacity and P-gp function, AML cells were stained with rhodamine 123 (Rh 123), washed and then sorted after 4 h incubation at 37 degrees C in Rh 123-free media on the basis of their residual fluorescence intensity before plating. For each of six samples, we found that the number of CFU-L in the AML cell fraction which displayed the most efficient Rh 123 efflux capacity (Rh 123dull) was significantly higher compared to that of the AML cell fraction which displayed high residual fluorescence signal (Rh 123bright) (P = 0.05); the median number of CFU-L for 10(5) seeded cells being 1025 (range 250-2240) and 296 (range 11-838) for Rh 123dull and Rh 123bright populations, respectively.

High-affinity IL-6R were detected on leukemic cells from 12 (80%) patients. Binding sites per cell ranged from 140 to 3580 (median 920; mean 1240), with dissociation constants of 0.26 to 0.71 nM. We therefore assessed the in vitro sensitivity of IL-6R+ AML cells to treatment with a recombinant IL6-Pseudomonas exotoxin fusion protein (IL6-PE4E), using the XTT cytotoxicity assay. Leukemic cells from eight patients had ID50 values (concentration of IL6-PE4E producing a 50% decrease in cell viability) of <1000 ng/ml (median, 87 ng/ml; mean, 262 ng/ml). Sensitivity to IL6-PE4E correlated significantly with receptor number. Normal bone marrow mononuclear cells had undetectable IL6-R expression (<20 receptors/cell) and were relatively resistant to IL6-PE4E. To test the efficacy of IL6-PE4E for ex vivo purging in an autologous stem cell transplantation setting, we incubated primary IL-6R+ AML cells with 10(3) ng/ml IL6-PE4E for 24 h, followed by inoculation into SCID mice. Mice receiving treated cells showed no leukemic engraftment, while all mice receiving untreated or control-treated cells developed leukemia with a median presymptomatic interval of 55 days. In recipients of IL6-PE4E treated cells, no evidence of occult leukemia was detected by PCR analysis of blood and bone marrow cells at 185 days postinoculation. These data suggest that IL-6R are expressed on leukemic cells from a substantial percentage of pediatric AML patients. Furthermore, leukemic cells expressing high numbers of IL6-R may be sensitive to IL6-PE4E in an ex vivo purging protocol.","['Boayue, K B', 'Gu, L', 'Yeager, A M', 'Kreitman, R J', 'Findley, H W']","['Boayue KB', 'Gu L', 'Yeager AM', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Findley HW']","['Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*ADP Ribose Transferases', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Virulence Factors']",1998/03/31 00:00,1998/03/31 00:01,['1998/03/31 00:00'],"['1998/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400914 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Feb;12(2):182-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400914.,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (IL-6-PE40 protein, chimeric)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",,,,,,['R29 CA72020-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 11 patients with indolent mastocytosis (category I), mastocytosis with an associated hematologic disorder (category II), or aggressive mastocytosis (category III); a patient with CMML unassociated with mastocytosis, and PBMCs from 13 normal subjects, we examined the level of expression of c-kit mRNA along with other c-kit isoforms to determine if overexpression of the c-kit receptor was associated with mastocytosis. Using quantitative competitive PCR, c-kit mRNA levels on average were found to be statistically elevated in the five patients with mastocytosis with an associated hematologic disorder and in the patient with aggressive mastocytosis as compared with controls, but not elevated in patients with indolent mastocytosis. The relative mRNA expression for the two c-kit isoforms was not significantly different in the mastocytosis patients compared with controls. This demonstration of the overexpression of c-kit mRNA in mastocytosis, and particularly those patients with clinical evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome, adds evidence to support the conclusion that mastocytosis, at least in some patients, is a feature of myelodysplasia; and suggests that determination of c-kit mRNA expression in PBMCs may provide an additional approach to assessing prognosis.","['Nagata, H', 'Worobec, A S', 'Semere, T', 'Metcalfe, D D']","['Nagata H', 'Worobec AS', 'Semere T', 'Metcalfe DD']","['Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1881, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*biosynthesis/blood', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/03/31 00:00,1998/03/31 00:01,['1998/03/31 00:00'],"['1998/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400906 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Feb;12(2):175-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400906.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our main results were: (1) plasmin was formed on the surface of APL cells; (2) RA stimulated transiently plasmin generation and increased uPAR mRNA level; (3) IFNs alpha and gamma potentiated RA in its effects on uPA and plasmin activities and on uPAR level; (4) dexamethasone suppressed totally the effect of RA on uPA induction and plasminogen activation; and (5) IFNs and dexamethasone alone did not have potent effects on plasminogen activation.

Analysis was extended to most females with the demonstration of differential DNA methylation patterns on active and inactive X-chromosome alleles and uses Southern blotting or PCR of either restriction enzyme polymorphisms, eg PGK, HPRT, or variable number tandem repeat sequences, eg M27beta, HUMARA. More recently RNA polymorphisms have been reported enabling direct analysis of expressed transcripts from the two alleles. Interpretation of clonality requires knowledge of an individual's constitutive XCIP as skewing (>75% expression of one allele) occurs in a significant proportion of hematologically normal females, probably due to the stem cell pool size at the time of Lyonization. Furthermore, acquired skewing occurs with increasing age. For myeloid disorders in the young, T lymphocytes serve as a suitable control XCIP, but interpretation of imbalanced XCIPs in the elderly can be difficult. In AML, XCIPs at presentation are consistent with a clonal disorder whereas in remission comparison with normal controls suggests that true clonal remission is infrequent. Sequential analysis of samples may be helpful in some patients in order to determine evolving clonal populations.","['Gale, R E', 'Linch, D C']","['Gale RE', 'Linch DC']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Medical School, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*pathology', 'X Chromosome']",1998/03/31 00:00,1998/03/31 00:01,['1998/03/31 00:00'],"['1998/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400935 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Feb;12(2):117-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400935.,,,,,36,,,,,,,,,,,

This review discusses the impact that these studies have had on our understanding of hematopoietic stem cell relationships and the pathogenesis of human neoplasia in general. To appreciate the special role played by studies on clonality, it is necessary to consider how little was known about the origin of leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders and the limited techniques available for their study in the early to mid 1960s. Dr Fialkow and his coworkers were the first to show that myeloproliferative disorders and acute myelogenous leukemias (AML) are clonal diseases at the time of diagnosis and to elucidate the level of differentiation manifested by the originating cell type. Although the myelodysplastic disorders were found to involve a pluripotent stem cell, heterogeneity was found in the level of stem cell involvement in AML. Evidence was obtained to support a multistep pathogenesis of these diseases as well as a clonal but cytogenetically normal stage in some cases of Ph-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplasia.","['Raskind, W H', 'Steinmann, L', 'Najfeld, V']","['Raskind WH', 'Steinmann L', 'Najfeld V']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195-7720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/*pathology']",1998/03/31 00:00,1998/03/31 00:01,['1998/03/31 00:00'],"['1998/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400934 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Feb;12(2):108-16. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400934.,,,,,121,,"['R01 CA16448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA16448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

One type of T-cell leukemia, T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, is consistently associated with chromosome rearrangements characterized by the juxtaposition of the TCRA locus on chromosome 14q11 and either the TCL1 gene on 14q32.1 or the MTCP1 gene on Xq28. The TCL1 gene is preferentially expressed in cells of early lymphoid lineage; its product is a 14 kDa protein (p14TCL1), expressed in the cytoplasm. p14TCL1 has strong sequence similarity with one product of the MTCP1 gene, p13MTCP1 (41% identical and 61% similar). The functions of the TCL1 and MTCP1 genes are not known yet. They have no sequence similarity to any other published sequence, including those of well-documented oncogene families responsible for leukemia. In order to gain a more fundamental insight into the role of this particular class of oncogenes, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of p14TCL1. RESULTS: The crystal structure of p14TCL1 has been determined at 2.5 A resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the solution structure of p13MTCP1, revealing p14TCL1 to be an all-beta protein consisting of an eight-stranded antiparallel beta barrel with a novel topology. The barrel consists of two four-stranded beta-meander motifs, related by a twofold axis and connected by a long loop. This internal pseudo-twofold symmetry was not expected on basis of the sequence alone, but structure-based sequence analysis of the two motifs shows that they are related. The structures of p13MTCP1 and p14TCL1 are very similar, diverging only in regions that are either flexible and/or involved in crystal packing. p14TCL1 forms a tight crystallographic dimer, probably corresponding to the 28 kDa species identified in solution by gel filtration experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Structural similarities between p14TCL1 and p13MTCP1 suggest that their (unknown) function may be analogous. This is confirmed by the fact that these proteins are implicated in analogous diseases. Their structure does not show similarity to other oncoproteins of known structure, confirming their classification as a novel class of oncoproteins.","['Hoh, F', 'Yang, Y S', 'Guignard, L', 'Padilla, A', 'Stern, M H', 'Lhoste, J M', 'van Tilbeurgh, H']","['Hoh F', 'Yang YS', 'Guignard L', 'Padilla A', 'Stern MH', 'Lhoste JM', 'van Tilbeurgh H']","['Centre de Biochimie Structurale, Faculte de Pharmacie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Structure,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",101087697,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry']",1998/03/31 00:00,1998/03/31 00:01,['1998/03/31 00:00'],"['1998/03/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0969-2126(98)00017-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0969-2126(98)00017-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Structure. 1998 Feb 15;6(2):147-55. doi: 10.1016/s0969-2126(98)00017-3.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MTCP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,['PDB/1JSG'],,,,,,,,,,

However, the latter parameter did not change during 4 hours of incubation. Nevertheless, AlF(-4) increased fragmentation of 3H-thymidine-labelled DNA by 2-4 times. This effect may be suppressed by cultivation of cells with 20 mkM nicotinamide (inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase enzyme). We found that incubation of K562 and YAC-1 cells with 10 mM nicotinamide for 24 hours much reduced their susceptibility to non-MHC-restricted lysis by rat spleen cells. This effect may be induced by a share of intracellular NAD+ and NADH from destroyed K562 cells; their concentration in cells increased under the influence of nicotinamide by 3 times, but this effect should be the least because in these conditions nicotinamide does not influence the survival of K562 cells. The effect of nicotinamide in both cases may be explained by suppression of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase activity and, thus, the rate of DNA reparation. Analysis of AlF(-4) and nicotinamide effects on the K562 cells enables us to suppose that suppression of the K562 proliferation by tetrafluoroaluminate results in accumulation of reversed damages of DNA.","['Anisimov, A G', 'Bolotnikov, I A']","['Anisimov AG', 'Bolotnikov IA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Petrozavodsk University.']",['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,IM,"['Aluminum Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Stability', 'Fluorides/*pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*agonists', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Niacinamide/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tsitologiia. 1997;39(9):822-8.,"['0 (Aluminum Compounds)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '21340-02-3 (tetrafluoroaluminate)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'Q80VPU408O (Fluorides)']",,,"Nikotinamid ponizhaet destabilizatsiiu DNK v kletkakh K562, obrabotannykh AlF(-4).",,,,,,,,,,,,

One postulated mechanism for its ameliorative action on tumor growth is via stimulating cells of the immune system and its accessory cells. Mice of the A/J strain have an unusually high frequency of leukemia, whereas C57BL/6J mice rarely develop leukemia, and moreover, unlike A/J mice, have strong resistance to a variety of pathogens. The purpose of the study reported here was twofold: to investigate whether A/J mice have quantitative deficiencies in their specific and nonspecific disease defense mechanisms (lymphoid, granuloid, and monocytoid cells) relative to those of C57BL/6J mice, and if so, whether in vivo administration of an ATRA could quantitatively augment these cells in the major organs housing them: the spleen and the bone marrow. Furthermore, for the lymphoid and granuloid lineages, absolute numbers of precursors and of differentiated (mature) cells also were enumerated. The results indicate that A/J mice have significantly lower numbers of lymphoid, granuloid, and monocytoid--but not erythroid--cells in the spleen and/or bone marrow than do C57BL/6J mice. Also, sensitivity to ATRA was generally more profound in A/J mice than in C57BL/6 mice with respect to several hemopoietic cell lineages. These observations collectively suggest a need for considerable prudence in selection of inbred strains of mice, not only because of the possibility of wide interstrain variations in hemopoietic and immune cell-mediated functions, but also because of potential differences in the responses of various strains of common laboratory mice to pharmacologic agents.","['Miller, S C', 'Kearney, S L']","['Miller SC', 'Kearney SL']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Lab Anim Sci,Laboratory animal science,1266503,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Immunity/drug effects', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Species Specificity', 'Spleen/*cytology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Anim Sci. 1998 Feb;48(1):74-80.,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, CSF sL-selectin was also assayed in 17 children with ALL, who remained in complete remission at least for a year and, as controls, in 12 children without malignant or meningeal disorders. There was no significant difference in CSF sL-selectin levels between the children with ALL without evidence of meningeal involvement and the controls (1.34 +/- 0.21 ng/ml, 1.46 +/- 0.18 ng/ml respectively, p > 0.05). However, in children with CNS leukemia, not only at the time CNS involvement was diagnosed, but also 29-91 days before the diagnosis of CNS leukemia, the concentrations of the CSF sL-selectin (12.41 +/- 2.14 ng/ml, 7.70 +/- 1.60 ng/ml respectively) were significantly higher than those in controls (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 respectively). After treatment and disappearance of the blasts in CSF, sL-selectin was found to be decreased and even normalized in the majority of children who had meningeal involvement (2.87 +/- 2.14 ng/ml). In 5 children, the CSF sL-selectin remained high, after the blasts in CSF had disappeared and CNS leukemia recurred within 3 months in 4 of these 5 children. In conclusion, assay of sL-selectin in CSF seems to be a good diagnostic tool in the detection of CNS involvement in children with ALL. This method may also be used as an indicator, in prediction of the CNS leukemia, which is going to develop.","['Dagdemir, A', 'Ertem, U', 'Duru, F', 'Kirazli, S']","['Dagdemir A', 'Ertem U', 'Duru F', 'Kirazli S']","[""Sami Ulus Children's Hospital Department of Pediatric Oncology, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis/*secondary', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Solubility']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809092695 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Jan;28(3-4):391-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199809092695.,['126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-five patients (3 primary refractory, 22 relapsed) were treated. Patients received 3 days of ""CECA"" therapy as follows: cyclophosphamide (CTX) 1 g/m2 i.v. over 2 hrs., etoposide (VP-16) 200 mg/m2 i.v. over 3 hr, carboplatin (CBP) 150 mg/m2 i.v. over 24 hours and ara-C 1 g/m2 over 2 hr.

Two of the patients achieving CR received allogeneic BMT in CR (at 18 and 22 weeks): one died of fungal infection on day 50 and the other, who had CNS involvement at relapse, is alive 24 months post transplant. Toxicity was tolerable: one patient each developed grade III diarrhea and mucositis, another had grade III cardiac toxicity, a fourth developed a grade IV bilirubin elevation. Single, 2, and 3 or more infectious episodes occurred in 10, 5 and 4 patients respectively. This regimen showed definite anti-leukemic activity: the 3 patients achieving CR were among 23 patients with a 1%, 10% or 20% expectation for second CR attainment.

The aim of the study was to determine how these two techniques could substitute or complement one another. The study sample consisted of 107 adult patients with de novo myeloid or lymphoid acute leukemias, tested by both techniques in 1994 and 1995, for identification of translocations t(9;22), t(8;21), t(15;17), t(4;11), t(1;19), the inversion of chromosome 16 and for monosomy 5 or 7 (or deletion of their long arms) and trisomy 8. The criterion for diagnostic effectiveness of these strategies was the rate of detection of true positive anomalies which are clinically relevant, according to the current state of knowledge. On the basis of these observations six alternative strategies at diagnosis were compared (each technique alone or different combinations of the two techniques). The study shows that:-for ALL, PCR alone appears the most cost-effective strategy;-for AML, cytogenetic analysis alone is the best strategy;-sequential strategies are more cost effective than simultaneous use of both techniques for minimising risk of false negatives.","['Tonnaire, G', 'Gabert, J', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, M', 'Mozziconacci, M J', 'Toiron, Y', 'Sainty, D', 'Maraninchi, D', 'Moatti, J P']","['Tonnaire G', 'Gabert J', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Toiron Y', 'Sainty D', 'Maraninchi D', 'Moatti JP']","['INSERM U 379, Institute Paoli-Calmettes, Cancer Centre, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Cytogenetics/*economics/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*economics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809092691 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Jan;28(3-4):363-70. doi: 10.3109/10428199809092691.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression was quantified using FACS and a correlation between drug-induced apoptosis and Bcl-2/Bax was established. Cells were then sorted into viable and nonviable populations according to their forward and side-scatter characteristics and re-analysed for Bcl-2/Bax. The most resistant cells had elevated Bcl-2 levels and low Bax expression. Furthermore, those cells which were undergoing apoptosis showed only a marginal reduction in Bcl-2 expression, but significantly elevated Bax expression following exposure to chlorambucil. The Bcl-2/Bax was significantly greater in the cell fractions resistant to chlorambucil-induced apoptosis.

Intensification of induction treatment with etoposide and high dose cytarabine does not alter the CR rate but appears to significantly improve the subsequent outcome. Updated results of the comparison of high dose cytarabine with daunorubicin and etoposide in induction (HIDAC-3-7) versus a standard dose combination (7-3-7) demonstrated a highly significant increase in relapse free survival, (RFS) on the high dose arm (p = 0.007) with RFS of 48% at 5 years with HIDAC-3-7 and 25% on 7-3-7. The high dose arm had a more modest survival advantage at 5 years of 33% compared with 25% on standard treatment, possibly because of a higher initial death rate with HIDAC-3-7. The improvement seen in patients with CR after high dose induction appear to parallel results obtained with post-remission therapies intensified with high dose cytarabine. These studies provide clinical evidence that a dose-response effect is present for cytarabine in AML. Intensified treatment is more toxic, gives more profound myelosuppression post-remission and has been shown to benefit younger patients only. Issues of patient selection and the optimal placement of intensification in the treatment sequence require further study. In the future, it is likely that remission duration may be a useful clinical tool to study the influence of new induction therapies on residual resistant leukemia.","['Bishop, J F', 'Matthews, J P', 'Young, G A', 'Bradstock, K', 'Lowenthal, R M']","['Bishop JF', 'Matthews JP', 'Young GA', 'Bradstock K', 'Lowenthal RM']","['Sydney Cancer Center, Royal Prince, Alfred Hospital, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia. jbishop@canc.rpa.cs.nsw.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809092687 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Jan;28(3-4):315-27. doi: 10.3109/10428199809092687.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,82,,,,,,,,,,,

In support of this conclusion is our recent finding that the VH region gene repertoire of the leukemic B-cells from CLL patients with AIHA is rather biased and characterised by the over-representation of the 51p1 VH gene. On the other hand, it appears relatively certain that the pathogenic anti-erythrocyte antibodies in CLL patients with AIHA are produced by remnant normal B-cells, and that the antibodies expressed by the leukemic CD5+ B-cells do not directly bind red blood cells (RBC). Of interest, the antibodies produced by the leukemic B-cells from CLL patients with AIHA might have in common rheumatoid factor (RF) activity. These data indicate that the antibodies produced by the leukemic B-cells from CLL patients with AIHA are not directly involved in red blood cell destruction, but may be involved in the induction or amplification of a polyclonal anti-RBC response. Finally, we discuss the possible clinical implications of our finding that CLL patients with leukemic cells expressing the 51p1 VH gene may be at a higher risk to develop autoimmune hemolytic anemia.","['Efremov, D G', 'Ivanovski, M', 'Burrone, O R']","['Efremov DG', 'Ivanovski M', 'Burrone OR']","['International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/immunology/pathology']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809092684 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Jan;28(3-4):285-93. doi: 10.3109/10428199809092684.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,

The RB-1 gene was analyzed in several studies by protein-, RNA and DNA-techniques in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as well as in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The frequency of RB-1 inactivation in ALL-patients ranged between 30% and 64% in several studies. Structural abnormalities of the RB-1 gene were reported in 18% of ALL-patients and in 27% of Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, respectively. The proportion of AML-patients with absent RB-1 protein expression ranged between 19% and 55%. Structural RB-1-abnormalities in AML were predominantly reported in leukemias with monocytic differentiation. Furthermore, the prognostic value of an abnormal RB-1 gene expression was also estimated in some studies. In childhood ALL RB-1 inactivation was reported to have prognostic significance while in contrast, in another study on adults no prognostic value of RB-1 was found. In 4 out of 5 documented studies AML-patients with RB-1 inactivation generally had a poorer prognosis. In conclusion, RB-1 inactivation is frequently observed in acute leukemia. The prognostic value of low RB-1 expression is controversial but the majority of published studies found low RB-1 expression to be a negative prognostic predictor, in acute leukemia.","['Sauerbrey, A', 'Stammler, G', 'Zintl, F', 'Volm, M']","['Sauerbrey A', 'Stammler G', 'Zintl F', 'Volm M']","['University of Jena, Department of Pediatrics, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*genetics']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809092683 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Jan;28(3-4):275-83. doi: 10.3109/10428199809092683.,['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)'],,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,

There is evidence that the selective expansion and growth advantage of malignant hematopoietic progenitors in CML may be related, at least in part, to their deficient responsiveness to normal negative regulation by the marrow stromal microenvironment and that interferon-alpha may restore normal hematopoiesis in CML by restoring normal microenvironmental regulation of malignant CML progenitor proliferation. In normal hematopoiesis, beta1 integrin receptors mediate progenitor adhesion to stroma. Stimulation of beta1 integrin receptors on normal progenitors results in transmission of proliferation inhibitory signals. CML progenitors demonstrate defective beta1 integrin receptor-mediated adhesion and regulation of proliferation. We have shown that interferon-alpha can restore both beta1 integrin mediated adhesion as well as integrin-mediated proliferation inhibition of CML progenitors. Interferon-alpha enhances CML integrin function through direct effects on CML progenitors as well as indirect effects on stroma. Restored beta1 integrin-mediated regulation of malignant CML progenitor proliferation may result in restoration of normal hematopoiesis in CML patients treated with interferon-alpha. There is evidence that abnormal integrin mediated signaling in CML progenitors may result from abnormalities in integrin-cytoskeletal interactions induced by the p210BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase. Although the exact mechanisms by which interferon-alpha restores normal integrin signaling in CML are not known, preliminary studies indicate that this may at least partly be related to the restoration of normal integrin-cytoskeletal interactions. The above studies offer some insights into the mechanisms of abnormal hematopoietic regulation in CML and the mechanisms by which interferon-alpha may restore normal hematopoiesis, in this disease.","['Bhatia, R', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Bhatia R', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA. rbhatia@smtplink.coh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*physiology', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809092680 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Jan;28(3-4):241-54. doi: 10.3109/10428199809092680.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the antiproliferative effects of actinonin on human and murine leukemia and lymphoma cells. Actinonin inhibited growth of NB4 and HL60 human cell lines and AKR mouse leukemia cells in vitro with an IC50 of about 2-5 micrograms/ml. The inhibitory effect on CD13-positive cells was not blocked by pretreatment with the anti-CD13/APN monoclonal antibody F23, which binds with high affinity to the active site of CD13/APN and blocks its enzymatic activity. Moreover, F23 alone was not inhibitory to CD13-positive cells. Furthermore, a similar inhibitory IC50 of actinonin was seen in the CD13-negative cell lines RAJI and DAUDI human lymphoma. These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of actinonin is not mediated by inhibition of CD13/APN. Cell cycle analysis showed that actinonin induces a G1 arrest in HL60 and NB4 cells; apoptosis was observed in 20-35% of the cells as measured by intracellular flow cytometry. To assess whether these effects could be seen in vivo, the effect of actinonin on the syngeneic AKR mouse leukemia model was evaluated. Actinonin showed dose-dependent antitumor effects on AKR leukemia in vivo, resulting in a survival advantage.

Most previous studies of this agent have focused on a three-drug regimen of chemical modulators that includes 6AN. In the present study, the effect of single-agent 6AN on the efficacy of selected antineoplastic drugs was assessed in vitro. Colony-forming assays using human tumor cell lines demonstrated that pretreatment with 30-250 microM 6AN for 18 h resulted in increased sensitivity to the DNA cross-linking agent cisplatin, with 6-, 11-, and 17-fold decreases in the cisplatin dose that diminishes colony formation by 90% being observed in K562 leukemia cells, A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells, and T98G glioblastoma cells, respectively. Morphological examination revealed increased numbers of apoptotic cells after treatment with 6AN and cisplatin compared to cisplatin alone. 6AN also sensitized cells to melphalan and nitrogen mustard but not to chlorambucil, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, etoposide, or daunorubicin. In additional studies undertaken to elucidate the mechanism underlying the sensitization to cisplatin, atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed that 6AN had no effect on the rate of removal of platinum (Pt) adducts from DNA. Instead, 6AN treatment was accompanied by an increase in Pt-DNA adducts that paralleled the degree of sensitization. This effect was not attributable to 6AN-induced decreases in glutathione or NAD+, because other agents that depleted these detoxification cofactors (buthionine sulfoximine and 3-acetylpyridine, respectively) did not increase Pt-DNA adducts. On the contrary, 6AN treatment increased cellular accumulation of cisplatin. Further experiments revealed that 6AN was metabolized to 6-aminonicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (6ANAD+). Concurrent administration of nicotinamide and 6AN had minimal effect on cellular 6AN accumulation but abolished the formation of 6ANAD+, the increase in Pt-DNA adducts, and the sensitizing effect of 6AN in clonogenic assays. These observations identify 6AN as a potential modulator of cisplatin sensitivity and suggest that the 6AN metabolite 6ANAD+ exerts this effect by increasing cisplatin accumulation and subsequent formation of Pt-DNA adducts.","['Budihardjo, I I', 'Walker, D L', 'Svingen, P A', 'Buckwalter, C A', 'Desnoyers, S', 'Eckdahl, S', 'Shah, G M', 'Poirier, G G', 'Reid, J M', 'Ames, M M', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Budihardjo II', 'Walker DL', 'Svingen PA', 'Buckwalter CA', 'Desnoyers S', 'Eckdahl S', 'Shah GM', 'Poirier GG', 'Reid JM', 'Ames MM', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['6-Aminonicotinamide/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Adducts/metabolism', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/14 00:00,1998/05/14 00:01,['1998/05/14 00:00'],"['1998/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Jan;4(1):117-30.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '329-89-5 (6-Aminonicotinamide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,"['N01-CM57200/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA67818/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The Children's Cancer Group.,45-52,"The sequential administration of fludarabine followed by cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) has demonstrated significant synergistic effects against the CEM human leukemic cell line. This in vitro synergism was investigated in a Phase I trial in pediatric patients with relapsed acute leukemia. The optimum concentrations of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl 2-fluoroadenine and ara-C necessary to achieve significant drug synergism from in vitro studies were between 10 and 20 microM. Fludarabine was infused at a dose to attain a target plasma concentration of 10 microM for 48 h, followed by a continuous infusion of escalated ara-C doses to maintain plasma ara-C concentrations of 10, 12.5, 15, or 17.5 microM for 72 h. Thirteen patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and 18 with acute myelocytic leukemia were entered into the study, 30 of whom were clinically evaluable for toxicity. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed on specimens from 20 patients. The optimal 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl 2-fluoroadenine and ara-C concentrations in plasma were easily achieved after continuous infusion regimens of both drugs. Cellular ara-CTP is augmented 5-8-fold in leukemic cells from patients receiving fludarabine phosphate treatment followed by ara-C. The maximum tolerated plasma concentrations for this combination regimen was 10 microM fludarabine for 48 h followed by 72 h of 15 microM ara-C, which were achieved at dose level 3. A significant number of responses were also seen. Nine of 18 evaluable patients (50%) with acute myelocytic leukemia achieved complete or partial responses, and 3 of 9 evaluable patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia achieved complete or partial responses. Fludarabine and ara-C successfully eradicated bone marrow disease in 16 of 27 patients (59%), 23 patients of which had been treated previously with high-dose ara-C. These results verified the synergistic effect fludarabine exhibited in augmenting ara-CTP concentrations in patients' leukemic blasts, thus improving the clinical response in relapsed pediatric leukemias.","['Avramis, V I', 'Wiersma, S', 'Krailo, M D', 'Ramilo-Torno, L V', 'Sharpe, A', 'Liu-Mares, W', 'Kowck, R', 'Reaman, G H', 'Sato, J K']","['Avramis VI', 'Wiersma S', 'Krailo MD', 'Ramilo-Torno LV', 'Sharpe A', 'Liu-Mares W', 'Kowck R', 'Reaman GH', 'Sato JK']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics']",1998/05/14 00:00,1998/05/14 00:01,['1998/05/14 00:00'],"['1998/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Jan;4(1):45-52.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",['Clin Cancer Res. 1999 Feb;5(2):475-6.

This study tests the hypothesis that Bryo 1-differentiated CLL cells are more susceptible to 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) than parent CLL cells. A recently established EBV-negative CLL line (WSU-CLL) from a patient resistant to chemotherapy including fludarabine was used to test this hypothesis. Both Bryo 1 (10-1000 nM) and 2-CdA (5.6-22.4 microM) exhibited a dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect on the WSU-CLL cell line. In vitro, the sequential exposure to Bryo 1 (100 nM for 72 h) followed by 2-CdA (11.2 microM) resulted in significantly higher rates of growth inhibition than either agent alone. Changes in immunophenotype, enzymes, lipids, proteins, and the DNA of WSU-CLL cells were studied before and after Bryo 1 treatment. Bryo 1 induced a positive tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase reaction and two important markers, CD11c and CD25, after 72 h of culture, confirming the differentiation of CLL to HC. The Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopic analysis showed that the amount of membrane lipids significantly increased in Bryo 1-treated cells compared to controls after 24 h, whereas the protein content, as well as the DNA content, decreased. This finding supports the change of CLL to HC. To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of Bryo 1 and 2-CdA, we used a xenograft model of CLL in WSU-CLL-bearing mice with severe combined immune deficiency. s.c. tumors were developed by injection of 10(7) WSU-CLL cells, and fragments were then transplanted into a new batch of severe combined immunodeficient mice. Bryo 1 and 2-CdA at the maximum tolerated doses (75 micrograms/kg i.p. and 30 mg/kg s.c., respectively) were administered to the mice at different combinations and schedules. The survival in days, the tumor growth inhibition ratio, the tumor growth delay, and the log10 kill of the mice treated with Bryo 1 followed by 2-CdA were significantly better than the control and other groups. We conclude that the sequential treatment with Bryo 1 followed by 2-CdA resulted in higher antitumor activity and improved animal survival.","['Mohammad, R M', 'Katato, K', 'Almatchy, V P', 'Wall, N', 'Liu, K Z', 'Schultz, C P', 'Mantsch, H H', 'Varterasian, M', 'al-Katib, A M']","['Mohammad RM', 'Katato K', 'Almatchy VP', 'Wall N', 'Liu KZ', 'Schultz CP', 'Mantsch HH', 'Varterasian M', 'al-Katib AM']","['Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.

MYCN and MRP gene expression were highly correlated in 60 primary untreated tumours both with (P = 0.01) and without MYCN gene amplification (P < 0.0001). Like MRP, high MYCN gene expression was significantly associated with reduced survival, both in the overall study population and in older children without MYCN gene amplification (relative hazards = 13.33 and 19.61, respectively). Inhibition of MYCN, through the introduction of MYCN antisense RNA constructs into human neuroblastoma cells in vitro, resulted in decreased MRP gene expression, determined both by RNA-PCR and Western analysis.

Parents (n = 124, 62 couples) were assessed at diagnosis, at 6 and 12 months. Fathers and mothers experienced higher levels of psychiatric symptomatology and psychological distress at diagnosis than men and women of a normgroup. Distress declined significantly with time. Although parents did not report more symptoms than the normgroup 12 months post-diagnosis, they still were psychologically out of balance. Contrary to findings in the general population, no differences were found between fathers and mothers in psychiatric symptoms or psychological distress on any of the measurements. Only a few gender differences in coping were found. Fathers used more active-problem focusing at diagnosis and a less palliative reaction pattern at 12 months than did mothers. Mothers used more social-support seeking on all measurements. A tendency for similarity in the use of the coping styles within couples was found. Discrepancies in coping in couples were positively related to distress in fathers at diagnosis. However, 12 months later, the more discrepant the couples were in their coping preferences the more distress the mothers indicated.","['Hoekstra-Weebers, J E', 'Jaspers, J P', 'Kamps, W A', 'Klip, E C']","['Hoekstra-Weebers JE', 'Jaspers JP', 'Kamps WA', 'Klip EC']","['Department of Medical Psychology, University Hospital, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cost of Illness', 'Defense Mechanisms', 'Fathers/*psychology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mothers/*psychology', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Personality Inventory', 'Problem Solving', 'Prognosis', 'Sick Role', 'Social Support']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1099-1611(199801/02)7:1<26::AID-PON315>3.0.CO;2-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 1998 Jan-Feb;7(1):26-36. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1611(199801/02)7:1<26::AID-PON315>3.0.CO;2-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spectrum of illness was also explored. DESIGN/METHODS: Prospective cohort of patients from outside the usual catchment area presenting at two children's emergency departments and their satellite urgent care centers during the 1996 Summer Olympics. A 13-point survey was completed on each which included general demographics, transportation, language, time in the area, chief complaint, past medical conditions, diagnosis, and medical complications or problems related to their visit. RESULTS: A total of 263 patients met criteria, mean age 6.7 years. Twenty-four percent were seen in the tertiary care centers and 76% in urgent care. Twenty-three countries with 15 primary languages were represented. Fifty-one percent were in Atlanta for less than seven days, and 44% were uninsured. Most presented with common concerns including; fevers, rashes, respiratory difficulty, and minor trauma. Children were sicker than our typical emergency department patients, with hospital admission rates two times the usual for the tertiary care children's hospital (27% vs 13%) and the county children's hospital (7% vs 3%). Nineteen (7.2%) had unusual presentations or difficulty with care. Notably, five had language barriers; three had serious chronic conditions of unknown detail to the temporary caregiver; two did not bring vital medical supplies (ie, spare tracheotomy tube); one mislabeled medications, causing an overdose; one had leukemia, needed transfusion, but did not know of the regional centers; and one required helicopter transport secondary to traffic. CONCLUSION: A large influx of people resulted in a relatively minor impact on the emergent care system for children. Care could have been improved if those with chronic illnesses were better informed of regional health care centers, essential medical needs for travel, and if travel included a physician's medical summary. In addition, anticipation of the Olympic Games helped the pediatric emergency medicine community improve disaster preparedness, and enhance its working relationship with the adult emergency medicine community and the regional poison center. Ongoing efforts for disaster preparedness with periodic reevaluation have also been established.","['Simon, H K', 'Stegelman, M', 'Button, T']","['Simon HK', 'Stegelman M', 'Button T']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Egleston Children's Hospital, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Emerg Care,Pediatric emergency care,8507560,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Anniversaries and Special Events', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disaster Planning', 'Emergency Medical Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Georgia', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Male', 'Pediatrics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prospective Studies', 'Seasons', '*Sports', 'Travel']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006565-199802000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Emerg Care. 1998 Feb;14(1):1-3. doi: 10.1097/00006565-199802000-00001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of K:Cl-CT is increased in pathologic RBCs containing hemoglobins S and C and may contribute to the abnormal dehydration state of these cells. Human K:Cl-CT (gene product KCC1) has been recently sequenced from human (hKCC1), rabbit and rat tissue by Gillen et al. (J Biol Chem 271:16237, 1996). We report here the sequence of KCC1 from human and mouse erythroleukemic cells (K562 and MEL cells, respectively). The cDNA for human erythroid-KCC1 is 100% identical to hKCC1 and the cDNA for mouse erythroid-KCC1 shares 89% identity with hKCC1, which translates to 96% identity at the amino acid level. Mammalian KCC1 is strongly conserved with >95% identity between human, rabbit, rat, and mouse KCC1 proteins. We did not detect any full-length mRNA transcripts of human erythroid-KCC1 in circulating reticulocytes. We detected two mRNA isoforms of human erythroid-KCC1 that resulted in C-terminal truncated proteins (73 amino acid and 17 amino acids, respectively). Human and mouse erythroidKCC1 differed at several consensus sites including a predicted PKC phosphorylation site at 108threonine and a predicted CK2 phosphorylation site at 51serine, within the predicted cytoplasmic N-terminal, that are present in human but not mouse erythroid-KCC1. Expression of MEL-KCC1 mRNA increases substantially upon DMSO-induced differentiation opening the possibility that erythroid-KCC1 plays a role in early erythroid maturation events. The molecular identification of erythroid-KCC1 is an important step towards understanding the physiologic role mediated by this protein in young and pathologic RBCs and during erythropoiesis, as well as providing a new tool for the elucidation of pathways and signals involved in RBC volume regulation.","['Pellegrino, C M', 'Rybicki, A C', 'Musto, S', 'Nagel, R L', 'Schwartz, R S']","['Pellegrino CM', 'Rybicki AC', 'Musto S', 'Nagel RL', 'Schwartz RS']","['Division of Hematology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center, 111 East 210th Street, Bronx, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*blood', 'Chlorides/*blood', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Erythrocyte Aging/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Potassium/*blood', 'Protein Conformation', 'Reticulocytes/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Symporters', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(98)90168-1 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1998.0168 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1998 Mar;24(1):31-40. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1998.0168.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (potassium-chloride symporters)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",,,,,"['GENBANK/AF047338', 'GENBANK/AF047339', 'GENBANK/AF054505', 'GENBANK/AF054506']","['HL07556/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL38655/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Copyright 1998 The Blood Cells Foundation.'],,,,,,

In some patients high platelet counts develop although leukocyte counts are well controlled with these drugs. If in such a situation cytoreductive therapy has to be intensified by a increase of the dosage, anemia and leukocytopenia as well as adverse effects of the drugs are likely to occur. In twelve CML patients we have therefore combined the basic CML treatment with anagrelide. This drug which selectively reduces platelet counts has been shown to be efficacious in the control of thrombocytosis in essential thrombocythemia. The diagnosis had been confirmed in all CML patients by cytogenetic and/or molecular biological analysis. The median age of our group was 58 years. Five were women and seven men. All patients were on treatment with hydroxyurea, some of them had previously received treatment with interferon-alpha (alone or in combination with hydroxyurea), busulfan or melphalan. Prior to the initiation of anagrelide treatment the platelet count was between 970,000 and 3,600, 000/microl (median about 2,000,000/microl). Seven patients had thrombohemorrhagic complications. All twelve patients, experienced hematologic responses, since their platelet counts decreased to less than 600,000/microl. The median platelet count after reduction was 343,000/microl. The median dosage required to achieve these responses and to maintain them for a period of at least four weeks was 1.9 mg/day. Thrombohemorrhagic complications disappeared or did not recur in all symptomatic patients. Adverse effects were seen in 3/12 patients: headache (1), tachycardia (1), palpitation (1) and fluid retention (1). Whereas these symptoms were mild and transitory they caused one patient to request discontinuation of treatment.

Flavopiridol is known to inhibit potently the activity of multiple cyclin-dependent kinases. We have assessed its effects on normal and malignant cells in preclinical animal models of localized and disseminated human hematopoietic neoplasms. Flavopiridol, when administered as daily bolus intravenous (IV) injections, produced selective apoptosis of cells in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, resulting in atrophy of these organs. With the exception of the intestinal crypts, apoptosis or tissue damage was absent in all other organs investigated (kidneys, liver, lungs, bone/bone marrow, muscle, and heart). Flavopiridol had a marked apoptotic effect documented by DNA nick-end labeling, or DNA agarose gels in xenografts of human hematopoietic tumors HL-60, SUDHL-4, and Nalm/6. After treatment with 7.5 mg/kg flavopiridol bolus IV or intraperitoneal on each of 5 consecutive days, 11 out of 12 advanced stage subcutaneous (s.c.) human HL-60 xenografts underwent complete regressions, and animals remained disease-free several months after one course of flavopiridol treatment. SUDHL-4 s.c. lymphomas treated with flavopiridol at 7.5 mg/kg bolus IV for 5 days underwent either major (two out of eight mice) or complete (four out of eight mice) regression, with two animals remaining disease-free for more than 60 days. The overall growth delay was 73.2%. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated lymphoma AS283 showed no significant response when flavopiridol was used in advanced s.c. tumors, but when treatment was initiated in early stages, there was a complete regression of the early tumors, and a significant overall growth delay (>84%). When flavopiridol was used in severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing disseminated human acute lymphoblastic leukemia Nalm/6 cells, there was 15-day prolongation in survival (P = .0089). We conclude that flavopiridol greatly influences apoptosis in both normal and malignant hematopoietic tissues. This activity was manifested in our study as a potent antileukemia or antilymphoma effect in human tumor xenografts, which was dose and schedule dependent. These findings provide compelling evidence for the use of flavopiridol in human hematologic malignancies.","['Arguello, F', 'Alexander, M', 'Sterry, J A', 'Tudor, G', 'Smith, E M', 'Kalavar, N T', 'Greene, J F Jr', 'Koss, W', 'Morgan, C D', 'Stinson, S F', 'Siford, T J', 'Alvord, W G', 'Klabansky, R L', 'Sausville, E A']","['Arguello F', 'Alexander M', 'Sterry JA', 'Tudor G', 'Smith EM', 'Kalavar NT', 'Greene JF Jr', 'Koss W', 'Morgan CD', 'Stinson SF', 'Siford TJ', 'Alvord WG', 'Klabansky RL', 'Sausville EA']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD 20852, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1998/04/18 02:09,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/04/18 02:09'],"['1998/04/18 02:09 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 02:09 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54755-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Apr 1;91(7):2482-90.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenotype is reminiscent of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-transformed leukemic cells, for which no consistently effective chemotherapeutic regime has been found. The presence of an active multiple drug resistance (MDR) phenotype in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HTLV-I-infected subjects was investigated. Significant P-gp-mediated efflux activity and enhanced MDR1 mRNA expression was observed in nine of 10 HTLV-infected subjects. The development of MDR phenotypes was found to be independent of disease type or status with significant MDR activities being observed in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), HTLV-associated myelopathy (HAM)/tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP), and asymptomatic HTLV-infected individuals. P-gp-mediated drug efflux was also found to be restricted to CD3+ T-cell populations. Furthermore, we show the novel finding that the MDR1 gene promoter is transcriptionally activated by the HTLV-I tax protein, suggesting a molecular basis for the development of drug resistance in HTLV-I infections. These observations open up the possibility of new chemotherapeutic approaches to HTLV-associated diseases through the use of P-gp inhibitors.","['Lau, A', 'Nightingale, S', 'Taylor, G P', 'Gant, T W', 'Cann, A J']","['Lau A', 'Nightingale S', 'Taylor GP', 'Gant TW', 'Cann AJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 9HN, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Adult', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', '*Genes, MDR', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*virology', 'Plasmids']",1998/04/18 00:00,1998/04/18 00:01,['1998/04/18 00:00'],"['1998/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54753-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Apr 1;91(7):2467-74.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that both RA-resistant HL-60 (HL-60R) and APL cells express P-glycoprotein and MDR1 transcripts; and these cells differentiate to mature granulocytes after culture with RA and P-glycoprotein antagonist. Ribozymes have been shown to be able to intercept a target RNA by catalytic activity. To address the role of MDR1 in overcoming RA-resistance in APL cells, we investigated the biologic effects of ribozymes against the MDR1 transcript in HL-60R cells. These ribozymes efficiently cleaved MDR1 mRNA at a specific site in vitro. The 196 MDR1 ribozyme was cloned into an expression vector, and stably transfected (HL-60R/196Rz) cells were obtained. Expression of MDR1 transcripts was decreased in HL-60R/196Rz cells compared with parental HL-60R and empty vector-transfected (HL-60R/neo) cells. Interestingly, RA inhibited cellular proliferation and induced differentiation of HL-60R/196Rz cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting reversal of drug resistance in HL-60R cells by the MDR1 ribozyme. These data are direct evidence that P-glycoprotein/MDR1 is responsible in part for acquired resistance to RA in myeloid leukemic cells. The MDR1 ribozyme may be a useful tool for investigating the biology of retinoid resistance and may have therapeutic potential for patients with RA-resistant APL.","['Matsushita, H', 'Kizaki, M', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Ueno, H', 'Muto, A', 'Takayama, N', 'Awaya, N', 'Kinjo, K', 'Hattori, Y', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Matsushita H', 'Kizaki M', 'Kobayashi H', 'Ueno H', 'Muto A', 'Takayama N', 'Awaya N', 'Kinjo K', 'Hattori Y', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genes, MDR', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'RNA, Catalytic/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1998/04/18 00:00,1998/04/18 00:01,['1998/04/18 00:00'],"['1998/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54751-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Apr 1;91(7):2452-8.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better define the stage of differentiation of the malignant B cell and to investigate the role of chronic antigen stimulation in the pathogenesis of the HCV-associated immunocytomas, we analyzed the variable (V) region gene repertoire in 16 cases with this type of tumor. The lymphoma-derived V gene sequences were successfully determined in 8 cases; 5 of them expressed the 51p1 VH gene in combination with the kv325 VL gene. Moreover, a monoclonal 51p1-expressing B-cell population was detected in 4 of the remaining immunocytomas by an allele-specific Ig gene fingerprinting assay, indicating that HCV-associated immunocytomas represent clonal proliferations of a highly selected B-cell population. Somatic mutations and intraclonal diversity were observed in all of the lymphoma V genes, and clonally related IgM and IgG VH transcripts indicative of isotype switching were present in one case.

To further investigate the mechanism of this, we have studied the influence of bone marrow stromal cells from normal subjects on apoptosis of B-CLL cells and normal umbilical cord blood (UCB) B lymphocytes. After 48 hours of incubation in medium alone, leukemic and normal B cells showed, respectively, 22 +/- 3% and 31 +/- 5% of apoptosis. Cocultures with stromal cells reduced the percentage of leukemic cells undergoing apoptosis (8 +/- 2%, P < . 0005) and prevented the loss of bcl-2 protein expression. In contrast, stromal cells slightly increased normal B-cell apoptosis (37 +/- 6%). Direct contact between leukemic cells and stromal cells was found to be essential for inhibition of leukemic cell apoptosis; indeed, separation of leukemic cells from stromal cells by microporous membrane increased spontaneous apoptosis, and comparable results were obtained with stromal cell conditioned medium. The difference in behavior observed between normal and leukemic B cells plated on stromal cells can be explained by the fact that only a few normal B cells adhere to stromal cells in comparison with B-CLL cells. B-CLL cell adhesion to stromal cells is mediated by beta1 and beta2 integrins acting simultaneously. Contact between B-CLL cells and bone marrow stromal cells seems to play a major role in the accumulation and survival of B-CLL cells in the bone marrow.","['Lagneaux, L', 'Delforge, A', 'Bron, D', 'De Bruyn, C', 'Stryckmans, P']","['Lagneaux L', 'Delforge A', 'Bron D', 'De Bruyn C', 'Stryckmans P']","[""Service de Medecine Interne et Laboratoire d'Investigation Clinique Henri Tagnon, Institut J.

Here we show that the C344 T-cell-derived lymphotropic HTLV-II type IIa Mo strain acts directly on CD34+ hematopoietic precursors by rescuing them from apoptosis induced by interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation. This effect is viral strain-specific, as it is not observed with the B-lymphotropic HTLV-II type IIb Gu strain, it does not require infection of the hematopoietic precursors, and, interestingly, it is strongly dependent on the infected cellular host from which the virus was derived. Indeed, growth adaptation of the Mo strain to the permissive B-cell line, BJAB, renders the virus no longer capable of mediating the antiapoptotic effect. However, pretreatment of the BJAB-adapted Mo strain with antibodies specific for HLA class II, but not class I, histocompatibility antigens restores the antiapoptotic potential of the virus. These results constitute the first evidence that HTLV-II retrovirus can directly influence the homeostasis of human progenitors, without infecting them, and that this crucial activity is strongly inhibited by the presence of host-derived envelope-associated HLA class II antigens.","['Casoli, C', 'Re, M C', 'Monari, P', 'Furlini, G', 'Tosi, G', 'Gradozzi, C', ""Dall'Aglio, P P"", 'Bertazzoni, P P', 'Accolla, R S']","['Casoli C', 'Re MC', 'Monari P', 'Furlini G', 'Tosi G', 'Gradozzi C', ""Dall'Aglio PP"", 'Bertazzoni PP', 'Accolla RS']","['Institute of Medical Pathology, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Cell Survival/immunology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology/*virology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 2', 'Humans', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology']",1998/04/18 00:00,1998/04/18 00:01,['1998/04/18 00:00'],"['1998/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54733-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Apr 1;91(7):2296-304.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This seems particularly true at the present time since much progress has been made in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer. For these reasons a tremendous amount of interest has been generated in the use of oligodeoxynucleotides to modify gene expression. However, in spite of some notable successes which are detailed in this review, oligonucleotides have generated controversy in regards to their mechanism of action, reliability, and ultimate therapeutic utility. Nevertheless, the potential power of the ""antisense"" approach remains undisputed, and its ultimate therapeutic utility is far reaching.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1984 and September 1994, 337 patients with malignant mesothelioma and no prior chemotherapy were accrued to seven phase II studies conducted by the CALGB which screened the efficacy of 10 treatment regimens or dose levels. The eligibility criteria for all studies were virtually identical. Patient characteristics include the following: age older than 60 years (63%); male (83%); performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 (81%); chest pain (60%); definite asbestos exposure (62%); >5% weight loss (41%); and pleural involvement (94%). Median survival time (MST) for the 10 treatment regimens ranged from 3.9 to 9.8 months (overall=7.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.5 to 8.3), with 1-year survival between 14% and 50% (overall=27%; 95% CI, 23 to 33%). RESULTS: Cox survival models and exponential regression trees were used to examine the prognostic importance of pretreatment patient characteristics. Univariate analyses show that patients with poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS, chest pain, dyspnea, platelet count (PLT) >400,000/microL, weight loss, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level >500 IU/L, pleural involvement, low hemoglobin (HGB) level, high WBC count, and increasing age over 75 years have a worse prognosis. With decreasing risk ratio, multivariate Cox analyses showed that pleural involvement, LDH >500 IU/L, poor PS, chest pain, PLT >400,000/microL, nonepithelial histology, and increasing age older than 75 years jointly predict poor survival. PS was the most important prognostic split in the regression tree. Terminal nodes were amalgamated to form six distinct prognostic subgroups with MST (2-year survival) of 13.9 (38%) in 36 patients, 9.5 (21%) in 36 patients, 9.2 (10%) in 146 patients, 6.5 (3%) in 33 patients, 4.4 (0%) in 73 patients, and 1.4 (0%) in 13 patients (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The subgroup with the best survival (MST=13.9 months) included patients with PS=0 and age younger than 49 years, and patients with PS=0, age of 49 years or older, and HGB > or =14.6. The worst survival (MST= 1.4 months) occurred for patients with PS= 1/2 and WBC > or =15.6/microL.","['Herndon, J E', 'Green, M R', 'Chahinian, A P', 'Corson, J M', 'Suzuki, Y', 'Vogelzang, N J']","['Herndon JE', 'Green MR', 'Chahinian AP', 'Corson JM', 'Suzuki Y', 'Vogelzang NJ']","['CALGB Statistical Center, Department of Community and Family Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. jherndon@ccstat.mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chest,Chest,0231335,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Pleural Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",1998/03/27 00:00,1998/03/27 00:01,['1998/03/27 00:00'],"['1998/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-3692(16)33848-X [pii]', '10.1378/chest.113.3.723 [doi]']",ppublish,Chest. 1998 Mar;113(3):723-31. doi: 10.1378/chest.113.3.723.,,,,,,,"['CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

By introducing a second antibody coupled to RPE-fluorescence, the discrimination between control and specific peaks was improved over that achieved with methods used previously. To quantify the content of p53 molecules in the cells, we used a series of beads with the capability to bind mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies. p53 cell content, expressed as antibody binding capacity (ABC), was directly quantified from logarithmic scattergrams; the results were reproducible in all cell lines tested. Flow cytometric results were compared with those of a standard immunocytochemistry method routinely used for the detection of p53 in cells, and found to be in correlation. Furthermore, cytometric data also reflect ELISA determinations. In summary, we showed for the first time that (i) p53 can be clearly detected by flow cytometry in various cell lines, (ii) p53 can be quantitated in terms of number of molecules per cell, and (iii) it can be easily monitored as a function of time after stimulation.","['Filippini, G', 'Griffin, S', 'Uhr, M', 'Eppenberger, H', 'Bonilla, J', 'Cavalli, F', 'Soldati, G']","['Filippini G', 'Griffin S', 'Uhr M', 'Eppenberger H', 'Bonilla J', 'Cavalli F', 'Soldati G']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, La Carita Hospital, Locarno, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Mutation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*analysis']",1998/03/27 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/03/27 03:03'],"['1998/03/27 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/03/27 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19980301)31:3<180::AID-CYTO5>3.0.CO;2-P [pii]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1998 Mar 1;31(3):180-6.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis was performed on a total of 20 DNA specimens consisting of 13 frozen bone marrow aspirates from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and fresh peripheral blood samples from seven healthy donors. For CGH, one aliquot from each test DNA sample was labeled using nick-translation with FITC-dUTP and another with TR-dUTP. Afterwards, the FITC-dUTP and TR-dUTP-labeled test DNAs were hybridized to TR-dUTP- and FITC-dUTP-labeled normal reference DNAs, respectively. The results using the two combinations were compared with each other and with the results of G-banding karyotype analysis. Karyotype data was used to detect artifacts known to occur in some chromosome regions in CGH analysis. The control DNAs labeled with FITC or TR showed no DNA copy number changes. Regardless of the fluorochrome employed for labeling, no DNA copy number changes were detected using CGH in patients with normal karyotypes, nor in patients whose karyotype aberrations were present in less than 40% of cells. In the remaining patients, CGH revealed DNA copy number changes that coincided with the results of the G-banding analysis. Hybridization artifacts known to occur in CGH experiments affecting chromosome regions 1p33-pter, 16p, 17p, 19, and 22 were observed in 15-23% of the tumor samples labeled with FITC, but not in samples labeled with TR. In addition, other previously unreported overrepresentations affecting 7q21, 9q34, 16q, 17q, and chromosome 20 were observed at very low frequencies in up to 10% of the samples when FITC was used to label test DNA. However, when TR was used, overrepresentations were observed at 4q13-q21, 11q21-q23, 13q21-qter, and Xq21-q22, whereas 19p was underrepresented.

In vitro vinflunine cytotoxicity proved dependent on concentration and exposure duration, with IC50 values (72-hr exposures) generally ranging from 60-300 nM. Vinflunine induced G2 + M arrest, associated with mitotic accumulation and a concentration-dependent reduction of the microtubular network of interphase cells, accompanied by paracrystal formation. These effects, while comparable to those of vincristine, vinblastine or vinorelbine, were achieved with 3- to 17-fold higher vinflunine concentrations. However, vinflunine and the other Vincas all inhibited microtubule assembly at micromolar concentrations. Vinflunine, like vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine, appeared to interact at the Vinca binding domain, as judged by proteolytic cleavage patterns, and induced tubulin structural changes favouring an inhibition of GTP hydrolysis. However, vinflunine did not prevent [3H]vincristine binding to unassembled tubulin at concentrations < or = 100 microM, and only weakly inhibited binding of [3H]vinblastine or [3H]vinorelbine. Indeed, specific binding of [3H]vinflunine to tubulin was undetectable by centrifugal gel filtration. Thus, the comparative capacities of these Vincas to bind to or to interfere with their binding to tubulin could be classified as: vincristine > vinblastine > vinorelbine > vinflunine. By monitoring alkylation of sulfhydryl groups, differential effects on tubulin conformation were identified with vinflunine and vinorelbine acting similarly, yet distinctively from vinblastine and vincristine. Overall, vinflunine appears to function as a definite inhibitor of tubulin assembly, while exhibiting quantitatively different tubulin binding properties to the classic Vinca alkaloids.","['Kruczynski, A', 'Barret, J M', 'Etievant, C', 'Colpaert, F', 'Fahy, J', 'Hill, B T']","['Kruczynski A', 'Barret JM', 'Etievant C', 'Colpaert F', 'Fahy J', 'Hill BT']","['Division of Experimental Cancer Research I, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, Castres, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Iodoacetamide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Tubulin/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'Vinorelbine']",1998/03/27 00:00,1998/03/27 00:01,['1998/03/27 00:00'],"['1998/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(97)00505-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00505-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 Mar 1;55(5):635-48. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00505-4.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Tubulin)', '5BF646324K (vinflunine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'Q6C979R91Y (Vinorelbine)', 'ZRH8M27S79 (Iodoacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that MRP functions as an ATP-dependent transporter functionally related to the previously described glutathione-conjugate (GS-X) pump. We have shown recently that the MRP and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) heavy subunit mRNA levels are coordinately overexpressed in cisplatin (CP)-resistant human leukemia cells (Ishikawa et al., J Biol Chem 271: 14981-14988, 1996) and frequently co-elevated in human colorectal tumors (Kuo et al., Cancer Res 56: 3642-3644, 1996). In the present study, we showed the coexpression patterns of thirteen additional human drug-resistant cell lines representing different tumor cell origins selected with different agents, except for one doxorubicin-selected line which demonstrated minor elevation in MRP mRNA with no detectable increase in gamma-GCS mRNA, suggesting that the increase of MRP mRNA preceded the increase in gamma-GCS mRNA. Furthermore, in seventeen randomly selected untreated tumor cell lines, the overall correlation coefficient between MRP and gamma-GCS mRNA levels was 0.861. In normal mice, the correlation coefficient of mrp and gamma-gcs mRNA was 0.662 in fourteen tissues (kidney and liver were not included) analyzed. Kidney and liver expressed low levels of mrp relative to gamma-gcs; however, these two tissues expressed high levels of a functionally related mrp homologue, mrp2 (cMoat or cMrp), which may have compensated for the underexpressed mrp in maintaining the total GS-X pump activities. Altogether, these results demonstrated the frequent coexpression of these two genes in various cell settings.","['Kuo, M T', 'Bao, J', 'Furuichi, M', 'Yamane, Y', 'Gomi, A', 'Savaraj, N', 'Masuzawa, T', 'Ishikawa, T']","['Kuo MT', 'Bao J', 'Furuichi M', 'Yamane Y', 'Gomi A', 'Savaraj N', 'Masuzawa T', 'Ishikawa T']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.

Using the various available approaches, the specific functions of any given gene may now be investigated directly in the relevant cell type. Application of similar experimental tools in a clinical setting might prove to be equally valuable and could well form the basis of a monumental advance in the practice of clinical medicine. This seems particularly true at the present time because much progress has been made in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer. For these reasons a tremendous amount of interest has been generated in the use of oligodeoxynucleotides to modify gene expression. However, in spite of some notable successes which are detailed in this review, oligonucleotides have generated controversy in regard to their mechanism of action, reliability, and ultimate therapeutic utility. Nevertheless, the potential power of the ""antisense"" approach remains undisputed, and its ultimate therapeutic utility is far reaching. Accordingly, the problems associated with the use of these compounds are clearly worth solving.

[1996] Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93, 11,236-11,241). Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we investigated possible changes in the expression of the four genes for cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE-4A-D) in HPBL under the same conditions. Isolated, quiescent HPBL express mRNA for PDE-4B as the principal transcript. Following mitogenic stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), mRNA for PDE-4A and PDE-4D are clearly induced. HPBL appear not to express PDE-4C under resting or stimulated conditions. The PHA induced increase in PDE-1B1, PDE-4A, and PDE-4D mRNA is mimicked by incubation of HPBL with dibutyryl cAMP (dBcAMP) and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (IBMX). The B-lymphoblastoid cell line, RPMI 8392, and the T-leukemic cell line, Molt 4, express PDE-4A mRNA as the most abundant transcript, but incubation with dBcAMP and IBMX induces an increase in the expression of mRNA for PDE-4B in both of these cell lines, and in PDE-4D3 in the RPMI 8392 cell line. These studies demonstrate that expression of mRNA for PDE-1B1 and some of the subtypes of PDE-4 are induced in HPBL following mitogenic stimulation, possibly secondarily to elevation of cAMP induced by the mitogen. As already indicated for PDE-1B1, some of these subtypes of PDE-4 might also provide additional therapeutic targets for treatment of immunoproliferative disorders and immune dysfunction.","['Jiang, X', 'Paskind, M', 'Weltzien, R', 'Epstein, P M']","['Jiang X', 'Paskind M', 'Weltzien R', 'Epstein PM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington 06030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,IM,"['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology', ""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*genetics"", 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/27 00:00,1998/03/27 00:01,['1998/03/27 00:00'],"['1998/03/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02737809 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 1998;28(2-3):135-60. doi: 10.1007/BF02737809.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)', 'TBT296U68M (1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major pathogenic determinant has been mapped to the extracellular envelope glycoprotein (Env-SU), but the mechanism by which envelope differences influence pathogenesis is not well understood. Moreover, it is unclear whether these viruses infect the same target cells and/or enter cells using the same receptor. In the present study, we exploited a recently developed single cycle infection assay to examine the host range and interference properties of 61E and 61C FeLVs and found that these two FeLV variants differ significantly in their host ranges and receptor usages. FeLV-61C was found to be an ecotropic virus; the entry of viruses bearing a 61C envelope protein (Env-SU) into cell lines was limited to feline T-cells and feline fibroblasts. In contrast, the host range of 61E includes, in addition to all feline cells examined, some canine, murine, and human cell lines. Feline fibroblast and feline T-cells that expressed 61E envelope were resistant to infection with a virus bearing a 61E Env-SU, whereas these same cells were susceptible to infection by an otherwise similar virus pseudotyped with the 61C Env-SU. This pattern of interference was observed in cells expressing 61E envelope alone, in the absence of other FeLV gene products, demonstrating that interference was mediated specifically by Env-SU. Fibroblast cells chronically infected with a 61C virus were partially resistant to infection with a virus having a 61C Env-SU, but were not resistant to infection by a virus having a 61E Env-SU. On the basis of the current understanding of virus-receptor interactions, the lack of interference between 61E and 61C under conditions where there is significant homologous interference, combined with the differences in their host cell range, leads us to conclude that 61E and 61C use two distinct primary cellular receptors for entry.","['Moser, M', 'Burns, C C', 'Boomer, S', 'Overbaugh, J']","['Moser M', 'Burns CC', 'Boomer S', 'Overbaugh J']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cats/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Dogs', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/growth & development/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*physiology', '*Viral Interference', 'Virus Replication']",1998/03/26 00:00,1998/03/26 00:01,['1998/03/26 00:00'],"['1998/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)99008-5 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.9008 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Mar 15;242(2):366-77. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.9008.,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,,"['CA 51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32CA62771-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Upon intraperitoneal inoculation with murine leukemia virus FB29 of either neonatal or adult rats, bone marrow cells became massively infected within the first 12 days postinoculation. In neonatally inoculated rats, a persistent productive bone marrow infection was established, whereas in rats inoculated as adults, no infected bone marrow cells could be detected beyond 12 days postinoculation. Retroviral infection was most likely cleared by an antiviral immune response (Hein et al., 1995, Virology 211, 408-417). Exposure to virus irreversibly decreased numbers of bone marrow cells staining with monoclonal antibody OX7 by 10-30%. Reduction of OX7+ bone marrow cells by 20% was also observed in vitro, after bone marrow cells from uninfected adult rats had been co-incubated with virus. FB29-envelope proteins were sufficient alone to reduce numbers of OX7+ bone marrow cells, both in vivo and in vitro. According to results on incorporation of propidium iodide, decreased numbers of OX7+ cells were due to cell death. By flow cytometric analyses OX7+ bone marrow cells as well as monocytes/macrophages were identified to be major target cells for infection with FB29 within the bone marrow. Thus, the mechanism(s) responsible for death of OX7+ bone marrow cells might be due to direct toxicity of viral envelope proteins and/or to interactions of viral envelope proteins with cells of the monocytic lineage.","['Mazgareanu, S', 'Muller, J G', 'Czub, S', 'Schimmer, S', 'Bredt, M', 'Czub, M']","['Mazgareanu S', 'Muller JG', 'Czub S', 'Schimmer S', 'Bredt M', 'Czub M']","['Institut fur Virologie und Immunbiologie, Universitat Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology/*virology', 'Cell Death', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Immunoblotting', 'Macrophages/pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Thy-1 Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*physiology']",1998/03/26 00:00,1998/03/26 00:01,['1998/03/26 00:00'],"['1998/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)98998-4 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8998 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Mar 15;242(2):357-65. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8998.,"['0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In studies of the importance of phosphorylation in CXCR2 desensitization, cells expressing wild type CXCR2 lost GTP gamma S binding above basal rate after the first exposure to IL-8, while cells with the T3 mutant retained 60% of their capacity to induce GTP gamma S exchange upon a second exposure to IL-8.

We have previously shown that using an in vitro system made up of two viral RNAs mimicking the 5' and 3' regions of the retroviral genome, both nucleocapsid protein and the repeat (R) sequences were necessary for minus strong-stop cDNA (ss-cDNA) transfer and elongation by reverse transcriptase (RT). In this paper we show that the basic residues of nucleocapsid protein NCp10 of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV), but not the zinc finger, are necessary for minus strand transfer. In order to examine the role of the R sequence repeated at the 5' and 3' ends of the genome in minus strand DNA transfer, the MoMuLV R sequence of 68 nt was replaced by either HIV-1 R of 96 nt, or RSV R of 21 nt, or by an artificial sequence of 21 nt. Analysis of MoMuLV DNA strand transfer from the 5' RNA to the 3' RNA and elongation in the presence of NCp10 and RT showed that it was high with control MoMuLV R, high with RSV R, reduced with HIV-1 R, and undetectable with the artificial R sequence. These results suggest that minus strand DNA transfer is a process more complex than simple hybridization of ss-cDNA to the 3' R sequence of the genomic RNA.","['Allain, B', 'Rascle, J B', 'de Rocquigny, H', 'Roques, B', 'Darlix, J L']","['Allain B', 'Rascle JB', 'de Rocquigny H', 'Roques B', 'Darlix JL']","[""Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 46 allee d'Italie, Lyon, 69364, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Core Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",1998/06/06 00:00,1998/06/06 00:01,['1998/06/06 00:00'],"['1998/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(97)91596-5 [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1997.1596 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1998 Mar 27;277(2):225-35. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1997.1596.,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '129924-33-0 (retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp10, Moloney murine leukemia', 'virus)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press Limited.'],,,,,,

The conjugate (TF-MMC) was internalized into the human leukemia cell line HL60 cells and distributed into intracellular fractions, then exocytosed into an incubation medium. Although these phenomena were similar to those of TF, part of the internalized TF-MMC was degraded to a trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-soluble fraction. Therefore, the intracellular disposition of the conjugate was analyzed kinetically. The mean time of internalization of TF-MMC (7.14 min) was longer than that of TF (5.46 min). The mean exocytosis time of TF-MMC (22.1 min) was also longer than that of TF (13.0 min). Although elongation of both the internalization and exocytosis steps was responsible for the increase in recycling time of the conjugate, the binding process to the TF receptor in the internalization stage was found to be markedly retarded. The recycling times of TF-MMC and TF were 29.2 and 18.5 min, respectively. The mean decomposition time of TF-MMC was 76.3 min. Proliferation of HL60 cells was inhibited by TF-MMC in vitro.

The effects of socioeconomic and environmental factors, including natural background radiation, were investigated and their relative importance assessed using Poisson regression. Data came from a national collection of all fatal cancers between 1953 and 1980 in children aged 0-15 years and consisted of 9363 children of known place of birth from 12 complete annual cohorts born in the period 1953-64. For solid cancers, as well as for leukaemias and lymphomas, there was marked variation of cumulative mortality according to place of birth. High mortalities were associated with areas characterized as having high social class, higher incomes and good housing conditions, but also with high population densities (births per hectare). Each of these contrasting social indicators operated independently of the other, indicating complex determining mechanisms. Mortalities increased with increased radon exposure, and the relationship operated independently of the socioeconomic factors. At this scale of analysis, we found no increased mortality in industrialized areas. A population-mixing infective hypothesis, which postulates high rates of leukaemia when highly exposed urban populations are introduced to isolated rural areas, was supported by observations of high mortalities in 'growth areas' and New Towns, but was not readily reconcilable with the high rates seen in the high-density areas. If these correlations do indeed represent an infective mechanism, then the outcomes are not limited to malignancies of the immune system alone.","['Gilman, E A', 'Knox, E G']","['Gilman EA', 'Knox EG']","['Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, The Medical School, The University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Background Radiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/complications', 'Leukemia/etiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/mortality', 'Population Density', 'Population Dynamics', 'Pregnancy', 'Radon/adverse effects/analysis', '*Residence Characteristics', 'Risk', 'Rural Health', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Urban Health']",1998/03/26 00:00,1998/03/26 00:01,['1998/03/26 00:00'],"['1998/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.137 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Mar;77(5):842-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.137.,['Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)'],,,,,,,PMC2149963,,,,,,,,

This paper examines the association between potential occupational exposure of fathers to pesticides and offspring's death from cancer in a large national database. Records for 167703 childhood deaths occurring during 1959-63, 1970-78 and 1979-90 in England and Wales have been analysed. Among the offspring of men with potential occupational exposure to pesticides there were 5270 deaths, of which 449 were due to cancer. Associations were assessed using proportional mortality ratios (PMRs), with adjustment for age, year of death and paternal social class. Of the childhood cancers previously linked with potential paternal occupational exposure to pesticides, the only statistically significant excess was for kidney cancer (PMR=1.59, 95% CI=1.18-2.15, based on 42 deaths). Although these results offer some support for the suggestion that paternal occupational exposure to pesticides may be related to the subsequent development of kidney cancer in offspring, other explanations cannot be excluded. In the light of the findings presented here and elsewhere, further, more detailed, research into the nature of this relationship is warranted.","['Fear, N T', 'Roman, E', 'Reeves, G', 'Pannett, B']","['Fear NT', 'Roman E', 'Reeves G', 'Pannett B']","['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Agriculture', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/mortality', 'Norway/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Occupations', '*Paternal Exposure', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Wales/epidemiology', 'Wilms Tumor/*etiology/mortality']",1998/03/26 00:00,1998/03/26 00:01,['1998/03/26 00:00'],"['1998/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.134 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Mar;77(5):825-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.134.,['0 (Pesticides)'],,,,,,,PMC2149972,,,,,,,,

The EUROCLUS project is a European collaborative study whose primary objective is to determine whether the residence locations of cases at diagnosis show a general tendency towards spatial clustering. The second objective is to interpret any patterns observed and, in particular, to see if clustering can be explained in terms of either infectious agents or environmental hazards as aetiological agents. The spatial distribution of 13351 cases of childhood leukaemia diagnosed in 17 countries between 1980 and 1989 has been analysed using the Potthoff-Whittinghill method. The overall results show statistically significant evidence of clustering of total childhood leukaemia within small census areas (P=0.03) but the magnitude of the clustering is small (extra-Poisson component of variance (%) = 1.7 with 90% confidence interval 0.2-3.1). The clustering is most marked in areas that have intermediate population density (150-499 persons km[-2]). It cannot be attributed to any specific age group at diagnosis or cell type and involves spatial aggregation of cases of different ages and cell types. The results indicate that intense clusters are a rare phenomenon that merit careful investigation, although aetiological insights are more likely to come from investigation of large numbers of cases.

STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of 272 consecutive high-risk patients treated at the trophoblastic disease center at the Charing Cross Hospital between 1979 and 1995. RESULTS: EMA (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D)/CO (cyclophosphamide, vincristine) chemotherapy is our treatment of choice for patients with high-risk GTT. In 272 consecutive patients the cumulative five-year survival was 86.2% (95% confidence interval, 81.9-90.5%). No deaths occurred from GTT more than two years after the start of treatment. In patients whose disease became resistant to EMA/CO or relapsed after receiving EMA/CO, the majority (70%) could be salvaged with further chemotherapy (usually with the EP (etoposide, cisplatin)/EMA chemotherapy with or without surgery. Multivariate analysis identified the following adverse prognostic factors: presence of liver metastases (P < .0001), prolonged interval from antecedent pregnancy (P < .0001), presence of brain metastases (P = .0008) and term delivery of antecedent pregnancy (P = .045). Intensive chemotherapy for treating high-risk GTT carries a small risk of inducing second malignancies, and two patients developed acute myeloid leukemia, 2 cervical malignancy and 1 gastric adenocarcinoma after receiving EMA/CO chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: EMA/CO is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for high-risk GTT. Salvage chemotherapy with EP/EMA is effective in the majority of patients whose disease is resistant to EMA/CO and should be combined with surgery when the dominant site of resistant disease is known. Major adverse prognostic variables have been identified, and patients with combinations of these factors should be considered for innovative therapeutic approaches from the outset.","['Newlands, E S', 'Bower, M', 'Holden, L', 'Short, D', 'Seckl, M J', 'Rustin, G J', 'Begent, R H', 'Bagshawe, K D']","['Newlands ES', 'Bower M', 'Holden L', 'Short D', 'Seckl MJ', 'Rustin GJ', 'Begent RH', 'Bagshawe KD']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Charing Cross Hospital, Middlesex, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Reprod Med,The Journal of reproductive medicine,0173343,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Dactinomycin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trophoblastic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Uterine Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1998/03/26 00:00,1998/03/26 00:01,['1998/03/26 00:00'],"['1998/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Reprod Med. 1998 Feb;43(2):111-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'EMA-CO protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proportionate cancer mortality ratio (PCMR) analyses also were conducted. Proportionate mortality ratios (PMR) were significantly increased (P < 0.05) for cancers of the lip (PMR = 384), stomach (PMR = 142), unspecified sites of the liver (PMR = 238), pancreas (PMR = 151), connective tissues (PMR = 243), prostate (PMR = 135), eye (PMR = 407), brain (PMR = 181), benign and unspecified neoplasms (PMR = 289), and leukemia (PMR = 175) for the entire cohort. Significantly decreased mortality was observed for respiratory tuberculosis (PMR = 29), esophageal cancer (PMR = 45), rectal cancer (PMR = 49), and cancers of the bladder and other urinary organs (PMR = 40). Skin cancer was observed to be significantly increased (PMR = 242) for workers with less than 20 years since union initiation. Significantly increased PCMRs were seen for cancers of unspecified sites of the liver (PCMR = 205), brain (PCMR = 147), benign and unspecified neoplasms (PCMR = 243), and leukemia (PCMR = 146). Among nonwhites, an increased risk of bone cancer was observed in the PCMR analysis (PCMR = 704), although based on only two deaths. Analyses of mortality patterns for white males by refinery revealed similar patterns in each refinery as was seen in the overall cohort of refinery workers. Mortality patterns for whites and nonwhites also were similar. Additional analyses of deaths between 1960 and 1993 demonstrated increased mortality due to asbestosis (PMR = 683) and multiple myeloma (PMR = 124), although the multiple myeloma excess was not statistically significant. Ten deaths due to mesotheliomas were observed among these refinery workers.","['Dement, J M', 'Hensley, L', 'Kieding, S', 'Lipscomb, H']","['Dement JM', 'Hensley L', 'Kieding S', 'Lipscomb H']","['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', '*Extraction and Processing Industry', 'Humans', 'Labor Unions', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality', 'Petroleum/*adverse effects', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Texas/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",1998/03/26 07:10,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/03/26 07:10'],"['1998/03/26 07:10 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/03/26 07:10 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199804)33:4<327::AID-AJIM3>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(199804)33:4<327::aid-ajim3>3.0.co;2-r [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1998 Apr;33(4):327-40. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(199804)33:4<327::aid-ajim3>3.0.co;2-r.,['0 (Petroleum)'],['Am J Ind Med. 1999 Jan;35(1):92-8.

All patients showed a decreased platelet count due to suppression of megakaryopoesis by infiltration of the bone marrow with leukaemic cells. In addition, in most of the patients a moderate activity decrease of one or more individual coagulation factors has been found, especially regarding factor II (median, x0.50 = 51%, p = 0.0001), but also factors X (x0.50 = 71%, p = 0.0003) and XI (x0.50 = 68%, p = 0.0006). This was reflected by the APTT and the PT activity (modified test), which were prolonged or decreased, respectively, in the majority of the cases. Furthermore, the activity of AT III and of plasminogen was distinctly diminished (p < 0.001). Like the concentration of FDP, the plasma level of soluble fibrin was significantly higher than in normal dogs (p < 0.001). This indicates that besides thrombocytopenia disseminated intravascular coagulation occurs frequently in dogs with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and is a main cause for the decreased activity of several plasmatic components of the haemostatic system. The lack of correlation between the concentration of soluble fibrin as an indicator of intravascular coagulation and the total blast cell count (rS = 0.011) shows the importance of other factors like degree of cell lysis as well as participation of organs such as the liver for generation of consumption coagulopathy in dogs with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Mischke, R', 'Freund, M', 'Leinemann-Fink, T', 'Eisenberger, B', 'Casper, J', 'Nolte, I']","['Mischke R', 'Freund M', 'Leinemann-Fink T', 'Eisenberger B', 'Casper J', 'Nolte I']",['Klinik fur kleine Haustiere der Tierarztlichen Hochschule Hannover.'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr,Berliner und Munchener tierarztliche Wochenschrift,0003163,IM,"['Angiotensins/analysis', 'Animals', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/analysis', '*Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', '*Hemostasis', 'Partial Thromboplastin Time', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*veterinary', 'Prothrombin Time']",1998/03/26 00:00,1998/03/26 00:01,['1998/03/26 00:00'],"['1998/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr. 1998 Feb;111(2):53-9.,"['0 (Angiotensins)', '0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)']",,,Veranderungen der Hamostase bei Hunden mit akuter Lymphoblastenleukamie.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fever at onset of positive blood culture, level of C-reactive protein (CRP) one day after the first positive blood culture and mortality did not differ between the groups. However, the median increase in CRP over 24 h from the first positive blood culture was significantly higher in true bacteraemias than among contaminants (median 35 mg/L vs 5 mg/L, P < 0.05). Patients with true bacteraemia were more likely than those with contaminants to have central catheters in situ (95 vs 75%, P < 0.05) and previous oral antibiotic prophylaxis (29 vs 5%, P < 0.05). Also clinical signs of catheter infection (30 vs 7%) were more common in true bacteraemias. In conclusion, central catheterization, antibiotic prophylaxis and clinical signs of catheter infection increase the likelihood of true bacteraemia; however, these factors have limited clinical utility in differentiation of true bacteraemia from contamination. Daily monitoring of serum CRP levels may help in the clinical decision-making.","['Lyytikainen, O', 'Valtonen, V', 'Anttila, V J', 'Ruutu, P']","['Lyytikainen O', 'Valtonen V', 'Anttila VJ', 'Ruutu P']","['Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hosp Infect,The Journal of hospital infection,8007166,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/blood/*microbiology', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Staphylococcal Infections/blood/*epidemiology/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis/*isolation & purification']",1998/03/26 00:00,1998/03/26 00:01,['1998/03/26 00:00'],"['1998/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0195-6701(98)90172-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0195-6701(98)90172-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hosp Infect. 1998 Jan;38(1):27-35. doi: 10.1016/s0195-6701(98)90172-4.,['9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goals of this study are to determine if in situ RT-PCR amplification is possible on bone marrow spirate smears and to demonstrate any unique factors in this procedure. A commercially available method was used because of the existence of published protocols for adaptation. Bone marrow (BM) aspirate smears (n = 17) from patients with CML in blast crisis (positive case material) or other hematological malignancies (negative case material) were evaluated. Satisfactory amplification of the BCR-ABL fusion transcript occurred, and distinct blue cytoplasmic granules that varied in intensity were found in most CML blasts. The negative case materials lacked the specifically amplified granular signals. Overall signal strength and backgrounds were readily affected by the quality of the specimen as well as by changes in assay parameters. In conclusion, the direct in situ RT-PCR technique is applicable for bone marrow aspirate smear evaluation.

Currently, efforts are aimed at identifying non-cisplatin-based combinations with an increased therapeutic index. In stage III disease multimodality therapies have been pursued. Dillman et al. reported a study comparing standard radiotherapy versus induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. The chemotherapy-treated patients were found to benefit with a 4-month increase in median survival time compared with patients receiving radiotherapy alone (13.8 vs. 9.7 months) and an increased 3-year survival rate of 23% versus 11%. This was the first randomized cooperative group study demonstrating a survival advantage resulting from the use of induction chemotherapy in locoregionally advanced NSCLC. In a subsequent study, the administration of additional ""posterior"" chemotherapy was not found to be feasible because of early disease progression and toxicity, while the administration of induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant chemoradiotherapy was feasible; therefore, the latter approach was studied further in a randomized phase III setting. This study compared a standard of two cycles of cisplatin and vinblastine followed by radiotherapy with an experimental arm of cisplatin and vinblastine followed by radiotherapy and concomitant carboplatin. Accrual to this study has been completed and results are expected in the near future. In resectable stage III disease, studies have focused on the optimal sequencing of multimodality therapy. A randomized study comparing standard regional therapy with radiotherapy and surgery versus a previously piloted approach combining chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy was closed prematurely due to poor accrual. The next generation of studies in stage III NSCLC will focus on the integration of new chemotherapy agents into the treatment armamentarium for NSCLC.

Oligonucleotides are not readily transfected into leukaemia cell lines using cationic lipid systems and streptolysin O (SLO) is used to effect their delivery. We wished to investigate the optimal oligonucleotide composition for antisense efficacy and specificity following delivery into leukaemia cells using SLO. For this study the well characterised chronic myeloid leukaemia cell line KYO-1 was selected and oligonucleotides (20mers) were targeted to an empirically identified accessible site of c- myc mRNA. The efficiency and specificity of antisense effect was measured 4 and 24 h after SLO-mediated delivery of the oligonucleotides. C5-propyne phosphodiester and phosphorothioate compounds were found to present substantial non-specific effects at 20 microM but were inactive at 0.2 microM. Indeed, no antisense-specific effect was noted at any concentration at either time. All of the other oligonucleotides tested induced some measurable antisense effect, except 7 (chimeric, all-phosphorothioate, 2'-methoxyethoxy termini) which was essentially inactive at 20 microM. The rank efficiency order of the remaining antisense compounds was 4 = 3 >> 9 >> 10 = 8 = 5 = 6 > 11. The efficient antisense effects induced by the chimeric methylphosphonate-phosphodiester compounds were found to be highly specific. Increased phosphorothioate content in the oligonucleotide backbone correlated with reduced antisense activity (efficacy: 2'-methoxyethoxy series 9 >> 8 >> 7, 2'-methoxytriethoxy series 10 > 11). No consistent evidence was obtained for increased activity correlating with increased oligonucleotide-mRNA heteroduplex thermal stability. In conclusion, the chimeric methylphosphonate-phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides present the most favourable characteristics of the compounds tested, for efficient and specific antisense suppression of gene expression following SLO-mediated delivery.","['Giles, R V', 'Spiller, D G', 'Grzybowski, J', 'Clark, R E', 'Nicklin, P', 'Tidd, D M']","['Giles RV', 'Spiller DG', 'Grzybowski J', 'Clark RE', 'Nicklin P', 'Tidd DM']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Life Science Building, Crown Street, Liverpool L69 7ZB, UK. giles@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Bacterial Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/chemistry', '*Streptolysins', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['gkb320 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/26.7.1567 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Apr 1;26(7):1567-75. doi: 10.1093/nar/26.7.1567.,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '0 (streptolysin O)']",,,,,,,PMC147466,,,,,,,,

After the degradation of cell-surface sphingomyelin (SM) by exogenous sphingomyelinase (SMase), the resynthesis of SM by baby-hamster kidney (BHK) and human leukaemia-60 (HL-60) cells was examined in relation to utilization of substrate phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and generation of the expected product, diradylglycerol (DRG). Using [3H]choline-labelled BHK cells incubated in non-radioactive medium, SMase caused a release of phosphocholine, which was derived approximately equally from SM and PtdCho, consistent with the anticipated resynthesis of SM at the expense of PtdCho. However, with choline-labelled cells incubated in radioactive medium or [14C]acetate-labelled cells treated with SMase, no loss of radioactivity from PtdCho or accumulation of labelled DRG was observed, suggesting that any DRG produced as a consequence of SM synthesis must have been rapidly converted back into PtdCho. In contrast, SMase treatment of HL-60 cells caused more than a doubling of DRG levels at the expense of PtdCho, and this appears to be the first demonstration of a rise in DRG related to the synthesis of SM. The DRG produced consisted of about 80% 1,2-diacylglycerol and 18% 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerol species, a similar composition to that of the DRG backbone of total cell PtdCho. 2. The requirement for cell-surface PtdCho in the biosynthesis of SM by BHK cells was also investigated. Treatment of [3H]choline-labelled BHK cells with Bacillus cereus PtdCho-specific phospholipase C (PLC) rapidly degraded about 6% of the total PtdCho, which was assumed to represent the cell-surface pool. This did not appear to be the pool of PtdCho required for SM synthesis, since (a) the released phosphocholine was additional to that derived from PtdCho in cells treated with SMase and (b) treatment with PLC did not affect SM synthesis, either de novo or in response to degradation of cell-surface SM by SMase. These findings suggest either that there is no SM synthase in the plasma membrane or, if it is present, then it does not utilize cell-surface PtdCho as a substrate.","['Sillence, D J', 'Allan, D']","['Sillence DJ', 'Allan D']","['Department of Physiology, University College London, Rockefeller Building, University Street, London WC1E 6JJ, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cricetinae', 'Diglycerides/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*metabolism', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/pharmacology', 'Sphingomyelins/*biosynthesis']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3310251 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1998 Apr 1;331 ( Pt 1):251-6. doi: 10.1042/bj3310251.,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '82231-61-6 (diarachidonyl diglyceride)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)']",,,,,,,PMC1219346,,,,,,,,

The hydrolysis of 2-AG was inhibited by typical esterase inhibitors and by more specific blockers of 'fatty acid amide hydrolase' (FAAH), the enzyme catalysing the hydrolysis of the other 'endocannabinoid', anandamide (AEA). No evidence for a facilitated-diffusion process was found. A 2-AG-hydrolysing activity was detected in homogenates from both cell lines, with the highest levels in membrane fractions. It exhibited an optimal pH at 10, and recognized both 2- and 1(3)- isomers of monoarachidonoylglycerol with similar efficiencies. The apparent Km and Vmax values for -3H-2-AG hydrolysis were 91 microM and 29 microM and 2.4 and 1.8 nmol.min-1.mg of protein-1 respectively in N18TG2 and RBL-2H3 cells. [3H]2-AG hydrolysis was inhibited by Cu2+, Zn2+ and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and by 2- or 1(3)-monolinoleoyl- and -linolenoyl-glycerols, but not by the oleoyl, palmitoyl and myristoyl congeners. Purified fractions from solubilized membrane proteins catalysed, at pH 9.5, the hydrolysis of 2-AG as well as AEA. Accordingly, AEA as well as FAAH inhibitors, including arachidonoyltrifluoromethyl ketone (ATFMK), blocked [3H]2-AG hydrolysis by N18TG2 and RBL-2H3 membranes, whereas 2-AG inhibited [14C]AEA hydrolysis. FAAH blockade by ATFMK preserved from inactivation the 2-AG synthesized de novo by intact N18TG2 cells stimulated with ionomycin. These data suggest that FAAH may be one of the enzymes deputed to the physiological inactivation of 2-AG, and create intriguing possibilities for the cross-regulation of 2-AG and AEA levels.","['Di Marzo, V', 'Bisogno, T', 'Sugiura, T', 'Melck, D', 'De Petrocellis, L']","['Di Marzo V', 'Bisogno T', 'Sugiura T', 'Melck D', 'De Petrocellis L']","['Istituto per la Chimica di Molecole di Interesse Biologico2, Via Toiano 6, Arco Felice, Napoli, Italy. vdm@trinc.icmib.na.cnr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Amidohydrolases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism', 'Basophils/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators', 'Cannabinoids/*metabolism', 'Diglycerides/*metabolism', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Glycerides/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neurons/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/16 00:00,1998/05/16 00:01,['1998/05/16 00:00'],"['1998/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3310015 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1998 Apr 1;331 ( Pt 1):15-9. doi: 10.1042/bj3310015.,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Cannabinoids)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '8D239QDW64 (glyceryl 2-arachidonate)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",,,,,,,PMC1219315,,,,,,,,

Further, are self-reported somatic symptoms explained by medical late-effects or a worry of recurrence of the cancer? METHODS: Of the total of 44 female survivors of leukaemia, 42 were compared with 69 age-matched healthy controls. We used a questionnaire to study self reported somatic symptoms and a face-to-face interview to explore worries about recurrence of the illness. Health status and medical late effects were evaluated by a paediatric haematologist. RESULTS: In contrast to our assumptions, young survivors of leukaemia reported fewer somatic symptoms than healthy age-matched comparison subjects (p < 0.001). Late physical sequelae were uncommon except in the survivors of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Of the survivors, 52% were afraid of recurrence of the illness. The presence of physical or visible impairment and worry of recurrence were unrelated to frequency of somatic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that experience of childhood leukaemia and its treatment does not result in increased somatic concerns or hypochondriacal tendencies.","['Puukko, L R', 'Sammallahti, P', 'Hovi, L', 'Aalberg, V', 'Siimes, M A']","['Puukko LR', 'Sammallahti P', 'Hovi L', 'Aalberg V', 'Siimes MA']","[""The Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/*psychology', 'Social Adjustment', 'Somatoform Disorders/*etiology/*psychology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1998/03/25 00:00,1998/03/25 00:01,['1998/03/25 00:00'],"['1998/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08035259850157615 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 1998 Feb;87(2):169-74. doi: 10.1080/08035259850157615.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The possibility of using ribozymes to suppress bcr-abl gene expression and subsequently alter the malignant phenotype of hematopoietic cells may provide an alternative therapeutic approach to current regimens. A series of hammerhead ribozymes targeted to a b3a2 bcr-abl transcript has been developed and previously shown to be capable of cleaving the desired sequence with varying degrees of specificity. This study investigated the ex vivo effects of endogenous expression of these ribozymes in a CML cell line, K562. We demonstrated a 53% decrease in bcr-abl mRNA levels in a clone induced to express Rz8, compared with its uninduced control. Phenotypic analysis of this clone also revealed a 63% decrease in colony-forming ability and a 43% inhibition of cell proliferation following ribozyme expression. Morphologic analysis of cells showed there was a slight increase (2.5% to 15%) in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. These results suggest that Rz8 was effective in suppressing bcr-abl gene expression within a cellular environment and altering the leukemic nature of a CML cell line.","['Wright, L A', 'Milliken, S', 'Biggs, J C', 'Kearney, P']","['Wright LA', 'Milliken S', 'Biggs JC', 'Kearney P']","[""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev,Antisense & nucleic acid drug development,9606142,IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Catalytic/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/25 00:00,1998/03/25 00:01,['1998/03/25 00:00'],"['1998/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/oli.1.1998.8.15 [doi]'],ppublish,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998 Feb;8(1):15-23. doi: 10.1089/oli.1.1998.8.15.,"['0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, recombinant)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lytic skeletal lesions of multiple myeloma are characterized by sharply defined, spheroid lesions. They have smooth borders and effaced/erased trabeculae. Unique spheroid myeloma lesions appear to be responsible for the ""punched out"" appearance of affected bone. The total absence of remodeling in myeloma forms a contrast to irregular preservation of trabeculae and buttressing, isolated ""fronts of"" cortical bone ""resorption"" coalescing to confluence, and the ""golf-ball surface"" phenomenon observed in metastatic cancer. The uniform effacement of both cortical and trabecular bone in multiple myeloma also contrasts with some cortical preservation in metastatic cancer. Leukemic lesions are more numerous than those of myeloma, but they lack the latter's ""space-occupied"" appearance. The relatively small holes and ""fronts of resorption"" of leukemia are quite different from the ""space-occupied"" lesions of multiple myeloma. Uniform size is a characteristic traditionally attributed to the bone lesions of multiple myeloma. The occurrence of isolated examples of uniform size lesions in metastatic cancer and of variable size lesions in some individuals with multiple myeloma precludes unequivocal use of size in differential diagnosis.

In our previous research, chronic retrovirus infection induced by inoculating a susceptible strain of mice with LP-BM5 murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) was found to suppress acetaminophen (APAP) induced liver injury. In the present study, we aimed to examine the influence of chronic retrovirus infection and its associated immune dysfunction on the activities of a number of cytochrome P-450 isozymes and the P-450-mediated activation of APAP in mouse liver microsomes. Liver microsomes prepared from female C57BL/6 mice at 8 and 16 weeks after LP-BM5 MuLV inoculation as well as from age-matched controls were used in the study. The catalytic activities of the cytochrome P-450 isozymes 1A family and 2E1, catalysts for the activation of APAP, were measured in different microsomal preparations using O-dealkylation of alkoxyresorufin homologues and oxidation of p-nitrophenol, respectively, as the metabolic markers. The formation of the reactive APAP metabolite trapped as glutathione conjugate in the microsomal preparations was also determined. We demonstrated that there were variable changes in total hepatic P-450 levels and in the activities of a number of P-450 isozymes in animals with chronic retrovirus infection and immune dysfunction. Such changes seemed to be dependent on the stage of the disease and to have resulted in increases or minimal changes in the rate of APAP activation in hepatic microsomes collected from this animal model. This suggests that the P-450-mediated activation of APAP was not down-regulated in animals with chronic retrovirus infection. Enhanced elimination of APAP by detoxification metabolic pathways is more likely to be responsible for the increased resistance to APAP-induced hepatotoxicity observed in our previous research in animals with chronic retrovirus infection.","['Chow, H H', 'Tang, Y', 'Li, P', 'Brookshier, G', 'Liang, B', 'Watson, R']","['Chow HH', 'Tang Y', 'Li P', 'Brookshier G', 'Liang B', 'Watson R']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721, USA. chow@tonic.pharm.arizona.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biopharm Drug Dispos,Biopharmaceutics & drug disposition,7911226,IM,"['Acetaminophen/*metabolism', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biotransformation/physiology', 'Body Weight/physiology', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microsomes, Liver/*enzymology', 'Organ Size/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Spleen/cytology']",1998/03/25 03:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/03/25 03:02'],"['1998/03/25 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/03/25 03:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-081X(199801)19:1<9::AID-BDD70>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1099-081x(199801)19:1<9::aid-bdd70>3.0.co;2-f [doi]']",ppublish,Biopharm Drug Dispos. 1998 Jan;19(1):9-15. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1099-081x(199801)19:1<9::aid-bdd70>3.0.co;2-f.,"['0 (Analgesics, Non-Narcotic)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand NF-kappaB regulation in HTLV-1-infected leukemic cells in vivo, we analyzed expression of NF-kappaB and IkappaB alpha in primary cells isolated from ATL patients. Using competitive polymerase chain reaction, we observed an elevated expression of IkappaB alpha mRNA in all four ATL cases tested. In contrast to the elevated mRNA levels, the levels of IkappaB alpha protein were remarkably reduced in some of these cases, suggesting destabilization of IkappaB alpha protein. On the other hand, mRNA expression of p50/p105 and p65, subfamilies of NF-kappaB, was enhanced in primary cells isolated from some ATL patients. Furthermore, the expression patterns of NF-kappaB subfamily were variable among patients and also different from those in T cells isolated from uninfected individuals. Although the number of cases analyzed was limited, we can conclude from these observations that activation of NF-kappaB is restricted to a few subfamilies in vivo. These findings in vivo are strikingly different from those in HTLV-1-infected T cell lines in vitro, in which Tax is responsible for NF-kappaB activation. It is therefore suggested that the elevation of NF-kappaB expression in leukemic cells of ATL patients might not be supported mainly by the viral protein Tax.","['Inoue, M', 'Matsuoka, M', 'Yamaguchi, K', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Yoshida, M']","['Inoue M', 'Matsuoka M', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Takatsuki K', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription Factor RelB', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/24 00:00,1998/03/24 00:01,['1998/03/24 00:00'],"['1998/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505097834102 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb00479.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1998 Jan;89(1):53-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb00479.x.,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)']",,,,,,,PMC5921590,,,,,,,,

Due to the risk of fatal myelosuppression we recommend up-front determination of TPMT activity in patients treated with 6MP or azathioprine.","['Andersen, J B', 'Szumlanski, C', 'Weinshilboum, R M', 'Schmiegelow, K']","['Andersen JB', 'Szumlanski C', 'Weinshilboum RM', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Laboratory of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, The Juliane Marie Centre, State University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methyltransferases/*deficiency', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy']",1998/03/24 00:00,1998/03/24 00:01,['1998/03/24 00:00'],"['1998/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08035259850158001 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 1998 Jan;87(1):108-11. doi: 10.1080/08035259850158001.,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,"['R01-GM28157/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM35720/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

IGF-I levels were similar to age-matched controls before chemotherapy (mean +/- SEM: 250+/-28 and 228+/-22 microg l(-1), respectively). During FN, IGF-I fell to 156+/-22 microg l(-1) (p = 0.02), and rose to 276+/-27 microg l(-1) with recovery at 6 months (p = 0.004). Similarly, IGFBP-3 decreased from 4.0+/-0.2 mg l(-1) before chemotherapy to 3.0+/-0.3 mg l(-1) during FN (p = 0.01), and returned to 4.1+/-0.2 mg l(-1) at 6 months (p = 0.01).

METHODS: Medical records of patients with acute and chronic leukemia who were followed during the last five years were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: The incidence of perianal infections was found to be 7.3 percent in 259 patients with acute leukemia. Only 1 of 108 patients with chronic leukemia suffered from this problem. Twenty percent of all patients with this complication died as a result of sepsis. Perianal abscess was the sole and obligatory indication for surgical treatment in our patients. There were ten patients in each treatment group. The operative group had better results (9 cures, 1 complication vs. 3 cures, 7 complications). However, median neutrophil count at diagnosis was notably higher in the operative group 1,280/mm3 vs. 96/mm3; P = 0.075). Also, significantly more frequent abscess formations and, consequently, operative treatments were performed in patients with a period of normal neutrophil counts during the infection compared with continuously neutropenic patients (9 operative, 4 nonoperative vs. 1 operative, 6 nonoperative; P = 0.057). Ten cures, three complications vs. two cures, five complications (3 mortalities) were present in patients with and without normal neutrophil counts, respectively (P = 0.062). When only severely neutropenic patients were considered, four patients in the surgery group had normal neutrophil counts before or shortly after surgery. However, only two of eight patients with perianal cellulitis had normal counts during full-course infection (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The course of the neutrophil count during infection was an important factor affecting the perianal lesion, and indirectly, choice of treatment and prognosis. A period of normal counts during infection usually led to well bordered and fluctuant lesions, and the prognosis was acceptable with operative treatment. However, continuously neutropenic patients developed nonfluctuating indurations. We found disappointing results with nonoperative treatment of such patients. In all studies, regarding treatment of perianal infections in neutropenic patients, the course of the neutrophil count and indications for surgery should be clarified to get reliable results.","['Buyukasik, Y', 'Ozcebe, O I', 'Sayinalp, N', 'Haznedaroglu, I C', 'Altundag, O O', 'Ozdemir, O', 'Dundar, S']","['Buyukasik Y', 'Ozcebe OI', 'Sayinalp N', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Altundag OO', 'Ozdemir O', 'Dundar S']","['Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Dis Colon Rectum,Diseases of the colon and rectum,0372764,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anus Diseases/complications/*diagnosis', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution']",1998/03/24 00:00,1998/03/24 00:01,['1998/03/24 00:00'],"['1998/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02236900 [doi]'],ppublish,Dis Colon Rectum. 1998 Jan;41(1):81-5. doi: 10.1007/BF02236900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These factors have also been shown to act in both an autocrine and paracrine manner to regulate the development of preimplantation embryos in several species. Attempts to define the function of each cytokine have involved receptor localization, establishment of the mode of control by steroid hormones, and functional assays in vivo and in vitro. However, because of the complex and redundant nature of cytokine networks, defining which of this plethora of factors plays a critical role in implantation has proved difficult. Although the development of preimplantation embryos can be influenced directly by cytokines, the in vitro culture of embryos from several species in defined media indicates that exogenous cytokines are not essential for development to the blastocyst stage. Nonetheless, supplementation of media with growth factors may prove valuable in overcoming the detrimental effects of embryo culture in vitro, which is widely used in assisted reproduction techniques in humans and domestic species. The creation of mouse strains in which specific genes for growth factors or adhesion molecules are deleted has also proved important in defining factors essential in implantation, as well as those that play a less significant role. Mice unable to express leukaemia inhibitory factor in the endometrium fail to support implantation, indicating a critical role for this protein in producing a receptive endometrium. Conversely, mouse embryos of the CF-1 strain, which lack the receptor for epidermal growth factor, fail to attach, indicating that this receptor is necessary for producing an implantation competent embryo. It is likely that abnormal expression of such receptors or their ligands in the endometrium underlies some forms of human infertility. Examining the actions of these factors in the endometrium will allow dissection of the molecular basis of embryo attachment and implantation.","['Sharkey, A']",['Sharkey A'],"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge, Rosie Maternity Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Rev Reprod,Reviews of reproduction,9602351,IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*physiology', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/physiology', 'Endometrium/*physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Species Specificity']",1998/03/24 00:00,1998/03/24 00:01,['1998/03/24 00:00'],"['1998/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1530/ror.0.0030052 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Reprod. 1998 Jan;3(1):52-61. doi: 10.1530/ror.0.0030052.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in vitro purging procedures are complex and expensive when applied to peripheral blood progenitor cells harvests. This is mainly due to the large quantities of nucleated cells present in leukapheresis collections. Aiming to reduce total cellularity without significant loss of CD34+ cells, we developed an in vitro cell separation procedure based on ficoll/metrizoate gradient used at a final density of 1.067 g/ml. To obtain this density, standard Lympho-prep (1.077 g/ml) was diluted with normal saline solution (NaCl 9 g/l). Twenty-six leukapheresis collections (median cellularity 21.1 x 10(9), range 2.8-60) from 14 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia were processed (median two leukaphereses per patient). Mean (+/- s.d.) recovery of total nucleated cells, CD34+ cells and CFU-GM was 20.9 +/- 10%, 74.7 +/- 22% and 70.5 +/- 19%, respectively. Cumulative per patient progenitor cell recovery was always above 50%, and as high as 80% in 10/14 patients, while total cellularity was reduced to a median 21.5% (10-33%) of pre-separation values. Contaminating neoplastic cells, identified by immunofluorescence in five collections, were reduced by 1-2 logs.

Role of intensification therapy in outcome.,375-82,"In order to determine if peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) collected after priming with G-CSF in AML in first complete remission (CR) can be used for autologous transplantation and to evaluate the efficacy of early intensification therapy as in vivo purging, we studied 35 consecutive patients with AML in first CR. After standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy, 24 of them were treated with one (10 patients) or two (14 patients) cycles of high-dose cytarabine plus etoposide prior to PBSC collection. G-CSF was used as the priming agent. Of the 35 patients scheduled for peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), three relapsed before transplantation, and the 32 remaining underwent PBSCT. High-dose therapy consisted of either total body irradiation plus cyclophosphamide or busulphan plus cyclophosphamide. The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 3.24 x 10(6)/kg (range 0.15-14). The median times to reach a PMN count of 0.5 x 10(9)/l and a platelet count of 50 x 10(9)/l were 12 (8-28) and 30 (11-345) days, respectively. There was no transplant-related mortality. Twelve patients relapsed between 2 and 21 months post-PBSCT. With a median follow-up of 28 months, actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) is 52.41 +/- 9% in the intent-to-treat group and 57.4 +/- 9.8% in patients who underwent PBSCT. The probability of DFS is significantly higher for patients who receive early intensification therapy prior to both PBSC collection and PBSCT as compared with patients that do not: 68.8 +/- 10.27% vs 35.5 +/- 12.6%, P = 0.0418. These results indicate the feasibility of PBSCT in AML using G-CSF-mobilized PBSC. The use of intensification treatment as 'purging in vivo' prior both to collection of PBSC and PBSCT significantly reduces the risk of relapse in this group of patients.","['Martin, C', 'Torres, A', 'Leon, A', 'Rubio, V', 'Alvarez, M A', 'Herrera, C', 'Jean-Paul, E', 'Correa, M A', 'Rojas, R', 'Campos, R', 'Serrano, J', 'Romero, R', 'Roman, J', 'Guzman, J L', 'Flores, R', 'Falcon, M', 'Martinez, F', 'Gomez, P']","['Martin C', 'Torres A', 'Leon A', 'Rubio V', 'Alvarez MA', 'Herrera C', 'Jean-Paul E', 'Correa MA', 'Rojas R', 'Campos R', 'Serrano J', 'Romero R', 'Roman J', 'Guzman JL', 'Flores R', 'Falcon M', 'Martinez F', 'Gomez P']","['Department of Hematology, Reina Sofia University Hospital, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blood Component Removal/methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/03/24 00:00,1998/03/24 00:01,['1998/03/24 00:00'],"['1998/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701102 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Feb;21(4):375-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701102.,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],['Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 May;23(9):975-6.

CD34+ cells mobilized from peripheral blood were separated by immunomagnetic beads. CD34+ cells at 2.2-6.2 x 10(6)/kg were transplanted into three patients with refractory leukemia, a patient with relapsed medulloblastoma and a patient with Fanconi's anemia following a conditioning regimen which included irradiation, alkylating agents and antithymocyte globulin treatment. The number of infused CD3+ cells included in grafts was 2.3-22.7 x 10(4)/kg. Four patients achieved engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution (> 5 x 10(8)/l of neutrophils on day 10 or 11). Graft rejection was observed in the patient with Fanconi's anemia, but a rapid engraftment was obtained after second PSCT. Although no prophylactic agents other than ATG (included in the conditioning regimen) were used, greater than grade I acute GVHD was not observed, but limited chronic GVHD was observed in two patients. The two patients with leukemia relapsed on days 103 and 210, respectively, and the patient with medulloblastoma died of disease on day 159. The patient with Fanconi's anemia died of fungal infection. CMV and HHV-6 diseases developed in four and two patients, respectively. Thus, although SCT using positively selected peripheral CD34+ cells may be an alternative approach for overcoming graft rejection and GVHD from HLA- mismatched donors, persistent immune deficiency attributing to extremely low numbers of T cells in grafts can potentially lead to reactivation of herpes viruses.","['Matsuda, Y', 'Hara, J', 'Osugi, Y', 'Fujisaki, H', 'Takai, K', 'Ohta, H', 'Nakanishi, K', 'Tokimasa, S', 'Miyoshi, H', 'Tanaka-Taya, K', 'Yamanishi, K', 'Okada, S']","['Matsuda Y', 'Hara J', 'Osugi Y', 'Fujisaki H', 'Takai K', 'Ohta H', 'Nakanishi K', 'Tokimasa S', 'Miyoshi H', 'Tanaka-Taya K', 'Yamanishi K', 'Okada S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fanconi Anemia/therapy', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/therapy', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Virus Diseases/etiology']",1998/03/24 00:00,1998/03/24 00:01,['1998/03/24 00:00'],"['1998/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701095 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Feb;21(4):355-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701095.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies have been encouraged by initial murine experiments showing a clear improvement in allogeneic bone marrow engraftment with addition of TT to total body irradiation (TBI) where it was assumed that TT enhances donor-type chimerism via ablation of competing stem cells in the recipient. The aim of the present study was to re-evaluate the hematological toxicity of TT among different stem cell subsets that included primitive cells capable of long-term repopulation and to assess how the combination of TT with TBI influences the development of donor engraftment in both syngeneic (B6-Gpi-1a --> B6-Gpi-1b) and H-2 compatible allogeneic (BALB.B10 --> B6) BMT models. At 24 h after TT (20 mg/kg) the femoral content of different stem cell subsets was determined from the frequency of transient repopulating, and the more primitive cobblestone area-forming, cells (CAFCs) growing in stroma-supported cultures. This assay showed a large TT-induced depletion (2% survival) of early clones developing at day 7 in culture but survival recovered towards normal for later appearing clones developing from more primitive CAFC subsets. The sparing of these primitive stem cells was reflected as undetectable levels of donor marrow repopulation in recipients given TT followed by syngeneic BMT. Addition of TT to TBI did not significantly improve long-term engraftment of syngeneic marrow while this combination had a dramatic effect in allogeneic BMT by preventing allograft rejection. In this respect TT shares similar properties with cyclophosphamide and suggests that the large improvement of allogeneic stem cell engraftment is attributable to the immune suppressive properties of TT rather than to its toxicity against host primitive stem cells.","['Down, J D', 'Westerhof, G R', 'Boudewijn, A', 'Setroikromo, R', 'Ploemacher, R E']","['Down JD', 'Westerhof GR', 'Boudewijn A', 'Setroikromo R', 'Ploemacher RE']","['Groningen Institute for Drug Studies, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/pathology', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Thiotepa/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1998/03/24 00:00,1998/03/24 00:01,['1998/03/24 00:00'],"['1998/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701103 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Feb;21(4):327-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701103.,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the patterns of intrafamilial transmission of HTLV-1 in Taiwanese patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL/L) or tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). Fifteen index patients (9 men, 6 women, aged 31-71 yr), 13 with ATL/L, and two with TSP/HAM, and 98 relatives were included. Of the 98 relatives, 23 were seropositive for HTLV-1. Spouses of 11 patients were studied. Seven of eight wives of male patients but none of the three husbands of female patients were HTLV-1 carriers. Mother-to-child transmission was found in seven of 13 families and in 15 of 75 children tested. The correlation of breast-feeding with seropositivity in two families with seropositive mothers indicates its important role in vertical transmission of HTLV-1. Our findings suggest that husband-to-wife and mother-to-child transmission are the main forms of intrafamilial transmission of HTLV-1 in Taiwan, a nonendemic area. Screening for HTLV-1 in family members of patients with ATL/L or TSP/HAM, and seropositive blood donors, may be warranted.

One of the most investigated resistance mechanisms is P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multiple drug resistance (MDR). We analyzed P-gp using flow cytometry with monoclonal antibody JSB1 in a series of 118 children with ALL, 103 at diagnosis and 15 at relapse. Increased P-gp expression was found in 55 (53%) patients at diagnosis and in 11 (73%) at relapse. We also analyzed the bone marrow aspirate slides for early response to treatment in a central review. No correlation was found between P-gp and early response. Patients with T-ALL had higher P-gp levels than the others, 5.3% versus 1.0% (P = .002).

The pretransplant conditioning regimen produces a major defect in the immune system that greatly favors the occurrence of life-threatening infections, caused particularly by Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus. However, adoptive transfer of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes can reconstitute specific immunity and/or cure viral disease in immunocompromised post-BMT patients. The other major drawback of allogeneic BMT is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Although potentially detrimental, it is closely associated with an antileukemia reaction (graft-versus-leukemia, GVL). The most direct evidence of the GVL effect has been provided by the efficacy of donor leukocyte infusions (DLI). DLI can induce long-lasting remissions, especially in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who relapse post-BMT. Although allogeneic cell therapy should still be considered a ""naive"" form of immunotherapy, work in progress on the identification of leukemia-specific antigens will improve the outcome and enlarge its applications.","['Dazzi, F', 'Goldman, J M']","['Dazzi F', 'Goldman JM']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, United Kingdom. f.dazzi@rpms.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Med,Annual review of medicine,2985151R,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/immunology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/therapy', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/therapy', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",1998/03/24 00:00,1998/03/24 00:01,['1998/03/24 00:00'],"['1998/03/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.med.49.1.329 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Med. 1998;49:329-40. doi: 10.1146/annurev.med.49.1.329.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,71,,,,,,,,,,,

GM-CFC will form neutrophils in the presence of the cytokines stem cell factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, whereas macrophage colony-stimulating factor leads to macrophage formation. Previously, we have shown that the commitment to the macrophage lineage is associated with lipid hydrolysis and translocation of protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha) to the nucleus. Here we have transfected freshly prepared GM-CFC with a constitutively activated form of PKCalpha, namely PKAC, in which the regulatory domain has been truncated. Greater than 95% of the transfected cells showed over a twofold increase in PKCalpha expression with the protein being located primarily within the nucleus. The expression of PKAC caused macrophage development even in the presence of stimuli that normally promote only neutrophilic development. Thus, M-CSF-stimulated translocation of PKCalpha to the nucleus is a signal associated with macrophage development in primary mammalian hematopoietic progenitor cells, and this signal can be mimicked by ectopic PKAC, which is also expressed in the nucleus.","['Pierce, A', 'Heyworth, C M', 'Nicholls, S E', 'Spooncer, E', 'Dexter, T M', 'Lord, J M', 'Owen-Lynch, P J', 'Wark, G', 'Whetton, A D']","['Pierce A', 'Heyworth CM', 'Nicholls SE', 'Spooncer E', 'Dexter TM', 'Lord JM', 'Owen-Lynch PJ', 'Wark G', 'Whetton AD']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Cellular Development Unit, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, M60 1QD, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,"['Animals', 'Culture Media', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.140.6.1511 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1998 Mar 23;140(6):1511-8. doi: 10.1083/jcb.140.6.1511.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Prkca protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)']",,,,,,,PMC2132662,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated a central role for mitochondrial proteins (e.g., Bcl-2 and cytochrome c) in the activation of caspase-3, by a process that involves interaction of several protein molecules. Using antibodies that specifically recognize the precursor form of caspase-3, we demonstrate that the caspase-3 proenzyme has a mitochondrial and cytosolic distribution in nonapoptotic cells. The mitochondrial caspase-3 precursor is contained in the intermembrane space. Delivery of a variety of apoptotic stimuli is accompanied by loss of mitochondrial caspase-3 precursor staining and appearance of caspase-3 proteolytic activity.

It seems that HLA- and HPA-alloimmunized patients can be successfully supported with HLA- and HPA-matched platelet concentrates.","['Kekomaki, S', 'Volin, L', 'Koistinen, P', 'Koivunen, E', 'Koskimies, S', 'Ruutu, T', 'Timonen, T', 'Kekomaki, R']","['Kekomaki S', 'Volin L', 'Koistinen P', 'Koivunen E', 'Koskimies S', 'Ruutu T', 'Timonen T', 'Kekomaki R']","['Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Helsinki.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Human Platelet/*immunology', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01007.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1998 Feb;60(2):112-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01007.x.,"['0 (Antigens, Human Platelet)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two patients had intravenous-catheter-associated fungemia, whereas the third had fungal hepatitis. The three cases of infection occurred over a period of 1 month in patients staying in adjacent single rooms. In vitro susceptibility testing of fungal strains showed all isolates to be resistant to fluconazole, with MICs greater than 32 microg/ml. All of the strains had identical DNA restriction profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprints. These data suggest a nosocomially acquired infection emanating from a common source within the hospital environment.","[""D'Antonio, D"", 'Violante, B', 'Mazzoni, A', 'Bonfini, T', 'Capuani, M A', ""D'Aloia, F"", 'Iacone, A', 'Schioppa, F', 'Romano, F']","[""D'Antonio D"", 'Violante B', 'Mazzoni A', 'Bonfini T', 'Capuani MA', ""D'Aloia F"", 'Iacone A', 'Schioppa F', 'Romano F']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia ed Oncologia, Ospedale Santo Spirito, Pescara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,IM,"['Adult', 'Candida/*isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis/complications/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cross Infection/complications/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Fungemia/microbiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JCM.36.3.792-795.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1998 Mar;36(3):792-5. doi: 10.1128/JCM.36.3.792-795.1998.,,,,,,,,PMC104627,,,,,,,,
