Each of these processes is described by a single model parameter. It is hypothesized that the leukaemic cell is characterized by an alteration of only one of these processes. The kinetic behaviour of the AML system is examined separately for possible alterations of each of the three parameters describing the three processes involved. It is shown that, on the basis of the existing data on AML kinetics, the alteration of the growth and cell-cell interaction parameters can be eliminated as a possible source of AML. Thus kinetic data support the modification of the differentiation process as the origin of the AML state. Further, the growth characteristics of normal and leukaemic cells in the presence of each other are analysed. It is shown how the initial growth of leukaemic cells depends on the difference in the differentiation of normal and leukaemic cells and how the same difference determines the decay of normal cells in the presence of the predominantly leukaemic population. Correlations between the kinetic parameters of the normal and leukaemic populations are suggested to characterize the leukaemic state.","['Djulbegovic, B', 'Svetina, S']","['Djulbegovic B', 'Svetina S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Tissue Kinet,Cell and tissue kinetics,0174107,IM,"['Cell Communication', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Probability']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1985.tb00660.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Kinet. 1985 May;18(3):307-19. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1985.tb00660.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings and the results obtained by monoclonal antibody staining and FACS analysis indicate that treatment of the myeloid lines ML-1, ML-2, and HL-60 by TPA induced the expression of antigenic and membrane molecular features compatible with a monocytic-macrophage phenotype, while treatment by retinoic acid induced granulocytic differentiation.

This approach is potentially useful for high-risk leukemias as well as for other cancers. The development of suitable methods for purging malignant cells from the bone marrow will offer a better chance of success for autologous stem cell transplantation. In this paper, we describe our efforts at purging myeloid cells. HL-60, a promyelocytic leukemia cell line, was used as a model. 4-Hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) and VP-16-213 (VP-16) (either alone or in combination) were used to treat HL-60 cells and normal bone marrow. The cytotoxic effect of 4-HC (29.2 micrograms/ml; 100 microM) upon the HL-60 cell line was 99.8 +/- 0.12% (SE), and the colony-forming units-granulocyte, macrophage (CFU-cs) of normal bone marrow was inhibited by 82.5%. VP-16, at a concentration of 25 micrograms/ml (42.5 microM), can kill 99% of HL-60 cells and inhibit 72.7% of the CFU-cs. A drug mixture containing 4-HC (29.2 micrograms/ml) and VP-16 (10 micrograms/ml) (combination ratio, 1:0.342) reduces HL-60 cells to an undetectable number, and the CFU-cs were inhibited by 87.2%. The laboratory data were further analyzed for the synergistic effect of these two drugs by quantitative determination of the median effect plot and the multiple drug equation recently described by Chou and Talalay (Adv. Enz. Regul., 22: 27-55, 1984). Interactions of two drugs at different effect levels and at different combination ratios were then determined by computer simulation. At high effect levels, 4-HC and VP-16 in combination gave a synergistic cytocidal effect on HL-60 leukemic cells and gave an antagonistic inhibitory effect on normal bone marrow CFU-cs. This combination greatly increases the safety margin. Computer simulation of a dose effect relationship has also shown that the 4-HC:VP-16 combination ratio of 1:0.342 yields a better selective effect than a ratio of 1:0.856. This quantitative analysis suggests that the combination of these two drugs at the selected dose level offers a good method for purging nonlymphoblastic leukemia cells.","['Chang, T T', 'Gulati, S C', 'Chou, T C', 'Vega, R', 'Gandola, L', 'Ibrahim, S M', 'Yopp, J', 'Colvin, M', 'Clarkson, B D']","['Chang TT', 'Gulati SC', 'Chou TC', 'Vega R', 'Gandola L', 'Ibrahim SM', 'Yopp J', 'Colvin M', 'Clarkson BD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Computers', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Jun;45(6):2434-9.,,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",['CA-19117/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Commitment to granulocytic maturation occurs very rapidly. When cells are exposed to these inducers for only 8 to 18 h, an interval much shorter than a single generation time, and are then subcultured in inducer-free plasma clots, they demonstrate a decrease in proliferative capacity and form colonies composed of mature nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-positive cells along with occasional colonies containing both NBT-positive and NBT-negative cells; in both types of colony, the NBT-positive cells are widely dispersed. Undifferentiated HL-60 cells give rise to compact NBT-negative colonies of large size without cell migration. HL-60 cell differentiation induced by either DMSO or RA is associated with a progressive decline in both DNA and RNA synthesis; this includes transcriptional inactivation of ribosomal DNA sequences. In contrast to DMSO, which induces development primarily of metamyelocytes, RA treatment leads to the accumulation of more mature band and segmented neutrophils; sequential exposure of cells pretreated with DMSO to RA alone fails to cause rapid appearance of segmented neutrophils. From these studies, we conclude that HL-60 cells become very rapidly committed to terminal maturation and that DMSO and RA appear to induce granulocytic maturation via two different mechanisms.","['Tsiftsoglou, A S', 'Wong, W', 'Hyman, R', 'Minden, M', 'Robinson, S H']","['Tsiftsoglou AS', 'Wong W', 'Hyman R', 'Minden M', 'Robinson SH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 May;45(5):2334-9.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']","['AM09834/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM17148/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Previous studies (Luikart, S.D., Maniglia, C. A., and Sartorelli, A. C. Cancer Res., 44: 2907-2912, 1984) have shown that both dimethyl sulfoxide and 4-beta-phorbol-12-beta-myristate-13-alpha-acetate decreased GAG production by a hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase-deficient clone of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells prior to the appearance of a mature myeloid or monocytoid phenotype. To expand these investigations further, GAGs were analyzed by cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation and DEAE-Sephacel ion-exchange chromatography after labeling of parental HL-60 cultures with [35S]sulfate and D-[3H]glucosamine for 6 h, following treatment with 1 microM all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Chondroitin sulfate represented the major GAG species produced, although endo-beta-galactosidase-sensitive undersulfated macromolecules which possibly might be keratan sulfate, were also identified. GAG production decreased over a time period of 144 h in culture. RA treatment reduced the amount of radiolabeled cell-associated GAGs by 50% after 48, 96, and 144 h of exposure. In contrast, commitment to myelocytic maturation of the majority (i.e., approximately 60%) of the cells occurred between 72 and 96 h of RA treatment. Concurrently with the appearance of mature granulocytic cells, two-thirds of the radiolabeled GAGs were recovered from the medium, compared to one-third in untreated cultures, a phenomenon that resulted in an overall alteration in the distribution of GAGs. When RA was removed by washing after either 48 h (i.e., precommitment to differentiation) or 96 h (i.e., postcommitment to differentiation), a 1.5- to 3.5-fold increase in GAG production was noted 48 h later; this increase was unrelated to the medium change or to alterations in cell cycle distribution. The amounts of endo-beta-galactosidase-sensitive macromolecules were unaltered. Thus, although 1 microM RA inhibited the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate by HL-60 leukemia cells, this inhibition was reversible by removal of the drug and appeared to be unrelated to the commitment to myelocytic maturation.","['Reiss, M', 'Maniglia, C A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Reiss M', 'Maniglia CA', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glycosaminoglycans/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 May;45(5):2092-7.,,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Two very different pictures emerged: a few patients (4/28) were young, with presentation and evolution similar to classic AML, for whom combination chemotherapy was effective; the majority (20/28) were older, with more varied clinical and cytologic presentation, for whom chemotherapy was of little effect and who presented a picture resembling classic RAEB with a median survival of 10 months.","['Scoazec, J Y', 'Imbert, M', 'Crofts, M', 'Jouault, H', 'Juneja, S K', 'Vernant, J P', 'Sultan, C']","['Scoazec JY', 'Imbert M', 'Crofts M', 'Jouault H', 'Juneja SK', 'Vernant JP', 'Sultan C']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",1985/05/15 00:00,1985/05/15 00:01,['1985/05/15 00:00'],"['1985/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19850515)55:10<2390::aid-cncr2820551015>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1985 May 15;55(10):2390-4. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19850515)55:10<2390::aid-cncr2820551015>3.0.co;2-b.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,

Marrow cultures from untreated patients exhibited heterogeneous growth patterns ranging from complete growth failure to excessive microcluster formation. We classified the growth patterns into 4 groups: (1) Gr I: normal growth, (2) Gr II: no growth, (3) Gr III: decreased growth, (4) Gr IV: excessive growth of microclusters. At presentation, none had Gr I growth; Gr II growth was observed in 23; Gr III in 14 and Gr IV in 13.

Twenty-one patients (45.5%) progressed to AML (greater than 30% blasts in bone marrow smears). Based on sequential determinations of percentages of bone marrow blasts, three patterns of evolution were observed in MDS. Patients with evolution pattern A (48%) had an apparently stable disease with minimal or no increase in bone marrow blasts. Exceptionally they developed new or additional chromosomal anomalies during the course of their disease. Cases in this group, who showed no abnormal localization of immature myeloid precursors (ALIP) at time of diagnosis experienced prolonged survival (median: 43 months), while ALIP positive patients had shorter survival times (median: 14 months), with high probability of early death from infections and/or bleeding problems. Patients with evolution pattern B (28%) initially had a morphologically stable disease, comparable to cases with evolution pattern A, but showed an abrupt shift from MDS to AML. Most of these patients (82%) were ALIP positive and a substantial proportion (46%) showed karyotype anomalies at diagnosis. The abrupt shift to AML in these patients was frequently (61.5%) associated with additional cytogenetic anomalies. Patients with evolution pattern C (24%) showed a gradual increase in bone marrow blasts. The majority of these cases (8/11) ultimately developed acute myeloid leukaemia (gradual progression to AML), whereas some patients (3/11) died from infections and/or haemorrhagic complications before they had reached the level of clinical AML. All of these patients were ALIP positive at diagnosis and no additional cytogenetic alterations occurred during evolution. Acquisition of new karyotypic anomalies during the course of MDS was almost invariably associated with abrupt shift to AML. From this retrospective study we conclude that evolution in MDS shows two important aspects, which seem to be preponderant in determining the course and outcome of the disease: one is the proliferative capacity and resulting growth advantage of the neoplastic clone over normal haematopoiesis, as measured by increasing percentages of bone marrow blasts in sequential aspirates; the other one is instability of the clone. Unstable clones have a high propensity to further intraclonal changes; they are expressed morphologically by the abrupt increase in bone marrow blasts and cytogenetically by the acquisition of new or additional karyotype anomalies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Tricot, G', 'Boogaerts, M A', 'De Wolf-Peeters, C', 'Van den Berghe, H', 'Verwilghen, R L']","['Tricot G', 'Boogaerts MA', 'De Wolf-Peeters C', 'Van den Berghe H', 'Verwilghen RL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/genetics/*pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Syndrome']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb07361.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1985 Apr;59(4):659-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb07361.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 24 h exposure to PGD2 was required to inhibit cell growth almost completely. During this period, PGD2 degraded time-dependently into several products. The major product was identified as delta 12-PGJ2 by TLC, UV and mass spectra. When delta 12-PGJ2 was added to cells instead of PGD2, it evoked growth inhibition with much shorter contact time than PGD2. In addition, when the medium containing PGD2 was preincubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h, it elicited growth inhibition with only 6 h contact with cells. Furthermore, when the medium containing PGD2 was changed every 6 h during 24 h exposure time to cells, no significant growth inhibition was observed. These results suggested that PGD2 per se has little, if any, growth inhibitory activity, and delta 12-PGJ2 is an ultimate metabolite exerting growth inhibition. This action appears to be independent of cAMP, since delta 12-PGJ2 was virtually inactive in raising intracellular cAMP levels.","['Narumiya, S', 'Fukushima, M']","['Narumiya S', 'Fukushima M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Prostaglandin D2', 'Prostaglandins D/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1985/03/29 00:00,1985/03/29 00:01,['1985/03/29 00:00'],"['1985/03/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/29 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(85)80005-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(85)80005-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1985 Mar 29;127(3):739-45. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(85)80005-x.,,"['0 (Prostaglandins D)', '87893-54-7 (9-deoxy-9,10-didehydro-12,13-didehydro-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin D2)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",,,,,,,,,,

The translocation breakpoint occurs near c-abl and correlates with the production of an altered c-abl mRNA. In the CML-derived cell line K562, Ph1 is accompanied by a structurally altered c-abl protein (P210c-abl) with in vitro tyrosine kinase activity not detected with the normal c-abl protein (P145c-abl). We have examined c-abl proteins in other Ph1-positive CML cell lines and found that they all express P210c-abl. P210c-abl was also detected in bone marrow cells from CML patients with Ph1 in the accelerated and blast crisis phases of the disease. Comparison of the [35S]methionine-labeled tryptic peptides generated from the normal P145c-abl and P210c-abl showed that they have closely related structures, but additional polypeptide sequences are present in P210c-abl. Based on these results we propose that translocation of c-abl in Ph1-positive CML results in the creation of a chimeric gene leading to the production of a structurally altered c-abl protein with activated tyrosine kinase activity.

Classification of CMPD was done following the concept of Georgii et al. (1984) into CGL -24-, CMGM-6-, E-MS-13- and MS/OMS-15 cases. There was a significant increase in blastic crisis in CGL compared with the other entities and in the latter a prolongation of the total course of disease due to a long period between symptoms--clinical diagnosis. As revealed by the autopsies causes of death were mostly infections (pneumonia, septicemia-50%) and lethal hemorrhages (gastrointestinal and cerebral--about 30%) in both AML and CMGM patients. Rare causes comprised fatal pulmonary embolism due to a peripheral thrombocytosis in CMPD, acute rupture of the spleen and extensive leukemic infiltrates of the myocard in AML. In addition to the well known giant enlargement of the spleen in MS/OMS, the relatively high frequency of a meningeal involvement (meningeosis leukemica) in AML (about 35%) and during an acute transformation in CMPD (up to 30%) was conspicuous. The examination of the bone marrow at various sites became feasible during the postmortem procedure and thus provided the opportunity to investigate the development and extent of a myelosclerosis evolving in CMPD.

However, according to epidemiological data lithium does not play an etiological role in leukemia. Furthermore, lithium does not stimulate several tumor cell lines in culture. The effect of cytostatic drugs as well as remission rates are not lessened by lithium. In spite of increased production the functions of the granulocytes are not impaired. Because of the wide range of serum level variation serum level determinations are mandatory. To treat hematological disorders a serum level between 0.7 and 1.2 mmol/l should be achieved. Flame emission photometry and atomic absorption photometry are equivalent methods for determination of the serum level. CNS, thyroid gland, kidney, electrolyte balance, gastrointestinal tract have to be monitored for side effects. Lithium therapy has not be given in pregnancy and to breast feeding mothers. In neutropenia with increased susceptibility to infections lithium therapy including serum level monitoring can be given.

The relationship between methylation and activation of the mouse albumin gene has been investigated in two types of hybrid clones: mouse lymphoblastoma--rat hepatoma hybrids where activation is very frequent, and mouse L-cell--rat hepatoma hybrids where activation is a rare event. Analysis of the methylation pattern of seven MspI/HpaII sites that occur along the first 8000 bases of the mouse albumin gene has been performed. The entire 5' region is unmethylated only in albumin-producing cells (adult liver and hepatoma); in non-hepatic cells this region is heavily methylated. In hybrids between rat hepatoma cells and mouse cells of mesenchymal origin, the only regular change is the demethylation of the most 5' site (M1), which is systematically observed in clones where expression of the mouse albumin gene has been activated. Demethylation of this site, like activation of the mouse albumin gene, is gene dosage-dependent; it is systematic in the lymphoblastoma--hepatoma hybrids and rare in L-cell--hepatoma hybrids. We conclude that demethylation of this site is tightly coupled with activation of the gene and may well be a necessary prerequisite for activation.","['Sellem, C H', 'Weiss, M C', 'Cassio, D']","['Sellem CH', 'Weiss MC', 'Cassio D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hybrid Cells', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Melanoma', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1985/02/05 00:00,1985/02/05 00:01,['1985/02/05 00:00'],"['1985/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-2836(85)90225-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-2836(85)90225-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1985 Feb 5;181(3):363-71. doi: 10.1016/0022-2836(85)90225-6.,,['0 (Serum Albumin)'],,,,,,,,,,

The t1/2 values for the actin and tubulin mRNAs were 16 to 26 hours and about seven hours, respectively. The globin mRNA, and two mRNA species subject to translation repression, the P40 and P21 mRNAs, were about as stable as the ribosomal RNA. A stable tubulin mRNA component also appeared to be present in the cells. Exposure of the cells to dimethylsulfoxide for 48 hours led to considerable increases in the rates of decay of all but the globin mRNA. The induction of erythroid differentiation caused by the drug appears to lead to activation of a mRNA-degradation process that affects individual species to different degrees. The newly synthesized actin and tubulin mRNAs lost their poly(A) rather rapidly. This was accompanied by accumulation of poly(A)-deficient mRNA chains, particularly in the case of actin mRNA. The steady-state distribution of mRNA components, determined by Northern blot analysis, also showed that the actin mRNA and one tubulin mRNA species have a high proportion of poly(A)-deficient molecules. The globin, P40 and P21 mRNAs showed little tendency to lose their poly(A) sequence. The steady-state globin and P40 mRNAs also had a low proportion of chains depleted of poly(A). For all five species, the proportions of poly(A)-deficient chains in newly synthesized mRNA were about the same in uninduced and induced cells, in spite of the large decreases in mRNA stability in the induced cells. The lack of correlation between tendency to lose poly(A) and rate of mRNA decay, and the large accumulation of poly(A)-deficient molecules in the cases of the actin and tubulin mRNAs suggest that the stability of mRNA is not determined solely by the presence of poly(A) on the RNA chains. The behavior of the untranslated species in induced and uninduced cells also fails to support the notion of a relationship between translation and mRNA decay.","['Krowczynska, A', 'Yenofsky, R', 'Brawerman, G']","['Krowczynska A', 'Yenofsky R', 'Brawerman G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,"['Actins', 'Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Line', 'Globins', 'Half-Life', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Poly A/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral', 'Tubulin']",1985/01/20 00:00,1985/01/20 00:01,['1985/01/20 00:00'],"['1985/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-2836(85)90087-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-2836(85)90087-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1985 Jan 20;181(2):231-9. doi: 10.1016/0022-2836(85)90087-7.,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Tubulin)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",['GM17973/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Longitudinal studies in 4 patients at increased risk to relapse consistently demonstrated elevated percentages of TdT positive cells while morphologic surveillance was inadequate in establishing a clinical diagnosis of leukemic relapse.

The drug-LDL complex contained 100-200 drug molecules/LDL particle. When cultured normal human fibroblasts were incubated with 125I-LDL-incorporated drug, there was a perfect correlation between the cellular uptake plus degradation of 125I-LDL and the cellular drug accumulation. The presence of excess native LDL inhibited the cellular uptake and degradation of 125I-LDL and the drug accumulation to the same extent. In contrast, methylated LDL, which does not bind to the LDL receptor, did not alter the cellular uptake and degradation of 125I-LDL nor did it alter the drug accumulation. When LDL receptor negative fibroblasts from a patient with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia were incubated with the drug-125I-LDL complex, cellular drug accumulation was very low. The drug-LDL complex inhibited the growth of cultured normal human fibroblasts. The drug incorporated into methylated LDL was much less toxic. These findings suggest that r11-DOX incorporated into LDL is delivered to cells selectively by the LDL receptor pathway. This might be of value in the treatment of leukemia, since we have previously found that leukemic cells exhibit higher LDL receptor activity than white blood cells and bone marrow cells from healthy subjects.","['Vitols, S G', 'Masquelier, M', 'Peterson, C O']","['Vitols SG', 'Masquelier M', 'Peterson CO']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Naphthacenes/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Pharmaceutical Vehicles', 'Receptors, LDL/*analysis']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00382a011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1985 Apr;28(4):451-4. doi: 10.1021/jm00382a011.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Vehicles)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)']",,,,,,,,,,

An antiidiotypic antiserum raised to 1416 was tested for its ability to bind to the thymic leukemia induced by P1 (P1 Thy). A membrane structure was identified on the surface of P1 Thy that reacted with the antibody against the idiotypic determinant of 1416. A similar structure was identified on the surface of several different, independently derived murine leukemias of T cell, B cell, and erythroid lineage. The expression of the idiotype-like determinant on these leukemia cells was independent of the serological relatedness of their expressed retroviral envelope glycoproteins to P1 gp70.

Molecular structures and relative kinetics of Ii synthesis, processing and turnover were compared in paired, Ia+ and Ia- Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines and in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cells. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S] methionine for 15 min (with or without a cold methionine chase to 3 hr) or were continuously labeled for 3 hr. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis resolved immunoprecipitates formed with a) a heteroantiserum to purified class II antigen (demonstrating alpha and beta chains and Ii associated with that complex), b) a heteroantiserum to hairy cell leukemia (HCL) membranes (demonstrating principally the dominant, basic form of Ii molecules, class I antigens, and some additional proteins), and c) a monoclonal antibody to human Ii. Treatment of Ia+ Jijoye and its daughter, Ia- P3HR-1, BL cells with 4 mM butyrate for 48 hr enhanced the synthesis of the dominant, basic form of Ii but did not affect apparent turnover rates of that pool of Ii chains in either cell line. In Ia+ Jijoye cells but not in Ia- P3HR-1 cells Ii was terminally processed to more acidic, sialic acid-derivatized forms. Butyrate treatment did not alter the relative turnover rate of terminally processed Ii in Jijoye cells. The level of the dominant, basic form of Ii in HCL cells equaled that in butyrate-treated Jijoye cells, and relative turnover rates of this terminally unprocessed Ii pool were similar in HCL and Jijoye cells. However, HCL Ia-associated Ii was not terminally processed, as was Ia-associated Ii in Jijoye cells. The expression of Ia auxiliary proteins, p41 and p25, was also enhanced in Jijoye cells by butyrate treatment and was prominent in HCL cells. From these experiments, we may hypothesize the following. In lymphoblastoid cells, two pathways for Ii turnover could exist. One is through association with Ia complexes and progressive terminal processing of carbohydrate side chains and a second is not associated with Ia or, apparently, with such processing. Because Ii is not found to be terminally processed in the absence of class II antigen, Ia might be considered to direct the processing of a subset of Ii towards some function (rather than vice versa).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Spiro, R C', 'Sairenji, T', 'Humphreys, R E']","['Spiro RC', 'Sairenji T', 'Humphreys RE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['*Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Biological Transport', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/*metabolism', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Line', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 May;134(5):3539-49.,,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (CBX5 protein, human)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (invariant chain)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)']","['CA-25873/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Selection in favor of normal phenotypes in some but not all cases.,961-9,"Long-term cultures were initiated with leukemic marrow aspirate cells from each of 13 newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. Initial assessment of the clonogenic potential of the marrow suggested that normal hemopoietic progenitors were reduced in most cases and progenitors of abnormal colonies and clusters were present in 10 cases. Subsequent assays of both nonadherent and adherent fractions of long-term cultures revealed two patterns of progenitor cell behavior. The most common pattern (nine cases) featured the detection after 1-4 wk of near normal numbers of typical erythroid, granulopoietic, and mixed colony-forming progenitor cells. Progenitors of abnormal (blast) colonies and clusters initially demonstrable in eight of these nine cases were, in these cases, not sustained in long-term culture and could not be found after 4 wk. Conversion to cytogenetic normalcy in long-term culture was confirmed in two experiments in this group. The second pattern (four cases) was characterized by the failure of progenitors capable of normal differentiation to become detectable in long-term cultures, and the concomitant maintenance of blast progenitors in the two cases in this group where such cells were initially demonstrable. Although progenitors capable of producing abnormal (blast) colonies or clusters in methylcellulose were not detected in either of the other two experiments, the maintenance for 6 wk of a hypercellular nonadherent blast population in one of these suggested the persisting activity of an ""adherent layer-dependent"" leukemic progenitor cell. Taken together, these findings indicate a strong correlation between the presence of leukemic blasts and their progenitors and a decreased level of normal hemopoiesis. In addition, the failure of leukemic cells to be maintained in long-term marrow cultures from some (but not all) AML patients suggests new applications of this methodology for studies of early stages of leukemic cell development.","['Coulombel, L', 'Eaves, C', 'Kalousek, D', 'Gupta, C', 'Eaves, A']","['Coulombel L', 'Eaves C', 'Kalousek D', 'Gupta C', 'Eaves A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Child', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Time Factors', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111797 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1985 Mar;75(3):961-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI111797.,,,,PMC423636,,,,,,,,

These results demonstrate that TNF destroys FELC whether they are nondividing, dividing or partially differentiated and suggest that TNF may accomplish this by affecting cell metabolism after internalization.","['Suyama, K', 'Goldstein, J', 'Green, S']","['Suyama K', 'Goldstein J', 'Green S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Exp Cell Biol,Experimental cell biology,7701827,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Glycoproteins/*toxicity', 'Growth Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Neuraminidase', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000163299 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Cell Biol. 1985;53(2):85-92. doi: 10.1159/000163299.,,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,

Reversible inhibition of transport by the oxidizing sulfhydryl reagent o-iodosobenzoate.,49-54,"An in vitro assay system for analysis of beta-globin mRNA transport is described. Nuclei isolated from murine Friend erythroleukemia cells induced to synthesize globin mRNA, were incubated in micro-assays. By electrophoresis and hybridization analysis, released 9-S beta-globin mRNA was shown to be undegraded. After direct blotting, the released mRNA was quantified by hybridization with a labeled plasmid containing a beta-globin DNA restriction fragment. The inducibility of beta-globin mRNA transport corresponded to that previously reported for the release of rapidly labeled RNA in other assay systems. In contrast to the ineffectiveness of high concentrations of the sulfhydryl reagent iodoacetate, low concentrations of the oxidizing sulfhydryl reagent, o-iodosobenzoate, inhibited the release of beta-globin mRNA from nuclei of erythroleukemia cells, as well as the release of rapidly labeled RNA from rat liver nuclei. The inhibitory effect of the oxidizing agent on beta-globin mRNA transport could be reversed by postincubation of the nuclei with the reducing agent, dithiothreitol. The potential role of disulfide bond formation on RNA transport is discussed.","['Kindas-Mugge, I', 'Sauermann, G']","['Kindas-Mugge I', 'Sauermann G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis/methods', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Iodoacetates/pharmacology', 'Iodoacetic Acid', 'Iodobenzoates/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sulfhydryl Reagents/*pharmacology']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1985.tb08805.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1985 Apr 1;148(1):49-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1985.tb08805.x.,,"['0 (Iodoacetates)', '0 (Iodobenzoates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Reagents)', '304-91-6 (2-iodosobenzoic acid)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'WF5188V710 (Iodoacetic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,

The present study has monitored c-myc and N-ras expression in HL-60 cells during induction of myeloid and monocytic differentiation with dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylene bisacetamide, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D3. The results demonstrate that induction of HL-60 differentiation is associated with decreases in c-myc RNA, while there is little if any effect on expression of the N-ras gene. Although the diminution in c-myc expression occurred as an early event in the induction of HL-60 differentiation, the rate of decrease in c-myc transcripts varied with respect to cessation of proliferation. Thus, the appearance of the mature phenotype and loss of proliferative capacity are associated with declines in c-myc RNA, while these events appear to occur in the absence of significant alterations in N-ras expression.","['Watanabe, T', 'Sariban, E', 'Mitchell, T', 'Kufe, D']","['Watanabe T', 'Sariban E', 'Mitchell T', 'Kufe D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Oncogenes/drug effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1985/02/15 00:00,1985/02/15 00:01,['1985/02/15 00:00'],"['1985/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-291X(85)90284-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(85)90284-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1985 Feb 15;126(3):999-1005. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(85)90284-0.,,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",['CA 19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The rate of DHFR synthesis is similar in both cell lines. Furthermore, both the sensitive and resistant cells have similar amounts of RNA hybridizing to a DHFR complementary-DNA probe, correlating well with the lack of increase in DHFR protein. DHFR-gene dosages were similar in both types of cells. We conclude that the 20-fold increase in DHFR activity present in these MTX-resistant cells is not due to the overproduction of DHFR but due to the expression of a more active form of the enzyme.","['Dedhar, S', 'Hartley, D', 'Goldie, J H']","['Dedhar S', 'Hartley D', 'Goldie JH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Genes', 'HeLa Cells/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunoelectrophoresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics/*metabolism']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2250609 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1985 Feb 1;225(3):609-17. doi: 10.1042/bj2250609.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,PMC1144635,,,,,,,,

When incorporation of [3H]-delta-aminolevulinic acid into heme was compared, the maximum incorporation into the cells without lead was on the third day after induction, while it was on the fifth day in the presence of lead (5 X 10(-4) M). However, these cells did reach similar differentiation stages by the seventh day. The amount of delta-aminolevulinic acid which was excreted into the medium increased in the presence of more than 10(-4) M lead. The amount of coproporphyrin III was slightly increased with 10(-6) M lead. Protoporphyrin IX content in the cells decreased slightly with increasing concentrations of lead. delta-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity in cells which were cultured in the presence of lead was low, while synthesis of this enzyme increased in the presence of lead. The bone marrow cells from lead-poisoned rats exhibited a lag in onset of maturation, which was consistent with the effect of lead on Friend cells.","['Taketani, S', 'Kohno, H', 'Kinoshita, S', 'Tokunaga, R']","['Taketani S', 'Kohno H', 'Kinoshita S', 'Tokunaga R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coproporphyrins/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Lead/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Male', 'Porphobilinogen Synthase/analysis', 'Protoporphyrins/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1985/03/15 00:00,1985/03/15 00:01,['1985/03/15 00:00'],"['1985/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0041-008x(85)90176-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1985 Mar 15;77(3):374-80. doi: 10.1016/0041-008x(85)90176-0.,,"['0 (Coproporphyrins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '2P299V784P (Lead)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'EC 4.2.1.24 (Porphobilinogen Synthase)']",,,,,,,,,,

By using fragments of this cDNA as hybridization probes in Southern blot analysis of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic DNA, we have now examined the structure of the gene in DNA from 26 patients with acute leukemia and from 23 normal individuals. We have found that the T-cell antigen receptor gene has undergone somatic rearrangement in 14 of 14 patients with the phenotypic diagnosis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this group of patients, similar patterns of rearrangement appear to occur in different patients. This finding suggests that there is either a limited repertoire of possible rearrangements or an association between the development of leukemia and specific patterns of rearrangement. DNA from 6 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, 6 patients with non-B, non-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 23 nonleukemic individuals showed no rearrangement or polymorphism. One case of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, however, showed rearrangement of both the T-cell receptor beta chain and the constant region of the immunoglobulin gene. Studies with mixtures of DNAs from leukemic bone marrow cells and cultured skin fibroblasts, as well as with remission and relapse marrow DNAs from the same patients, indicate that this technique can detect 1% leukemic cells in a mixed population. In addition, DNA from the marrow of a patient in relapse contains a similar rearrangement to that found in the marrow sample taken at the time of diagnosis, which suggests that the original clone of leukemic cells was responsible for relapse. Our results indicate that assessment of rearrangement of the T-cell antigen receptor gene will be valuable in the diagnosis and management of leukemia and can be used to evaluate clonality in T-cell neoplasia.","['Minden, M D', 'Toyonaga, B', 'Ha, K', 'Yanagi, Y', 'Chin, B', 'Gelfand, E', 'Mak, T']","['Minden MD', 'Toyonaga B', 'Ha K', 'Yanagi Y', 'Chin B', 'Gelfand E', 'Mak T']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.4.1224 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Feb;82(4):1224-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.4.1224.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,PMC397227,,,,,,,,

These proteins function in the regulation of trace-metal metabolism, the storage of these ions in the liver, and as a protective mechanism against heavy-metal toxicity.

Conversely, the PDBU-nonadherent cells were substantially depleted of NK cells. The fact that the pAd cells do not lyse the Daudi line and that their NK activity can be further augmented by IFN-alpha would suggest that the pAd are enriched for NK cells rather than changed in their characteristics as a result of the separation procedure.

Selective inhibition of the recognition or post recognition events in the cytolytic pathway of NK cells.,2209-14,"NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity results from membrane interactions between NK effector and target cells. The role of membrane fluidity in these events is not known. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of changes in membrane lipid fluidity of NK effector and NK-sensitive target cells on the lytic pathway of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Fluidity was modulated by various lipids and measured by fluorescence polarization. NK effector cells treated with phosphatidylcholine complexed with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) showed increased membrane fluidity. This fluidization of the effector cell membrane resulted in a significant inhibition of cytotoxic activity in the 51Cr-release assay. Single cell analysis revealed that the inhibition was due to a decrease in the frequency of NK target conjugates and reduced killing of conjugated targets. Rigidification of the NK effector cell membranes by treatment with cholesteryl hemisuccinate complexed with PVP and BSA also resulted in inhibition of cytotoxicity. This inhibition was post binding, because binding was increased and lysis was abrogated. Fluidization of K562 target cell membranes caused a slight but insignificant increase in their lysis by NK cells without affecting the binding step. On the other hand, rigidification of K562 membranes decreased the sensitivity of these target cells to lysis. Single cell analysis revealed that this inhibition of NK lysis is post binding, because the frequency of killers was significantly decreased. It was also shown that membrane rigidification of target cells that were programmed for lysis during the lethal hit stage and subsequently separated from effector cells, rendered the programmed cells resistant to killing during the killer cell-independent lysis step. These results demonstrate that fluidization or rigidification of the plasma membrane of either effector or target cells affect different stages of the NK cell-mediated cytolytic events.","['Roozemond, R C', 'Bonavida, B']","['Roozemond RC', 'Bonavida B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adult', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/metabolism', '*Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Apr;134(4):2209-14.,,['0 (Membrane Lipids)'],['CA 35791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The hepatic ascorbate values suggest an endeavour by the animals to compensate for the loss through increased synthesis and storage of the vitamin, at least in the early stages of the disease.","['Bhattacharjee, J', 'Chakraborty, A S', 'Sarkar, N K', 'Basu, A', 'Mitra, S']","['Bhattacharjee J', 'Chakraborty AS', 'Sarkar NK', 'Basu A', 'Mitra S']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Comp Pathol,Journal of comparative pathology,0102444,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/blood/*metabolism/urine', 'Ascorbic Acid Deficiency/etiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/complications/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/complications/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/complications/*metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0021-9975(85)90080-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0021-9975(85)90080-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Comp Pathol. 1985 Jan;95(1):87-91. doi: 10.1016/0021-9975(85)90080-5.,,['PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)'],,,,,,,,,,

The surface antigen phenotypes of the clonogenic cells were compared with the phenotypes of the whole leukemic cell population, and with the phenotypes of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. In each case the clonogenic leukemic cells were found within a distinct subpopulation that was less ""differentiated"" than the total cell population. Clonogenic leukemic cells from different patients could be divided into three phenotype groups. In the first group (7 of 20 cases), the clonogenic cells expressed surface antigens characteristic of the normal multipotent colony-forming cell (Ia, MY9). These cases tended to have ""undifferentiated"" (FAB M1) morphology, and the total cell population generally lacked expression of ""late"" monocyte antigens such as MY3 and Mo2. A second group (seven cases) of clonogenic cells expressed surface antigens characteristic of an ""early"" (day 14) colony-forming unit granulocyte-monocyte (CFU-GM), and a third group (six cases) was characteristic of a ""late"" (day 7) CFU-GM. The cases in these latter two groups tended to have myelomonocytic (FAB M4) morphology and to express monocyte surface antigens. These results suggest that the clonogenic cells are a distinct subpopulation in all cases of AML, and may be derived from normal hematopoietic progenitor cells at multiple points in the differentiation pathway. The results further support the possibility that selected monoclonal antibodies have the potential to purge leukemic clonogenic cells from bone marrow in some AML patients without eliminating critical normal progenitor cells.","['Sabbath, K D', 'Ball, E D', 'Larcom, P', 'Davis, R B', 'Griffin, J D']","['Sabbath KD', 'Ball ED', 'Larcom P', 'Davis RB', 'Griffin JD']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Stem Cells/*pathology']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111756 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1985 Feb;75(2):746-53. doi: 10.1172/JCI111756.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']","['CA09321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA19389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36167-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC423572,,,,,,,,

The relationship of these changes in chromatin structure to globin gene activation and to cellular commitment events has been studied. Imidazole, which blocks globin gene transcription during induction does not affect the terminal differentiation of the cells nor does it prevent the acquisition of DNAse I hypersensitivity. The formation of the inducible DNase I-hypersensitive site near the globin gene accompanies the developmental events which lead to cellular differentiation independent of the transcription process. The increased MNase sensitivity of the adult beta-globin gene region, normally preceded by the acquisition of 5' DNase I hypersensitivity, was blocked by the addition of imidazole prior to but not after globin gene activation. The enhanced MNase sensitivity was not abolished by the addition of actinomycin D and, thus, reflects a part of chromatin alterations that define potential for transcription. Therefore, there is a sequential series of chromatin alterations in the globin gene region associated with murine erythroleukemia cell differentiation. The appearance of the inducible 5' DNase I-hypersensitive site precedes the onset of globin gene transcription and is strongly correlated with commitment events. The enhanced MNase sensitivity is closely related to globin gene transcription, but it is not a consequence of the transcription process. In addition, the commitment of cells to terminal differentiation is dissociable from the stimulation of globin gene transcription.","['Yu, J', 'Smith, R D']","['Yu J', 'Smith RD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*analysis', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Micrococcal Nuclease/metabolism']",1985/03/10 00:00,1985/03/10 00:01,['1985/03/10 00:00'],"['1985/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)89468-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Mar 10;260(5):3035-40.,,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '7GBN705NH1 (imidazole)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'EC 3.1.31.1 (Micrococcal Nuclease)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,

The transfectants were examined for the presence of human oncogenes in relation to tumorigenic potential and composition of surface-located fucosyl glycopeptides by gel filtration, Concanavalin-A-binding and high-performance liquid chromatography. All transfectants, harboring 3 different human cellular ras genes, appeared to be tumorigenic in nude mice and displayed characteristically altered glycopeptides. The surface glycopeptides were consistently changed to higher apparent molecular weight due to enrichment in higher-branched sialic-acid-containing glycopeptides. Similar alterations have been found previously in virally- and chemically-transformed cells in vitro and tumors raised in vivo, and were designated as cancer-related or tumor-associated glycopeptides. Revertants derived from HL60-DNA-induced transfectants, which had lost the transfected human N-ras oncogene, simultaneously lost their tumorigenic potential and expression of cancer-related membrane glycopeptides. In addition, spontaneous transformants, exhibiting morphology and growth patterns indistinguishable from those of tumor-DNA-induced transfectants, neither contained transferred human DNA sequences nor expressed cancer-related glycopeptides. Nevertheless these cells were capable, after prolonged latency periods, of inducing tumors in nude mice. Cells derived from such tumors constantly displayed cancer-related glycopeptides on their surface, suggesting selection of tumorigenic cells from spontaneous transformants during passage in nude mice. In one of these tumors at least, an endogenous mouse ras-gene appeared to be activated. The results indicate a close correlation between the presence of activated ras-oncogenes in the genome of the transfected cells, the tumorigenic potential of these cells and the expression of surface-located cancer-related glycopeptides. The data suggest that functions provided by human ras-oncogenes contribute to the alteration of membrane glycopeptides on tumor cells.","['Collard, J G', 'van Beek, W P', 'Janssen, J W', 'Schijven, J F']","['Collard JG', 'van Beek WP', 'Janssen JW', 'Schijven JF']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Oncogenes', '*Transfection', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*genetics']",1985/02/15 00:00,1985/02/15 00:01,['1985/02/15 00:00'],"['1985/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910350211 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1985 Feb 15;35(2):207-13. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910350211.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we investigate the biosynthesis and cell specificity of two characteristic murine RBC membrane glycoproteins that resemble the human RBC glycophorins: a major component of apparent molecular mass 31 kD (glycophorin MA) and a minor 46 kD component (glycophorin MB). Both glycophorins bind to wheat germ lectin and share a common protein antigenic determinant recognised by a monoclonal antibody (GP 29.4), but they differ significantly in their carbohydrate components: whilst both glycophorins contain mainly O-linked sugars, glycophorin MA contains in addition at least one N-linked carbohydrate residue and terminal sialic acid residues. Pulse-chase in vivo labelling experiments combined with in vitro translations of glycophorin mRNAs show that the initial precursor to glycophorin MA is a 24.5 kD polypeptide which is subsequently processed and glycosylated to give the mature 31 kD molecule via a 21.5 kD polypeptide intermediate. Both glycophorins MA and MB are synthesized most actively in early to mid erythroblasts (e.g., Friend cells induced for 3 days with DMSO) but their synthesis is considerably reduced by the reticulocyte stage. However, of the other cell types tested (neuroblastoma, myeloma, fibroblasts, epithelial cells and T-lymphoma cells), none synthesizes glycophorin with the possible exception of a low level in thymus tissue. Thus murine glycophorins, in contrast to the RBC cytoskeletal proteins (spectrin, ankyrin, band 4.1) seem to be restricted to the erythroid cell lineage like human glycophorin.","['Kasturi, K', 'Harrison, P']","['Kasturi K', 'Harrison P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Carbohydrates/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glycophorins/*biosynthesis', 'Immunochemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/blood', 'Mice', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(85)90167-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(85)90167-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1985 Mar;157(1):253-64. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(85)90167-3.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 50% augmentation was observed after direct mixture of monocytes with autologous null cells in the 4-hr chromium-release assay. This effect was dependent on the number of monocytes, and B cells and granulocytes were not effective. Coculture of null cells with monocytes and subsequent recovery of null cells for use as effector cells also produced significantly elevated cytolytic activity. This effect was dependent upon the number of monocytes, the length of time of coculture, and the cell donor. Augmentation of NK activity was rapid and observed after 0.5-12 hr of coculture, but suppression was observed after 36 hr; augmentation was observed with high monocyte:null cell (1:1, 1:2) ratios, and no effect was generally observed with lower ratios (1:8). At the single-cell level, the augmentation was associated with an increase in the proportion of target-binding cells which were lytically active. The augmentation of NK activity by monocytes required close cellular proximity, was mediated by a factor which was active or induced only in close proximity of the effector and producer cells, and/or was mediated by a soluble factor with a molecular weight greater than 50,000. This new demonstration that monocytes can augment as well as suppress NCMC may represent another avenue by which NK cell activity may be modulated in vivo.","['Bloom, E T', 'Babbitt, J T']","['Bloom ET', 'Babbitt JT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['*Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocytes, Null/*immunology/physiology', 'Monocytes/*immunology/physiology', 'Time Factors']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(85)90028-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(85)90028-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1985 Mar;91(1):21-32. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(85)90028-0.,,,['CA30187/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Culture of the cells in the presence of prostaglandin D2 for 3 days strongly inhibited their production of lysozyme activity. Prostaglandin D2 caused dose-dependent inhibition of the activity: 1 X 10(-6) M prostaglandin D2 caused about 50% inhibition. Inhibition by prostaglandin D2 was not related to cytotoxicity and was reversible. The rate of synthesis of lysozyme protein was measured by culturing Mm-1 cells with radioactive amino acids and then immunoprecipitating the protein. At the concentrations used, prostaglandin D2 inhibited the synthesis of lysozyme dose-dependently, but did not suppress the synthesis of total protein. Of the various types of prostaglandin, only prostaglandin D2 inhibited the production of lysozyme in Mm-1 cells. Moreover, prostaglandin D2 did not inhibit the production of other lysosomal enzymes, such as acid proteinase, acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase, and did not affect Fc receptors on the cell surface, adherence of cells to the culture dish or the cell morphology. These results indicate that prostaglandin D2 specifically inhibits the synthesis of lysozyme in Mm-1 cells. When Mm-1 cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of the ethyl acetate extract from the culture medium in which Mm-1 cells had been cultured with prostaglandin D2 for 3 days, the production of lysozyme activity of Mm-1 cells was also markedly inhibited by the extract. After the incubation of prostaglandin D2 for 3 days with Mm-1 cells, less than 10% of the initial prostaglandin D2 remained and two major metabolites appeared. These results suggest that the metabolites of prostaglandin D2 were involved in the inhibitory action of prostaglandin D2 in Mm-1 cells.","['Kasukabe, T', 'Honma, Y', 'Hozumi, M']","['Kasukabe T', 'Honma Y', 'Hozumi M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Macrophages/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Muramidase/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin D2', 'Prostaglandins D/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis']",1985/03/21 00:00,1985/03/21 00:01,['1985/03/21 00:00'],"['1985/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(85)90134-X [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(85)90134-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1985 Mar 21;844(3):330-6. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(85)90134-x.,,"['0 (Prostaglandins D)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",,,,,,,,,,

All of these cell lines, except PU5-1.8, were demonstrated to have LDL receptors that were induced 2-5-fold by preincubation in lipoprotein-deficient serum. Metabolism of dextran sulfate-LDL complexes by all lines except PU5-1.8 was observed. Three cell lines, P388D1, J774.1 and RAW 264.7, while exhibiting individual differences in their metabolism of acetyl-LDL, all processed acetyl-LDL in a fashion qualitatively analogous to that by murine peritoneal macrophages and human monocytes. Cell lines PU5-1.8, U-937 and HL-60 did not bind or degrade significant quantities of acetyl-LDL. In P388D1 cells, metabolism of acetyl-LDL exhibited time and concentration dependence, was reversibly inhibited by chloroquine, blocked by fucoidan and dextran sulfate, and was calcium independent. Approximately 4 X 10(5) receptors, with an apparent Kd of 3 X 10(-8) M, were present on P388D1 cells.

Activity was maximal at acid (4.5) and alkaline (9.5) pH, although there was also a neutral peak of activity at pH 6.5. Neutrophils were homogenised in isotonic sucrose and subjected to analytical subcellular fractionation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The gradient fractions were assayed for acid, neutral and alkaline lipase activity and for the principal organelle marker enzymes. Neutral lipase showed a unimodal distribution with an equilibrium density of 1.19 g . cm-3, corresponding to the distribution of particulate leucine aminopeptidase. Acid and alkaline lipase activities showed very similar distribution profiles to each other with both soluble components and a broad peak of particulate activity. The broad modal density of 1.19-1.22 g . cm-3 suggests that acid and alkaline lipase activities could be localised to more than one population of cytoplasmic granule. Fractionation experiments with neutrophils homogenised in sucrose medium containing digitonin confirmed the localisation of neutral lipase and leucine aminopeptidase to the same cytoplasmic granule, and suggested that at least part of the acid lipase activity was localised to the specific granule.

The blast cells in lymphoid blast crises of CML displayed the same lymphoid marker profile as those in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In three of 16 patients who were serially tested, we observed phenotypic changes in the blast cell populations. In one patient the blasts changed from lymphoid to myeloid type while remaining TdT-positive; in another case the blasts switched from granulomonocytic TdT-negative to granulomonocytic TdT-positive.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), used in 41 samples, included: morphology and techniques for myeloperoxidase (MPO), platelet-peroxidase (PPO) and acid phosphatase (AP). The majority of cases were also studied by light microscopy cytochemistry and with a battery of cell markers which are reported in the accompanying paper (San Miguel et al, 1985). The characterization of the type(s) of proliferating blasts was made from the integration of ultrastructural and immunological data. TEM morphology allowed the precise recognition of specific granules in basophil and mast-cell precursors and of ferritin particles in blasts of erythroid lineage; these rare cell types were not adequately characterized by other methods. The PPO reaction made possible the identification of pure megakaryoblastic proliferations in 38% of cases, including eight of the 11 with AM; megakaryoblasts were also present in nine of 12 cases with mixed blast cell types. The MPO and AP reactions were useful for the characterization of myeloblasts and monoblasts, respectively. Lymphoblasts could be distinguished from other cell types by TEM morphology and negative MPO and PPO reactions. TEM techniques were valuable for diagnosing correctly the type of blast cell in this study in which only four cases (8%) remained unclassifiable.","['Polli, N', ""O'Brien, M"", 'Tavares de Castro, J', 'Matutes, E', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Catovsky, D']","['Polli N', ""O'Brien M"", 'Tavares de Castro J', 'Matutes E', 'San Miguel JF', 'Catovsky D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*pathology', 'Stem Cells/*ultrastructure']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb02994.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1985 Feb;59(2):277-96. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb02994.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect was not due to a specific reduction in NK cell numbers since proportions of mononuclear cells detected by the monoclonal antibodies HNK-1 (Leu-7) and Leu-11a were normal. Furthermore NK cell activity in patients could only be partially increased by pre-incubation of effector cells with interferon (alpha IFN).

Report of two cases and review of the literature.,23-30,"A hematologic malignancy occurred simultaneously with a malignant mediastinal germ cell tumor in two men. In one instance the blood disorder was acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and in the other, malignant histiocytosis. We subsequently identified nine additional patients, all male (age range 12-48 years), with a mediastinal germ cell tumor and either acute nonlymphocytic leukemia or malignant histiocytosis. Six of the 11 patients had not received either radiation or chemotherapy before development of the hematologic malignancy. One patient developed malignant histiocytosis and was found to have a malignant mediastinal germ cell tumor after having received steroid therapy for a renal allograft. The four remaining patients developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia 5-32 months after initiation of irradiation or chemotherapy for a mediastinal germ cell tumor. In four patients with acute leukemia, karyotypic analysis established the clonal nature of the leukemic process. Although the leukemia may be therapy-related in four or possibly five patients, this explanation cannot be applied to the remaining six patients. These six patients, coupled with studies of in vitro growth characteristics of teratocarcinoma cells described previously, suggest that a previously unrecognized association between malignant mediastinal germ cell tumors and hematologic malignancies may exist in humans.","['DeMent, S H', 'Eggleston, J C', 'Spivak, J L']","['DeMent SH', 'Eggleston JC', 'Spivak JL']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Mediastinum/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology', 'Teratoma/*pathology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-198501000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1985 Jan;9(1):23-30. doi: 10.1097/00000478-198501000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation of this embryonal tumour is of clinical importance, since occasional tumours have been noted to differentiate in vivo to benign ganglioneuroma. In vitro, many human neuroblastoma cell lines can be induced to differentiate morphologically and biochemically by a variety of agents. Retinoic acid (RA), an analogue of vitamin A, has been shown to inhibit neuroblastoma cell growth and clonability in soft agar, and to induce extensive neurite outgrowth. Therefore we examined the relationship of N-myc expression to the in vitro differentiation of these cells.

In addition, it exists as a family of related polypeptides showing differential expression in these two tissues, suggesting variant-specific functions. Here we show that the pattern of protein 4.1 variants changes during the terminal differentiation of erythroid and lenticular cells, with novel variants appearing in postmitotic cells. The accumulation of these variants may lead to the final stabilization of the plasma membrane skeletons of these cells.","['Granger, B L', 'Lazarides, E']","['Granger BL', 'Lazarides E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Chickens', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Gelsolin', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Lens, Crystalline/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', '*Microfilament Proteins', 'Molecular Weight', '*Neuropeptides', 'Spectrin/metabolism']",1985/01/17 00:00,1985/01/17 00:01,['1985/01/17 00:00'],"['1985/01/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/17 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/313238a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1985 Jan 17-23;313(5999):238-41. doi: 10.1038/313238a0.,,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (brevin)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane band 4.1 protein)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1-like 1)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)']",,,,,,,,,,

PGE2 enhanced the in vitro migration of EL 4 cells while indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, reduced the extent of migration. When EL 4 cells were allowed to migrate into medium containing both indomethacin and PGE2, the cells exhibited an enhanced migration ability suggesting an extrinsic effect on cells by PGE2. The participation of tumor-derived PGE2 in promoting tumor spread in a host was supported by demonstration that EL 4 cells grown in indomethacin-treated mice secreted less PGE2 and had reduced in vivo dissemination ability. These results indicated that tumor spread was promoted by tumor-derived PGE2. The extent of migration and dissemination can be reduced by prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as indomethacin.","['Mahan, M', 'Meunier, J', 'Newby, M', 'Young, M R']","['Mahan M', 'Meunier J', 'Newby M', 'Young MR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dinoprostone', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prostaglandins E/*biosynthesis/physiology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1985 Jan;74(1):191-5.,,"['0 (Prostaglandins E)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",,,,,,,,,,

Cellular protein content coupled with nuclear geometric parameters can be used to evaluate cellular maturation and differentiation. In this study, leucoblasts from 50 cases of adult acute myeloid leukemia were analyzed by flow cytometry, and semiautomatic morphometry was performed on bone marrow smears. Ethanol-fixed bone marrow blast cells were stained for DNA with propidium iodide (PI) and for proteins with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). On the resulting FITC versus PI histograms we defined the cells with low protein content which are associated with a nonproliferating subpopulation (LPC fraction). Low protein content fraction and S-phase are correlated (p less than 0.01). The LPC fraction values are more dispersed than S-phase values and thus should indicate more clearly eventual differences between cellular populations. This hypothesis has been tested with the prognostic significance of cell-cycle variables: The LPC fraction was significantly higher in the complete remission group than in the other (p less than 0.01), while S-phase did not show any difference. The peak value of the protein content histograms is significantly lower in the granulocytic leukemias (M1, M2, M3) than in the leukemias with a monoblastic component (M4, M5). Furthermore, we showed that the differentiation and the maturation of the myeloid blast cells modify the nuclear size. The combination of these two parameters provides useful information for cytological classification.","['Ffrench, M', 'Bryon, P A', 'Fiere, D', 'Vu Van, H', 'Gentilhomme, O', 'Adeleine, P', 'Viala, J J']","['Ffrench M', 'Bryon PA', 'Fiere D', 'Vu Van H', 'Gentilhomme O', 'Adeleine P', 'Viala JJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Prognosis']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990060109 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1985 Jan;6(1):47-53. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990060109.,,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,

Using leukemia as a model we have found that the release of 51Cr from labeled tumor cells treated with antibody and complement can be an equivocal measure of cell viability. Combined with its restricted sensitivity (less than a 2 log range of cell killing) this makes this widely used assay of questionable value for detecting small numbers of viable cells, or for identifying subpopulations of complement-resistant cells. As an alternative we have developed a [125I]iododeoxyuridine (125IUdR) uptake assay, that combines the simplicity and rapidity of the 51Cr release technique with the sensitivity of a clonogenic assay. This method eliminates the problem of spontaneous isotope release, inherent in prelabeling assays, and variability from experiment to experiment can be avoided by including a viable cell standard curve within each assay. The sensitivity of the 125IUdR uptake method, which can be completed within a day, is similar to that of a 10 day methylcellulose cloning assay and was capable of detecting the presence of a minor subpopulation of complement-resistant tumor cells.","['Gee, A P', 'Rolfe, A E', 'Worthington-White, D', 'Graham-Pole, J', 'Boyle, M D']","['Gee AP', 'Rolfe AE', 'Worthington-White D', 'Graham-Pole J', 'Boyle MD']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromium Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay/*methods', 'Complement System Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Idoxuridine/metabolism', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Mice/immunology', 'Rabbits/immunology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay/*methods']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0090-1229(85)90030-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1985 Feb;34(2):263-71. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(85)90030-3.,,"['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)']",['CA-34060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In an effort to study directly the expression and behavior of Ia surface molecules on myeloid progenitor cells, we used an immunologic purification technique to enrich these cells approximately 100-fold from the peripheral blood of CML patients. The majority of cells in this blast population expressed HLA-DR antigens. Thirty percent to 40% of cells could form a granulocyte or monocyte colony in agar, and these cells tended to express the highest levels of HLA-DR. The number of HLA-DR molecules per cell increased about twofold as the cells tranversed the cell cycle from G0/G1 to G2/M. This was true for unstimulated cells or cells exposed to colony-stimulating factors. Some of this increase was related to a corresponding increase in cell size and is also seen with other cell surface antigens such as beta-2-microglobulin. Ia antigen expression was not modified by culture with colony-stimulating factors, fetal calf serum, or serum-free, prostaglandin-free medium for periods of up to 24 hours. These results demonstrate that Ia antigens are expressed on the myeloid progenitor cells of CML, are increased in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and are stable under most in vitro culture conditions for at least 24 hours of culture.","['Cannistra, S A', 'Daley, J F', 'Larcom, P', 'Griffin, J D']","['Cannistra SA', 'Daley JF', 'Larcom P', 'Griffin JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Monocytes/immunology']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83688-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Feb;65(2):414-22.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']","['5T32CA09172-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 19389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 3616701/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

One or more of four types of CT-scan abnormalities were observed: ventricular dilatation (VD), subarachnoid space dilatation (SAD), areas of parenchymal decreased attenuation coefficient (DAC), and intracerebral calcifications (CALs). To study the natural history of these findings, serial CT scans were obtained on 24 of the original 32 patients who were available for long-term follow-up. CT scanning was performed for a minimum of seven years from the initiation of CNS preventive therapy. Review of the CT scans showed that VD (n = 5) and SAD (n = 7) were stable over the time of follow-up. DAC, originally observed in two patients, was no longer present on follow-up scans. In contrast, five patients developed CALS from five to seven years after initiation of CNS preventive therapy. All occurred in children who were less than 8 years of age at the time of diagnosis (P less than .01). These data indicate that CALs may develop many years after the cessation of CNS preventive therapy and suggest that long-term CT-scan follow-up should be considered in children who have received CNS preventive therapy.","['Riccardi, R', 'Brouwers, P', 'Di Chiro, G', 'Poplack, D G']","['Riccardi R', 'Brouwers P', 'Di Chiro G', 'Poplack DG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Brain/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Calcinosis/etiology', 'Cerebral Ventricles/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dilatation, Pathologic/etiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy', 'Subarachnoid Space/pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1985.3.1.12 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1985 Jan;3(1):12-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1985.3.1.12.,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1981) Cancer Res. 41, 4621-4628). In this report, we examine the mechanism for reduction of glycophorin expression. By immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins, we found an 11-fold reduction in the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into glycophorin after 48 h of TPA treatment. This was found to closely correlate with a reduction in [35S]methionine incorporation, suggesting that regulation occurs at the level of protein synthesis and not glycosylation. We also found that TPA decreased the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into glycophorin in another leukemic cell line, HEL. A time course showed that there was a 3-fold reduction in glycophorin biosynthesis as early as 4 h after TPA treatment. The level then decreased to approximately 10% of the untreated control levels after 12 h of treatment. The reduction in glycophorin biosynthesis was found to be reversible following removal of TPA from the culture medium. By immunoprecipitation of in vitro translation products directed by purified total cellular RNA, we found that there is a corresponding decrease in glycophorin mRNA activity. Glycophorin mRNA activity was extensively reduced as early as 1 h after TPA treatment and by 12 h was nearly undetectable. Interestingly, the size of the primary translation product was found to be 8 kDa larger than the fully processed apoprotein. These results are consistent with the transcriptional regulation of glycophorin expression by TPA.","['Siebert, P D', 'Fukuda, M']","['Siebert PD', 'Fukuda M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Genes/*drug effects', 'Glucosamine/metabolism', 'Glycophorins/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*genetics', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tritium']",1985/01/10 00:00,1985/01/10 00:01,['1985/01/10 00:00'],"['1985/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/10 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)89780-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Jan 10;260(1):640-5.,,"['0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['R01 CA 33000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Our laboratory has developed an improved differentiation system in which the use of rapidly inducing MEL subclones and culture conditions which stabilize terminally differentiated cells results in highly synchronous differentiation and the accumulation of large numbers of cells in the end stages of differentiation. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the proteins of MEL cell cytoplasm have been fractionated at different times of induction in the improved system. The protein composition of MEL cell cytoplasm changes dramatically during the differentiation program, in contrast to previously reported results. We observe patterns of changes that are consistent with alterations in the relative degradative rates as well as the relative synthetic rates of the different proteins. We find that the rate of incorporation of labeled amino acid into protein is reduced in induced cultures of MEL cells. We demonstrate that the contribution of uninduced cells to the protein patterns observed late in differentiation is minor in our system, and argue that the results previously obtained for differentiating MEL cells were influenced by the heterogeneity of the induced populations.","['Parker, D', 'Housman, D']","['Parker D', 'Housman D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis']",1985/01/10 00:00,1985/01/10 00:01,['1985/01/10 00:00'],"['1985/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/10 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)89775-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Jan 10;260(1):604-9.,,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],"['CA 14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

G 1/0-specific growth arrest could occur without the usual associated subsequent phenotypic differentiation into mature myeloid cells, suggesting that growth arrest and phenotypic differentiation are separately regulated. In the course of differentiating, the cells achieved a semi-stable intermediate state where they had a labile, pre-commitment memory of exposure to inducer, but were not yet committed to differentiation. This state was associated with a nuclear structural change previously found to be associated with the precommitment memory state. The process of differentiation could thus be resolved into two steps, early events up through development of pre-commitment memory and late events subsequents to pre-commitment memory. The kinetics of terminal cell differentiation indicated that the cellular regulatory event initiating a program of differentiation in response to inducer was S phase-specific. A comparison of the present results for DSMO to previous results for retinoic acid (RA)-induced HL-60 myeloid differentiation showed that the two inducers effect different cellular pathways for differentiation of HL-60 cells to mature myeloid cells, but with certain common features including the above S-phase specificity and pre-commitment memory.","['Yen, A']",['Yen A'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interphase/*drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mathematics', 'Models, Biological']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(85)90274-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(85)90274-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1985 Jan;156(1):198-212. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(85)90274-5.,,['YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)'],,,,,,,,,,

No significant overall changes were recorded in any of the biochemical indices of renal or hepatic function between the first and third infusions, but the patient who exhibited the largest reduction in Cl showed a marked increase in AST levels and a reduction in albumin concentration.

Studies in wild-type and mutant HL-60 cells have provided evidence that the free-base TGua is the form of this drug that induces differentiation, while the formation of TGua nucleotides leads to cytotoxicity and inhibits differentiation. To attempt to increase the potential of TGua to serve as an inducer of parental HL-60 leukemia cells, physiological purine and pyrimidine nucleosides were tested for their ability to protect HL-60 cells against TGua-induced cytotoxicity. Adenosine, deoxyadenosine, inosine, and deoxyinosine completely prevented the toxic action of the purinethiol, while guanosine and deoxyguanosine were only partially effective. The capacity of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to prevent the cytotoxicity of TGua was abolished by the inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, deoxycoformycin, implying that inosine and deoxyinosine were the active forms of the protecting agents. The protective activities of inosine and deoxyinosine appeared to depend on phosphorolysis catalyzed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase, since exogenously added hypoxanthine was as effective as inosine in reducing the cytotoxicity of the purine antimetabolite. Accumulation of TGua nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction of HL-60 cells treated with TGua was significantly decreased by the presence of inosine. Inosine also served under these circumstances as a D-ribose 1-phosphate donor to TGua, as evidenced by its increased conversion to 6-thioguanosine. The prevention of the cytotoxicity of TGua by the simultaneous administration of hypoxanthine or its nucleosides resulted in an expression of the differentiation-inducing properties of TGua in HL-60 cells, as measured by the accumulation of nitroblue tetrazolium-positive cells. These findings support the concept that the processes of cytotoxicity and differentiation are separable events produced by different metabolic forms of the purine antimetabolite.","['Ishiguro, K', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Ishiguro K', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency', 'Hypoxanthines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Jan;45(1):91-5.,,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']","['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Thus, natural killer cells are present at the tumor site, show lytic capability, but appear to be unable to recycle for multiple lytic events.","['Moy, P M', 'Holmes, E C', 'Golub, S H']","['Moy PM', 'Holmes EC', 'Golub SH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology/secondary', 'Melanoma/immunology', 'Osteosarcoma/immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Jan;45(1):57-60.,,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",['CA12582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In five patients, the only abnormality was a rather subtle structural rearrangement (e.g., tiny deletion). Five other patients had clonal changes which were found in less than 10% of the mitoses examined in each case.

This additional selection pressure resulted in a cell line, CCRF-CEM/R2, resistant to methotrexate by virtue of both an elevation of dihydrofolate reductase activity and a marked decrease in methotrexate transport. The R1 and R2 cells were approximately 70- and 350-fold more resistant to methotrexate than were the parent cells. The effects of three folate antagonists were studied on these cell lines and also on CCRF-CEM/R3 cells, characterized by impaired methotrexate transport but normal levels of dihydrofolate reductase. The elevated reductase subline CCRF-CEM/R1 was cross-resistant to triazinate [Baker's antifol, NSC 139105; ethanesulfonic acid compounded with alpha-(2-chloro-4-[4,6-diamino-2,2-dimethyl-S-triazine-1-(2H)-yl] phenoxyl)-N,N-dimethyl-m-toluamide (1:1)] and trimetrexate (NSC 249008, JB-11, TMQ; 2,4-diamino-6-[(3,4,5-trimethoxyanilino)methyl]quinazoline), two nonclassical folate antagonists. In contrast, the transport defective subline, CCRF-CEM/R3 was not cross-resistant to these two compounds. In cells resistant to MTX by virtue of both mechanisms, CCRF-CEM/R2, triazinate, and trimetrexate were partially cross-resistant. All three methotrexate-resistant sublines showed minor cross-resistance to isoaminohydroxyquinazoline (IAHQ, NSC 289517; 5,8-dideazaisopteroylglutamate), a folate antagonist inhibitor of thymidylate synthase.

A higher frequency of nonclonal chromosomal changes was found in patients with clonal abnormalities compared with those without such abnormalities. Male patients tended to gain chromosomes and had more hyperdiploid abnormalities than female patients, who tended to lose chromosomes and had more hypodiploid abnormalities. This trend of chromosomal gain in males and loss in females mainly involved chromosomes similar in size to the sex chromosomes. Three female patients with trisomy 8 and one with 7q+ and t(8;21) showed an X chromosome twisted into a spiral shape.

In principle, esters of cortoic acids could fulfill these criteria, if they had sufficient affinity for the glucocorticoid receptors but were rapidly hydrolyzed to the inactive acids in the circulation. With this rationale, we have synthesized esters of the 21-oic acid of triamcinolone acetonide (TA, 9 alpha-fluoro-11 beta, 16 alpha, 17 alpha, 21-tetrahydroxy-pregna-1, 4-diene-3,20-dione 16,17-acetonide), a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, in both tritiated and unlabeled forms. The synthesis involves 1) oxidation to the 21-dehydro compound with methanolic cupric acetate, 2) further oxidation to the acid with methylene blue in the presence of KCN at pH 6.5, 3) esterification with diazomethane in the presence of methanol or ethanol, to produce the methyl ester of TA (TAme) or ethyl ester, respectively, and 4) purification of the products by TLC and HPLC. The molecular weights and structures of the esters were established by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. The binding of [3H]TAme to steroid receptors or serum steroid-binding proteins and the in vitro hydrolysis of the ester were evaluated simultaneously, by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 columns in aqueous buffer. [3H]TAme is bound with high affinity by receptors from human leukemic cells and rat liver. The pattern of competition for this binding is characteristic of glucocorticoid receptors: TA approximately equal to TAme greater than R5020 (a synthetic progestin) approximately equal to aldosterone greater than 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. [3H]TAme is not bound detectably by serum steroid-binding proteins and is rapidly hydrolyzed during incubation with serum at 37 C. The acidic product has a very low affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. Complexes of [3H]TAme with human and rat receptors have sedimentation coefficients of 9-10S in hypotonic buffer containing 20 mM Na2MoO4 and approximately 4S in hypertonic, molybdate-free buffer.

Established therapy and its limitations.,100-17,"Diseases affecting host defense mechanisms include neutropenia, aplastic anemia, leukemia, lymphocytopenia (B- and T-lymphocyte abnormalities), deficiencies of complement, splenectomy, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and autoimmune diseases. Immunocompromised patients face frequent life-threatening complications of infections, particularly when they are hospitalized and receiving cytotoxic myelosuppressive drugs. Oral antimicrobial agents affect the flora of the host's alimentary tract, enhancing colonization by resistant, potentially pathogenic, strains and species, especially in a hospital environment. Nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, pipemidic acid, polymyxins, co-trimoxazole, polyene antibiotics, and framycetin, which preserve anaerobic colon flora, do not affect the host's colonization resistance and can be given in oral doses high enough to suppress and clear susceptible potential pathogens from the intestinal tract. Such prophylactic treatment permits patients to stay hospitalized in ward conditions. In the compromised host who has fever and suspected septicemia, a decision concerning treatment should be made within an hour of notification of the patient's condition. In acute stages of life-threatening infection, the principal aim of antimicrobial chemotherapy is to provide the most potent treatment; at this stage, the accompanying side effects are less important. An essential component of therapy should be an aminoglycoside paired with a beta-lactam antibiotic. Because the incidence of staphylococcal resistance to antibiotics is high, preliminary sensitivity-testing is essential when staphylococcal sepsis threatens the life of a compromised host. Despite aggressive antibiotic therapy, more than half of immunocompromised patients and patients with severe underlying diseases die when gram-negative bacteria invade their blood. In these patients, medical or surgical removal of the septic focus is a major part of management, but plasma or plasma fractions should be given to correct hypovolemia, and an agent such as dopamine should be administered if volume replacement fails to restore adequate blood pressure. A high dose of corticosteroids should have a beneficial effect, and, for neutropenic patients with gram-negative bacteremia or fever, transfusion with functional neutrophils improves survival.","['Periti, P', 'Mazzei, T']","['Periti P', 'Mazzei T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,IM,"['Aminoglycosides/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Lactams', 'Penicillin Resistance', 'Penicillins/therapeutic use', 'Pseudomonas Infections/drug therapy', 'Staphylococcus/drug effects']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Ther. 1985;8(1):100-17.,,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Lactams)', '0 (Penicillins)']",,,,,,,,,,

In this international study the reactivity profiles of monoclonal antibodies were analyzed on normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. The Workshop was divided into three categories: the T-cell, B-cell and myelomonocytic cell studies. We blindly tested 159 coded monoclonal antibodies of the panel for the T-cell study on 22 permanently established leukemia cell lines. The monoclonal antibodies were provided by the Workshop Committee and their reactivity with the target cells was visualized by standardized indirect immunofluorescence. After decoding it was recognized that 11 monoclonal antibodies had been examined on these cell lines prior to the Workshop. The reactivity of these 11 monoclonal antibodies was analyzed and compared with the earlier results. From a total of 217 paired tests done blindly in the Workshop study and prior to the Workshop, 191 tests (88%) did not show significantly different data. The possible reasons for discrepancies include nonspecific Fc-receptor-binding on some cell lines and a relatively nonspecific reactivity of some monoclonal antibodies. This analysis demonstrates the stability of the antigen expression on human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines grown at consistently optimal conditions, for the tests, using the same monoclonal antibodies as in the Workshop, had been performed 0.5-5 years prior to the Workshop study. On the other hand, nonspecific Fc-binding, wide ""specificity"" of monoclonal antibodies and a shift in antigen expression of the cells (due to poor growth conditions, involuntary induction of differentiation and other factors) must be taken into consideration upon immunological analysis.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gignac, S', 'Misra, B', 'Skowron, L', 'Menon, M', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Gignac S', 'Misra B', 'Skowron L', 'Menon M', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00199777 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1985;20(1):75-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00199777.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, there are several open questions, such as the route, mode and dosage of IFN application. These variables of IFN treatment may be critical since a myelosuppressive effect of IFN, which is commonly seen in the initial phase of treatment, can result in further deterioration of the already impaired platelet production in advanced HCL. The present study shows that serious side effects can be avoided and the flu-like syndromes described by others almost completely reduced by s.c. application of IFN via a portable pump during a daily 8 h period. IFN is initially given five times a week and the daily dose is adjusted according to the actual platelet count. The efficiency controls show that the increase of platelets in the peripheral blood, which is most critical in advanced HCL, may be seen earlier by this than by other protocols, which usually recommend higher daily doses of IFN and only three instead of five weekly applications.","['Porzsolt, F', 'Thoma, J', 'Unsold, M', 'Wolf, W', 'Obert, H J', 'Kubanek, B', 'Heimpel, H']","['Porzsolt F', 'Thoma J', 'Unsold M', 'Wolf W', 'Obert HJ', 'Kubanek B', 'Heimpel H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Platelet Count']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00320115 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1985 Aug;51(2):73-82. doi: 10.1007/BF00320115.,,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],,,,,,,,,,

Gastrin kinases were detected in various transformed cells: human lymphomas, K562 cells, cells from a patient with acute proliferative leukemia, and normal cells: human T and B lymphocytes.","['Fagard, R', 'Gacon, G', 'Boissel, J P', 'Reibel, L', 'Piau, J P', 'Fischer, S', 'Schapira, G', 'Accary, J P']","['Fagard R', 'Gacon G', 'Boissel JP', 'Reibel L', 'Piau JP', 'Fischer S', 'Schapira G', 'Accary JP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Biochem Biophys Methods,Journal of biochemical and biophysical methods,7907378,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', '*Gastrins', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/*analysis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Vanadates', 'Vanadium/pharmacology', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-022X(85)90065-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-022x(85)90065-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem Biophys Methods. 1985 Mar;10(5-6):307-14. doi: 10.1016/0165-022x(85)90065-x.,,"['0 (Gastrins)', '00J9J9XKDE (Vanadium)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",,,,,,,,,,

We explored the possibility that patients with CLL have a defect in binding the potent opsonin C3b to bacteria. Bacteria selected for these experiments included Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, which binds C3 by activating the classical complement pathway (CCP), type 25, which can bind normal amounts of C3b by the alternative complement pathway (ACP), type 14, which can activate both the CCP and ACP, and Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, both of which activate the CCP. Bacteria were treated with normal serum or serum from 15 patients with CLL, and the bound C3b was quantified spectrophotofluorometrically. Despite normal serum concentrations of C3, C4, Factor B, C-reactive protein, and total hemolytic complement activity, all 15 CLL sera bound reduced amounts of C3b to at least one bacterial species; 9 to S pneumoniae type 3, 8 to types 14 and 25, 11 to S aureus, and 13 to E coli. Mixing normal serum with CLL serum restored C3b binding to all bacteria, suggesting a deficiency rather than an inhibitor of activity. Serum from ten hypogammaglobulinemic CLL patients bound less C3b (62.7 +/- 5% of normal) (means +/- SEM) than those with normal immunoglobulin levels (81.9 +/- 5%) (p less than .005). Nevertheless, the addition of specific antibacterial antibodies to CLL serum did not enhance C3b binding to any of the bacteria. Serum from patients with a history of a bacterial infection bound less C3b (62.3 +/- 5%) than those without a history of infections (76.1 +/- 6%) (p less than .05). Thus, there is a defect in either the activation or activity of C3 in CLL serum which may contribute to the increased incidence of infections in these patients.","['Heath, M E', 'Cheson, B D']","['Heath ME', 'Cheson BD']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Blood Bactericidal Activity', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement C3/analysis', 'Complement C3b/metabolism', 'Complement C4/analysis', 'Complement Factor B/analysis', 'Complement Pathway, Classical', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*immunology']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830190109 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1985 May;19(1):63-73. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830190109.,,"['0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Complement C4)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '80295-43-8 (Complement C3b)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', 'EC 3.4.21.47 (Complement Factor B)']",,,,,,,,,,

Susceptibility to various beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides was investigated in members of the two most frequent species: Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. S. haemolyticus strains were not only more often resistant to methicillin than S. epidermidis strains (respectively 81% and 17%) but they were more highly resistant (mean MICs respectively 85 and 19 mg/L). Methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus strains were highly resistant to nine other beta-lactam antibiotics, whereas methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis strains showed both lower levels and a narrower spectrum of cross-resistance. Resistance to methicillin in members of both species was ""heterogeneous"", i.e., only a minority of cells in a culture showed significant resistance.

Regulating permissible exposures on the basis of very-low-dose risk extrapolation uses scientific information that may not meet either criterion. With regard to clarity, it is difficult for an individual to conceive of the meaning of risks on the order of 1 in 1,000,000 lifetime excess. With regard to scientific validity, the uncertainties of extrapolating risks at very low doses are evident in the wide variation in results produced depending on the statistical and pharmacokinetic assumptions made. An alternative approach is to fix benchmarks from which safety factors are chosen (Gaylor, 1983). For epidemiological data, we propose a benchmark of that exposure which would cause 1% cancer excess with 10 yr of exposure followed by 30 yr of further followup. These values have been chosen at this stage of development since they are close to observable values in many cancer epidemiology studies. In the first stage, excess cancer risk versus duration of exposure is plotted and the excess risk is estimated for a exposure duration of 10 yr. The next step involves a short linear extrapolation from the exposure levels linked with this excess risk to the exposure levels that would cause a 1% excess risk over a duration of 10 yr. We have established preliminary benchmarks from published data for benzene and radon daughter exposure. Permissable exposure levels might then be set by deciding on safety factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Smith, A H', 'Sharp, D S']","['Smith AH', 'Sharp DS']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicology and industrial health,8602702,IM,"['Carcinogens, Environmental/*toxicity', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Risk']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/074823378500100413 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Ind Health. 1985 Dec;1(4):205-12. doi: 10.1177/074823378500100413.,,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)']",,,,,,,,,,

Of the 220 new patients listed, 16 (7.3%) sought initial care in the ED (1 per 4,500 ED visits). Seven had leukemia, five had non-CNS solid tumors (2 lymphoreticular, 1 Wilms', 1 neuroblastoma, and 1 ovarian), and four had CNS tumors. Among the children with leukemia, pallor (6) and decreased activity (4) were the most common complaints. Duration of symptoms ranged from 4 days to 3 weeks. Physical examination showed pallor (5), splenomegaly (4), fever (3), hepatomegaly (3), lymphadenopathy (3), and ecchymoses or petechiae (2). The complete blood count and peripheral smears were all abnormal. The five patients with non-CNS solid tumors had symptoms related to the location of their neoplasms. The patients with Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, and ovarian dysgerminoma had abdominal masses; the patient with lymphoma had a large, painful inguinal node; and the patient with histiocytosis X had an infiltrative rash, gingivitis, and pneumonitis. Of the four children with CNS tumors, three had headache, and one had an incidentally detected scotoma following head trauma. All four eventually had abnormal neurologic exams and computer tomographic scans, but two were discharged initially with psychiatric diagnoses.

Similar mutations have been observed in ras oncogenes activated during induction of neoplasia in both humans and experimental animals. The unmutated normal rat or human c-Ha-ras-1 genes have the ability to transform NIH 3T3 cells in culture when activated by a RNA synthesis promoter. These findings raise the question of whether the mutations are necessary for the ras oncogenes to induce the neoplastic phenotype in vivo. To address this question, we inserted the normal human c-Ha-ras-1 or its mutated counterpart EJ/T24 bladder carcinoma oncogene independently into a retrovirus vector derived from the M1 strain of Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MoMuSV). Both recombinant clones induced foci of transformed cells in an NIH 3T3 cell transfection assay. Infectious virus particles were rescued from cloned transformants carrying a single copy of the integrated provirus using the nonpathogenic amphotrophic wild mouse leukemia virus (WMLV) as helper. The pseudotypes rescued from the EJ/T24-containing transformants had higher titers than the normal c-Ha-ras-1 pseudotypes as determined by a focus assay and gave rise to larger and earlier detected foci upon infection of NIH 3T3 cells. The two pseudotypes were tested for in vivo pathogenicity by inoculation into newborn NFS mice and were compared to the pseudotype WMLV/Harvey murine sarcoma virus (HaMuSV) (positive control) and WMLV (negative control). While the WMLV/EJ/T24 and the WMLV/HaMuSV pseudotypes induced erythroleukemias and sarcomas with a latency period of 6-9 weeks, the WMLV/c-Ha-ras-1 pseudotype induced only mild splenomegaly. As expected the WMLV negative control induced no pathology. Tumor-bearing animals that were not euthanized at 6-9 weeks died within 2-3 months following virus inoculation.","['Chang, E H', 'Morgan, P L', 'Lee, E J', 'Pirollo, K F', 'White, E A', 'Patrick, D H', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Chang EH', 'Morgan PL', 'Lee EJ', 'Pirollo KF', 'White EA', 'Patrick DH', 'Tsichlis PN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Pathol,Journal of experimental pathology,8400623,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', '*Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Transfection', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*genetics']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Pathol. 1985 Fall;2(3):177-89.,,,['CA 34582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Morphological, cytochemical, immunological and cytogenetic marker analysis demonstrated that the in vitro cells represent genotypically and phenotypically the in vivo Hodgkin (H) and Sternberg-Reed (SR) cells in biopsy specimens. The cultured cells resemble haematolymphoid cells at different stages of maturation. Four of the five continue to grow in vitro as suspension cells after more than 50 months. Four more in vitro HD-derived lines were described recently by several authors. A summary of the various marker characteristics of these in vitro lines is given as a synopsis of the phenotypic marker spectrum and is discussed in comparison with our own cell lines. There is a striking similarity between two of the newly established lines (CO, HDLM-2) and our lines whereas the two other in vitro established cultures seem to resemble cell species further along the line of maturation to B lymphocytes (DEV) and monocytes (SU-HD-1). Gene rearrangement experiments undertaken with the L428, L540, L591 and the CO cell line show that the L428 and 591 cells have undergone gene rearrangement, the L428 being compatible with the genotypic state of a pre-B cell; the L591 cells, similarly rearranged furthermore demonstrated functional light chain rearrangement, compatible with B-cell development. By cytogenetic analysis chromosome 7 was found to be affected in all our described lines. This chromosome appears to be particularly unstable and vulnerable in patients with HD, since all tested cell lines revealed multiple abnormalities of this chromosome, a finding which is in accordance with observations made by other investigators in HD-biopsy cells. Since similar structural changes or loss of chromosome 7 is a characteristic event in cases of secondary acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia, it is speculated that this form of secondary neoplasia could resemble the blast crisis, as observed in chronic myeloid leukaemia.","['Diehl, V', 'Pfreundschuh, M', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Stein, H', 'Falk, M', 'Burrichter, H', 'Schaadt, M']","['Diehl V', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Fonatsch C', 'Stein H', 'Falk M', 'Burrichter H', 'Schaadt M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Genotype', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Phenotype']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1985;4(2):399-419.,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now well established that most murine tumours express multiple tumour-associated antigens and in many cases it has been possible to show that these multiple antigens are expressed on completely different molecules. In the case of tumours induced by DNA and RNA viruses, certain virally encoded proteins may be tumour antigens. However, these tumours, like tumours of nonviral origin, also express other antigen-bearing molecules that are encoded by cellular genes. Frequently, the same tumour-associated antigen-bearing molecules are shared by all independently induced tumours of similar aetiology leading to the prediction that the expression of these antigenic molecules is linked to the molecular events necessary for tumour induction. Many of the nonviral tumour-associated antigen-bearing molecules purified to date are also found on normal tissues, but the normal metabolic function of these molecules and the alterations that render them antigenic are not yet understood.","['Rogers, M J', 'Galetto, G']","['Rogers MJ', 'Galetto G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1985;4(1):35-49.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (tumor-associated transplantation antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,

GOE1734, an analog of a group of compounds known for other than antitumor effects with relatively simple N-acyl-O-phenylenediamine structure, is characterized by a low bacterial mutagenic potential after in vitro metabolic activation and DNA-DNA crosslinking activity after in vivo treatment. Maximum tolerated doses in rats and dogs amount to 4 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. High growth-inhibiting efficacy was obtained in intratibially implanted osteosarcoma, in methylnitrosourea-induced primary mammary carcinoma, and in acetoxymethyl-methylnitrosamine-induced colorectal adenocarcinoma. GOE1734 proved to be ineffective in transplanted Yoshida sarcoma and Walker 256 carcinosarcoma when single or multiple doses were administered at dose levels that were moderately toxic or not toxic. Some antitumor effects were observed in L5222 leukemia after ip transplantation, but no effect could be observed after ic implantation or in vitro incubation and subsequent retransplantation of these cells.

CI-920 was active against murine leukemia P388, and highly active and curative against L1210 leukemia in vivo. CI-920 was less active or inactive against the murine solid tumors tested. Daily administration for five to nine days was more effective against L1210 leukemia than a single dose or doses every four days. Given three times daily for five days, CI-920 was more toxic and less active. CI-920 had similar activity intravenously and intraperitoneally. Oral administration was inactive and nontoxic. Subcutaneous treatment was less effective and more toxic. Structure-activity relationship studies showed that the phosphate group was essential for antitumor activity in vivo and in vitro. Hydrolyzing the lactone ring also resulted in loss of antitumor activity, as did acetylation of the 6-hydroxyl group. Hydroxylation at the 5-position of the lactone ring resulted in partial retention of antitumor activity, but in greater toxicity to mice. Removal of the 13-hydroxyl group resulted in retention of high antitumor activity with approximately three-fold improvement in dose-potency. CI-920 is not cytotoxic to prokaryotic cells. CI-920 causes inhibition of biosynthesis of RNA and DNA in intact L1210 cells. Protein synthesis is also inhibited at higher drug concentrations. The inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis is not an antimetabolite effect, since pools of ribonucleoside triphosphates and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates are not depleted. CI-920 does not cause DNA strand breakage, as measured by alkaline elution, and is not mutagenic in the Ames test at concentrations up to 200 micrograms/ml. CI-920 does not cause direct inhibition of RNA polymerase or DNA polymerase in permeabilized cells. It is possible that CI-920 must be metabolically activated within the target cells; alternatively it may interact with a component of chromatin other than DNA or the polymerases. Flow cytometry studies showed that growth-inhibitory levels of CI-920 caused accumulation of cells in the G2+M region. Higher drug concentrations caused an S-phase block. CI-920 is an inhibitor and irreversible inactivator of reduced folate membrane transport, and appears to enter cells by this receptor. L1210 cells selected for resistance to CI-920 are cross-resistant to methotrexate, and deficient in reduced folate transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Jackson, R C', 'Fry, D W', 'Boritzki, T J', 'Roberts, B J', 'Hook, K E', 'Leopold, W R']","['Jackson RC', 'Fry DW', 'Boritzki TJ', 'Roberts BJ', 'Hook KE', 'Leopold WR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,IM,"['Alkenes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Polyenes', 'Pyrones', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(85)90048-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1985;23:193-215. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(85)90048-2.,,"['0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Pyrones)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'ZO1648L551 (fostriecin)']",['N01-CM-37614/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The two-drug combination was also given intermittently with continuous 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate during the first year of continuation chemotherapy. Periodic intrathecal methotrexate and delayed cranial irradiation were used to prevent central nervous system involvement.

Preventive CNS therapy in both studies consisted of intrathecal methotrexate (12 mg/m2) given monthly during the first six months of therapy and then every three months until all treatment was stopped. Children with CNS leukemia at diagnosis or relapse were given intrathecal chemotherapy weekly for four weeks and then monthly throughout the remainder of the treatment course. Those continuing in complete remission received 2,400 rad cranial irradiation plus five doses of intrathecal methotrexate before cessation of therapy. The 38 children (20.7%) with CNS leukemia at diagnosis were more likely to have an initial leukocyte count greater than or equal to 25 X 10(9)/L (P = .01) and age less than 2 years (P = .03). The presence of CNS leukemia at diagnosis did not adversely affect the remission induction rate (P = .13) or the length of complete remissions (P = .73). CNS relapse ended initial remissions in 11 patients only and did not preclude subsequent long-term survival, as four of these children are off therapy and in second complete remission for 33+ to 78+ months. Three features at diagnosis were predictive of CNS relapse: monocytic or myelomonocytic leukemia (P = .002); age less than 2 years (P = .0001); and leukocyte count greater than or equal to 25 X 10(9)/L (P = .012). By stepwise Cox regression analysis, each factor was found to have independent predictive value.

This indicated that early metabolic events take place that are important in the fate of the cell exposed to oxidants. In this study, we described two early and independent events of H2O2-induced injury in P388D1 macrophagelike tumor cells: activation of the glutathione cycle and depletion of cellular NAD. Glutathione cycle and hexose monophosphate shunt (HMPS) were activated within seconds after the addition of H2O2. High HMPS activity maintained glutathione that was largely reduced. However, when HMPS activity was inhibited--by glucose depletion or by incubation at 4 degrees C--glutathione remained in the oxidized state. Total pyridine nucleotide levels were diminished when cells were exposed to H2O2, and the breakdown product, nicotinamide, was recovered in the extracellular medium. Intracellular NAD levels fell by 80% within 20 min of exposure of cells to H2O2. The loss of NADP(H) and stimulation of the HMPS could be prevented when the glutathione cycle was inhibited by either blocking glutathione synthesis with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) or by inhibiting glutathione reductase with (1,3-bis) 2 chlorethyl-1-nitrosourea.

On the basis of pharmacologic considerations, the title compounds have been prepared as second-generation analogues of N-(trifluoroacetyl)adriamycin 14-valerate with improved aqueous solubility; use is made of the available carboxylic acid function to solubilize the products in dilute aqueous alkaline medium. Target compounds were made by treating N-(trifluoroacetyl)-14-halodaunorubicin (bromo or iodo) with monosodium salts of dibasic acids (malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, azelaic, sebacic) in aqueous acetone.

Nontumor cells (human fibroblasts and human gingival cells) were highly resistant against the two compounds. The inhibitory potency of avarone on L5178Y cells (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.62 microM) was significantly higher than the avarol activity (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.93 microM). Modification of the molecule at the quinone ring or the double bond in the terpenoid skeleton resulted in a significant loss of activity. In vivo studies with L5178Y cells in the ascites of mice confirmed the strong antileukemic effect determined in vitro. At doses of 10 mg/kg given i.p. once daily for 5 days to mice bearing approximately 10(8) leukemia cells, avarone was found to be curative in about 70% of the mice (20% for avarol).

Glucocorticoid receptors in intact cells were affinity labeled with [3H]dexamethasone-21-mesylate and were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Receptors in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and six human leukemia cell lines had mol wt of 97,000. Malignant cells from ten of 25 patients with leukemia contained electrophoretically abnormal glucocorticoid receptors having mol wt of 55,000 in addition to normal size receptors (Mr = 97,000). The receptor abnormality was not restricted to a particular type of leukemia and was seen in cells from both newly diagnosed patients and patients who had received prior chemotherapy, including prednisone. The abnormal receptor was not generated when cells having only normal size receptors were assayed under conditions that favor proteolysis or when cytosol from cells containing the abnormal receptor form was mixed with cytosol from cells containing only normal size receptors. The mol wt of the abnormal receptors in human leukemia cells was the same as the mol wt of receptors in mutant mouse lymphoma cell lines, S49 143R and S49 55R, which have the nuclear transfer-increased phenotype of glucocorticoid resistance. This work describes for the first time a single common electrophoretic abnormality of glucocorticoid receptors in human leukemia cells.

Thirty-one patients (82%) had an indolent clinical course and were free of disease for a minimum follow-up period of 24 months. However, seven patients (18%) died within 24 months of biopsy, and six of the seven patients died of rapid progression of their tumor despite intensive treatment. Histologically, the tumors of these six short-term survivors were indistinguishable from those of the long-term survivors. RCA staining of paraffin-embedded tumor tissue of the 38 cases revealed three groups of tumors: (1) tumors with numerous (greater than 10/high-power field [HPF]) stromal macrophage-histiocytes (4 patients); (2) tumors with a moderate number (4-9/HPF) of macrophage-histiocytes (5 patients); (3) tumors with rare or no (0-3/HPF) macrophage-histiocytes, or only thin, anuclear variants (29 patients). Each of the six short-term survivors had readily demonstrable RCA-binding macrophage-histiocytes in their tumor; these were numerous in four and moderate in two. In contrast, macrophage-histiocytes were either rare or absent, or were anuclear variants, in 29 of the 31 patients who had an indolent clinical course. These observations suggest that in small lymphocytic type malignant lymphoma there is a subgroup characterized by an increased number of stromal macrophage-histiocytes and aggressive behavior of the tumor. Tumors of this subgroup can be detected by RCA staining.","['Ree, H J', 'Crowley, J P', 'Leone, L A']","['Ree HJ', 'Crowley JP', 'Leone LA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Female', 'Histiocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/complications', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Macrophages/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Plant Lectins', 'Prognosis']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19850901)56:5<1117::aid-cncr2820560527>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1985 Sep 1;56(5):1117-23. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19850901)56:5<1117::aid-cncr2820560527>3.0.co;2-t.,,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Ricinus communis agglutinin-1)']",['CA08015-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The growth of L1210 cells was inhibited to a greater extent by 5'-dInox than by Inox. The increased inhibition of L1210 cell growth by 5'-dInox was also reflected by the increased inhibition of the incorporation of precursors into RNA, DNA and proteins. Even though 5'-dInox was a more potent inhibitor, Inox accumulated in the L1210 cells to levels 4- to 5-fold greater than 5'-dInox. The metabolism of [5-3H]deoxycytidine and [5-3H]deoxyuridine by L1210 cells in culture, in the presence of Inox or 5'-dInox, indicated that dCMP deaminase was an intracellular site of action for 5'-dInox.

Incubation of macrophages harvested from the peritoneal cavities of normal mice with the compound for 48 to 72 hr rendered these cells inhibitory to the growth of tumor cells in vitro. Activation of tumor-inhibitory macrophages occurred over a range of concentrations (0.025 to 0.1 micrograms/ml) producing no direct inhibitory effects on tumor cells. Treatment of effector cells with carrageenan abrogated the effect, whereas treatment with anti-Thy-1.2 antibody and C did not, suggesting that the primary effectors were macrophages rather than T lymphocytes. These activated macrophages also manifested in vitro tumor cytolysis. In vivo studies indicated that peritoneal macrophages from mice treated with single oral doses of 100 to 400 mg/kg of the compound were also inhibitory to tumor cell growth in vitro. Effector macrophages became demonstrable in mice as early as 1 day after drug administration, reached peak activity at day 12, and disappeared by day 31, indicating a rapid onset but long-persisting effect. The tumor cytostatic activity of these macrophages was augmented by endotoxin at the dose of endotoxin that, in itself, had no effect. The addition of protease inhibitors, N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and aprotinin, to cultures markedly diminished the cytostatic effect, suggesting that the release of neutral protease(s) could account for the inhibitory effects of the macrophages. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide and arginase seemed excluded as the mechanism of action because the effect was not sensitive to treatment with catalase and exogenous arginine. The present findings indicate that CL 246,738 is an orally active immunopotentiator capable of inducing tumor-inhibitory macrophages both in vitro and in vivo.","['Wang, B S', 'Lumanglas, A L', 'Ruszala-Mallon, V M', 'Durr, F E']","['Wang BS', 'Lumanglas AL', 'Ruszala-Mallon VM', 'Durr FE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Acridines/*pharmacology', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Ascitic Fluid/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jul;135(1):679-83.,,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '81541-26-6 (3,6-bis(2-piperidinoethoxy)acridine trihydrochloride)']",,,,,,,,,,

Two beta-chain constant region genes (designated C beta 1 and C beta 2) occur in human genomic DNA, and both of these genes are capable of rearrangement in T-cell DNA. When the downstream C beta 2 gene is rearranged, deletion of the C beta 1 gene can occur.

A comprehensive battery of tests was administered to two CNS treatment groups (irradiated and nonirradiated leukemia and lymphoma patients) and a control group (solid tumor and Hodgkin disease patients receiving no CNS treatment). The CNS-irradiated group obtained lower scores than the other two groups, with significant differences in visual-motor and fine motor skills, spatial memory, and arithmetic achievement resulting in significant differences in IQ scores (VIQ, PIQ, FSIQ). The results are discussed in relation to: (1) the effects of CNS irradiation on cognitive development; (2) the specificity of these effects; and (3) the relationship of age at diagnosis to treatment effects. It is concluded that although there is a general lowering of scores after CNS irradiation, the effect is most pronounced for nonlanguage skills. Age at diagnosis was less important than the type of treatment, with CNS irradiation reducing performance regardless of when cancer was diagnosed. There were indications that children with any type of cancer diagnosed before age 5 years are more likely to have some cognitive difficulties.","['Copeland, D R', 'Fletcher, J M', 'Pfefferbaum-Levine, B', 'Jaffe, N', 'Ried, H', 'Maor, M']","['Copeland DR', 'Fletcher JM', 'Pfefferbaum-Levine B', 'Jaffe N', 'Ried H', 'Maor M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control/secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electroencephalography', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Language Tests', 'Learning', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/psychology/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/psychology/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', '*Neuropsychological Tests', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatrics. 1985 Apr;75(4):745-53.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,

L1210/MPR cells were totally resistant to 1 mM 6-mercaptopurine-9-beta-D-ribofuranoside [MPR] and 2 mM MPRP, but were inhibited by high concentrations (greater than 0.25 mM) of bis(MPR)P. These results suggested that bis(MPR)P was taken up by cells as the intact molecule since MPR and MPRP were its extracellular breakdown products. L1210/MPR cells were much more sensitive to the lipophilic bis(dibut.MPR)P derivative which had a predominantly cytotoxic action as judged by trypan blue staining and the ability of treated cells to produce macroscopic colonies in soft agar medium. However, cells killed by bis(dibut.MPR)P did not disintegrate appreciably over periods of up to 10 days. The effects of bis(dibut.MPR)P were probably the result of cellular uptake of the intact molecule. Dibut.MPRP showed minimal ability to inhibit L1210/MPR cells although this compound was a possible breakdown product of bis(dibut.MPR)P and a source of the same extracellular degradation products. The median cell size decreased in L1210/MPR cultures during exposure to both bis(MPR)P and bis(dibut.MPR)P. This effect was elicited more rapidly and at lower concentration by bis(dibut.MPR)P than by bis(MPR)P. In contrast, sodium butyrate, a breakdown product of bis(dibut.MPR)P induced increases in cell size at high concentration. Bis (dibut.MPR)P was also cytotoxic to MP-resistant CH/TG cells and was approximately 300 times more effective than bis(MRP)P and MPR which exhibited similar activity against this cell line.

Neither of these proteins was induced in the closely related human erythroleukemic cell line, HEL.

By RNA dot blot and Northern gel hybridization using a cloned human actin cDNA, we found that there was also an induction of actin mRNA.

These results are consistent with the induction of vimentin and actin gene transcription by TPA in K562 cells.","['Siebert, P D', 'Fukuda, M']","['Siebert PD', 'Fukuda M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Actins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoskeleton/analysis', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Vimentin/biosynthesis/*genetics']",1985/03/25 00:00,1985/03/25 00:01,['1985/03/25 00:00'],"['1985/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)83704-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 Mar 25;260(6):3868-74.,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vimentin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['CA 33895/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA33000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Coculture with 10(4) K562 or HL-60 cells results in 50% inhibition of normal CFU-E and BFU-E colony formation. However, when the same number of K562 and HL-60 cells is first treated for two to five days with agents that induce their differentiation, a gradual loss in their capacity to inhibit CFU-E and BFU-E colony formation is observed. The inhibitory material in K562 cells is soluble and present in conditioned medium from cultures of these cells. The degree to which leukemic cell suppression of CFU-E and BFU-E growth is reversed is correlated with the time of exposure to the inducing agent. Suppression is no longer evident after five days of prior treatment with inducers. In fact, up to a 90% stimulation of CFU-E growth is observed in cocultures with K562 cells that have been pretreated with 30 to 70 mumol/L hemin for five days. K562 cells treated with concentrations of hemin as low as 30 mumol/L demonstrate increased hemoglobin synthesis and grow normally, but no longer have an inhibitory effect on CFU-E growth. Hence, reversal of normal BM growth inhibition must be caused by the more differentiated state of the K562 cells and not by a decrease in the number of these cells with treatment. Thus, induction of differentiation in cultured leukemic cells not only alters the malignant cell phenotype but also permits improved growth of accompanying normal marrow progenitor cells. Both are desired effects of chemotherapy.","['Steinberg, H N', 'Tsiftsoglou, A S', 'Robinson, S H']","['Steinberg HN', 'Tsiftsoglou AS', 'Robinson SH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood', 'Lipoproteins/biosynthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Proteins', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83728-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Jan;65(1):100-6.,,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '77538-12-6 (colony inhibiting factor)']","['AM-17148/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Such procedures are poorly tolerated by children and by their veins. Recently it has become possible to undertake the majority of such procedures by means of permanent indwelling silastic catheters improving the quality of life of the children and their parents and increasing the scope of therapeutic intervention. In the period July '83 - August '84 we have used 46 of these catheters in 45 children with malignant disease, 12 with acute myeloid leukaemia, 12 with neuroblastoma, 7 with B cell leukaemia-lymphoma, 6 with rhabdomyosarcomas, 2 with Ewing's Sarcoma, 2 with Wilms' tumor and 1 case each of Hodgkin's disease, teratocarcinoma, osteosarcoma and juvenile chronic myeloid leukaemia. The children's ages ranged from 2 months to 14 years; 22 were male and 23 female. The catheters were inserted under general anaesthesia (duration 20-40 minutes) usually without difficulty, except for a single patient in whom no suitable vein could be found. No complications connected with the placement of the catheter were observed. Subsequent management of the catheter was initially complicated and time-consuming, but was subsequently simplified so that acceptance by parents, children and nursing staff was eventually excellent. The duration of use of 46 catheters ranges from 7 to 350+ days; 24 catheters are presently in use at 30-350+ days from insertion. Eight children died as a result of disease progression and two of sepsis with the catheter in place.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Garaventa, A', 'Rizzo, A', 'Ivani, G', 'Vallarino, R', 'Taccone, A', 'Viscoli, C', 'Perlino, G', 'De Bernardi, B']","['Garaventa A', 'Rizzo A', 'Ivani G', 'Vallarino R', 'Taccone A', 'Viscoli C', 'Perlino G', 'De Bernardi B']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Pediatr Med Chir,La Pediatria medica e chirurgica : Medical and surgical pediatrics,8100625,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology', '*Catheters, Indwelling/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Jugular Veins', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatr Med Chir. 1985 Sep-Oct;7(5):717-21.,Vantaggi di un accesso venoso permanente in bambini trattati per malattie oncologiche.

At day 12 of gestation, all 50 testable CpG sites in the individual viral genomes as well as sites in flanking host sequences were highly methylated. Some sites were unmethylated in sperm, indicating de novo methylation of unique DNA sequences during normal mouse development. At subsequent stages of development, specific CpG sites which were localized exclusively in the 5' and 3' enhancer regions of the long terminal repeat became progressively demethylated in all six proviruses. The extent of enhancer demethylation, however, was tissue specific and strongly affected by the chromosomal position of the respective proviral genome. This position-dependent demethylation of enhancer sequences was not accompanied by a similar change within the flanking host sequences, which remained virtually unchanged. Our results indicate that viral enhancer sequences, but not other sequences in the M-MuLV genome, may have an intrinsic ability to interact with cellular proteins, which can perturb the interaction of the methylase with DNA. Demethylation of enhancer sequences is not sufficient for gene expression but may be a necessary event which enables the enhancer to respond to developmental signals which ultimately lead to gene activation.","['Jahner, D', 'Jaenisch, R']","['Jahner D', 'Jaenisch R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/embryology/genetics', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/embryology/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Spermatozoa/analysis', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.5.9.2212-2220.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1985 Sep;5(9):2212-20. doi: 10.1128/mcb.5.9.2212-2220.1985.,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']","['HD-19015/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA38497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC366946,,,,,,,,

The phospholipid content showed a less significant positive correlation whilst the cholesterol ester content and the cholesterol:phospholipid molar ratio did not correlate with heat sensitivity. There were no correlations observed when the levels of these cell components were compared to heat survival at 42 degrees C. As the three lymphoid lines are small, very heat sensitive cells, the six monolayer lines were analysed separately.

To study the resistance phenomenon drug-induced tumor lines were selected and examined for the mechanism of resistance. A comparison of the biochemical expression of resistance to tiazofurin in drug-induced resistant lines of hepatoma 3924A, leukemias L1210 and P388 revealed that the 3 lines expressed similar genetic alterations related to reduced TAD content, decreased NAD pyrophosphorylase activity and increased synthesis of guanylates from salvaging preformed guanine indicating that these 3 factors play an important role in the resistance to tiazofurin. Resistance was stable in the leukemia lines and did not require drug to maintain resistance. Hepatoma 3924A resistant line reverted to sensitive state in the absence of drug selection pressure. NAD pyrophosphorylase activity was substantially deleted in the tiazofurin resistant leukemia lines, but was only significantly decreased in the hepatoma resistant line. Extensive biochemical alterations including enhanced activity of IMP dehydrogenase, increased inosinate and guanylate pools, and reduced uptake of tiazofurin were found in the hepatoma line resistant to tiazofurin. To examine the applicability of these results to naturally sensitive and spontaneously resistant tumors, murine tumors were examined. In murine tumors, TAD accumulation, ratios of enzyme activities responsible for the synthesis and degradation of TAD, and the ratios of perturbation of inosinate and guanylate pools following tiazofurin challenge demonstrated significant correlation with the sensitive or resistant nature of the tumors. To extrapolate these observations to human tumor systems, cytotoxicity of tiazofurin and its metabolic effects were compared in 6 human lung cancer cell lines derived from cancer patients with small cell lung cancer (4 lines) and lung adenocarcinoma (2 lines). Cell lines exhibiting greater sensitivity to tiazofurin accumulated significantly larger amounts of TAD and showed significant reduction of guanylate pools following tiazofurin incubation. The activity of the enzyme responsible for the formation of TAD, NAD pyrophosphorylase, did not correlate with responsiveness to tiazofurin but the enzyme which hydrolyzes TAD, TADase, correlated positively with the status of resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Jayaram, H N']",['Jayaram HN'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Guanine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(85)90070-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1985;24:67-89. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(85)90070-6.,,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Inosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '83285-83-0 (thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide)', 'EC 2.7.7.1 (Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']","['CA-05034/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-13526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

These forms had pI values of 7.4 and 8.2, respectively; both stained for protein and catalytic activity. Form 1 was a single component, comprising ca. 10% of the total protein, but multiple components of 2 were observed by narrowing the pH range in the electrophoretic procedure. Urea-denatured enzyme exhibited two bands of approximately equal intensity upon isoelectric focusing. These results were interpreted to mean that the enzyme consists of a set of conformationally different forms, arising from two primary structures. Inhibition of the native enzyme by Methotrexate was polyphasic, and appreciable activity remained when the drug was present at an equimolar concentration. Various agents (KCl, H+, urea, and SH-modifiers), known to ""activate"" dihydrofolate reductases, produced a monophasic, stoichiometric inhibition.

One may expect that new reagents detecting other leukocyte subsets will yield equally exciting information about nonmalignant diseases.

Risk estimates for individual cancers by religion were screened and those extreme but stable estimates found were reexamined in light of relative socioeconomic class, nativity, and ethnicity. Within Protestant denominations, gradients which can still best be attributed to religious preference were observed for leukemia, stomach, and cervix cancer. Roman Catholics tend to have high risks of stomach and gallbladder and a low risk of prostate cancer, whereas Eastern Orthodox women trade high risk of stomach cancer for low risk of endometrial and lung cancer. The most extreme pattern of risk, that for Jews, is comprised of lowered risk for cervical cancer and for most sites usually associated with smoking, plus consistently higher risk for lymphomas, thyroid cancer, and bladder cancer among males. Like Jews, Seventh-Day Adventists experience high risk for lymphoma and low risk for cervical and respiratory cancers. Risk to Mormons in Los Angeles differs from that of the standard Protestant population in only minor and inconsistent ways. Neither Mormons nor Adventists showed the previously reported deficits of colorectal or breast cancer. Although the method of proportional incidence may be partly responsible for our failure to confirm previous findings, nonreligious cultural or methodologic factors in the original investigations also provide plausible explanations. More generally, associations of the modest magnitude observed between cancer risk and religion in American populations should probably not be attributed to religious life-style, unless extraordinary circumstances permit the exclusion of other determinants.","['Mack, T M', 'Berkel, J', 'Bernstein, L', 'Mack, W']","['Mack TM', 'Berkel J', 'Bernstein L', 'Mack W']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,National Cancer Institute monograph,0216026,IM,"['California', '*Christianity', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Judaism', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Urban Population']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 1985 Dec;69:235-45.,,,"['CA09142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA17054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

After six months of interferon treatment all patients were evaluable. At this time both doses regimens proved to be effective in terms of their anti-leukemic activity, but differed significantly in toxicity, which was only seen in Group A patients.","['Aulitzky, W', 'Gastl, G', 'Troppmair, J', 'Tilg, H', 'Abbrederis, K', 'Nerl, C', 'Flener, R', 'Rokos, H', 'Huber, C']","['Aulitzky W', 'Gastl G', 'Troppmair J', 'Tilg H', 'Abbrederis K', 'Nerl C', 'Flener R', 'Rokos H', 'Huber C']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Austria,Acta Med Austriaca,Acta medica Austriaca,7501997,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopterin/analogs & derivatives/urine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neopterin', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Austriaca. 1985;12(5):115-21.,Ergebnisse einer Phase-II-Studie zur Behandlung von Haarzell-Leukamien mit unterschiedlichen Dosen von alpha-2-rekombinantem Interferon.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '670-65-5 (Neopterin)']",,,,,,,,,,

Although it is a powerful inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, its Ki value (0.2 microM) is considerably higher than that of ethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (0.06 microM). The compound is only poorly taken up by tumor cells, and its accumulation is not stimulated by a prior exposure of the tumor cells to difluoromethylornithine, a compound that causes polyamine depletion. Thus, the uptake characteristics of the compound are similar to those of ethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), but in striking contrast to those of methylglyoxal and glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazones). Since the configuration of the double bonds in glyoxal, methylglyoxal and propylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazones) has been shown to be identical, the different uptake characteristics are probably only due to differences in side chain size and/or hydrophobicity.","['Elo, H', 'Laine, R', 'Alhonen-Hongisto, L', 'Janne, J', 'Mutikainen, I', 'Lumme, P']","['Elo H', 'Laine R', 'Alhonen-Hongisto L', 'Janne J', 'Mutikainen I', 'Lumme P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Z Naturforsch C Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

Adherent cells separated from this preparation showed similar activity. Peritoneal cells from polypeptone-injected mice acquired appreciable cytostatic activity when incubated in vitro in the presence of glyceroglycolipid liposomes. The adherent cell fraction alone showed rather weak cytostatic activity when pretreated with the glyceroglycolipids, and full activity was restored by supplementing with the nonadherent cell fraction. The ability of glycolipids to induce tumoricidal effects was affected by cholesterol content: with increasing cholesterol content, the activities decreased. Cholesterol-free glycolipid liposomes were taken more efficiently by macrophages than cholesterol-containing liposomes. Cholesterol modifies the surface property of glyceroglycolipid liposomes.

Studies in vitro showed that the drug following covalent fixation to the polymer had only marginally decreased cytotoxicity against HeLa and P388 cells when compared with that of free anthracycline.

The drugs also inhibited the growth of KB cells in vitro, 50% effective doses of 3.5 ng/ml of ECPT and 8.6 ng/ml of CPT, indicating the stronger activity of ECPT. Pharmacokinetic studies of the drugs in mice showed that ECPT had a longer biological half-life in the terminal phase and a larger amount remained in the plasma compared with CPT. After iv administration of ECPT, the drug accumulated in the intestine, suggesting that the main route of excretion of the drug is through the biliary tract. The study on cell cycle progression by flow cytometry suggested that the main effect of both drugs on L1210 cells was the blocking of G2-M phase. These results suggest that the main reasons for the superior antitumor activity of ECPT compared with CPT are as follows: (a) ECPT had a stronger growth-inhibiting activity against tumor cells, and (b) ECPT remained in the intestinal tract for a longer time and in higher amounts when administered in vivo.","['Nagata, H', 'Kaneda, N', 'Furuta, T', 'Sawada, S', 'Yokokura, T', 'Miyasaka, T', 'Fukada, M', 'Notake, K']","['Nagata H', 'Kaneda N', 'Furuta T', 'Sawada S', 'Yokokura T', 'Miyasaka T', 'Fukada M', 'Notake K']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,IM,"['Animals', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Tissue Distribution']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1987 Apr;71(4):341-8.,,"['78287-27-1 (7-ethylcamptothecin)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,

Among the three, the best fit model was the exponential mixture model, which was 119 times more likely to assume that samples came from the exponential mixture distribution than to assume that those were from the usual Weibull distribution. This strongly suggests that refractory anemia with excess of blasts consists of subgroups with very high and very low probability to develop acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. The estimated proportion of the very low probability group was about 30%.

NCG, in intact cell suspensions and ultracentrifuged pellets, induced platelet aggregation most significantly in heparinized platelet rich plasma (PRP) containing 2.5 units/ml of heparin, but not in the presence of higher concentrations of heparin or 5 mM ethylenediamine-tetraacetate or in citrated PRP. NCG induced platelet aggregation was also inhibited by hirudin or (2R,4R)-4-methyl-1-[N2-(3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfon yl)-L- arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid (MD 805) in the same manner as that of tissue thromboplastin induced platelet aggregation. HL-60 cells did not induce platelet aggregation in our heparinized PRP assay systems; however, after treatment with neuraminidase HL-60 cells became active in aggregating platelets in either heparinized or citrated PRP. NCG demonstrated high procoagulant activity by either intact cell suspensions or ultracentrifuged pellets. The procoagulant activity of NCG was reduced in Factor VII deficient human plasma as it was in the results obtained by tissue thromboplastin. These results suggest that NCG induces platelet aggregation via thrombin generated through procoagulant activity which is shed in association with microvesicles demonstrated in the ultracentrifuged pellets. This type of platelet aggregating activity found in NCG is significantly different from that of HL-60.","['Esumi, N', 'Todo, S', 'Imashuku, S']","['Esumi N', 'Todo S', 'Imashuku S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/analysis', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Apyrase/pharmacology', 'Blood Coagulation', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Neuroblastoma/*physiopathology/ultrastructure', 'Platelet Aggregation/*drug effects', 'Thrombin/*physiology', 'Ultracentrifugation']",1987/04/15 00:00,1987/04/15 00:01,['1987/04/15 00:00'],"['1987/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Apr 15;47(8):2129-35.,,"['61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.6.1.5 (Apyrase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,

Intraspecies hybrids of the sensitive and resistant cells were made to determine whether cis-DDP resistance is a dominant or recessive trait. Hybrid cells displayed a partial degree of resistance as compared to the parental cells. To determine whether this was due to a single codominant trait or contribution from a variety of resistance mechanisms, the cells and hybrids were investigated for alterations in the accumulation of drug, as well as alterations in glutathione levels which might inactivate the drug. The cis-DDP-resistant cells demonstrated both a 50% reduction in accumulation of drug and a 1.7-fold increase in intracellular glutathione. Reducing the glutathione levels in these cells with buthionine sulfoximine did not sensitize them to cis-DDP. The hybrid cells had the same accumulation and the same levels of glutathione as the cis-DDP-sensitive cells. Parallel studies were performed with cells resistant to 1,2-diaminocyclohexaneplatinum(II) analogues. These cells also demonstrated reduced drug accumulation but no increase in glutathione. Therefore, both a decrease in accumulation and increase in glutathione may mediate resistance. Both mechanisms represent recessive traits as demonstrated in the cell hybrids. These mechanisms can only account for a small part of the resistance in these cells. A major, dominant mechanism occurs after the DNA has been platinated, but it remains to be determined whether this involves DNA repair, postreplication repair, or some other as yet unidentified process.","['Richon, V M', 'Schulte, N', 'Eastman, A']","['Richon VM', 'Schulte N', 'Eastman A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glutathione/analysis', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/metabolism']",1987/04/15 00:00,1987/04/15 00:01,['1987/04/15 00:00'],"['1987/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Apr 15;47(8):2056-61.,,"['0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '14096-51-6 (platinum ethylenediamine dichloride)', '52691-24-4 (dichloro-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum complex)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']","['CA 00906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

In colony and liquid cultures containing 10% serum, B3/25 did not inhibit growth of melanoma or ovarian carcinoma cell lines. 42/6 caused modest dose-dependent inhibition in colony cultures (maximum inhibition approximately 50%), and slowed growth of melanoma, ovarian carcinoma and epidermoid carcinoma cells in liquid culture. Inhibition was more pronounced in low (1%) serum, and was abrogated by 200 micrograms/ml iron-saturated Tf or 50 microM ferric nitriloacetate. All cells displayed high affinity Tf receptors (4-20 X 10(4)/cell). Cells grown in 1% serum and epidermoid carcinoma cells displayed more receptors, and susceptibility to 42/6 inhibition appeared related to higher receptor number. After culture with anti-Tf receptor antibodies, solid tumor cells showed a 57-93% reduction in surface Tf-binding sites. Tf uptake by cells grown for 24 h in B3/25 was approximately 50% of control, but was reduced to less than 10% of control with 42/6. Immunofluorescence staining of melanoma and HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells suggested greater heterogeneity of Tf receptor display on melanoma than on leukemia cells. Previous studies showed 42/6 completely blocked blood cell Tf internalization and is a potent inhibitor of hemopoietic cell growth. In contrast, in solid tumor cells, inhibition of Tf uptake and growth inhibition are subtotal. Solid tumor resistance to 42/6 may be due in part to greater heterogeneity of Tf receptor display by proliferating cells. However, responses to iron-saturated Tf and ferric nitriloacetate in the presence of 42/6 also differ in hemopoietic and solid tumor cells, suggesting possible differences in Tf processing or iron growth requirements.","['Taetle, R', 'Honeysett, J M']","['Taetle R', 'Honeysett JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/analysis/*immunology', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",1987/04/15 00:00,1987/04/15 00:01,['1987/04/15 00:00'],"['1987/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Apr 15;47(8):2040-4.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)']","['CA23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We determined the clinical and biological significance of this association by the retrospective study of a series of 50 patients with HCL, including nine patients with vasculitis. The development of vasculitis was not related to a variant of HCL on the basis of hematologic findings and survival. Vasculitis could occur at any time during the course of HCL, and was the circumstance for the diagnosis of HCL in three cases. Clinical and immunohistologic findings were those of hypersensitivity vasculitis in the nine patients. Infection was found to be an associated factor. Thus, eight of nine patients were infected at vasculitis onset, four died of their infection with no remittance of the cutaneous lesions, and three recovered from both infection and vasculitis. The monocyte deficiency in HCL is known to favor intracellular pathogen infection; however, we could not demonstrate that it also correlates with a decrease in the clearance of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes. Finally, vasculitis in HCL appears to be associated with a lasting infection in most cases.","['Farcet, J P', 'Weschsler, J', 'Wirquin, V', 'Divine, M', 'Reyes, F']","['Farcet JP', 'Weschsler J', 'Wirquin V', 'Divine M', 'Reyes F']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/complications', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenectomy', 'Vasculitis/*etiology/immunology']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 1987 Apr;147(4):660-4.,,['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis is still speculative but is thought to be due to bacteraemia especially from the gastrointestinal tract, due to growth of dormant spores in tissue following antecedent trauma or as an infection descending along the ilio-psoas sheath from a gastrointestinal focus. The symptoms are pain in an oedematous, discoloured, crepitant area with haemorhagic bullae and often shock. The diagnosis is based on the clinical findings and Gram-positive rods in the exudate. Treatment instituted promptly constitutes of surgical debridement, antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen.

Among all Wisconsin farmers, significantly decreased PMRs were seen for tobacco- and alcohol-related causes of death, while excesses occurred for accidental causes, asthma, and cancer of the stomach, prostate, eye, and lymphatic and hematopoietic systems. Elevated PCMR's for leukemia and all lymphopoietic cancer and cancers of the stomach, rectum, eye occurred in farmers born 1905-1958, while deficits were observed for cancer of the pancreas and the category, ""all other cancers."" Increases in PCMR's with level of various agricultural activities were largely associated with cancers of other lymphatic tissue (2/3 of which were multiple myeloma) and the rectum. Certain agricultural exposures were also positively associated with deaths due to cancers of the prostate, brain, lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma, and all lymphopoietic cancers.

The mean daily dose was 0.72 gm, and the median dose was 0.64 gm. Hydroxyurea gave adequate control of red cells, platelets, and spleen size. Cytopenia was not observed. Phlebotomy requirements were markedly reduced. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase scores were generally lowered and several blood chemistry values returned to normal. Side effects were minimal, and there were no drug-related deaths. Infections were not a problem. Hydroxyurea, a metabolic inhibitor of desoxyribonucleic acid, does not interfere with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or protein and is thus probably less leukemogenic than radioactive phosphorus and alkylating agents. Acute myelogenous leukemia was seen in one patient after five years of continuous hydroxyurea therapy. He had received no other myelosuppressant agent. Because hydroxyurea is safe and effective in the treatment of polycythemia vera, it should be considered as first-line therapy.

The apparently normal anatomic property that almost 1% of eccrine sweat glands are branched has not hitherto been appreciated. One doubly branched gland was found. Patients with leukemia (11 in the study) possibly had more branched glands than nonleukemic patients of the same body size. The best statistical relation of the number of sweat glands per unit area of skin (GUA) to surface area (SA) or age in children was the natural logarithm of GUA versus the reciprocal of surface area: LnGUA = (0.2205 X 1/SA) + 5.42. This result is consistent with the classical proposition that there is no important degree of formation of new eccrine glands, nor of loss, after birth, the density of glands per unit area of skin reducing as SA rises with growth during childhood.","['Wells, T R', 'Landing, B H', 'Sandhu, M', 'Lipsey, A I']","['Wells TR', 'Landing BH', 'Sandhu M', 'Lipsey AI']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Pathol,Pediatric pathology,8303527,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Eccrine Glands/*pathology', 'Female', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Male', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Sweat Glands/*pathology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/15513818609037720 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Pathol. 1986;6(2-3):301-7. doi: 10.3109/15513818609037720.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have suggested that the risk of leukemia in these patients increases with time after treatment. We analyzed the occurrence of second neoplasms among 192 patients with Hodgkin's disease who were followed for a median of over 15 years. We originally planned to identify prospectively the morphologic changes in bone marrow that precede the development of acute leukemia. All 63 patients consenting to bone marrow aspiration had normal marrow morphology, and no case of acute leukemia occurred more than 11 years after treatment. Actuarial analysis revealed that the peak onset of leukemia-related complications was between three and nine years after first treatment. We conclude that there appears to be a period of increased risk in patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation, after which the risk of secondary leukemia decreases. Patients surviving for more than 11 years after treatment appear to be at no increased risk of acute leukemia.","['Blayney, D W', 'Longo, D L', 'Young, R C', 'Greene, M H', 'Hubbard, S M', 'Postal, M G', 'Duffey, P L', 'DeVita, V T Jr']","['Blayney DW', 'Longo DL', 'Young RC', 'Greene MH', 'Hubbard SM', 'Postal MG', 'Duffey PL', 'DeVita VT Jr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Prednisone/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/adverse effects']",1987/03/19 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/03/19 00:00'],"['1987/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM198703193161203 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1987 Mar 19;316(12):710-4. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198703193161203.,,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'MOPP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the mutagenic and clastogenic activities of teniposide were evaluated in L5178Y/TK +/- -3.7.2C mouse lymphoma cells. Although teniposide is a weak mutagen at the hprt locus, it is a potent mutagen at the tk locus, with as little as 0.5 ng/ml producing 220 TK mutants/10(6) survivors at 96% survival (background = 100/10(6) survivors). This same dose of teniposide induced 38 aberrations per 100 metaphases (background = 7/100 cells). At 7 ng/ml, teniposide induced approximately 2700 TK mutants/10(6) survivors at approximately 10% survival. At the highest dose sampled for aberration analysis (5 ng/ml), teniposide induced 44 aberrations/100 cells. Most of the aberrations were chromosomal rather than chromatid events. As expected for a compound acting primarily by a clastogenic mechanism, most of the TK mutants were small colonies. Thus, teniposide is a potent clastogen, and it is a potent mutagen at the tk locus but not at the hprt locus. These results support the hypothesis that the location of the target gene affects the ability of the assay to detect both intragenic events and events causing functional multilocus effects. Thus, a heterozygous locus (like tk) but not a functionally hemizygous locus (like hprt) may permit the detection of mutagens that act primarily by a clastogenic mechanism. Because teniposide induces topoisomerase II-associated DNA breaks, and because there is evidence that teniposide may not interact directly with DNA, we discuss the possibility that the potent clastogenic/mutagenic activity of teniposide may be mediated by topoisomerase II.","['DeMarini, D M', 'Brock, K H', 'Doerr, C L', 'Moore, M M']","['DeMarini DM', 'Brock KH', 'Doerr CL', 'Moore MM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Animals', '*Carcinogens', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', '*Mutagens', '*Mutation', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Teniposide/*toxicity', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1218(87)90081-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(87)90081-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1987 Mar;187(3):141-9. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(87)90081-4.,,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we began a phase II trial of the combination of HU and ara-C to determine the efficacy and toxicity of this combination in treatment of patients with refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Chemotherapy began with HU 500 mg administered orally every six hours for four doses. Twelve hours following the fourth HU dose, ara-C 100 mg/m2/d was administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for three days. Concomitantly with the three-day ara-C infusion, patients again received HU 500 mg orally every four hours. Cycles of therapy were repeated every 28 days. Twenty-five patients ranging in age from 26 to 70 years were enrolled in the study. Of 21 patients evaluable for response, nine (43%) obtained complete (CR) or partial remissions (PR). Most responding patients had either large-cell or cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and all but two had a performance status of 0 to 1 at entry in the study. The median survival for all responding patients was 13 months compared with 2.5 months for nonresponders. Patients obtaining a CR had a median survival of 27.5 months, and two of the four CRs remain alive and in remission at 10+ and 30+ months from achievement of CR status. The primary toxic effect of this regimen was bone marrow suppression. The median WBC nadir was 2,200 cells/microL, and the median platelet nadir was 80,000/microL.

The application of the method for marker studies on normal marrow and marrow from patients with hematologic malignancies is exemplified.","['Kayser, W', 'Spiegel, K', 'Schmitz, N', 'Loffler, H']","['Kayser W', 'Spiegel K', 'Schmitz N', 'Loffler H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology']",1987/03/12 00:00,1987/03/12 00:01,['1987/03/12 00:00'],"['1987/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(87)90466-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(87)90466-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1987 Mar 12;97(2):245-9. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(87)90466-2.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,

Location of the mass was confirmed in 62 patients and showed six patterns: four along the hepatoduodenal ligament or within the porta hepatis; another within the liver impinging on the hepatoduodenal ligament/porta hepatis; the sixth, an intraductal mass. Of the masses along the hepatoduodenal ligament or within the porta hepatis the four patterns were well defined nodular masses caused by discrete nodes; matted masses due to confluent adenopathy; mixed, well defined and confluent masses in various locations along the hepatoduodenal ligament; infiltrating, enhancing soft tissue densities obscuring the portal vein margins.

Extra-metacentric chromosomes and double minute chromosomes were not found in cells from the normal control dogs and cells with more than 78 chromosomes were rare. Specific chromosome changes were not associated with any of the various types of leukaemia and prognosis could not be predicted from the cytogenetic findings but, in general, the prognosis was poor.

L., Benson, D.M., and Smith, L.C. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 100, 1295-1308). Cellular uptake of benzo(a)pyrene from low density lipoproteins followed first-order kinetics with a rate constant that was independent of the relative lipoprotein concentrations or cell number but which was 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the rate constant for benzo(a)pyrene desorption from low density lipoproteins. Moreover, identical rate constants for cellular uptake of benzo(a)pyrene were observed when the donor vehicle was high density lipoproteins, very low density lipoproteins, or single bilayer phosphatidylcholine vesicles, even though rate constants for benzo(a)pyrene transfer from these donor vehicles differed by 10-fold. When phosphatidylcholine vesicles containing benzo(a)pyrene and a nontransferable fluorescence quencher were mixed with cells in a stopped-flow system, two kinetic components were distinguished: a fast component with a rate constant corresponding to that measured for transfer of benzo(a)pyrene out of vesicles, followed by a much slower component, with a time course approximating that measured for cellular accumulation of benzo(a)pyrene by other techniques. Rate constants for desorption of a series of PAH which contained different number of aromatic rings from phosphatidylcholine vesicles differed over a 70-fold range. First-order rate constants for cell uptake of benzo(a)pyrene and five other PAH of different molecular sizes had the same 70-fold range of values, but were 2 orders of magnitude smaller than their respective rate constants for desorption from single bilayer vesicles. In addition, activation energies for cell uptake were essentially identical to the respective activation energies for desorption of PAH from phosphatidylcholine vesicles, confirming the mechanistic similarity of the two processes.","['Plant, A L', 'Knapp, R D', 'Smith, L C']","['Plant AL', 'Knapp RD', 'Smith LC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzo(a)pyrene/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mathematics', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Polycyclic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Water']",1987/02/25 00:00,1987/02/25 00:01,['1987/02/25 00:00'],"['1987/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)61534-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Feb 25;262(6):2514-9.,,"['0 (Polycyclic Compounds)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '3417WMA06D (Benzo(a)pyrene)']","['HL-15648/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-23741/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-26973/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,['J Biol chem 1987 Jul 15;262(20):9921'],,,,,

Of the prognostic factors evaluated, only spermatic cord involvement proved to be a significantly adverse factor. However, the true significance of cord involvement is unclear because the para-aortic regions were not irradiated in 2 of the patients in whom there was this finding, and in 1 of these there was failure in the retroperitoneum. Spermatic cord involvement was not a prognostically significant finding in patients whose para-aortic region was treated.

Seven patients relapsed (4%) and 4 died of seminoma (2%). The XRT technique described is simple to implement and is extremely effective. Of 161 patients whose para-aortic region was irradiated, none developed subdiaphragmatic nodal recurrence. Only 1 patient developed acute leukemia. No patient developed any of the recognized delayed XRT-induced complications involving small bowel, large bowel, bladder, kidney, liver or spinal cord.

RNA-RNA tissue in situ hybridization performed on sections of one of this patient's lymph nodes and on cytospins of his peripheral blood demonstrated the presence of an apparent monoclonal population of B cells producing mu and lambda immunoglobulin (Ig) messages in the lymph node and peripheral blood as well as a T-cell population in the lymph node only.

With the use of this technique, an intriguing pattern of cellular heterogeneity was observed within the mu-lambda population of cells in the lymph node. A subset of these cells appeared to express a much greater amount of immunoglobulin message and to cluster around the lymph node vessels. The combination of RNA-RNA in situ hybridization and routine histopathology has the potential for providing an additional dimension to tumor analysis.","['Seibel, N L', 'Funa, K', 'Dmitrovsky, E', 'Foss, F', 'Hollis, G F', 'Kirsch, I R']","['Seibel NL', 'Funa K', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Foss F', 'Hollis GF', 'Kirsch IR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Lymph Nodes/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(87)80186-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(87)80186-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1987 Jan;18(1):3-8. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(87)80186-7.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,

We now report that continuously growing, autonomous cell lines could be obtained from a high proportion of individually infected multilineage colonies generated in assays of spleen cells from normal adult mice if the infected cells were cocultivated for the first two to three months with irradiated NIH-3T3 cells. No lines were obtained if the 3T3 cell feeders were not initially present. Similar results were obtained when the cells exposed to virus were from multilineage colonies originating from isolated single cells obtained by replating small blast colonies. Characterization of the transformants and a number of derivative cloned sublines revealed the consistent presence of a mast cell phenotype, with some suggestion of macrophage differentiation in a few cases. All cell lines tested produced virus, showed a variable pattern of A-MuLV integration, and gave rise directly to tumors when injected subcutaneously, as shown by both Southern analysis and cytogenetic studies. The early absolute but transient dependence of these A-MuLV mast cell transformants on a fibroblast feeder suggests a multistep process in their evolution, in which the acquisition of autonomy from factors of mesenchymal cell origin may play an important role.","['Wong, P M', 'Humphries, R K', 'Chen, T R', 'Eaves, C J']","['Wong PM', 'Humphries RK', 'Chen TR', 'Eaves CJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/microbiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/etiology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells', 'Culture Media', 'Mast Cells', 'Methylcellulose', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phenotype', 'Retroviridae']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1987 Mar;15(3):280-7.,,"['0 (Culture Media)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)']",,,,,,,,,,

The retroviral vector pZIP-Neo(SV)(X) carrying the bacterial neomycin resistance (neor) gene that confers resistance to the neomycin analog G418 in mammalian cells was packaged in a Moloney envelope either as a replication-competent or replication-defective virus. Virus was introduced by infection of long-term marrow cultures at day 7. During a period of 12 weeks in culture, 10%-50% of harvested hematopoietic progenitor cells that formed differentiated CFU-GEMM colonies in response to pokeweed mitogen-containing spleen cell-conditioned medium (SCCM) and erythropoietin expressed the neor gene. In contrast, 1%-10% of hematopoietic progenitor cells that formed colonies in agar in response to WEHI-3B- or L-cell-conditioned medium expressed resistance to G418. The percentage of resistant progenitors was not detectably enhanced when replication-competent Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) was present as helper virus, even though M-MuLV infected greater than 90% of cells in the long-term marrow cultures. In a separate CFU-F assay, 12%-17% of the adherent stromal cells in LTBMCs were found to express the neor gene.

In the L5178Y mouse lymphoma radiosensitive line (LS), the dTTP pool fell 50% following irradiation, whilst the three other dNTP pools remained unaltered. On the other hand, for the radioresistant line (AII) all four dNTP pools increased by 2-to 3-fold. The dNTP pools of the Chinese hamster radiosensitive (V79) line and radioresistant (V79/79) lines were unaltered by the radiation, but a difference in pool size was present before irradiation, with the pools of the V79 cells being approximately twice those of the V79/79 cells. Two out of the three ataxia telangiectasia cell lines studied show reduced dNTP pools when compared with those of normal human fibroblasts and these pools were also unaltered by the radiation. In the L5178Y and Chinese hamster cells the levels of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of dNTPs have been determined. In general the higher the level of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase (RDR) the larger the cellular pools. The observed levels of RDR could, in part, explain the observed results. Increasing the dTTP pool by the addition of deoxythymidine and deoxycytidine to the cell culture with the V79/79 cells reduced their sensitivity to the radiation. These results indicate a relationship between a cell's sensitivity to e- irradiation and the sizes of the cellular dNTP pools.

Xenografts were established using primary explants from patients who had not received chemotherapy and serially passaged as sc tumors in nude mice. In vivo drug activities for dactinomycin, carmustine, vinblastine, melphalan, amsacrine, cisplatin, bleomycin, mitomycin, doxorubicin, and etoposide were evaluated by 4 weekly ip injections of 10% less than LD10 doses. Plots of relative tumor growth versus time were nearly log-linear. Analysis of in vivo activity was performed using percent control growth (treated/control tumor volume) and by calculation of a novel growth delay index obtained by fitting growth curves to a quadratic regression model. Both modes of data analysis identified alkylating agents (melphalan, carmustine, and mitomycin) as the most active drugs against human melanomas. Melphalan, mitomycin, and cisplatin showed the greatest activity against ovarian xenografts. However, complete tumor regressions were noted only with melphalan, mitomycin, and cisplatin against a single ovarian tumor xenograft. Correlation analysis suggested xenograft tumor growth rate was an important determinant of drug response. These results suggest that preclinical, new-drug screening with melanoma xenografts would identify drugs such as alkylating agents as active, and may not provide an advantage over murine leukemia screens. However, screening with ovarian xenografts may more closely reflect clinical drug activity. Criteria for detecting active drugs in such systems are discussed.","['Taetle, R', 'Rosen, F', 'Abramson, I', 'Venditti, J', 'Howell, S']","['Taetle R', 'Rosen F', 'Abramson I', 'Venditti J', 'Howell S']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Body Weight', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Statistics as Topic']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1987 Mar;71(3):297-304.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],"['CA-23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-37568/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Since it was unclear whether light exposure enhanced DTIC antitumor activity or local toxic effects in vivo, a series of experiments was performed in mice given DTIC solutions exposed to light for 2 hours at room temperature. Adenocarcinoma 07/A was implanted by trocar in adult female BALB/c mice. DTIC (50 and 100 mg/kg) was given ip three times per week for 2 weeks. Both drug doses significantly inhibited tumor growth. However, there was no significant difference between light-exposed and -protected drug treatments. In vitro clonogenic assays in L1210 leukemia and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells demonstrated that DTIC cytotoxicity was not increased with light exposure (0.8 J/m2/sec). Both cell lines showed a dose-response relationship to DTIC after 1- or 6-hour exposures in the presence or absence of light. Normal dehaired BALB/c mice were given single intradermal injections of 0.5, 1.75, 5.0, or 10 mg of DTIC in 0.05 ml of saline. Dose-dependent skin ulceration was produced at the 1.75-, 5.0-, and 10.0-mg dose levels. Again, there was no consistent statistical difference in skin ulceration between treatments using light-exposed and -protected DTIC vials. However, when mice were exposed to light following intradermal DTIC, increased skin toxicity was produced (P less than 0.05 by Student-Neuman-Keuls multiple range test). A number of potential local antidotes to DTIC skin ulceration were found to be ineffective. These included: L-cysteine, dimethyl sulfoxide, hyaluronidase, hydrocortisone, and 0.9% saline. Sodium thiosulfate (0.3 M) significantly reduced DTIC skin ulcers as did pre-exposure of DTIC to S-9 rat liver enzymes and NADPH. Neither mild skin heating nor cooling reduced DTIC ulcerations. DTIC appears to synergize with light in vivo to produce increased toxicity. Patients receiving DTIC should avoid intense light exposure after drug injection. However, elaborate precautions to prevent light exposure of DTIC solutions during preparation or injection appear to be unnecessary.","['Dorr, R T', 'Alberts, D S', 'Einspahr, J', 'Mason-Liddil, N', 'Soble, M']","['Dorr RT', 'Alberts DS', 'Einspahr J', 'Mason-Liddil N', 'Soble M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Animals', 'Antidotes/pharmacology', 'Dacarbazine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Light/*adverse effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Photochemistry', 'Skin Ulcer/*chemically induced', 'Solutions', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1987 Mar;71(3):267-72.,,"['0 (Antidotes)', '0 (Solutions)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)']","['CA-14612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Compound NSC 370147 inhibited competitively the binding of [3H]colchicine to purified tubulin and enhanced slightly the binding of [3H]vincristine to tubulin.

Therefore, the possible therapeutic benefit of thiol depletion in cancer treatment is dependent upon the relative degree to which tumor or normal tissue is sensitized to the toxic effects of subsequent chemotherapy. To address this issue, the following studies on the chemosensitization of melphalan (L-PAM) by the thiol-depleting agent buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) were conducted in vivo in BDF mice inoculated with L-PAM-resistant murine L1210 leukemia. Different dosing regimens of BSO were found to potentiate L-PAM toxicity in a manner that depended upon the degree of GSH depletion. Multiple i.p. injections of BSO (450 mg/kg every 6 h X 5) were found to reduce GSH concentrations in most tissues by 70-80%, and to decrease the LD50 for L-PAM from 22 to 14 mg/kg. No two organs were found to behave entirely the same with respect to the rate of depletion or recovery of GSH, or to the maximum depletion that could be obtained by BSO. In this regard, the bone marrow was found to be the most resistant tissue to thiol depletion by BSO and was found to tolerate the combination of BSO and therapeutic doses of L-PAM. However, BSO pretreatment markedly inhibited the recovery of the peripheral WBC population at the LD10 dose of L-PAM. Differences also were found in the in vivo metabolism of GSH by L-PAM-sensitive and -resistant murine L1210 leukemia cells. The intracellular concentration of GSH in the resistant cell line was 1.6-fold higher than in the sensitive tumor. Moreover, GSH levels were depleted more rapidly in the resistant tumor relative to the sensitive cell line. A single injection of BSO decreased GSH concentrations in both tumors to equivalent levels (20 nmol/10(7) cells) within 24 h. However, multiple i.p. injections of BSO failed to produce a significant increase in the life-span of L-PAM-treated animals despite a 90% reduction in tumor GSH concentrations (5.5 nmol/10(7) cells). In contrast to the median day survival data, BSO was found to enhance the antitumor activity of L-PAM as determined by an in vivo/in vitro clonogenic assay or by in vivo thymidine incorporation. Using decreased thymidine incorporation as an index of antitumor activity, BSO was found to increase the therapeutic index (LD10/ED50) of L-PAM from 3.6 to 6.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kramer, R A', 'Greene, K', 'Ahmad, S', 'Vistica, D T']","['Kramer RA', 'Greene K', 'Ahmad S', 'Vistica DT']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione/analysis', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/*pharmacology', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1987/03/15 00:00,1987/03/15 00:01,['1987/03/15 00:00'],"['1987/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Mar 15;47(6):1593-7.,,"['1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,

Two antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and sodium ascorbate, administered with equimolar doses of procarbazine decreased the spermatotoxicity of procarbazine. At the highest doses of procarbazine (400 mg/kg) that caused a 56% decrease in sperm count, equimolar doses of N-acetylcysteine coadministered with procarbazine caused only a 17% decrease in sperm count, and equimolar doses of ascorbate coadministered with procarbazine caused only a 13% decrease in sperm count. Thus, protection against the spermatotoxic effects of procarbazine was demonstrated with either antioxidant. The effect of the antioxidants on the chemotherapeutic efficacy of procarbazine against murine L1210 leukemia was also assessed. Procarbazine at the highest dose (600 mg/kg) increased mean survival time of mice inoculated i.p. with 1 X 10(5) L1210 leukemia cells by 31%. Simultaneous administration of equimolar doses of either N-acetylcysteine or ascorbate given with procarbazine caused no change in the increased mean survival time of tumor-bearing mice. These results indicate a decrease in the toxicity of procarbazine when coadministered with antioxidants, via decreased spermatotoxicity without changing anticancer efficacy.

The last six patients had the cyclophosphamide infusion lengthened to 7 days, and the cytarabine increased to 14 doses. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. Seven patients (47%) obtained a complete remission and six patients (40%) a partial remission. Median duration of all remissions has been 7.0 months with a range of 1 to 32 months. Toxicity has been limited to primarily myelosuppression with no hemorrhagic cystitis, central nervous system (CNS), hepatic, or pulmonary toxicity noted. Gastrointestinal toxicity was mild, with no effect on nutritional status noted. Median duration of complete responders was 8.5 months. Thus, Hi-COAP demonstrates promising efficacy with minimal toxicity in RAAL and warrants further exploration in multiinstitutional trials.","['Guthrie, T H Jr']",['Guthrie TH Jr'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1987/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19870401)59:7<1255::aid-cncr2820590704>3.0.co;2-s [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Apr 1;59(7):1255-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870401)59:7<1255::aid-cncr2820590704>3.0.co;2-s.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,

The most frequent cohort pattern was characterized by increases up to the generations born between 1920 and 1930, followed by stabilization or a slight decrease. This pattern was evident for total cancer mortality in men, and for several common sites, including larynx, lung, esophagus, bladder, female breast, and ovary. Only four sites (pancreas, pleura, intestines in both sexes, and kidney in men) showed cohort values still rising in more recent generations. Stable cohort and period of death curves were observed for cancers of the prostate and testis, whereas trends were steadily going down for neoplasms of the stomach, and (cervix) uteri. Finally, there were a few discontinuous trends (e.g., in the case of brain neoplasms, leukemias, and lymphomas), which probably reflect different effects of improvements in diagnosis and/or treatment. Period of death values increased for lung and other tobacco related sites (chiefly in males) and, up to the early 1970s, for a few other common sites, including intestines, and the female breast. Downward trends over the calendar period were evident for cancers of the stomach and of the (cervix) uteri. Therefore, total cancer mortality trends over the calendar period of death were moderately increasing for men, and slightly decreasing for women.","['Decarli, A', 'La Vecchia, C', 'Mezzanotte, G', 'Cislaghi, C']","['Decarli A', 'La Vecchia C', 'Mezzanotte G', 'Cislaghi C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Bone Neoplasms/mortality', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/mortality', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/mortality', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/mortality', 'Skin Neoplasms/mortality', 'Stomach Neoplasms/mortality', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/mortality', 'Time Factors', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/mortality']",1987/03/15 00:00,1987/03/15 00:01,['1987/03/15 00:00'],"['1987/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19870315)59:6<1221::aid-cncr2820590632>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Mar 15;59(6):1221-32. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870315)59:6<1221::aid-cncr2820590632>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Final diagnoses were: moderate aplastic anemia (MAA), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and hypoplastic acute leukemia (HAL). Ninety-two patients received high dose testosterone enanthate (TE) as first treatment (starting dose = 7-10 mg/week i.m. for at least three months). Median survival was significantly longer in MAA than in MDS and in HAL. Among MDS patients, those with primary acquired sideroblastic (AISA) and refractory (RA) anemia had median survival similar to those with MAA, but distinctly longer (p = 0.01) than patients with RA with an excess of blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEBtr) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). Acute leukemia (AL) developed more rarely (p less than 0.02) in MAA, AISA and RA than in RAEB, RAEBtr and CMMoL. Response to TE was seen in about two thirds of MAA and in a half of MDS and HAL patients. Among MDS patients, those with hypocellular BM developed leukemia less frequently, responded to androgens more often and survived longer than those with normocellular and, especially, with hypercellular BM. These data indicate that the cytohistological classification of refractory cytopenias identifies essentially two groups with different clinical behaviour, one (MAA, AISA and RA) having long life expectancy and a low probability of developing AL and the other (RAEB, RAEBtr, CMMoL) with a short survival and relatively frequent leukemic complication. Bone marrow hypocellularity seems to be a favourable prognostic factor in MDS. Patients with refractory cytopenias, especially those with a hypocellular BM, can be advantageously treated with androgens.","['Riccardi, A', 'Giordano, M', 'Girino, M', 'Cazzola, M', 'Montecucco, C M', 'Cassano, E', 'Danova, M', 'Ucci, G', 'Castello, A', 'Coci, A']","['Riccardi A', 'Giordano M', 'Girino M', 'Cazzola M', 'Montecucco CM', 'Cassano E', 'Danova M', 'Ucci G', 'Castello A', 'Coci A', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Aplastic/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Anemia, Refractory/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Testosterone/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Time Factors']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00320369 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1987 Mar;54(3):153-63. doi: 10.1007/BF00320369.,,"['3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '7Z6522T8N9 (testosterone enanthate)']",,,,,,,,,,

Univariate analysis identified the following characteristics associated with survival: (1) clinical characteristics: age, race, sex, performance status, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly; (2) hematologic parameters: WBC count, absolute lymphocyte and granulocyte counts, hemoglobin level, and platelet count; and (3) biochemical parameters: serum albumin, calcium, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, BUN, and creatinine. Multivariate regression analysis in a randomly selected training subset of 217 patients demonstrated that the combination of uric acid, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, external lymphadenopathy, and age had the strongest predictive relation to survival time. The resulting model was validated in the remaining independent subset of 108 patients and led to classification of patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups with five-year survival rates of 75%, 59%, and 14%, respectively, and with distinctively different annual mortality rates (P less than .01). Both the regression model and Rai staging were highly effective in identifying risk groups among the entire patient population (P less than 0.001). Overall the regression model was superior to Rai staging in defining prognostic risk groups. In addition, it was able to separate patients into significantly different risk categories within each Rai stage, thus improving on the prognostic prediction of individual patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Lee, J S', 'Dixon, D O', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Keating, M J', 'Talpaz, M']","['Lee JS', 'Dixon DO', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ', 'Talpaz M']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/classification/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Paraproteins/analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Statistics as Topic']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69841-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Mar;69(3):929-36.,,['0 (Paraproteins)'],,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-three patients received IFN alfa-2b for at least 3 months in a dose of 2 X 10(6) U/m2 subcutaneously thrice weekly. Of the 49 patients evaluable for response (at least 6 months of IFN therapy), there were ten complete responses and 29 partial responses for a total response rate of 80%. The peripheral blood counts and bone marrow continued to improve over the course of a full year of therapy. IFN was well tolerated, with no patients discontinuing therapy because of toxicity. Transient myelosuppression occurred in most patients during the first 1 to 2 months of therapy, occasionally precipitating a transfusion requirement. After IFN treatment was discontinued, there was a marked decrease in normal marrow elements and a relative increase in marrow hairy cells. This was associated with a transient increase in normal elements in the peripheral blood. Only one of 24 patients followed after receiving IFN for a median of 8.5 months (range, 3 to 16 months) has required further therapy. We conclude that low-dose IFN alfa-2b is highly effective in advanced HCL; responding patients should be treated for at least 1 year. The decision to initiate a second course of IFN therapy should be based primarily on peripheral blood counts and the clinical status of the patient rather than on the bone marrow.","['Ratain, M J', 'Golomb, H M', 'Bardawil, R G', 'Vardiman, J W', 'Westbrook, C A', 'Kaminer, L S', 'Lembersky, B C', 'Bitter, M A', 'Daly, K']","['Ratain MJ', 'Golomb HM', 'Bardawil RG', 'Vardiman JW', 'Westbrook CA', 'Kaminer LS', 'Lembersky BC', 'Bitter MA', 'Daly K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Random Allocation', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Splenectomy']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69832-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Mar;69(3):872-7.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",,,,,,,,,,

No significant differences in actuarial survival and probability of transformation to acute leukaemia were found in patients with RA, AISA or CMML. The median survival time for the RA group was 50 months, for the AISA and CMML subclasses more than 60 months. The probability of transformation for the RA, AISA and CMML subgroups showed a linear trend with a probability of 25% for the RA, 16% for the AISA and of 18% for the CMML groups after a 5 year observation period. A uniformly poor prognosis was found for the RAEB and RAEB/t subgroups with median survival times of respectively 9 and 6 months. Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 68 out of 155 patients (44%). Patients with only normal metaphases or with abnormal metaphases together with karyotypic normal cells had a longer median survival time and a lower probability for transformation as compared to those with only abnormal metaphases. The most important factor in prognosis is the number of blast cells in blood and bone marrow. Age and sex, and certain quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in the peripheral blood appear of limited prognostic value for patients with RA, AISA and CMML. The longer life expectancy of 35 patients with CMML as compared to other series seems to be related to the percentage of blast cells at the time of diagnosis.","['Kerkhofs, H', 'Hermans, J', 'Haak, H L', 'Leeksma, C H']","['Kerkhofs H', 'Hermans J', 'Haak HL', 'Leeksma CH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations/complications', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*classification/mortality', 'Prognosis']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb06138.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 Jan;65(1):73-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb06138.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases and controls were identified from the National Cancer Registry of the German Democratic Republic. Cases were women who had developed leukaemia as a second primary after an initial diagnosis, at least one year before, of an ovarian or breast tumour. Controls were patients with an ovarian tumour or breast cancer who had survived to the year when the case developed a leukaemia but who had not themselves developed a second malignancy. Controls were matched to cases by the site of the first primary and its year of diagnosis, as well as year of birth. The relative risk for acute leukaemia following treatment with cyclophosphamide alone was significantly elevated (P less than 0.05), at 14.6 for ovarian tumour patients and 2.7 for breast cancer patients. Among breast cancer patients the increased risk of leukaemia associated with chemotherapy was confined to women who had been under 50 years of age at the time of diagnosis of the breast cancer (for whom the relative risk was 13.1). No excess risk of leukaemia was observed in association with radiotherapy for either ovarian or breast cancer patients.

For neoplasms other than leukaemia or colon cancer, mortality was 28% greater than that of members of the general population of England and Wales, and this increase is likely to have been a direct consequence of the treatment. The proportional increase reached a maximum of 71% between 10.0 and 12.4 years after irradiation and then declined. There was only a 7% increase in mortality from these tumours more than 25.0 years after irradiation and only for cancer of the oesophagus was the relative risk significantly raised in this period. Neither the magnitude of the relative risk, nor its temporal pattern following treatment, were greatly influenced by the age of the patient at first treatment. For leukaemia there was a threefold increase in mortality that is also likely to have been due to the radiotherapy. The relative risk was at its highest between 2.5 and 4.9 years after the treatment and then declined, but the increase did not disappear completely, and the risk was still nearly twice that of the general population more than 25.0 years after treatment. There was some evidence that the risks of acute myeloid, acute lymphatic, and chronic myeloid leukaemia were all increased, but no evidence of any increase in chronic lymphatic leukaemia. The relative risk appeared to be greatest for acute myeloid leukaemia. For colon cancer, which is associated with spondylitis through a common association with ulcerative colitis, mortality was increased by 30%. For non-neoplastic conditions there was a 51% increase in mortality that was likely to be associated with the disease itself rather than its treatment. The increase was apparent for a wide range of diseases and was not confined to diseases that have been associated clinically with ankylosing spondylitis.","['Darby, S C', 'Doll, R', 'Gill, S K', 'Smith, P G']","['Darby SC', 'Doll R', 'Gill SK', 'Smith PG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Colonic Neoplasms/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/mortality', 'Sex Factors', 'Spondylitis, Ankylosing/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1987.35 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1987 Feb;55(2):179-90. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1987.35.,,,,PMC2002095,,,,,,,,

The technique is illustrated with reference to sections of leukaemic rat kidney, epididymis and testis.

The blast cells in refractory anemia with an excess of blasts.,281-92,"A quantitative image analysis of bone marrow blast cells from eight patients with refractory anemia with an excess of blast cells was performed using the SAMBA 200 cell image analyzer. A total of 33 parameters was computed on 665 cells visually classified as B1 blasts (agranular cells), B2 blasts (cells containing a few azurophilic granules) and B3 blasts (cells with numerous granules). The continuum of variation of some cytoplasmic parameters (area, hue and standard deviation of the luminance, hue and saturation histograms) and some nuclear parameters (area and convexity degree) from the B1 cells to the B3 cells indicated a concomitant cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation, with the B1 cells being the most immature. An attempt to automatically classify these cells using a stepwise linear discriminant analysis resulted in an average of 68% correctly classified cells at the fifth step. Among the B1 and B2 blast cells considered together, an unsupervised classification method distinguished seven subgroups of blasts, which were principally different in cytoplasmic area, cytoplasmic color and nuclear texture. The percentages of cells belonging to two of these subgroups were highly discriminatory with respect to the prognosis. These two cell types had morphologic, textural and color features that put them very near the normal immature myeloidlike progenitor cells and normal myeloblasts, as demonstrated by means of canonical analysis. All patients having a very low percentage of these two cells among their blast cells died from overt leukemia less than one year after the first diagnosis of their disease.","['Seigneurin, D', 'Brugal, G', 'Payard, D', 'Gauvain, C']","['Seigneurin D', 'Brugal G', 'Payard D', 'Gauvain C']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anal Quant Cytol Histol,Analytical and quantitative cytology and histology,8506819,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Granulocytes/classification/pathology', 'Humans', 'Neural Tube Defects/pathology', 'Prognosis']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol Histol. 1986 Dec;8(4):281-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The neonatal cancers included neuroblastoma (47%), retinoblastoma (17%), soft tissue sarcoma (12%), central nervous system tumours (9%), leukaemia (8%), and a few cases of Wilms' tumour, liver tumour, and miscellaneous tumours. The overall mortality from disease was 41%. Patients with retinoblastoma, Wilms' tumour, and neuroblastoma had the best prognosis. Forty three patients (42%) survived their neonatal cancers; all were treated with surgery or radiochemotherapy, or both, but none suffered long term major handicaps as a result of treatment.

Physicians should discuss with parents the possible risks associated with treatment before treatment is begun.","['Campbell, A N', 'Chan, H S', ""O'Brien, A"", 'Smith, C R', 'Becker, L E']","['Campbell AN', 'Chan HS', ""O'Brien A"", 'Smith CR', 'Becker LE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.62.1.19 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1987 Jan;62(1):19-23. doi: 10.1136/adc.62.1.19.,,,,PMC1778176,,,,,,,,

It has been recognized for a long time that methods capable of revealing the specific chemosensitivity of individual tumors could be useful for an individual optimization of a chemotherapeutic protocol. The Tumor Colony Forming Assay (TCFA) and the Biochemical Antimetabolic Assay (BAA) have been proposed for this purpose. Their main limitation is a consequence of the fact that the capability of in vitro growth is required from cells of a tumor grown in vivo. This is often lacking or very poor in the first in vitro passages. In this work we have investigated the possibility of using a sensitive method for evaluating DNA damage, the Alkaline Elution technique (AE). Cells treated in vivo can be easily tested directly for DNA damage. No cell proliferation in vitro is required. It is not required that the measured effect is the specific cause of cell death. A P388 Doxorubicin sensitive line and a resistant subline were tested. Correct correlations between DNA damage and chemosensitivity were obtained working both in vivo and in vitro. This test could be useful for assessing the chemosensitivity in vivo of alkylating and intercalating agents.","['Russo, P', 'Favoni, R E', 'Zarcone, D', 'Miglietta, L', 'Peluso, M', 'Nicolin, A', 'Bignone, F', 'Parodi, S']","['Russo P', 'Favoni RE', 'Zarcone D', 'Miglietta L', 'Peluso M', 'Nicolin A', 'Bignone F', 'Parodi S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1986 Nov-Dec;6(6):1297-304.,,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],,,,,,,,,,

When compared with US death rates, fewer deaths than expected were found for all causes of death, all cancers, and lung cancer. No bone cancer was observed. An excess of brain tumors was found for the cohort in general. Elevated rate ratios for all causes of death and all lymphopoietic neoplasms were found when employees with plutonium body burdens greater than or equal to 2 nCi were compared with those with body burdens less than 2 nCi, while accounting for age, calendar period, and induction time. Increased rate ratios were also found for esophageal, stomach, colon, and prostate cancers, and for lymphosarcomas and reticulum cell sarcomas. No elevated rate ratios were noted for bone and liver cancers. When employees with cumulative exposures greater than or equal to 1 rem were compared with those with exposures less than 1 rem, elevated rate ratios were found for myeloid leukemia, lymphosarcoma and reticulum cell sarcoma, liver neoplasms, and unspecified brain tumors. No overall dose-response relationships were found for plutonium or external radiation exposures. Standardized rate ratios increased, however, as plutonium body burden levels increased for all causes, all cancers, and digestive cancers at five years induction time. Standardized rate ratios also increased as external radiation exposure categories increased for all lymphopoietic cancers and unspecified brain tumors for a two-year induction period. With the exception of analyses of combined categories of death, and perhaps of lung cancer, confidence limits were wide, indicating limited precision. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that increased risks for several types of cancers cannot be ruled out at this time for individuals with plutonium body burdens of greater than or equal to 2 nCi. Plutonium-burdened individuals should continue to be studied in future years.","['Wilkinson, G S', 'Tietjen, G L', 'Wiggs, L D', 'Galke, W A', 'Acquavella, J F', 'Reyes, M', 'Voelz, G L', 'Waxweiler, R J']","['Wilkinson GS', 'Tietjen GL', 'Wiggs LD', 'Galke WA', 'Acquavella JF', 'Reyes M', 'Voelz GL', 'Waxweiler RJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,"['Air Pollutants, Radioactive/poisoning', 'Body Burden', 'Death Certificates', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Plutonium/*poisoning']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a114523 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1987 Feb;125(2):231-50. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a114523.,,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)']",,,,,,,,,,

TPA caused cells from HCL to adhere strongly and produce elongated cytoplasmic extensions. Many of these cells had an appearance resembling fibroblasts, while others showed marked surface ruffling and spreading containing increased dense bodies, and phagolysosomal vacuoles as seen by transmission electron microscopy. This HCL in vitro growth pattern after TPA exposure differed from that seen in B-CLL and NHL cells, which only adhered moderately after 72 hours and readily detached in clumps. CLL and NHL-cells did not show ultrastructural features of macrophages but had either plasmacytic or HCL features. It is suggested that these different growth patterns may aid in distinguishing HCL from other B-cell neoplasias. The expression of surface markers, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and Ig secretion were studied in some B-CLL, NHL and HCL cells after exposure to different concentrations of TPA for up to 6 days. Results showed that the documented changes were frequently both dose and time dependent and the most striking HCL-features were encountered after 6 days incubation with higher concentrations of TPA. However, individual variation from case to case was noted. Nevertheless, it seems that TPA induces neoplastic B-cells to mature into secreting plasmacytoid lymphocytes, and cells with features of HCL with variable expression of surface markers and TRAP.","['Polliack, A', 'Gurfel, D', 'Leizerowitz, R', 'Feinstein, H', 'Gazitt, Y']","['Polliack A', 'Gurfel D', 'Leizerowitz R', 'Feinstein H', 'Gazitt Y']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Scan Electron Microsc,Scanning electron microscopy,0371617,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', 'Leukocytes/cytology/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron/methods', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning/methods', 'Microvilli/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Scan Electron Microsc. 1986;(Pt 4):1523-35.,,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],,,,,,,,,,

A review and current status.,1515-21,"Past scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reports demonstrated cell surface undulations, ridges, folds, and ruffles to support the monocytic/histiocytic nature of hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) cells. On the other hand, SEM studies illustrating spikes, villi, and microvilli on the cell surfaces favored the lymphocytic nature of hairy cells (HCs). The evidence for the 'hybrid' nature of the HCs has emerged from the demonstration of concurrent display of monocytic (ruffles) and lymphocytic (microvilli) surface features on each cell. Utilizing improved methods of sampling, fixation, and drying, the current status is that all HCs display microvilli and ruffles simultaneously. However, two distinct morphological types of HCs are acknowledged: cells showing ruffled areas next to clumps of microvilli (type A), and cells displaying microvilli interspersed among ruffles (type B).

As observed by phase-contrast microscopy, treatment of HTC cells with fermented or unfermented Iscador, at a concentration corresponding to 1 mg of fresh plant per milliliter culture, led to rapid lysis of cellular membranes. At a lower concentration, 0.1 mg/ml, unfermented Iscador led to the formation of polynucleated cells. On Molt 4 cells, fermented Iscador also produced cytolysis but after a longer time of action. Unfermented Iscador showed a much stronger cytotoxic effect on these cells than on HTC cells. Fermented Iscador was slightly more potent than unfermented Iscador in inhibiting the growth of HTC cells, but on Molt 4 cells fermented Iscador was less active than unfermented Iscador. DNA synthesis, measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation in HTC and Molt 4 cells, was inhibited by fermented and unfermented Iscador with the same type of differences of action as on cell growth. Fermented Iscador contained a low amount of lectins, approximately 100 ng/ml, while unfermented Iscador contained about 10 times more. A purified mistletoe lectin produced effects on HTC and Molt 4 cells similar to those of unfermented preparations. HTC cells were 100 times less sensitive to this lectin than Molt 4 cells.

We partially purified DNA primase from acute lymphocytic leukemia cells from patients using several chromatography columns. Poly(dT) and poly(dC), but not poly(dA) or poly(dG), were good templates for ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP)-dependent DNA synthesis (i.e., DNA primase activity), and they were used in the study of the effect of natural and arabinofuranosyl nucleoside triphosphates on DNA primase activity. The Km for GTP in the poly(dC) primase assay was approximately 175 microM. All noncomplementary natural rNTPs and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) inhibited poly(dC) primase activity to a similar extent (Ki values of ATP and CTP were 610 and 517 microM, respectively). 1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate (araCTP) and 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-triphosphate (araATP) were more potent inhibitors of poly(dC) primase activity than were CTP and ATP (Ki values were approximately 125 microM). araCTP, araATP, CTP, and ATP inhibited DNA primase activity in a manner competitive with GTP. The concentration required to inhibit poly(dC) DNA primase activity by 50% was determined for a number of arabinofuranosyl nucleoside triphosphate analogs, and the relative potency of inhibition of DNA primase activity was as follows: rNTP = dNTP = 5-aza-dCTP less than ara-5-azaCTP = araTTP = araATP = araCTP less than 2-fluoro-araATP = 2'-azido-2'-deoxy araCTP less than 2'-fluoro-araTTP = 2'-fluoro-5-iodo-araCTP = 2'-fluoro-5-methyl-araCTP. In the poly(dT) primase assay ATP did not follow classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics (ATP exhibited positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 2.0). However, this assay was very sensitive to araCTP (apparent Ki of 25 microM). In summary, these experiments suggested that DNA primase is controlled by the levels of ribonucleoside triphosphates, and that the perturbation of these pools by any agent could lead to the inhibition of DNA primase and thereby inhibit DNA synthesis. Furthermore, aranucleoside triphosphate analogs directly inhibited DNA primase, and it is possible that this effect may contribute to the cytotoxicity of these compounds.","['Parker, W B', 'Cheng, Y C']","['Parker WB', 'Cheng YC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Arabinonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'DNA Polymerase II/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Primase', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'RNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1987 Feb;31(2):146-51.,,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (Nucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Primase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",['CA-27448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The most potent inhibitors were analogues that contained a 5,8-cis,cis-diene system and acted as alternate substrates for the enzyme. However, several analogues in which the 5,8-diene had been reduced were also found to inhibit the enzyme. Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase by 15-hydroxyeicosa-11,13-dienoic acid (15-HEDE) analogues was optimal in compounds that generally contained a free carboxyl group, a carboxylate side chain of nine carbons, an omega side chain of five or six carbons, a cis,trans- or trans,cis-11,13-diene or 11,13-diyne system, and a 15-hydroxyl group. Conversion of 15-HEDE to its 16-membered lactone reduced but did not eliminate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity. In contrast, a 3- to 10-fold enhancement of activity occurred when 5,15-diHETE (58) or 5-HETE (56) were cyclized to their respective delta-lactones. Molecular modeling of 15-HEDE analogues, modified in the C11-C15 region, showed that inactive analogues protrude into regions in space not occupied by active analogues. These structural studies indicate that multiple regions are important for 5-lipoxygenase inhibition by both 15-HETE and 15-HEDE analogues and that no single region plays a predominant role in inhibition.","['Haviv, F', 'Ratajczyk, J D', 'DeNet, R W', 'Martin, Y C', 'Dyer, R D', 'Carter, G W']","['Haviv F', 'Ratajczyk JD', 'DeNet RW', 'Martin YC', 'Dyer RD', 'Carter GW']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate Lipoxygenases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Basophils/enzymology', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', '*Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Rats', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00385a005 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1987 Feb;30(2):254-63. doi: 10.1021/jm00385a005.,,"['0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '73945-47-8 (15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Arachidonate Lipoxygenases)']",,,,,,,,,,

Unlike leukemia, patients with lymphomatous marrow involvement often had patchy, often discrete, areas of low signal intensity, representing focal marrow infiltration. Five of six patients in this study with lymphoma detected by histologic examination also had marrow lesions seen on MR. An additional four patients had marrow lesions detected by MR that were not detected on initial marrow biopsies; two of these had marrow involvement proven on subsequent biopsies, one had disease isolated to the vertebrae that was never pathologically documented, and one had progression of disease in the marrow documented by MR without biopsy confirmation. These results indicate that marrow involvement with lymphoma can be detected by MR imaging and that MR can complement bone marrow biopsy.","['Shields, A F', 'Porter, B A', 'Churchley, S', 'Olson, D O', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Thomas, E D']","['Shields AF', 'Porter BA', 'Churchley S', 'Olson DO', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Thomas ED']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis', '*Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.2.225 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1987 Feb;5(2):225-30. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1987.5.2.225.,,,"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Steroid concentration in plasma and CSF was measured with a radioimmunoassay following celite column chromatography. The CSF to plasma ratios of dexamethasone and prednisolone following IV bolus administration were 0.15 +/- 0.02 and 0.08 +/- 0.03, respectively. Although peak levels of the two steroids in the CSF reached equally potent levels when administered systemically in equipotent doses, the half-life of prednisolone in the CSF was shorter. In addition, there was a significant difference in the plasma protein binding of the two steroids, which may account for the differences in their CSF pharmacokinetics. Dexamethasone was 70% protein bound over a wide concentration range, while the protein binding of prednisolone was concentration dependent, ranging from 60% at 10 mumol/L to 95% at 0.5 mumol/L and below. After the initial distribution phase in plasma, CSF concentrations of dexamethasone and prednisolone approximated free plasma concentrations, indicating that penetration into the CSF was limited primarily by protein binding. At the plasma concentrations achieved following oral administration of standard doses of prednisone in children, the prednisolone (the active metabolite) is greater than 90% protein bound. The proportionally higher free plasma levels of dexamethasone result in greater penetration into the CSF. These findings may explain the lower rates of meningeal leukemia observed in children receiving dexamethasone instead of prednisone for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).","['Balis, F M', 'Lester, C M', 'Chrousos, G P', 'Heideman, R L', 'Poplack, D G']","['Balis FM', 'Lester CM', 'Chrousos GP', 'Heideman RL', 'Poplack DG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*cerebrospinal fluid/therapeutic use', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*prevention & control', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Prednisolone/*cerebrospinal fluid/therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding/drug effects']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1987.5.2.202 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1987 Feb;5(2):202-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1987.5.2.202.,,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",,,,,,,,,,

At 1 microM ara-C, the rate of net cellular accumulation was close to the membrane transport rate, and NBMPR inhibited transport and accumulation to the same extent. The rate of ara-C accumulation was half maximal at only 3-5 microM, a level much lower than that required for murine cells (67-85 microM). At concentrations below 1 microM the rate of ara-C accumulation was determined primarily by the transport rate, but at higher concentrations above 10 microM, phosphorylation capacity was the principal determinant of the net uptake rate.

The two monoclonal antibodies we obtained (YI328-18 and YI328-51, both IgG3) specifically recognized the novel branching structure and had no cross-reactivity with gangliotriaosylceramide or lactotriaosylceramide. Thus, the antibodies were found to be useful probes to detect lactogangliotetraosylceramide expressed in undifferentiated M1 leukemia cells, which disappears on induced differentiation.

Subcutaneous administration of minimal doses of recombinant interferon-alpha-2 (5-8 X 10(5) U/day), which induced maximum neopterin release in serum and urine, proved to be clinically effective: Eight of nine patients responded to this dose regimen. This response rate was comparable to that of a conventional dose schedule (3 X 10(6) U/sqm/day) which was also applied to nine patients (eight responders).

In cold competition assay, YAC-IF inhibited cytotoxicity to a lesser extent than YAC lymphoma when labeled target YAC cells were used. However, when radioactive YAC-IF cells were used as targets, cold competition attained with both YAC and YAC-IF was essentially the same. Furthermore, effector splenocytes, depleted of NK effector cells through immunoabsorption on YAC monolayer, were inactive against both YAC and YAC-IF targets. On the other hand, effector lymphocytes, absorbed on YAC-IF monolayer, retained NK activity against YAC cells but not against YAC-IF targets. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that interferon (IF) modulates negatively a subset of ""interferon-susceptible"" (IFS) NK target structure(s) (TS) of YAC cells, which would then express membrane determinants not functionally present on YAC-IF cells.

In order to test whether IFS X TS and IFR X TS are present on the same cell or clonally distributed, YAC cells were cloned and tested for NK susceptibility following IF pretreatment. The results did not support the hypothesis of a clonal distribution of both IFS X TS and IFR X TS since IF pretreatment of all clones, obtained by limiting dilution, resulted in a net impairment of target susceptibility to NK effector cells.","['Marini, S', 'Guadagni, F', 'Bonmassar, E', 'Potenza, P', 'Giuliani, A']","['Marini S', 'Guadagni F', 'Bonmassar E', 'Potenza P', 'Giuliani A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/immunology', 'Mice, Nude/immunology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(86)90330-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(86)90330-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1986 Oct 1;102(1):113-25. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(86)90330-8.,,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],,,,,,,,,,

In the present study a correlation between the protective effect of pretreatment with bismuth nitrate against cis-DDP toxicity and the preinduced MT levels in the kidney was observed. Bismuth nitrate pretreatment showed no effect on the antitumor activity of cis-DDP against several transplantable tumors, probably because it induces MT in the kidney but not in tumor tissues. The fact that p.o. preadministration of bismuth subnitrate, an antidiarrheal drug, also depressed the lethal toxicity of cis-DDP is promising for its prompt application in medical attention. Thus, bismuth pretreatment allows higher doses of cis-DDP with no apparent toxicity, resulting in more efficient utilization of this anticancer drug.","['Naganuma, A', 'Satoh, M', 'Imura, N']","['Naganuma A', 'Satoh M', 'Imura N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antacids/therapeutic use', 'Bismuth/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'Digestive System/drug effects', 'Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Metallothionein/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",1987/02/15 00:00,1987/02/15 00:01,['1987/02/15 00:00'],"['1987/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Feb 15;47(4):983-7.,,"['0 (Antacids)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'H19J064BA5 (bismuth subnitrate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",,,,,,,,,,

Two rat IgM antibodies, RI7 208 and REM 17.2, which both block transferrin receptor function, inhibited the growth of SL-2 leukemic cells in vitro at concentrations of 5-10 micrograms per ml. However, RI7 208 was more effective than REM 17.2 in prolonging survival of tumor-bearing mice. The antitumor effects of RI7 208 MAb were dependent on both the antibody dose and number of leukemic cells inoculated. The serum clearance of [75Se]methionine-labeled RI7 208 and REM 17.2 antibodies was similar and consisted of an initial rapid phase over the first 2 days followed by a slower phase. A single dose of 2 mg of antibody maintained a serum MAb concentration (greater than 10 micrograms/ml) sufficient to inhibit SL-2 leukemic cell growth in vitro for 2-3 days. The liver, kidney, and spleen were the major sites at which each of the antibodies accumulated regardless of whether trace or saturating amounts of antibody were administered. The specific activity of antibody found in s.c. SL-2 tumors was about 2-fold less than that of liver. It was shown that multiple doses of R17 208 MAb administered on a schedule aimed at maintaining a therapeutic serum level of MAb for 1-3 weeks were more effective than a single dose. Further, administration of RI7 208 MAb, in combination with the anti-Thy-1.1 MAb 19E12, was more effective than either antibody alone. SL-2 mutant cells were selected that were resistant to growth inhibitory effects of RI7 208 in vitro. The effects of RI7 208 MAb on the growth of these mutant cells in vivo suggests the major mechanism by which the MAb inhibits SL-2 tumor growth is by directly blocking receptor function. Acute toxicity associated with administration of the MAb was minimal. However, assays of myeloid and erythroid colony-forming units in bone marrow and spleen of mice given multiple doses of RI7 208 showed a depression of stem cell activity in bone marrow and elevated numbers of erythroid and cellular colony-forming units in the spleen.","['Sauvage, C A', 'Mendelsohn, J C', 'Lesley, J F', 'Trowbridge, I S']","['Sauvage CA', 'Mendelsohn JC', 'Lesley JF', 'Trowbridge IS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Transferrin/immunology/*physiology', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Feb 1;47(3):747-53.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']","['CA-25893/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Earlier finds by Avramis and Plunkett (Cancer Res., 42: 2587-2591, 1982) showed markedly less accumulation in vivo of administered F-Ara-A as cytotoxic triphosphate in gastrointestinal mucosa and bone marrow compared to P388 cells. We have pursued the basis for this difference in vitro using L1210 ascites and proliferative epithelial cells (85-95% crypt cells) isolated from mouse small intestine as representative sample populations of drug-sensitive tumor and drug-limiting normal regenerative host tissue. Using a rapid sampling technique, linear initial rates of substrate uptake were established at 25 degrees C for radiolabeled F-Ara-A and adenosine at a concentration range of 1-1000 microM. The relationship between velocity of initial transport and substrate concentration is indicative of Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics for both substrates. Competition studies between F-Ara-A and adenosine suggest a common route of entry for both substrates in crypt epithelial cells. Results from double-reciprocal analysis of the velocity versus concentration data are consistent with a simple carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion process with Km, V25max, and Ki values of 317 +/- 44 (SE) microM, 49 +/- 7 nmol/s/g dry weight, and 301 +/- 34 microM for F-Ara-A, and 264 +/- 14 microM, 44 +/- 5 nmol/s/g dry weight, and 225 +/- 44 microM for adenosine, respectively. The presence of a single low-affinity carrier in the proliferative epithelial cells contrasts sharply with the high affinity (Km, 68 +/- 14 microM; V25max, 48 +/- 4 nmol/s/g dry weight) and low-affinity (Km, 326 +/- 48 microM; V25max, 124 +/- 44 nmol/s/g dry weight) routes of entry documented for L1210 cells. This differential in transport kinetics conveys a 7- to 8-fold greater capacity to L1210 ascites compared with crypt epithelial cells for uptake of the antitumor agent F-Ara-A. At pharmacologically achievable concentrations of F-Ara-A and in view of this differential, influx of F-Ara-A would be more rate limiting to phosphorylation of F-Ara-A in epithelial cells than in L1210 cells. Metabolism studies with L1210 ascites and proliferative intestinal epithelial cells show that intracellular phosphorylation of F-Ara-A is also elevated in L1210 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Barrueco, J R', 'Jacobsen, D M', 'Chang, C H', 'Brockman, R W', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Barrueco JR', 'Jacobsen DM', 'Chang CH', 'Brockman RW', 'Sirotnak FM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Intestine, Small/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tritium', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/therapeutic use']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Feb 1;47(3):700-6.,,"['10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']","['CA 08743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We have now synthesized and evaluated a new drug in which the mustard cytotoxic group is attached to the carbon-6 position of galactose (C6-GLM). C6-GLM, administered i.p. as a single 10% lethal dose of 15.5 mg/kg, produced a 121% increase in life span (ILS) in mice bearing the ascitic P388 leukemia, compared to a 60% ILS with a 10% lethal dose of nitrogen mustard (P less than 0.01). A single p.o. dose of C6-GLM, 16 mg/kg, produced an ILS of 58%. Against i.p.-implanted B-16 melanoma, i.p. C6-GLM produced a 56% ILS compared to 30% with an equitoxic dose of nitrogen mustard (P less than 0.01). The activity of the two drugs for Ehrlich ascites was comparable, with 60% survivors with the galactose mustard. A single 10% lethal dose of C6-GLM reduced the white blood cells to 74% of control; circulating granulocytes remained at 91% of initial values. With nitrogen mustard, the nadir white blood cell count was 57% of control with an absolute granulocyte count of 70% of initial values (P less than 0.01). The toxicity of melphalan was considerably greater, with a lower and more protracted while blood cell nadir and an absolute neutrophil count nadir of 49% of control. These findings paralleled the relative decrements in bone marrow DNA synthesis produced by the three drugs. Measurement of human bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, following in vitro exposure to graded concentrations of the three mustards, confirmed the bone marrow sparing properties of C6-GLM. At the highest concentration, 1 X 10(-2) mM, the latter drug produced only a 33% reduction in colonies compared to a 75% reduction with nitrogen mustard and a virtual elimination of activity of colony-forming units with melphalan. The demonstration of antitumor activity, at least equivalent to nitrogen mustard, without the necessity of significant bone marrow toxicity supports the development of C6-GLM for clinical trials in humans.","['Schein, P S', 'Green, D', 'Dean, S W', 'McPherson, E']","['Schein PS', 'Green D', 'Dean SW', 'McPherson E']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Galactosamine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/toxicity', 'Melphalan/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Feb 1;47(3):696-9.,,"['105618-02-8 (C6-galactose mustard)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '7535-00-4 (Galactosamine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",['2-RO1-CA17583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Although interferons are in the class of biologic response modifiers, they do have some direct cytotoxic effects on human tumor cells that can be quantitated in vitro with the colony-forming assay. In the clonogenic assay, RPMI-8226 myeloma cells were tested with interferon alfa-2b (Intron A, Schering Corp., Kenilworth, NJ), melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone. With concentrations of interferon alfa-2b as low as 1 U/ml (international antiviral activity), colony number was reduced to less than 30% of the untreated control cultures. Both melphalan and cyclophosphamide showed measurable cytotoxic activity, with the ID50 of melphalan at 0.15 microgram/ml and that of cyclophosphamide at 0.4 microgram/ml. Prednisone had the least cytotoxic effect when tested with these myeloma cells as a single agent. Additive antiproliferative effects were noted with combinations of interferon alfa-2b plus cyclophosphamide and interferon alfa-2b plus prednisone. However, the interferon-melphalan combination showed synergistic effects on tumor colony cell reduction. Even greater cytotoxic activity was seen with the three-drug combination of interferon alfa-2b, melphalan, and prednisone. Clinical trials have shown that interferon alfa-2b may be effective in relapsing and refractory patients with multiple myeloma. Of 38 evaluable patients, a total of seven responded to treatment; one patient had a complete response, and six had a partial response. Three of the seven responders have continued to respond for over 33 months, with monoclonal proteins approaching undetectable levels. A pilot study of the feasibility of combining interferon alfa-2b with melphalan and prednisone in previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma has been completed. It is concluded that interferon alfa-2b, in dosages not exceeding 2.0 X 10(6) IU/m2, can be safely given in combination with melphalan and prednisone, without compromising melphalan dosage. Although response was not the primary objective of the study, an overall response of 75% was achieved using the criteria established by the Chronic Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force.","['Cooper, M R', 'Welander, C E']","['Cooper MR', 'Welander CE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiography', 'Random Allocation', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19870201)59:3+<594::aid-cncr2820591303>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Feb 1;59(3 Suppl):594-600. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870201)59:3+<594::aid-cncr2820591303>3.0.co;2-7.,,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],,,,,,,,,,

A study of its metabolic disposition in animals has shown that CNCC undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism leading to the formation of four main plasma metabolites.

Cytogenetic analysis of single colonies revealed hypotetraploid karyotypes with several marker chromosomes that were identical to those found in directly sampled bone marrow. The concurrently formed erythroid bursts showed only normal karyotypes. No leukemic colony formation was observed in other culture systems with either colony-stimulating activity (CSA) or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte-conditioned medium (PHA-LCM). The leukemic colonies exhibited a complete EPO-dose dependency similar to that of the patient's normal BFU-E. Although cytochemical and immunologic marker studies of the bone marrow cells failed to clarify the cell lineage of the leukemic cells with extraordinarily large cell size, ultrastructural study revealed erythroid differentiation such as siderosome formation in the cytoplasm and ferritin particles in the rhophecytosis invaginations. These findings indicate that the patient had poorly differentiated erythroid leukemia and that some of the clonogenic cells might respond to EPO in vitro. Corresponding to this biological feature, the leukemic cells were markedly decreased in number in response to repeated RBC transfusions, and partial remission was obtained. These observations suggest that erythroid leukemia distinct from erythroleukemia (M6) with a myeloblastic component, can develop as a minor entity of human acute leukemia.","['Tomonaga, M', 'Jinnai, I', 'Tagawa, M', 'Amenomori, T', 'Nishino, K', 'Yao, E', 'Nonaka, H', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Yoshida, Y', 'Matsuo, T']","['Tomonaga M', 'Jinnai I', 'Tagawa M', 'Amenomori T', 'Nishino K', 'Yao E', 'Nonaka H', 'Kuriyama K', 'Yoshida Y', 'Matsuo T', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68896-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Feb;69(2):546-52.,,['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],,,,,,,,,,

Effects of osmotic perturbation.,214-23,"The effects of osmotic perturbation on the dielectric behavior of cultured rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells were examined. Cells exposed to osmolalities (pi) of 145-650 mosmolal showed dielectric dispersions of the following characteristics: Permittivity increment delta epsilon(= epsilon l - epsilon h where epsilon l and epsilon h refer to the low- and high-frequency limit values) for a fixed volume concentration increased with pi; gross permittivity behavior was apparently of a typical Cole-Cole type; however, frequency dependence of conductivity was undulant and could be simulated by a superposition of two separate Cole-Cole type dispersions; separation of these subdispersions along the frequency axis was an increasing function of pi, and so was conductivity increment in the high-frequency region. As examined by light microscopy, the cells were spherical in spite of imposed anisotonic stresses and behaved as osmometers at 200-410 mosmolal. When normalized by dividing by number (not volume) concentration, delta epsilon remained relatively constant irrespective of pi. Apparent membrane capacities (Cm), analyzed by applying a single-shell model, increased systematically from a hypotonic value of approx. 1 microF/cm2 up to 5 microF/cm2 at 650 mosmolal. This increase was interpreted as due to increased cellular 'surface/volume' ratios that were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Cole-Cole's beta parameter, which culminated around 0.9 for isotonic cells and declined to approx. 0.8 for anisotonic cells, did not parallel the broadening of cell volume distribution but appeared to reflect changes in the intracellular conductivity caused by the anisotonic challenge. The results indicate that the dispersion method can probe changes in surface morphology as well as subcellular organelles' constitution of living cells.","['Irimajiri, A', 'Asami, K', 'Ichinowatari, T', 'Kinoshita, Y']","['Irimajiri A', 'Asami K', 'Ichinowatari T', 'Kinoshita Y']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/pathology/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasm/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electrophysiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', '*Osmotic Pressure', 'Rats']",1987/01/26 00:00,1987/01/26 00:01,['1987/01/26 00:00'],"['1987/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(87)90182-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(87)90182-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1987 Jan 26;896(2):214-23. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(87)90182-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dielectric behavior of cell suspensions in 0.01-500 MHz and its simulation with a single-shell model.,203-13,"Frequency dependence of relative permittivity (dielectric constant) and conductivity, or the 'dielectric dispersion', of cultured cells (RBL-1 line) in suspension was measured using a fast impedance analyzer system capable of scanning 92 frequency points over a 10 kHz-500 MHz range within 80 s. Examination of the resulting dispersion curves of an improved reliability revealed that the dispersions consisted of at least two separate components. The low-frequency component (dispersion 1) had a permittivity increment (delta epsilon) of 10(3)-10(4) and a characteristic frequency (fc) at several hundred kHz; for the high-frequency component (dispersion 2), delta epsilon was smaller by a factor of 10(2) and fc = 10-30 MHz. Increments delta epsilon for both components increased with the volume fraction of cell suspension, while fc did not change appreciably as long as the conductivity of suspending medium was fixed. By fitting a model for shelled spheres (the 'single-shell' model) to the data of dispersion 1, the dielectric capacity of the plasma membrane phase (Cm) was estimated to be approx. 1.4 microF/cm2 for the cells in an isotonic medium. However, simulation by this particular shell model failed to reproduce the entire dispersion profile leaving a sizable discrepancy between theory and experiment especially at frequencies above 1 MHz where dispersion 2 took place. This discrepancy could not be filled up even by taking into consideration either the effect of cell size distribution actually determined or that of possible heterogeneity in the intracellular conductivity. The present data strongly indicate the need for a more penetrating model that effectively accounts for the behavior of dispersion 2.","['Irimajiri, A', 'Asami, K', 'Ichinowatari, T', 'Kinoshita, Y']","['Irimajiri A', 'Asami K', 'Ichinowatari T', 'Kinoshita Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/pathology', 'Buffers', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasm/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electrophysiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Suspensions']",1987/01/26 00:00,1987/01/26 00:01,['1987/01/26 00:00'],"['1987/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(87)90181-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(87)90181-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1987 Jan 26;896(2):203-13. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(87)90181-7.,,"['0 (Buffers)', '0 (Suspensions)']",,,,,['Biochim Biophys Acta 1987 Apr 23;898(3):351'],,,,,

Accordingly, the effect of dDAVP on membrane transport of various alkylating agents and amino acids was evaluated in L5178Y lymphoblasts in vitro. dDAVP stimulated melphalan uptake but conversely inhibited uptake of nitrogen mustard, choline (the natural transport substrate for the nitrogen mustard carrier), and leucine. No effect on the uptake of cyclophosphamide or glutamine was observed. Increased melphalan uptake was due to effects on both substrate influx and efflux. The effect of dDAVP on melphalan influx was particularly complex: dDAVP stimulated melphalan influx by amino acid transport system ASC but inhibited influx by system L, resulting in a net increase in unidirectional drug influx. Melphalan efflux was inhibited by dDAVP. Decreased uptake of nitrogen mustard, choline and leucine was due, at least in part, to decreased substrate influx. However, the mechanisms of inhibition were dissimilar: inhibition of substrate influx was non-competitive for choline but competitive for leucine. In conclusion, dDAVP induced diverse but apparently specific effects on membrane transport of several alkylating agents and amino acids. Since the accumulation of alkylating agents such as melphalan within tumor cells is a major determinant of cytotoxicity, dDAVP may have a role as a biological response modifier.","['Miller, L', 'Kobrinsky, N L', 'Goldenberg, G J']","['Miller L', 'Kobrinsky NL', 'Goldenberg GJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*metabolism', 'Amino Acids/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Deamino Arginine Vasopressin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Mice']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(87)90395-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(87)90395-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1987 Jan 1;36(1):169-76. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(87)90395-9.,,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'ENR1LLB0FP (Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,,,,,,,,,

A national survey of 568 cases of childhood malignant lymphoma in Japan revealed that 505 cases (88.9%) were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and 63 cases (11.1%) were Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). The biological characteristics of NHL in Japan were a male predominance, an average age of 7.8 years, and frequent occurrence in the head and neck (38.2%). Histopathologically, only 3.2% of NHL was nodular type and 96.8% was diffuse type (lymphoblastic 28.4%, histiocytic 19.5%, medium-size cell 18.6%, Burkitt's 14.6%, and miscellaneous 15.8%.) The characteristics of the 63 cases of HL were a male predominance, an average age of 9.3 years, 73% of primary lesions in the cervical nodes, and 46.6% of mixed cellularity type. The survival rate at 7 years estimated by the Kaplan -Meier method was 41.1% for patients with NHL, and 84.9% for patients with HL. Leukemic conversion and CNS involvement occurred in 27.9% and 22.9% of patients with NHL, respectively. The current multi-institutional treatment study for NHL conducted by the Children's Cancer and Leukemia Study Group (CCLSG) has improved the prognosis of childhood NHL to an 84.6% induction rate with initial therapy and a relapse-free survival rate of 55.6% at four years.

The age of the lesions appears to correlate with the interval period between complete recovery from this disease and death. Six cases succumbed incidentally of other causes: one traffic accident, one hemophilus meningitis, one chronic myeloid leukemia, one neuroblastoma, one meningeal hemorrhage due to rupture of basilar arterial aneurysm, and one acute lymphatic leukemia. Even in these cases, definite sequelae of arteritis were detected. A surgically resected coronary aneurysm and a ventricular aneurysm were also examined. It was disclosed by mass physical check-up of school children that 0.1% had a history of Kawasaki disease, among which 5-6% showed cardiac and/or coronary abnormality including aneurysms. The high incidence of cardiac involvement in Kawasaki disease has been proved in this study and this kind of lesion has the possibility of resulting in unexpected cardiac death of children.","['Tanaka, N', 'Naoe, S', 'Masuda, H', 'Ueno, T']","['Tanaka N', 'Naoe S', 'Masuda H', 'Ueno T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Acta Pathol Jpn,Acta pathologica japonica,0372637,IM,"['Arteritis/etiology/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coronary Aneurysm/etiology/*pathology', 'Coronary Vessels/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome/*complications', 'Myocardium/pathology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1986.tb02823.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pathol Jpn. 1986 Oct;36(10):1513-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1986.tb02823.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formation of the heparin precipitate following plasma incubation in the cold in the presence of heparin is determined by FN involvement. Fibrinogen (FG) is another main component of the heparin precipitate. To determine the functional activity of plasma FN in sepsis and other pathological conditions, a study was made of the ability of FN and FG to go into the precipitate formed in blood plasma in the cold after its incubation with heparin. Unlike normal subjects in whom over 80% of FN on the average and about 20% of FG went into the heparin precipitate, in patients with hemoblastoses and aplastic anemia complicated by sepsis, less than 40% of FN on the average and about 7% of FG went into the precipitate. In some patients with sepsis, the heparin precipitate did not form. The reduction of FN ability to go into the heparin precipitate correlated with the gravity of the patients' condition. In uncomplicated hemoblastoses, cryoglobulinemia and cryofibrinogenemia and in immunocomplex pathology, the consumption of FN and FG during heparin precipitate formation did not significantly differ from the control.

By molecular cloning, deletions were made in the vicinity of the XbaI site at -150 base pairs (bp) in the U3 region, between the tandemly repeated enhancers and the TATA box. The effects of the deletions on LTR function were measured in two ways. First, deleted LTRs were fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and used in transient expression assays. Second, infectious M-MuLVs were generated by transfection of M-MuLV proviruses containing the deleted LTRs, and the relative infectivity of the mutant viruses was assessed by XC-syncytial assay. Most of the deleted LTRs examined showed relatively high promoter activity in the transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays, with values ranging from 20 to 50% of the wild-type M-MuLV LTR. Thus, the sequences between the enhancers and the TATA box were not absolutely required for transient expression. However, infectivity of viruses carrying the same deleted LTRs showed more pronounced effects. Deletion of sequences from -195 to -174 bp reduced infectivity 20- to 100-fold. Deletion of sequences within the region from -174 to -122 bp did not affect infectivity, indicating that this region is dispensable. On the other hand, deletion of sequences from -150 to -40 bp reduced infectivity from 5 to 6 logs, although the magnitude of the reduction partly may have reflected threshold envelope protein requirements for positive XC assays. The reduced infectivity did not appear to result from a failure of proviral DNA synthesis or integration by the mutant. Thus, the infectivity measurements identified three functional domains in the region between the enhancers and the TATA box.","['Hanecak, R', 'Mittal, S', 'Davis, B R', 'Fan, H']","['Hanecak R', 'Mittal S', 'Davis BR', 'Fan H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.6.12.4634-4640.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1986 Dec;6(12):4634-40. doi: 10.1128/mcb.6.12.4634-4640.1986.,,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],"['CA-32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 GM09553/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC367248,,,,,,,,

Two protein components are necessary to catalyze rDNA transcription, and these have been extensively purified. The first, factor D, can stably associate by itself with the rDNA promoter region and is responsible for template commitment. The second component, factor C, which appears to be an activated subset of polymerase I, can stably bind to the factor D-rDNA complex but not to the rDNA in the absence of factor D. A third component which had been previously identified as a rDNA transcription factor is shown to be a RNase inhibitor. Extending our earlier observation that the approximately 150-base-pair mouse rDNA promoter consists of a minimal essential region (residues approximately -35 to approximately +9) and additional upstream stimulatory domains, we now report that each of these promoter domains acts to augment the binding of the polymerase I transcription factors. A minimum core region (residues approximately -35 to approximately -15) is capable of stable complex formation and of binding transcription factor D. Factor C can also bind to this D-core region complex.","['Tower, J', 'Culotta, V C', 'Sollner-Webb, B']","['Tower J', 'Culotta VC', 'Sollner-Webb B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase I/metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.6.10.3451-3462.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1986 Oct;6(10):3451-62. doi: 10.1128/mcb.6.10.3451-3462.1986.,,"['0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase I)']",,PMC367093,,,,,,,,

At untreated stage, CFU-F number in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was lower than that in acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANL). In ANLs, CFU-F number in M1 was lower than that in M2. Adipocyte colonies were frequently developed at regenerating and relapsing stages, but rarely at untreated and remission stages. The adipocyte colony formation did not correlate with any of CFU-F number, marrow cellularity nor number of leukemic cells, but might be associated with hemopoietic regeneration. The favorable prognosis was associated with normal CFU-F number and with adipocyte colony formation at regenerating or bottom stage. As adipocytes in marrow samples were completely removed before cultures, adipocyte colony was probably originated from preadipocytes. Thus, our results suggest that adipocyte precursor cells increase in regenerating marrow and that they are essential in active hemopoiesis.","['Hirata, J', 'Katsuno, M', 'Kaneko, S', 'Umemura, T', 'Nishimura, J', 'Motomura, S', 'Ibayashi, H']","['Hirata J', 'Katsuno M', 'Kaneko S', 'Umemura T', 'Nishimura J', 'Motomura S', 'Ibayashi H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adipose Tissue/*physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Regeneration']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90011-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(12):1441-5. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90011-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of the uracil-DNA glycosylase of peripheral blood cells in 8/8 cases of myeloma and in 3/3 cases of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia was in the same range as in 22 non-hematological control patients, i.e. 2.4-25.1 U/mg of protein.

This acid was transported across the plasma membranes of cells and subsequently incorporated into their neutral lipids and phospholipids. Irradiation of these pyrene-containing cells for short periods (0.5-4 min) with ultraviolet light at 366 nm resulted in eventual cell death. Similar irradiation had no effect on cells that had not been exposed to P12. The time of the period of irradiation necessary for inducing the toxic process was related to the quantity of P12 incorporated, the latter being a function of the respective metabolic activity of the individual cell type. The degree of incorporation of P12 into a cell, and consequently its acquired sensitivity to killing by ultraviolet irradiation at 366 nm, was affected by the incubation temperature and addition of non-fluorescent fatty acid, albumin or other serum proteins. Different degrees of incorporation of P12 into various cell types were used for selective killing and elimination of cell populations by irradiation at 366 nm. The combined procedure of preincubation with P12 followed by ultraviolet irradiation thus permitted selection of cell types with a greater resistance to this procedure.","['Fibach, E', 'Morand, O', 'Gatt, S']","['Fibach E', 'Morand O', 'Gatt S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Lauric Acids/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1986 Sep;85:149-59.,,"['0 (Lauric Acids)', '69168-45-2 (12-(1-pyrene)dodecanoic acid)']",,,,,,,,,,

For each drug in each tested tumor type we derived a response rate from the pooled data of all trials reported either in the literature or to the NCI. We rated a drug active if the lower 80% confidence bound of the response rate was greater than 10%. Of the 83 drugs developed and introduced by the NCI, there are 47 which we considered evaluable. Of these drugs, 24 were rated active in at least one cancer type, of which ten were analogs of drugs in wide clinical use. Diseases most commonly responsive include lymphoma (74% of the tested drugs rated active), leukemia (35%), urothelial cancer (29%), small cell lung cancer (29%), ovarian cancer (22%), cervical cancer (22%), and breast cancer (18%). For colon cancer and melanoma, only one of 42 and two of 30 tested drugs rated active, respectively. We also examined the completeness of clinical testing: among the 47 drugs there were 20 tested in greater than or equal to 14 patients with leukemia, 23 tested in patients with lymphoma, and 18 tested in patients with small cell lung cancer; whereas 34 drugs for breast cancer, 42 for colon cancer, and 33 for non-small cell lung cancer were more completely evaluated. Considering the ""clinical panel"" of seven cancer types (breast, non-small cell lung, small cell lung, colon, melanoma, leukemia, and lymphoma), drugs were tested in greater than or equal to 30 patients in a median of four tumor types. Testing in this panel failed to detect activity in only one drug found active in another tumor, although testing in diseases other than this clinical panel was even less complete. Phase II testing should emphasize completion of minimum accrual goals, testing in patient populations with minimum prior therapy, and evaluation in a minimum set of tumor types.","['Marsoni, S', 'Hoth, D', 'Simon, R', 'Leyland-Jones, B', 'De Rosa, M', 'Wittes, R E']","['Marsoni S', 'Hoth D', 'Simon R', 'Leyland-Jones B', 'De Rosa M', 'Wittes RE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', '*Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1987 Jan;71(1):71-80.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,

Three levels of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (10, 15, and 20 mg/kg) were coadministered to mice bearing the L1210 leukemia or the B16/F10 melanoma with each of the deoxyribonucleosides (2 g/kg).

Thus, in the presence of L-histidinol, the toxicity of a proliferation-dependent drug such as 5-fluorouracil (FUra) was found to be reduced in normal tissue cells of the DBA/2J mouse, but not in L1210 leukemia cells in the same mouse. Because of the potential clinical significance of this approach to reduce chemotherapy-associated host toxicity, we evaluated the L-histidinol-FUra combination in a nonleukemic, solid murine tumor model, the BALB/c X DBA/8 F1 (hereafter called CD8F1) breast tumor. The results of these studies indicate that the administration of L-histidinol can protect the CD8F1 mouse from FUra-associated leukopenia, body weight loss, and ultimately, from mortality. However, in contrast to results reported in the L1210 leukemic system, L-histidinol also reduced the cytotoxic activity of FUra against CD8F1 breast tumors. Therefore, although the dose of FUra that could be administered with safety was higher in mice receiving L-histidinol, the therapeutic results of the combination of FUra and L-histidinol were not superior to those obtained with FUra alone at a lower dose.","['Stolfi, R L', 'Sawyer, R C', 'Martin, D S']","['Stolfi RL', 'Sawyer RC', 'Martin DS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Aspartic Acid/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Histidinol/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Imidazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jan 1;47(1):16-20.,,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '501-28-0 (Histidinol)', '78QVZ7RG8L (sparfosic acid)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",['P01-CA25842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

No comprehensive analysis of available data has so far been attempted in the literature either. Here we present an analysis of chromosome changes and their correlation with subtypes of lymphoma studied by conventional histology and cell surface markers, as observed in two sets of data: a group of 65 karyotypically abnormal tumors sequentially ascertained and studied by us during the period January 1, 1984 to April 30, 1985, and a larger data set derived by combining our data with those from two published series from the University of Minnesota that are comparable to our data. These combined data, which comprise the largest data set on the cytogenetics of lymphomas assembled so far, enabled a comprehensive analysis of correlation between chromosome change and tumor histology and the patterns of chromosome instability in these tumors. We found several significant associations, some previously described and others now recognized, between nonrandom chromosome gains, breaks, translocations, and deletions and histologic subtypes of tumors that characterize lymphomas. The data indicate that finding of chromosome breaks at certain sites (eg, 8q24, 14q32, 18q21) is of diagnostic value in dealing with cases of unusual lymphoma. Furthermore, nonrandom chromosome breakage exhibited three distinct patterns that reflected three levels of etiologically relevant genetic change.","['Koduru, P R', 'Filippa, D A', 'Richardson, M E', 'Jhanwar, S C', 'Chaganti, S R', 'Koziner, B', 'Clarkson, B D', 'Lieberman, P H', 'Chaganti, R S']","['Koduru PR', 'Filippa DA', 'Richardson ME', 'Jhanwar SC', 'Chaganti SR', 'Koziner B', 'Clarkson BD', 'Lieberman PH', 'Chaganti RS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*pathology', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76549-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jan;69(1):97-102.,,,"['AI-21181/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34775/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Tumoricidal dose curves were defined using malignant lymphoid (SK-DHL2 and Reh) and myeloid (HL-60) cells admixed with a 20-fold excess of irradiated marrow cells to simulate a borderline remission marrow. One-hour treatments yielded ID50 of less than 5 mumol/L of VP-16 for clonogenic units from each cell line; rare-to-zero clonogenic units survived exposure to 50 to 100 mumol/L. CFU-Mix, BFU-E, and CFU-GM were equal in their sensitivity to VP-16 (ID50s25 to 30 mumol/L). Marrows treated with 75 mumol/L were completely depleted of these colony-forming cells but produced CFU-GM in one-stage long-term marrow cultures (LTMCs). This dose had little adverse effect on the proliferative capacity of marrow stromal progenitors, as measured by CFU-F (ID50 271 mumol/L) and by the unperturbed development of adherent layers in LTMCs. Furthermore, these stromal layers were able to support hematopoiesis as well as controls in co-culture experiments with autologous marrow cells (two-stage LTMCs). In conclusion, doses of VP-16 that cleanse marrow of lymphoma-leukemia cells spare hematopoietic and stromal progenitors as demonstrated by LTMCs.

The compound was hydrolyzed to 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5HmUra) by the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.4) present in leukemia cells; this catabolic product was non-toxic. The catabolism of 5HmdUrd by human platelet thymidine phosphorylase could be inhibited by 6-aminothymine. The toxicity of 5HmdUrd was effectively reversed by deoxycytidine and 5HmdUrd increased the incorporation of deoxycytidine into dCTP and DNA several fold. The two latter phenomena are explicable in terms of a feedback action to ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in deoxycytidylate starvation, which is a known effect of excess thymidine.

At all concentrations of the chelator (2-50 microM) binding of 125I-transferrin was increased by 24 h and reached a maximum at 72-96 h. Maximum binding (6-8-fold increased) occurred in cells treated with 20 microM-desferrioxamine, in contrast with control cells which, at 96 h, showed a 50% decrease over initial binding. Scatchard analysis at 4 degrees C showed that this increased binding was due to an increase in the number of receptors, as the Kd was similar in induced (1.8 nM) and control (1.5 nM) cells. After 96 h cells, cultured with 20 and 50 microM-desferrioxamine accumulated 59Fe from bovine transferrin at over twice the rate found with control cells, reflecting the increase in transferrin receptors. Although iron uptake was unimpaired by the chelator there was a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth, with control cells completing three divisions in 96 h and those in 10 microM-desferrioxamine only two divisions. At the highest concentration (50 microM), cell division was abrogated although cell viability was maintained (85%). In contrast, DNA synthesis was not markedly affected, except at 50 microM-desferrioxamine when incorporation of [3H]thymidine was 52% of that in control cells. Flow cytometry revealed that there was a progressive accumulation of the cells in the active phases of their cycle (S, G2 + M). Desferrioxamine may increase transferrin receptors in two ways: by chelating a regulatory pool of iron within the cell, and by arresting cells in S phase when receptors are maximally expressed.","['Bomford, A', 'Isaac, J', 'Roberts, S', 'Edwards, A', 'Young, S', 'Williams, R']","['Bomford A', 'Isaac J', 'Roberts S', 'Edwards A', 'Young S', 'Williams R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology', 'Ferric Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",1986/05/15 00:00,1986/05/15 00:01,['1986/05/15 00:00'],"['1986/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2360243 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1986 May 15;236(1):243-9. doi: 10.1042/bj2360243.,,"['0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '4A0UG9NR9K (ferrioxamine B)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",,PMC1146812,,,,,,,,

First, a detailed comparison of the cancer mortality experience in the two studies has been carried out; this has shown a high level of agreement between them. In the second example the relation between the radiogenic risk and the baseline age-specific cancer risk in the two populations has been studied.

Sequential methods allow for repeated testing. Three sequential methods are well adapted to censored data: the group sequential analysis, the sequential probability ratio test and the triangular test. Among them, the triangular test has the best statistical properties. The influence of the frequency of the analyses on the statistical properties of sequential methods has been studied by simulation: sequential analyses need not be performed more frequently than interim analyses. Sequential methods have been applied to several randomized clinical trials. The results are briefly reported for two of them. The ability of the triangular test and of the sequential probability ratio test to reach conclusions early when there is no difference between two compared treatments is supported by these two examples. Moreover, careful patient follow-up must be planned in the protocol in order to reduce the time for data updating and to perform sequential analyses at the required frequency. It appears well-founded to propose the use of the triangular test in randomized clinical trials with a censored response criterion. Four types of analyses with different aims must be planned in the protocol.","['Benichou, J', 'Chastang, C']","['Benichou J', 'Chastang C']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,7608039,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Aspirin/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Random Allocation']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 1986;34(3):196-208.,Mise en oeuvre de methodes sequentielles dans les essais therapeutiques randomises dont le critere de jugement est censure.,['R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)'],,,,,,,,,,

Much valuable information about rearrangement processes has been inferred by comparing DNA from (monoclonal) lymphoid lines with germ-line DNA and, for B cells, from rearrangements in some Abelson murine leukaemia virus-transformed cell lines. However, because it is difficult to isolate and grow precursor populations, it has not proved possible to study rearrangements occurring in normal untransformed cells in vitro. Here we show that a single T-cell precursor colonizing an alymphoid thymus lobe in organ culture can generate multiple receptor beta-chain gene rearrangements. These observations provide unequivocal evidence for the intra-thymic diversification of the T-cell repertoire. They also offer the possibility of investigating rearrangement and its control in the clonal progeny of a single normal T-cell precursor without the perturbations involved in the use of viral transformation or the production of T-cell hybridomas.","['Williams, G T', 'Kingston, R', 'Owen, M J', 'Jenkinson, E J', 'Owen, J J']","['Williams GT', 'Kingston R', 'Owen MJ', 'Jenkinson EJ', 'Owen JJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",1986/11/06 00:00,1986/11/06 00:01,['1986/11/06 00:00'],"['1986/11/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/06 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/324063a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1986 Nov 6-12;324(6092):63-4. doi: 10.1038/324063a0.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,

Glutathione reacted avidly with DDP in normal saline with a bimolecular rate constant of 16.2 M-1 hr-1. Glutathione had no effect on the rate of hydrolysis of LPAM, consistent with the SN1-like reaction mechanism of LPAM. Glutathione protected calf thymus DNA and bovine serum albumin from DDP platination and LPAM alkylation. Glutathione also protected nuclei isolated from human ovarian carcinoma cells from DDP platination. The importance of intracellular glutathione in determining the cytotoxicity of DDP and LPAM was assessed by depletion of glutathione with buthionine sulfoximine in three cell types. Exposure to 0.5 mM buthionine sulfoximine for 20-28 hr depleted glutathione to levels that were 10-20% of control levels. COLO 316 and 2008 human ovarian carcinoma cells, and ZCR9 mouse leukemia cells were all sensitized to LPAM cytotoxicity by this level of glutathione depletion. The dose modification factors, defined as the IC50 control cells/IC50 depleted cells, were: 2.6 +/- 0.5 for COLO 316 cells, 1.6 +/- 0.1 for 2008 cells, and 2.1 +/- 1.1 for ZCR9 cells.

This is done by adding the log P parameter as a separate component to an earlier method based on structure. The two-component approach is motivated by the dual concepts of accessibility and specificity. Extensive testing shows improvement in performance for the two-component method over the use of structure alone. All the compounds with definitive biological results in the in vivo NCI prescreen form the training set. The method separates the training set into disjoint subsets depending on the range of log P. Therefore, structure fragments receive activity weights that vary with the log P range. This change in weights accounts for the improved performance rather than any difference in the structural characteristics of the compounds in the different log P ranges.","['Hodes, L']",['Hodes L'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00161a013 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1986 Nov;29(11):2207-12. doi: 10.1021/jm00161a013.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,

Chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities were also significantly higher in patients previously treated with alkylating agents, procarbazine, and nitrosoureas (72% to 83%), compared with those who had received cyclophosphamide-based regimens (29%), other chemotherapies (14%), or irradiation alone (29%). The median overall survival from diagnosis of the secondary leukemia or MDS was 30 weeks.

It is expected these diterpenes are of dietary origin although the possibility of biotransformation of a precusor by the mollusk cannot be ruled out at this time.

In preparations of hepatic DNA, isolated up to 60 min after administration of [3H]thymidine to rats subjected earlier to partial hepatectomy, the proportion of radioactivity contained in the caffeine-eluted fraction progressively decreased. This change was attributable to migration of incorporated radioactivity from replicating forms to mature (double-stranded) DNA, the latter being recovered from the column in 1.0 M sodium chloride. In terms of the same chromatograms, the relative size of the 0.3 M sodium chloride-eluted fraction also decreased, this fraction of radioactivity co-eluting from benzoylated DEAE-cellulose with thymidine triphosphate.

It also exhibited antitumor activity against M5076 fibrosarcoma, AH66 and AH66F rat hepatomas, but not against Meth-A fibrosarcoma, B16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma (LL) and C26 colon adenocarcinoma. The antitumor activity of SGL was administration-schedule dependent. The strongest activity against L1210 was obtained by ip continuous infusion for 7 days or daily ip administration for 9 days. Single ip injection of SGL at 100 mg/kg to mice caused convulsion and death within 15 minutes after injection. Such acute toxicity was not observed by continuous infusion. SGL showed its strongest activity at subtoxic dose against sensitive tumors except for L1210(IMC). Mice implanted ip with L1210(IMC) were cured by treatment with SGL at 3.13 mg/kg/day for 9 days, but died from the tumor at 50 mg/kg/day X 9. The cured mice rejected a second inoculation of up to 10(6) tumor cells. The tumor cells isolated from mice after treatment with the high dose showed resistance to SGL in vivo. Mice implanted sc with L1210(IMC) were also cured by 9 daily ip administrations of SGL at 12.5 mg/kg/day, but solid tumor was observed at the implantation site until 3 days after the final injection of SGL in some cured mice.

The neoR gene driven by the SV40 early promoter confers G418 resistance to human fibroblasts and K562 human erythro-leukemia cells transformed with these viruses. Most neoR clones contain the entire recombinant viral genome, including the inserted globin gene, integrated into their chromosomes. Normally, K562 cells express their gamma but not their beta globin genes. The transferred human beta globin gene was not expressed in either K562 cells or fibroblasts. However, the hybrid gamma-beta globin gene was expressed in all K562 clones that contained the gene whereas gamma-beta mRNA was barely detectable in the fibroblasts. This demonstrates tissue-specific expression of the adenovirus-transferred globin gene.

A probable relationship between unbalanced growth, DNA breakage and cell death.",47-55,"This study examines the relationship between unbalanced growth, DNase II activity, DNA breakage and cell survival during the exposure of L5178Y cells to hydroxyurea (HU), excess thymidine (dThR) or HU with excess of four deoxyribonucleosides (dNR). It has been found that in the cells arrested by HU or dThR, but still appearing viable with the trypan blue exclusion test, Protein/DNA imbalance and abnormal cell volume are correlated with enhancement of DNase II activity in the cells and in the medium and with moderate increase in parental DNA breakage. The incidence of DNA breaks was markedly potentiated in the presence of non-toxic concentration of caffeine (CAF), used to inhibit DNA repair. In HU+dNR arrested cells, in which unbalanced growth was abolished, enhancement of DNase II activity and of DNA breakage in the presence or absence of CAF was substantially prevented. Comparison of posttreatment cell survival in the presence or absence of CAF confirmed the differential effect of CAF: while in HU or dThR arrested cells the presence of CAF induced marked cell killing, in HU+dNR arrested cells the influence of CAF was negligible. Only a slight effect of CAF was observed in cells in which dThR-induced arrest and unbalanced growth were reversed by deoxycytidine (dCR) addition. It is suggested that the involvement of DNA nucleases in the unbalanced growth-induced overproduction of numerous hydrolytic enzymes, with their progressive leakage through the cell membranes, can lead to progressive DNA digestion. DNA breaks produced in this way are normally, at least partly, repaired. Concomitant exposure of such cells to DNA repair inhibitor can markedly enhance the level of breaks, leading to potentiation of unbalanced growth-induced cell killing.","['Sawecka, J', 'Golos, B', 'Malec, J']","['Sawecka J', 'Golos B', 'Malec J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cell Survival/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/pharmacology']",1986/10/15 00:00,1986/10/15 00:01,['1986/10/15 00:00'],"['1986/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-2797(86)90016-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-2797(86)90016-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1986 Oct 15;60(1):47-55. doi: 10.1016/0009-2797(86)90016-5.,,"['EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.22.1 (deoxyribonuclease II)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,

All complexes had good in vitro cytotoxicity and were not cross-resistant with cis-dichloro-diammineplatinum(II) (DDP) in a DDP-resistant cell line in vitro. When the complexes were administered as a single i.p. injection to C57BL/6 X DBA/2F1 (hereafter called B6D2F1) mice inoculated with L1210 leukemia cells, a significant increase in mean survival time was observed, but there were few long-term survivors. When the complexes were administered on Days 1, 5, and 9 after tumor inoculation, however, cure rates of 50 to 85% were obtained. The oncolytic activity of the IDP complexes against L1210 ascites appeared much greater than that of DDP. The IDP complexes also had good antitumor activity when administered i.p. on Days 1, 5, and 9 following i.p. inoculation of B16 melanoma to B6D2F1 mice.

In both groups, the results showed that patients with multiple chromosome abnormalities in a marrow clone had a very high probability of early death, from progression to leukemia or from other complications of hematopoietic dysfunction. Conversely, in patients with a hemic clone having only one karyotypic alteration (involving a single chromosome or single translocation), survival over 2 years was only slightly reduced as compared to those without chromosome abnormality. The only single karyotypic alteration perhaps associated with a markedly shortened survival was monosomy 7. These findings suggest that the conclusions of previous studies concerning the grave consequences of chromosome alterations in preleukemia largely reflect the clinical significance of clones with multiple cytogenetic changes. Prior knowledge of the karyotypic status of preleukemic patients should be helpful in evaluating current attempts to find effective treatment for these difficult disorders.","['Nowell, P C', 'Besa, E C', 'Stelmach, T', 'Finan, J B']","['Nowell PC', 'Besa EC', 'Stelmach T', 'Finan JB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Preleukemia/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",1986/12/15 00:00,1986/12/15 00:01,['1986/12/15 00:00'],"['1986/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19861215)58:12<2571::aid-cncr2820581202>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Dec 15;58(12):2571-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19861215)58:12<2571::aid-cncr2820581202>3.0.co;2-o.,,,['CA-12779/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The second 10 mL sample from the HC showed that FBG levels were comparable with those demonstrable in PB samples, as were levels of FDP in eight of 12 cases.

An alternative maneuver for obtaining HC blood studied in four patients showed significant prolongation of PTT values in the second 10-mL sample despite levels of FDP, FBG, and PT similar to those in the PB.

The percentage of nonwashed antibody-positive cells from healthy controls as compared with the conventional technic of cell washing shows a good correlation. However, the correlation is not as good when the lymphocytes from certain classes of diseased patients are analyzed. It appears that excessive washing in fact produces erroneous results for certain markers with cells from diseased patients. The no-wash technic is also applicable to various combinations of dual-fluorescence monoclonal antibody staining. This technic substantially reduces the processing time and, more importantly, eliminates some of the cell losses and artifacts induced during the process of cell washing.

When L-1210 murine leukemia cells were incubated with the PG at 4, 20 and 37 degrees C, the initial rate of uptake increased with temperature. However, the uptake at 37 degrees C declined rapidly after 5 min, whereas that at 4 and 20 degrees C increased linearly and reached plateau. Subcellular distribution study revealed that about 90% of the radioactivity taken up at 4 and 20 degrees C was present in the cytoplasm, whereas more than 50% of the radioactivity transported at 37 degrees C accumulated in the nuclei. When incubation temperature was shifted from 4 to 37 degrees C during incubation, significant accumulation of the radioactivity in the nuclei occurred at 37 degrees C. In contrast, when the cells were first incubated with delta 12-PGJ2, then washed and incubated without the PG at either 20 or 37 degrees C, most of the radioactivity found in the cytoplasm was effluxed to the medium during the second incubation.

Action sites of these PGs were studied by incubating them with L-1210 murine leukemia cells. L-1210 cells accumulated both PGs in a time-dependent manner at 37 degrees C. When the uptake was analyzed with various concentrations of delta 12-PGJ2, the Michaelis-Menten type of kinetics was obtained, and the Km and Vmax were 250 microM and 2.5 nmol/min/10(6) cells, suggesting that the uptake was a carrier-mediated active transport. Competition studies with [3H]delta 12-PGJ2 showed that PGA2 was transported by the same carrier with a similar affinity. PGs without growth inhibitory activity such as PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha were neither taken up by the cells nor interfered the uptake. Subcellular distribution studies with sucrose density gradient centrifugation showed that transported delta 12-PGJ2 was present mainly in cytoplasm and nuclei without metabolism. Accumulation of the PG was attenuated greatly by preincubation of the cells at 37 degrees C for 30 min. When the effect of delta 12-PGJ2 was examined in the control and attenuated cells, a clear correlation was observed between the accumulation of the PG and its growth inhibitory effect. These results suggested that uptake and intracellular accumulation of cyclopentenone PGs are responsible for their growth inhibitory activity.","['Narumiya, S', 'Fukushima, M']","['Narumiya S', 'Fukushima M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives', 'Prostaglandins A/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins D/*pharmacology', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1986 Nov;239(2):500-5.,,"['0 (Prostaglandins A)', '0 (Prostaglandins D)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', 'K6VT5BDY9E (prostaglandin A2)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",,,,,,,,,,

The factor stimulated migration of human LGL, rat alveolar macrophage (RAM), and human monocytes and neutrophils (PMN). The locomotor response was chemotactic and chemokinetic on the basis of unidirectional migration in concentration gradients. The cell producing the factor was detected exclusively in LGL-rich Percoll fraction coincident with the peak of NK lytic activity and HNK-1+ cells. The monoclonal phenotype of the cell was HNK-1+, partially OKT-11+, OKM-1-, OKT-3-, OKT-4-, and OKT-8-. The factor was released by LGL within 20 min of incubation with Sr++, a cation that is able to induce LGL degranulation. A powerful chemoattractant was also detected in the granules of the rat LGL leukemia, RNK. Chemotactic activity coincided with granule enzyme beta-glucuronidase and cytolysin after RNK nitrogen cavitation and Percoll fractionation of subcellular constituents. The RNK granule chemoattractant induced unidirectional migration of human LGL and was also active against rat alveolar macrophages and human PMN. Anti-RNK granule antibody conjugated to Sepharose 4B was able to deplete the chemotactic activity from both K562-induced LGL supernatants and solubilized RNK granules.

Addition of dichloroallyl lawsone (25 microM) results in a rapid depletion of uridine and cytidine nucleotides; carbamyl aspartate and dihydroorotate accumulate to high levels in an equilibrium ratio of 20.5:1, and orotate, orotidine, and UMP increase transiently before decreasing to levels approaching their original steady states. The predominant inhibitory effects of acivicin are upon the reactions UTP----CTP and XMP----GMP, but there is also an initial transient activation of both the pyrimidine and purine pathways by acivicin. The data obtained with dichloroallyl lawsone are consistent with inhibition of the conversion of UMP----UDP initially followed by potent inhibition of dihydroorotate----orotate.","['Kemp, A J', 'Lyons, S D', 'Christopherson, R I']","['Kemp AJ', 'Lyons SD', 'Christopherson RI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Bicarbonates/metabolism', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cytidine Triphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Isoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Oxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*biosynthesis', 'Uracil Nucleotides/biosynthesis']",1986/11/15 00:00,1986/11/15 00:01,['1986/11/15 00:00'],"['1986/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)66800-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Nov 15;261(32):14891-5.,,"['0 (Bicarbonates)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Uracil Nucleotides)', '36417-16-0 (dichloroallyl lawsone)', '65-47-4 (Cytidine Triphosphate)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'O0X60K76I6 (acivicin)']",,,,,,,,,,

The proton-sodium exchanging ionophore, monensin, is found to cause noncytolytic dose dependent serotonin release from the rat leukemic basophils (line RBL-2H3). Its half maximal dose of ca. 2 microM leads to secretion of ca. 20% of these cells' serotonin content. Monensin induced serotonin secretion increases with external pH and decreases upon lowering external sodium ion concentrations, yet is independent on external calcium. Monitoring cytosolic pH and free Ca2+ concentrations with BCECF and quin2, respectively, shows that a rise in pHi and [Ca2+]i is caused by the ionophore. Amiloride, the blocker of cellular Na+/H+ antiporter, is found to be an effective inhibitor of antigen or monensin induced serotonin release. However, it does not by itself cause secretion. In contrast, ouabain, which inhibits the cellular Na+/K+ ATPase, does induce secretion. Cellular levels of pH, Na+ and Ca2+ ions are evidently linked and involve a manifold of activities. Though exchanging protons for sodium seems to be effective in causing mediator release, the present results do not provide sufficient support for proton/sodium ions having a second messenger role in the immunologically induced mediator release.","['Sussman, Y', 'Reck, B', 'Pecht, I']","['Sussman Y', 'Reck B', 'Pecht I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,IM,"['Amiloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Basophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Sodium/*metabolism']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2478(86)90058-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(86)90058-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1986 Oct;13(4):215-9. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(86)90058-1.,,"['333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,

A significant correlation was found between the number of lymphocytes/hairy cell and the level of endotoxin-induced PCA suggesting that lymphocytes potentiate the procoagulant response of hairy cells. When stimulated with 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), patients' cells produced about 2-8 times more PCA than endotoxin-stimulated cells.

The systems include cysteine disulfides and pyridoxal, cystamine and diamine oxidase, beta-mercaptoalcohol disulfides and an alcohol dehydrogenase, and sulfide-treated proteins and a thiol. Persulfide sulfur is very unstable at pH near 7 and an essential feature of the growth-supporting systems is the ability to generate persulfide sulfur at a very low rate for long periods of time. Methyl disulfides (R--S--S--CH3) also support growth of L1210 cells and are more stable than persulfides (R--S--S--H). The requirement for these sulfur groups by L1210 cells may be related to the fact that these cells are defective in at least two enzymes of sulfur metabolism, cystathionase and 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase.

The products were compared with the corresponding D,L-homocysteic acid derivatives as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and folylpolyglutamate synthetase, and as inhibitors of cell growth in culture. The gamma-phosphonates were somewhat less active than either the gamma-sulfonates or the parent drugs as inhibitors of murine dihydrofolate reductase. The MTX gamma-sulfonate and gamma-phosphonate analogues were equally inhibitory toward mouse liver folylpolyglutamate synthetase (Ki = 190 microM), but in the AMT series the gamma-phosphonate (Ki = 8.4 microM) was more potent than the gamma-sulfonate (Ki = 45 microM). The AMT analogues were consistently more inhibitory than the MTX analogues against cultured L1210 murine leukemia cells, but neither the gamma-phosphonates nor the gamma-sulfonates were as potent as their respective parent drugs. The gamma-phosphonate analogue of MTX was three times more potent than MTX against the MTX-resistant mutant line L1210/R81, but the AMT gamma-phosphonate was less potent than AMT; however, these differences were small in comparison with the level of resistance to all these compounds in the L1210/R81 line.

A unique pattern of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.,220-4,"At present, the majority of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia can expect a favorable outcome. However, leukemia in infants (0-1 year) still runs a dismal course. The first year of life also has a unique pattern of hematopoietic activity. We investigated possible association between these two findings. We examined the characteristics of 51 infants with leukemia, diagnosed from 1975 to 1984; 48/51 had evaluable data. Infants had a high frequency (39.6%) of hyperleukocytosis (greater than 100 X 10(9)/liter), early central nervous system involvement (27.1%), and cutaneous infiltration (18.8%). The respective numbers in patients greater than or equal to 1 year were 13.9, 4.8, and 1.0%. Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia was diagnosed in 18/48 infants (37.5%) compared to 128/892 (14.3%) in older patients. Infants had only acute leukemia of French-American-British (FAB) class M5 (10/19) or acute leukemia with unclassifiable but monocytoid blasts (8/19). This study confirms the presence of poor prognostic features in infant leukemia. The almost exclusive occurrence of monoblastic or monocytoid acute leukemia parallels the high proliferation rate of monocytes in this age group and the leukemic cells may thus well reflect frozen stages of monocytic differentiation.","['van Wering, E R', 'Kamps, W A']","['van Wering ER', 'Kamps WA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Central Nervous System/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hepatomegaly', 'Humans', '*Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/blood/classification/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Skin/pathology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-198623000-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1986 Fall;8(3):220-4. doi: 10.1097/00043426-198623000-00008.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, HuIFN alpha 2 induced an increased activity of 2-5A synthetase in leukemic and in control cells indicating cellular responsiveness to IFN. HuIFN alpha 2 also produced a dose-responsive decline in marrow leukemia blast progenitor colony growth, and in normal hematopoietic colony formation in vitro, confirming its antiproliferative effect. A course of intravenous therapy given to a lymphoma patient produced a modest decline in peripheral white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts; higher, more frequent doses in a second patient induced a profound drop in WBC's, neutrophils, and platelets. When the leukemia patients were given an intravenous course of HuIFN alpha 2 as a sole agent, blast cytoreduction was seen in peripheral blood in three patients, and in marrow of one patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Elevated 2-5A synthetase levels could be detected after therapy. No modulation of leukemic cell markers was seen after in vitro or in vivo treatment with HuIFN alpha 2, implying that the cytoreduction was not linked to blast cell differentiation. These studies suggest that this subtype of recombinant DNA-derived IFN has antileukemic properties, and indicates the possibilities for IFN as an adjunctive form of therapy in leukemia.","['Freedman, M H', 'Estrov, Z', 'Williams, B R', 'Gelfand, E W']","['Freedman MH', 'Estrov Z', 'Williams BR', 'Gelfand EW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/metabolism"", 'Acute Disease', 'Blood Cells/enzymology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/enzymology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-198623000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1986 Fall;8(3):178-82. doi: 10.1097/00043426-198623000-00002.,,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",,,,,,,,,,

Similar, but less severe, histologic lesions were observed in corresponding areas of the central nervous system from wt-infected mice.

It had been shown by Schultz and Oroszlan (1983), that murine leukemia virus (MuLV) Pr65gag, the polyprotein precursor to the virion core proteins contains the fatty acid myristate at its NH2 terminus. We showed that when 20 micrograms/ml of cerulenin is added for 3 h to mouse fibroblasts chronically infected with Moloney (M)-MuLV it causes a greater than 4-fold decrease in virus production. This is accompanied by an accumulation of uncleaved Pr65gag in the infected cells. Further, thin-section electron micrographs of cerulenin-treated cells show a 2-fold increase in the number of nascent-budding forms, as well as the appearance of aberrant viral forms at the cell membrane. This suggests that the failure to add myristic acid to Pr65gag prevents their proper assembly into viral particles.","['Katoh, I', 'Yoshinaka, Y', 'Luftig, R B']","['Katoh I', 'Yoshinaka Y', 'Luftig RB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,"['Animals', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cerulenin/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Morphogenesis/drug effects', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Sterols/biosynthesis', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0168-1702(86)90023-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0168-1702(86)90023-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 1986 Aug;5(2-3):265-76. doi: 10.1016/0168-1702(86)90023-7.,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Sterols)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '17397-89-6 (Cerulenin)']",,,,,,,,,,

The two most common cancers in China, stomach and esophagus, were found to have no significant correlation with some selected physical variables and population density, suggesting the need to examine other socio-economic variables such as dietary habit. The study also suggests that the type of diet which may be responsible for these two cancers could be very different from each others.

In the clonogenic assay, RPMI-8226 myeloma cells were tested with recombinant interferon alfa-2b (Intron A), melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone. Prednisone used as a single agent had the least cytotoxic effect. Concentrations of alfa-2b as low as 1 unit/mL (international antiviral activity) showed a reduction in colony number of less than 30% of the untreated controlled cultures. Melphalan and cyclophosphamide showed measurable cytotoxic activity, expressed in terms of 50% inhibition of colony growth, at doses of 0.15 microgram/mL and 0.4 microgram/mL, respectively. Additive antiproliferative effects were noted with combinations of alfa-2b plus cyclophosphamide and alfa-2b plus prednisone. However, the alfa-2b-melphalan combination had a synergistic effect on tumor-cell colony reduction. Even greater cytotoxic activity was seen with the three-drug combination of alfa-2b, melphalan, and prednisone. Clinical trials have shown that alfa-2b may be effective in patients with relapsing and refractory multiple myeloma. Of 38 patients evaluated, seven responded to treatment. Three of the seven responders have continued to respond for over 33 months, with monoclonal proteins approaching undetectable levels. A pilot study of the feasibility of combining alfa-2b with melphalan and prednisone in previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma has been completed. Although response was not the primary objective of this study, an overall response rate of 78% was achieved using criteria established by the Chronic Leukemia Task Force. Phase II trials conducted thus far have established tumor responsiveness to interferons in human myeloma. To clearly define the role of these agents in the treatment of myeloma, well-planned multicenter studies are needed.","['Cooper, M R']",['Cooper MR'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(86)90052-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1986 Sep;13(3 Suppl 2):13-20.,,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,,,,,,,,,

The presence of these cell nests, previously described as ""abnormal localized immature precursors"" or ALIP, bears a strong prognostic value predisposing patients to early death with an increased risk to develop myeloid leukaemia. In order to describe and delineate this histological characteristic more precisely, we compared bone biopsies of patients with MDS, used in these previous studies, with bone marrow biopsies performed for staging procedures in patients with Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and carcinoma. From this comparison we conclude that immature precursors are readily differentiated from proerythroblasts, myeloblasts and small-sized megakaryocytes, and that they most probably represent precursors of the myelo-monocytic-erythroid series. A clearcut increase in their number, mostly resulting in the formation of small clusters, is only found in biopsies from patients with MDS.","['De Wolf-Peeters, C', 'Stessens, R', 'Desmet, V', 'Tricot, G', 'Verwilghen, R L']","['De Wolf-Peeters C', 'Stessens R', 'Desmet V', 'Tricot G', 'Verwilghen RL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cells/*pathology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(86)80075-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(86)80075-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1986 Aug;181(4):402-7. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(86)80075-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two cases of lacrimal obstruction secondary to sarcoidosis and leukemia were discovered in biopsies of patients with the clinical syndrome of PANDO, demonstrating the value of routine biopsy during DCR. Biopsies revealed a spectrum of changes that correlated with duration of symptoms. Early cases revealed active chronic inflammation along the entire length of the narrowed nasolacrimal duct. Intermediate cases revealed focal resolution of the inflammatory process with fibrosis, while late cases showed fibrous obliteration of the entire duct.

Stage-specific glycosaminoglycan changes have previously been associated with the differentiation process, including a dramatic reduction in cellular chondroitin 4-sulfate during human myeloid leukemia cell maturation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We have demonstrated that treatment of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells with 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-D-xyloside increases precursor incorporation into glycosaminoglycans linked to beta-D-xyloside, rather than core protein, eliminating the need for core protein and xylosyltransferase. Therefore, these beta-D-xyloside-treated cells were used to study the decreased glycosaminoglycan production during TPA-induced HL-60 differentiation. Exposure of these pretreated HL-60 cells to TPA, which induces macrophage-like maturation, resulted in a 70% reduction of incorporation of [35S]sulfate into cell-associated glycosaminoglycans. Thus, even in HL-60 cells in which glycosaminoglycan production is maximally stimulated by beta-D-xyloside, TPA is a strong inhibitor of free glycosaminoglycan chain production, and this biochemical effect is associated with other features of leukocyte maturation.","['Luikart, S D', 'Sackrison, J L']","['Luikart SD', 'Sackrison JL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Glycosaminoglycans/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hymecromone/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Umbelliferones/*pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90053-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(9):1083-90. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90053-6.,,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Umbelliferones)', '3T5NG4Q468 (Hymecromone)', '6734-33-4 (methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-xyloside)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['CA-38972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CH-39973/CH/OID CDC HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Other phorbol esters also inhibited vincristine uptake in approximate proportion to their activity in competing for [20-3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutrate binding. TPA enhanced the Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent phosphorylation of histone III-S by a soluble protein fraction of cells. Phosphorylation of various cell lysate proteins (p18, p21, p29, p34 and p45) were also stimulated by TPA. These TPA-induced stimulations were also inhibited dose-dependently by H-7.

The children with FNH (four females, two males) ranged in age from 6 months to 15 years (average age: 7 years). Three patients had ""hepatomegaly"" noted on physical examination 2 months to 2 or more years prior to diagnosis. The average diameter of FNH was 7.3 cm (range 2.5-10 cm). The lesion was confined to the right lobe in four cases and showed bilobar involvement in two. The HA's were diagnosed in a newborn male and a 2-year-old girl, both of whom were symptomatic because of large tumor size (10 cm each). There was no maternal history of exposure to exogenous steroids during pregnancy. Three children with FNH underwent hepatic lobectomy and were alive and well 4 to 17 years later. One child who died of acute leukemia had an incidental FNH discovered at autopsy. Two patients were treated conservatively with biopsy only and were alive and symptom-free 13 and 15 years later. Both children with HA underwent hepatic lobectomy. One died postoperatively because of intra-abdominal hemorrhage and the other was alive and well 10 1/2 years later. Complete surgical resection is recommended for most children with HA when technically feasible because of the lingering suspicion of possible (albeit remote) malignant transformation and diagnostic difficulties in distinguishing HA from a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.","['Lack, E E', 'Ornvold, K']","['Lack EE', 'Ornvold K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,IM,"['Adenoma/*pathology/surgery', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Hepatectomy/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia/surgery', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Liver/*pathology/surgery', 'Liver Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Male']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jso.2930330217 [doi]'],ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 1986 Oct;33(2):129-35. doi: 10.1002/jso.2930330217.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested this possibility by comparing the alkyl cleavage enzyme activity in cells that exhibit differences in sensitivity toward the cytotoxic effects of the rac-1-hexadecyl-2-methoxy-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60), a cell line highly sensitive to the cytotoxic alkyl phospholipid analogue, possessed an alkyl cleavage enzyme activity (0.25 pmol/min/microgram protein) similar to that found in three cell types known to be relatively resistant to the cytotoxic activity of the analogue: immature human promyeloblastic leukemia cells (K562) (0.22 pmol/min/microgram protein), human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (0.34 pmol/min/microgram protein), and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (0.37 pmol/min/microgram protein). Moreover, our results indicate that the cytotoxic rac-1-octadecyl-2-methoxy-glycero-3-phosphocholine analogue is not a substrate for the alkyl cleavage enzyme with an active microsomal preparation of the enzyme from rat liver; cleavage of this analogue was 200-fold less than the rate obtained with 1-octadecylglycerol as substrate. In cultures of either sensitive or resistant type cells, approximately 90% of the added rac-1-[9',10'-3H]octadecyl-2-methoxy-glycero-3-phosphocholine was not metabolized during a 24-h incubation. The amount of radiolabel in fatty acids, a major product of alkyl cleavage activity, was small, and essentially identical amounts were produced in all four cell types [3.1 +/- 0.2% (SD)]. These data indicate that differences in the cellular activities of the alkyl cleavage enzyme are not responsible for the differential cytotoxic responses between normal and specific types of neoplastic cells toward rac-1-octadecyl-2-methoxy-glycero-3-phosphocholine. On the other hand, the cellular uptake of the alkyl phospholipids could be a factor in explaining the cytotoxic response of certain tumor cells, since more radiolabeled 1-octadecyl-2-methoxy-glycero-3-phosphocholine was associated with the susceptible HL-60 cells than with the resistant cell types.

This drug has been reported to display antitumor effects but its utilization has been limited by its extreme toxicity. Here we report that the incorporation of valinomycin into multilamellar liposomes composed of dimyristoyl phosphatidyl choline:cholesterol:phosphatidyl serine (10:4:1 M ratio) results in a profound reduction in toxicity with maintainence of antitumor efficacy. Thus the median lethal dose (LD50) for i.p. administered valinomycin (VM) in C57BL/6 X DBA/2 mice is 1.7 mg/kg whereas the LD50 for liposome incorporated valinomycin (MVL-VM) is in excess of 50 mg/kg. In like manner, the LD50 for i.v. administered VM is 0.18 mg/kg where the LD50 for MLV-VM preparations passed through a 0.6-micron filter is greater than 10 mg/kg. The antitumor efficacies of i.p. administered VM or MLV-VM against i.p. P388 mouse leukemia were similar in multiple dose formats using doses below the maximal tolerated dose for VM. However, since MLV-VM was substantially less toxic than VM, the liposomal drug also produced significant (170% median survival time of treated mice/median survival time of untreated control) antitumor effects when administered as a single dose at levels above the maximal tolerated dose for free VM; single doses of free VM at the maximal tolerated dose were ineffective in this context. In experiments with i.v. inoculated P388 leukemia, MLV-VM but not free VM, displayed antitumor activity (144% median survival time of treated mice/median survival time of untreated control) when administered i.v. at equitoxic doses. Thus the use of a lipid vesicle drug carrier system permits a reduction in the toxicity of valinomycin with maintainence or enhancement of antitumor activity against i.p. or i.v.

During studies of the chemistry of a gold complex of this group [(AuCl)2(DPPE)], it was observed that this complex readily underwent ring closure on reaction with DPPE to form the tetrahedral complex [Au(DPPE)2]+. Various counterion forms (e.g., Cl-) of this cation were isolated and were found to exhibit a remarkably high stability in solution. Evaluation of [Au(DPPE)2]Cl in mice bearing i.p. P388 leukemia demonstrated that the compound produced an average of 87% increase in life span at its maximally tolerated dose (2-3 mumol/kg/day for 5 days). Activity was also seen in i.p. M5076 reticulum cell sarcoma (60% increase in life span) and s.c. mammary adenocarcinoma 16/c. Modest activity was evident in i.p. B16 melanoma and L1210 leukemia.

P388 demonstrated an advantage over single-agent therapy. In vitro studies of [Au(DPPE)2]Cl showed that the compound: is cytotoxic to tumor cell lines; is only minimally inhibited in its cytotoxic activity by the presence of serum; produces DNA protein cross-links and DNA strand breaks in cells; and inhibits macromolecular synthesis with a preferential inhibitory effect on protein synthesis relative to DNA and RNA synthesis. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that the compound is stable in the presence of serum proteins, thiols, or disulfides and that it reacts with Cu(II) resulting in the formation of a Cu(I)DPPE complex. The results of these in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that the contrasting pharmacological profile of [Au(DPPE)2]Cl with respect to other gold(I) phosphine complexes may be related to both the kinetic stability of the complex and its stability in the presence of thiols.","['Berners-Price, S J', 'Mirabelli, C K', 'Johnson, R K', 'Mattern, M R', 'McCabe, F L', 'Faucette, L F', 'Sung, C M', 'Mong, S M', 'Sadler, P J', 'Crooke, S T']","['Berners-Price SJ', 'Mirabelli CK', 'Johnson RK', 'Mattern MR', 'McCabe FL', 'Faucette LF', 'Sung CM', 'Mong SM', 'Sadler PJ', 'Crooke ST']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Copper', 'Copper Sulfate', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Gold/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acids/biosynthesis', 'Organogold Compounds', '*Organometallic Compounds', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*drug therapy']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Nov;46(11):5486-93.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Organogold Compounds)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '47895-18-1 (bis(1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane)gold(I))', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'LRX7AJ16DT (Copper Sulfate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,

We have purposely chosen three growth-regulated protooncogenes that share similar biological features and three gene sequences that have in common the cell cycle dependence of their expression in cells of different tissue and in different species. The level of expression was determined by measuring the amounts of specific RNA by Northern blot analysis. Levels of expression of the six growth-regulated genes were compared to the level of expression of the S-phase-specific H3 gene and among themselves. This method distinguishes the increased expression of a growth-regulated gene due to a true altered activation from over-expression which simply reflects an increase in the fraction of cycling cells. We have found that six of 14 patients with acute leukemias have markedly high ratios of c-myc/H3, c-myc/p53, and c-myc/c-myb expression. Two patients with altered c-myc expression have also a high ratio p53/H3. Within the group of cell cycle-dependent genes the ratios of expression seem in the overall much more regular with the clear exception of a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia in which the ratios 4F1/H3 and 2F1/H3 are significantly increased. A possible interpretation of these findings is that the fraction of noncycling leukemic cells that often constitute the majority of the entire leukemic population is in some cases in a true resting state, whereas in other cases heterogeneous degrees of growth arrest might occur. The altered expression of c-myc seems the feature most commonly associated with this putative growth arrest of leukemic cells suggesting that this gene may contribute to the impairment of proliferative control that is associated with the leukemic phenotype.","['Ferrari, S', 'Narni, F', 'Mars, W', 'Kaczmarek, L', 'Venturelli, D', 'Anderson, B', 'Calabretta, B']","['Ferrari S', 'Narni F', 'Mars W', 'Kaczmarek L', 'Venturelli D', 'Anderson B', 'Calabretta B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/analysis/biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Oct;46(10):5162-6.,,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",['CA 25898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Incorporation of 2-14C-labeled 3-deazaguanine into DNA and RNA, separated by Cs2SO4 density gradient centrifugation, was demonstrated. Incorporation into DNA was linear versus [3-deazaguanine] X t and correlated inversely with cell viability (P less than 0.001). These data suggest that 3-deazaguanine is anabolized and incorporated into DNA, and that this incorporation is related to decreased DNA synthesis and cell death. The decrease in protein synthesis and diminution of guanosine 5'-triphosphate levels following drug treatment may also contribute to the growth-inhibitory actions of 3-deazaguanine.","['Pieper, R O', 'Barrows, L R', 'Mandel, H G']","['Pieper RO', 'Barrows LR', 'Mandel HG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Oct;46(10):4960-5.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '9DRB973HUI (3-deazaguanine)']",,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effect of merocyanine-540 (MC-540) on both leukemic and normal bone marrow (BM) cells. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen-positive non-T, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Reh) cell lines were incubated with MC-540 and simultaneously exposed to white light. Normal human BM and mixtures of leukemic cells with BM cells were treated under similar conditions. At constant illumination rates of 50,000 lx, significant (at least 4 to 5 logs) tumor cell destruction was obtained with MC-540 concentrations of 20 micrograms/ml or more for HL-60, and 10 micrograms/ml or more for Reh cells. Incubation of BM under equivalent conditions preserved 18.0% of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and 14.2% of erythroid burst-forming units. Similar results were obtained when tumor cells were mixed with irradiated BM and then treated with MC-540. In summary, cell photosensitization with MC-540 has a selective cytotoxic effect towards leukemic cells and therefore may be useful for purging tumor cells from autologous BM.","['Atzpodien, J', 'Gulati, S C', 'Clarkson, B D']","['Atzpodien J', 'Gulati SC', 'Clarkson BD']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Light', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Oct;46(10):4892-5.,,"['0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)']",['CA-20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Concordance was calculated using a statistic that corrects for chance-expected agreement (k), and a weighted statistic that takes into account the seriousness of disagreements was used. Samples were available for morphological and cytochemical assessment on 105 patients, and immunophenotype data were available on 93 specimens. Intraobserver concordance was 64.8% and 70.5% for observers A and B, respectively, with kappa values of .56 and .62.

Reproducibility improved to 89% (k = .86) when cytochemistry was added. When immunophenotype information was provided in addition to Wright-stained and cytochemical preparations, the agreement was 99%. Lymphocytic:nonlymphocytic discordance between observers occurred on nine occasions when Wright-stained preparations only were available and four times when cytochemistry was added; it did not occur with immunophenotyping.

SMN's were seen in 27 of these patients giving an incidence rate three and a half times that expected in an age and sex matched normal population (p = much less than 0.001). The incidence rate was higher in those receiving multiple chemotherapy and radiotherapy for relapsed HD compared with those receiving primary radiotherapy, chemotherapy or chemotherapy with adjuvant radiotherapy (p = 0.02). However, the increased incidence rate in those patients treated with chemotherapy on relapse, may reflect in part a delayed effect of their primary therapy, since the incidence rate in the primary treatment group only becomes significantly raised after six years. When allowance was made for this delay the difference between the two groups was no longer significant. The incidence rates for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and myelogenous leukaemia were 32 and 57 times those expected, compared with only two and a half times the expected rate for non-haematological SMN's (p = much less than 0.001). The four acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) all occurred within five years of treatment compared to wide-ranging intervals between treatment and occurrence of SMN in the other groups. The increased incidence of NHL may be an alternative expression of lymphoid abnormality rather than a treatment-related occurrence. Multiple SMN's were diagnosed in three patients. This represented a highly significant (p = much less than 0.001) increase over the expected incidence of multiple neoplasia in the general population. Several factors may contribute to the development of SMN's in HD, including an inherent disposition of HD itself. The time-dependent incidence pattern of SMN's with a delay followed by an increased incidence rate, suggests that treatment plays a key role. It is not yet clear whether more intensive, or multiple treatments add to the risk accrued for the initial treatment.","['Dorreen, M S', 'Gregory, W M', 'Wrigley, P F', 'Stansfeld, A G', 'Lister, T A']","['Dorreen MS', 'Gregory WM', 'Wrigley PF', 'Stansfeld AG', 'Lister TA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', '*Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Prednisolone/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Vinblastine/adverse effects']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900040207 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1986 Apr-Jun;4(2):149-61. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900040207.,,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'MVPP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,

Activity was assessed by means of semiautomated microculture growth inhibition assays. Cell density of the non-adherent cell lines was measured using the technique of Mosmann (J Immunol Methods 1983, 65, 55-63), in which the dye thiazolyl blue (MTT) is metabolised to a dark blue formazan product. This technique gives similar results to those obtained by direct cell counting in an electronic cell counter, and when applied to some adherent cell lines gives similar results to those obtained by the methylene blue staining technique previously developed (Anal Biochem 1984, 139, 272-277). Both methylene blue and MTT methods were used to investigate cytotoxicity in conjunction with semi-automated 96-well microculture plate techniques. The results show that the three T-cell leukaemia lines (CCRF-CEM, Jurkat and MOLT-4) are more sensitive to DNA-binding drugs (excluding nitracrine) than are the colon carcinoma lines (HCT-8, HT-29, SW480 and SW620).

After removal of the inducer from the cultures, DNA synthesis and c-myc mRNA levels returned rapidly to near-normal levels, but the expression of c-fos gene continued to increase for 24 hr and then declined slowly. Studies with isolated nuclei showed that the inhibition of DNA synthesis can be detected earlier than the changes in transcriptional rates of the oncogenes studied, and that 1,25(OH)2D3 directly inhibits the DNA synthesis in isolated nuclei. Autoradiographic studies of [3H]thymidine incorporation showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 does not immediately block the progression of the cells into the S phase of the cell cycle, but that those cells which become differentiated as the result of a brief exposure to this inducer do have such a block. It is concluded that 1,25(OH)2D3 produces both an immediate and a delayed inhibition of DNA synthesis in HL 60 cells, that the immediate inhibition is not preceded by detectable changes in oncogene expression, and that the delayed inhibition is accompanied by an elevated expression of the c-fos gene, and may be related to the monocytic differentiation of HL 60 cells.","['Brelvi, Z S', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Brelvi ZS', 'Studzinski GP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041280206 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1986 Aug;128(2):171-9. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041280206.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,

They are weakly oncogenic and express a very low tropism for thymic cells. However, their activation by X-rays and the subsequent insertion of new proviral sequences in the cell genome of in vivo- and in vitro-passaged tumors suggest that they might play a role in radioleukemogenesis. To study this possibility, a cloned B-ecotropic virus (1223) was injected into C57BL/6 mice subjected to a subleukemogenenic irradiation which induces only 7% of thymic lymphosarcomas (TL). When it was injected prior to or after irradiation, 1223 induced respectively 31% and 19% of TL. The incidence of TL in the different groups closely correlated with virus expression in hematopoietic tissues during the preleukemic period. Thus, irradiation seems to amplify bone marrow (BM) and thymic cell population(s) which play a decisive role in viral expression.

Routinely prepared Pappenheim-stained blood smears were scanned in a high-resolution color TV-microscope system. Eleven blast-cell classes (OMSBC, T-ALL, OMS, ALL, LBL, IBL, AUL, AML, AMOL, AMMOL, and CML) were analyzed with the nonparametric statistical software program ""Classification and Regression Trees"" (CART). This paper documents the initial statistical evaluation of 62 leukemia-related morphological features that directly measure and analyze the cell-related quantifiable differences occurring in the various blast cells. The 62 cell image features include both common cytophotometric features, and new texture and color features developed for this project. This study found that each leukemia specimen contains a dominant class of blasts that correlates with the specific leukemia, plus a distribution of blasts from related diseases. The present data suggest the existence of a distribution fingerprint pattern for each leukemia.","['Aus, H M', 'Harms, H', 'Haucke, M', 'Beritova, J', 'ter Meulen, V', 'Gunzer, U', 'Baumann, I', 'Abmayr, W']","['Aus HM', 'Harms H', 'Haucke M', 'Beritova J', 'ter Meulen V', 'Gunzer U', 'Baumann I', 'Abmayr W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*pathology', 'Software']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990070411 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1986 Jul;7(4):365-70. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990070411.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty patients were part of the National Hodgkin's Disease Study, randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy to either an involved (39) or extended field (41). In a subsequent single-arm study, 104 patients were treated with involved-field radiotherapy preceded and followed by three cycles of MOPP chemotherapy. Median durations of follow-up have been 172, 172, and 92 months, for the involved-field radiotherapy, extended-field radiotherapy, and MOPP plus involved-field radiotherapy treatment groups, respectively. Although significant differences among the three treatment groups were observed with respect to disease-free survival (p less than 0.001), only the group of patients treated with involved-field radiotherapy had a statistically significant decline in overall survival as compared with the two other treatment groups (p less than 0.001). Moreover, patients who underwent clinical staging and were treated with MOPP plus involved-field radiotherapy had significantly prolonged disease-free survival compared with those who underwent surgical staging and were treated with extended-field radiotherapy (p less than 0.001). One of the patients who received MOPP plus involved-field radiotherapy had subsequent development of acute monocytic leukemia, and another had refractory anemia with excess blasts. One instance of diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma was also observed. Acute monocytic leukemia developed in another patient treated with involved-field radiotherapy. The rates of amenorrhea in the group treated with MOPP plus involved-field radio-therapy were 9.6 percent and 78.5 percent for female patients younger and older than 30 years of age, respectively. Despite the universal azoospermia ensuing after MOPP plus involved-field radiotherapy, in three patients whose sperm counts were checked sequentially for 26 to 53 months after treatment, evidence of spermatogenesis was observed. Three patients with remission of Hodgkin's disease after involved-field (two) and extended-field (one) radiotherapy died from cardiovascular disease that could only be attributed to the prior radiotherapy. Although further follow-up evaluation will be required to determine the impact of the three different treatment modalities on survival and long-term toxicity, MOPP plus involved-field radiotherapy appears to be superior to involved-field or extended-field radiotherapy alone in achieving prolonged disease-free survival without significant leukemogenic potential.","['Koziner, B', 'Myers, J', 'Cirrincione, C', 'Redman, J', 'Cunningham, I', 'Caravelli, J', 'Nisce, L Z', 'McCormick, B', 'Straus, D J', 'Mertelsmann, R']","['Koziner B', 'Myers J', 'Cirrincione C', 'Redman J', 'Cunningham I', 'Caravelli J', 'Nisce LZ', 'McCormick B', 'Straus DJ', 'Mertelsmann R', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Adult', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/etiology', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(86)90667-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(86)90667-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1986 Jun;80(6):1067-78. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(86)90667-4.,,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'MOPP protocol']",['CA-05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

However, no such effect was obtained with a suspension in PBS or in HCO-60 solution. In this regard, it should be noted that sequential but independent administration of SS 554 and oil was found to be equally as effective as simultaneous administration of oil with SS 554. Thus the effect of the oil should be reconsidered through an examination of the sequential appearance of effector cells.

When the dose effect of SS 554 was examined in the presence of 10% sesame oil, doses over 1 mg exhibited a dose dependent curative effect.

After formation of a rapidly reversible dUMP-NPQ-enzyme complex, a slow isomerization occurs to provide a ternary complex that can be isolated on nitrocellulose membranes or by gel filtration. Unusual features of the isolable complex are the slow rate by which it is formed (t1/2 = 0.88 h) and the slow rate at which it dissociates (t1/2 = 26.5 h). The ternary complexes contain 2 mol of dUMP and 2 mol of NPQ bound per mol of dimeric enzyme. Ultraviolet difference spectra of the dUMP-NPQ-TS complex shows a high wavelength maximum that has been attributed to perturbations of the enzyme and/or ligand chromophores that occur upon binding. Data are presented that suggest that the formation of the isolable ternary complex involves nucleophilic attack by a catalytic thiol group of the enzyme to the 6-position of dUMP. Evidence for this is as follows: first, there is a decrease in the absorbance of the pyrimidine chromophore at 265 nm that occurs at the same rate as the formation of the isolable complex; second, using [6-3H]dUMP there is a large, inverse alpha-secondary kinetic isotope effect (kappa H/kappa T = 0.83) upon formation of the complex that is in accord with sp2 to sp3 rehybridization of the 6-carbon of the heterocycle. Treatment of the complex with sodium dodecyl sulfate (NaDodSO4) results in the dissociation of both ligands in an unmodified form, which is consistent with proposed structure of the complex. Isolable ternary complexes are also formed when the enzyme is incubated with 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate (FdUMP) and NPQ. Interestingly, the dissociation of FdUMP from these complexes is biphasic, with one-half of the bound nucleotide dissociating at an exceedingly slow rate (t1/2 congruent to 100 h). The findings are discussed with relationship to the possible use of NPQ as an anticancer agent.","['Pogolotti, A L Jr', 'Danenberg, P V', 'Santi, D V']","['Pogolotti AL Jr', 'Danenberg PV', 'Santi DV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Deoxyuracil Nucleotides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', 'Protein Denaturation', '*Quinazolines', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tritium']",1986/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00154a009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1986 Apr;29(4):478-82. doi: 10.1021/jm00154a009.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', ""964-26-1 (2'-deoxyuridylic acid)"", 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",['CA-14394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

All participants had normal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion as assessed by plasma cortisol responses to insulin hypoglycemia. Urinary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) excretion of pubertal and postpubertal patients (N = 37) was appropriate, except for one subject from Group I who had an abnormally high output of gonadotropins, and one from Group II who had abnormally low levels.

Nevertheless, all children had normal linear growth. It was concluded that the three forms of CNS prophylaxis evaluated had no long-term adverse effect on TSH and ACTH secretion.

The latter sequences, termed v-myb, are responsible for the oncogenic properties of the virus. AMV causes acute myeloblastic leukaemia in chickens and transforms a specific class of haematopoietic cells in vitro, but does not induce morphological transformation of cultured fibroblasts, suggesting that only a restricted target-cell population is responsive to its transforming gene product. The normal cellular counterpart of v-myb, c-myb, is highly conserved and is present in all vertebrate and some invertebrate species examined. DNA rearrangements and altered expression of the myb oncogene have been reported in mouse lymphoid tumours and human myeloid and colon tumours. The mechanism of activation of the cellular proto-oncogenes is thought to involve the structural alteration of the coding regions that result in either the synthesis of an altered gene product or the enhanced expression of a proto-oncogene caused by alterations in its regulatory elements. To distinguish between these two mechanisms, we have cloned and sequenced the chicken c-myb complementary DNA and compared it with that of v-myb sequences. We demonstrate that during the transduction of the cellular sequences and/or viral passage a substantial portion of the coding region of the c-myb gene has been lost from both the 5' and 3' ends, resulting in the generation of a truncated gene product that mediates the transforming function of the virus.","['Rosson, D', 'Reddy, E P']","['Rosson D', 'Reddy EP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chickens', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Genes, Viral', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1986/02/13 00:00,1986/02/13 00:01,['1986/02/13 00:00'],"['1986/02/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/13 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/319604a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1986 Feb 13-19;319(6054):604-6. doi: 10.1038/319604a0.,,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,['GENBANK/X03477'],,,,,,,

Sixty-one scans were performed (40 IV, 21 SQ) in 59 patients who had injections of 0.2-50 mg of 131I coupled (0.2-12 mCi) antibody. These included 48.7, which identifies a high molecular weight antigen (HMW), or 96.5, which identifies a transferrin like molecule, p97. 125I coupled nonspecific Fab 1.4, reacting with murine leukemia virus, or the whole antibody BL3, reactive with a human B cell idiotypic determinant, was generally used in tandem with the patients injected SQ as a nonspecific control. All patients had immunohistochemical studies performed on biopsied lesions and demonstrated binding to the antibodies injected. Of the IV patients, 22/38 (58%) had (+) scans, 13 at SQ or nodal sites, four at visceral sites, and five at visceral and SQ sites. Patients with clinical stage II disease had SQ injection of MoAb, including 11 additional patients injected with the whole antibody 9.2.27 (anti-HMW) labeled with 111In (6 patients) or 131I (5 patients). Nodal dissection was performed 2-4 days later. All 111In coupled antibodies demonstrated excellent nodal delineation without specific identification of tumor deposits. Of the 21 patients injected SQ with MoAb, 17 had confirmed tumor in nodes. Of patients injected with Fab fragments, 4/8 (50%) had specific uptake of MoAb, although only two were successfully imaged. Increased uptake of antimelanoma antibodies was observed in some patients in lymph nodes not containing tumor and was possibly related to antigen shedding. Clearance of labeled antibody from the injection site occurred with a half life of 16-50 hours. Toxicity was limited to local discomfort at the site of SQ injection. Melanoma metastases can be identified with IV or SQ injection or radiolabeled antibodies. These reagents may be useful in the diagnosis or therapy of human melanoma. Further evaluation will be required before they could be considered clinically useful.","['Lotze, M T', 'Carrasquillo, J A', 'Weinstein, J N', 'Bryant, G J', 'Perentesis, P', 'Reynolds, J C', 'Matis, L A', 'Eger, R R', 'Keenan, A M', 'Hellstrom, I']","['Lotze MT', 'Carrasquillo JA', 'Weinstein JN', 'Bryant GJ', 'Perentesis P', 'Reynolds JC', 'Matis LA', 'Eger RR', 'Keenan AM', 'Hellstrom I', 'et al.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Surg,Annals of surgery,0372354,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments', 'Indium', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Lymph Nodes/diagnostic imaging', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*diagnostic imaging/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiography', 'Radioisotopes', 'Radionuclide Imaging']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000658-198609000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg. 1986 Sep;204(3):223-35. doi: 10.1097/00000658-198609000-00002.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '045A6V3VFX (Indium)']",,PMC1251268,,,,,,,,

Single injections of 5-FU, 15-50 mg/kg i.p., caused a sharply dose-related reduction of leukemic growth as measured by liver and spleen weights and leucocyte counts. Similar results were obtained with three doses of 5-FU over a period of 10 days. No apparent toxicity was observed in these experiments. A schedule of 25 mg/kg every 5 days extended the survival time of leukemic rats to 156%, as compared to untreated controls. In the BNML model such an increase in lifespan is equivalent to a 10,000 fold reduction of the tumor mass. These results indicate a potential value of 5-FU treatment in human myeloid leukemia. 5-FU, however, is not used in the clinical treatment of leukemia. A review of the literature revealed that there have been very few relevant studies of this application of 5-FU, while the more unique activity of this drug against some solid tumors has been investigated extensively. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is no clear evidence of the ineffectiveness of 5-FU against leukemia, and that further investigations should find out whether the disregard of 5-FU in this respect is justified.","['Ermens, A A', 'Kroes, A C', 'Lindemans, J', 'Abels, J']","['Ermens AA', 'Kroes AC', 'Lindemans J', 'Abels J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1986 Jul-Aug;6(4):797-800.,,['U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)'],,,,,,,,,,

This is indicative of the complex involvement of folate metabolism in the effects of 5-FU. In the BN rat leukemia model, 5-FU treatment was combined with the inactivation of cobalamin (vitamin B12) by nitrous oxide (N2O). Exposure to nitrous oxide causes severe disturbance of folate metabolism through the inhibition of the cobalamin-dependent enzyme methionine synthetase, and leads to loss of folates from the cell. With regard to the effects on growth of leukemia, the addition of nitrous oxide did not antagonize 5-FU. On the contrary, therapeutic effects were enhanced by combined treatment, as was evident from a further reduction of leukemic infiltration in spleen and liver, from a decrease or even disappearance of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood, and from extended survival of rats. These findings were in accordance with metabolic studies in isolated leukemic cells of treated rats, in which combined treatment caused further impairment of thymidylate and DNA synthesis. Pretreatment with nitrous oxide, for a period of 3 days, was more effective than treatment after the administration of 5-FU. Folate levels, in plasma and intracellular, were reduced after combined treatment. It is concluded that in this leukemia, unlike observations in some models of solid tumors, the activity of 5-FU is enhanced with a depletion of folates. This effect is probably comparable to the combination of methotrexate pretreatment with 5-FU, and might be important to applications of 5-FU in combination chemotherapy of hematological neoplasms.","['Kroes, A C', 'Ermens, A A', 'Lindemans, J', 'Abels, J']","['Kroes AC', 'Ermens AA', 'Lindemans J', 'Abels J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/*administration & dosage', 'Folic Acid/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Nitrous Oxide/*administration & dosage', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Vitamin B 12/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1986 Jul-Aug;6(4):737-42.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'K50XQU1029 (Nitrous Oxide)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,

Together these findings suggest that the decrease of guanine nucleotides induced by MPA is restored by GMP, which is formed from guanine by HGPRTase in the cells.

BVDU inhibits the replication of HSV-1 and VZV at a concentration as low as 1-10 ng/ml; and the proliferation of tumor cells transformed with the HSV-1 thymidine kinase gene is even inhibited by BVDU concentrations lower than 1 ng/ml. Moreover, BVDU is inhibitory to Epstein-Barr virus replication in vitro at a concentration of 0.02 micrograms/ml. Due to the action of pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases, BVDU is rapidly degraded to the free pyrimidine base bromovinyluracil (BVU). In contrast to BVDU, which is cleared from the bloodstream within 2-3 hours, BVU persists in the plasma for at least 24 hours. During this period BVU can be converted again to BVDU upon administration of deoxythymidine, deoxyuridine or any other deoxyribonucleoside capable of transferring its deoxyribosyl moiety onto BVU. BVU owes its long persistence in the bloodstream to the fact that it does not act as substrate for dihydrothymine dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the catabolic pathway of pyrimidines. On the contrary, BVU acts as an efficient inhibitor of this enzyme and thereby prevents the degradation of fluorouracil (FU), a well-known anticancer agent. As a consequence, BVDU via BVU enhances the antitumor activity of FU, as has been demonstrated in the murine P388 leukemia model. Thus, BVDU may be useful in anticancer chemotherapy from several viewpoints, e.g. for treatment of intercurrent herpesvirus infections, and, in combination with FU, for treatment of those malignant diseases that are amenable to FU therapy.","['De Clercq, E']",['De Clercq E'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bromouracil/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Herpesviridae/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1986 Jul-Aug;6(4):549-56.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '2M3055079H (brivudine)', '4HK400G5UO (Bromouracil)', '69304-49-0 (5-(2-bromovinyl)uracil)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,

There was severe distortion of lymph nodal architecture with variable loss of discernible follicles and sinuses. Histiocytes, lymphocytes, immunoblasts, and plasma cells were present in expanded paracortical regions which encroached on, and occasionally effaced, lymphoid follicles. Postcapillary venules were numerous and prominent throughout the paracortex. The lymphadenopathy was most commonly transient (86% of cases) with subsequent development of lymphoma in one cat. Lymph nodes from seven kittens with experimental FeLV infection were compared with spontaneously enlarged lymph nodes; four of seven had B and T lymphocyte hyperplasia with normal nodal architecture. Three had partial loss of nodal architecture as a result of expanded paracortical regions populated largely by histiocytes and lymphocytes. Proliferation of postcapillary venules was not prominent in nodes from FeLV-infected cats. The cause of spontaneous lymph node hyperplasia of young cats was not determined. However, the similarity of lesions to those of kittens with experimental FeLV infection and the association with FeLV by serologic tests in six of nine cats suggest that this retrovirus may be involved in the pathogenesis of the lesion.","['Moore, F M', 'Emerson, W E', 'Cotter, S M', 'DeLellis, R A']","['Moore FM', 'Emerson WE', 'Cotter SM', 'DeLellis RA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*pathology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Hyperplasia/etiology/veterinary', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/pathology/veterinary', 'Male']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/030098588602300407 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Pathol. 1986 Jul;23(4):386-91. doi: 10.1177/030098588602300407.,,,['2507RR05852-03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We used such information from a closed population in Maine that was followed for a year, along with data from the literature on the absorbed dose from typical examinations and a mathematical model linking dose to the incidence rate of cancer, to estimate the numbers of cases of radiologically induced cancer of the bone marrow and breast. Our data indicate that about 1 percent of all cases of leukemia and less than 1 percent of all cases of breast cancer result from diagnostic radiography. In addition, such tumors generally occur late in life; the incidence of radiation-induced leukemia was highest at 69 years, and the incidence of radiation-induced breast cancer was highest at 76 years. Thus, diagnostic radiography has only a small influence on the occurrence of leukemia and breast cancer.","['Evans, J S', 'Wennberg, J E', 'McNeil, B J']","['Evans JS', 'Wennberg JE', 'McNeil BJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Maine', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiography/*adverse effects', 'Risk']",1986/09/25 00:00,1986/09/25 00:01,['1986/09/25 00:00'],"['1986/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM198609253151306 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1986 Sep 25;315(13):810-5. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198609253151306.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the search for new compounds to treat human solid tumors it is proposed to use human tumors as xenografts in primary screening. Phenomena related to doxorubicin resistance are presented together with a new approach to circumvent this in the clinic. The value of biochemical modulation is discussed, exemplified by the combination of 5-fluorouracil and uridine. The complexity of the biological response modifiers and the importance of evaluating them adequately in the clinic is stressed. The EORTC has recently decided on requirements for the minimum toxicology for phase I trials of a new cytostatic drug in order to ensure safe and rapid evaluation of new anti-cancer compounds.

The group's median survival was 42 weeks, with high marrow cellularity and percentage of blasts, impairment of bone marrow, liver or renal function, age over 65 yr and performance status less than 80% associated with poorer survival. Cytogenetic changes associated with poor survival included loss of chromosome 5 or 7, additional chromosome 8, karyotypic instability, and presence of 100% abnormal metaphases. A regression model including terms for blood and bone marrow features, and age at hospital admission was able to stratify patients into prognostic groups in the same population and in an independent population admitted prior to 1973. Further prospective testing of the model is required. Twenty-six of the 78 patients who were eventually treated with combination chemotherapy achieved complete remission. The presence of Auer rods, diagnosis of acute leukemia or refractory anemia with excess blasts, rapid increase in marrow infiltrate and favorable cytogenetic karyotype were associated with response.

The alterations were made by recombinant DNA manipulations on a plasmid subclone containing an M-MuLV LTR. Promoter activity of altered LTRs was measured by fusion to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, followed by transient expression assay in NIH 3T3 cells. M-MuLV proviral organizations containing the altered LTRs were also generated, and infectious virus was recovered by transfection. Infectivity of the resulting virus was quantified by XC plaque assay, and pathogenicity was determined by inoculating neonatal NIH Swiss mice. Inversion of sequences in the U3 region containing the tandemly repeated enhancer sequences (-150 to -353 base pairs [bp]) reduced promoter activity approximately fivefold in the transient-expression assays. Infectious virus containing the inverted sequences (Mo- M-MuLV) showed a 20-fold reduction in relative infectivity compared with wild-type M-MuLV, but the virus still induced thymus-derived lymphoblastic lymphoma or leukemia in mice, with essentially the same kinetics as for wild-type M-MuLV. We previously derived an M-MuLV which carried inserted enhancer sequences from the F101 strain of polyomavirus (Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV) and showed that this virus is nonleukemogenic. In Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV, the PyF101 sequences were inserted between the M-MuLV promoter and the M-MuLV enhancers (at -150 bp). A new LTR was generated in which the PyF101 sequences were inserted to the 5' side of the M-MuLV enhancers (at -353 bp, PyF101 + Mo M-MuLV). The PyF101 + Mo LTR exhibited promoter activity similar (40 to 50%) to that of wild-type M-MuLV, and infectious PyF101 + Mo M-MuLV had high infectivity on NIH 3T3 cells (50% of wild type). In contrast to the nonleukemogenic Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV, PyF101 + Mo M-MuLV induced leukemia with kinetics similar to that of wild-type M-MuLV. Thus, the position of the PyF101 sequences relative to the M-MuLV LTR affected the biological behavior of the molecular construct. Furthermore, PyF101 + Mo M-MuLV induced a different spectrum of neoplastic disease. In comparison with wild-type M-MuLV, which induces a characteristic thymus-derived lymphoblastic lymphoma with extremely high frequency, PyF101 + Mo M-MuLV was capable of inducing both acute myeloid leukemia or thymus-derived lymphoblastic lymphoma, or both. Tumor DNA from both the PyF101 + Mo- and Mo- M-MuLV-inoculated animals contained recombinant proviruses with LTRs that differed from the initially inoculated virus.","['Fan, H', 'Mittal, S', 'Chute, H', 'Chao, E', 'Pattengale, P K']","['Fan H', 'Mittal S', 'Chute H', 'Chao E', 'Pattengale PK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.60.1.204-214.1986 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Oct;60(1):204-14. doi: 10.1128/JVI.60.1.204-214.1986.,,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']","['CA32454/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC253918,,,,,,,,
