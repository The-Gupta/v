Single class surface immunoglobulins (IgG kappa) were seen in six cases. These markers are thought to represent serum immunoglobulins attached to the leukemic monocytes via the receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin and are not synthesized by the cells as is the case with B lymphocytes. Receptors for complement were also noted. It appears that surface immunoglobulins and receptors for the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin and complement, which are found on several classes of normal lymphocytes and monocytes, may also be found on leukemic monocytes. Antisera to B lymphocytes, detecting HlA-DRw antigens, also reacted with some of the leukemic monocytes.","['Mirchandani, I', 'Tabaczka, P', 'Palutke, M']","['Mirchandani I', 'Tabaczka P', 'Palutke M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Cytoplasm/immunology', 'HLA Antigens', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/immunology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis/immunology', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Rosette Formation']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830120206 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1982 Apr;12(2):139-47. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830120206.,,,,,,,,

However, involvement of the joints is rare even with dissemination. Nineteen cases of joint involvement have previously been reported in adults and 21 cases in children. The most commonly involved joint has been the knee; in such cases, amphotericin B has been effective in controlling the infection. Five patients with cancer developed septic arthritis due to Candida species at the M. C. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute in the past five years. Four of these patients were seen in 1980. Candida albicans was isolated from three patients and Candida tropicalis from two. All five patients had predisposing conditions - e.g., intravenous and/or urinary catheterization, neutropenia, and previous treatment with steroids and antibiotics. The knee was the affected joint in all five. Different modalities of treatment were used, including intravenous miconazole, oral ketoconazole, and systemic and local amphotericin B; adequate levels of these drugs were found in the joint fluid when measured. Infection was cured in two patients. The condition of the third patient improved. The fourth patient died of disseminated disease despite therapy, and the fifth died of malignancy without the benefit of antifungal therapy. For treatment of such infections, the use of an antifungal agent is recommended in addition to frequent evacuation of the joint fluid. Some new compounds may prove useful alternatives to amphotericin B. Arthritis can be resolved even in the presence of unresolved disseminated disease.","['Fainstein, V', 'Gilmore, C', 'Hopfer, R L', 'Maksymiuk, A', 'Bodey, G P']","['Fainstein V', 'Gilmore C', 'Hopfer RL', 'Maksymiuk A', 'Bodey GP']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Rev Infect Dis,Reviews of infectious diseases,7905878,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Infectious/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Candidiasis/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Knee Joint/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Osteosarcoma/complications']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/clinids/4.1.78 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Infect Dis. 1982 Jan-Feb;4(1):78-85. doi: 10.1093/clinids/4.1.78.,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we investigated the involvement in these leukemias and lymphomas of the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) that was previously isolated in one of our laboratories from cultured T cells of some patients in the United States with leukemias and lymphomas involving relatively mature T cells. High titers of antibodies capable of quantitative precipitation of (125)I-labeled p24, a well characterized core protein of HTLV, were detected in 12 of 12 patients with untreated adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). (One negative was a patient on chemotherapy.) Ten of the 12 positive samples were from an area where the disease is endemic. Strong precipitating antibodies were also detected in five of seven cases of T-cell malignant lymphoma (TML) which differs from ATL by having fewer leukemic cells in the peripheral blood. High antibody titers were also observed in one of five cases of acute monoblastic leukemia and one of eight cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia in the blast phase of the disease. Low to moderate titers of antibodies were detected in several categories of leukemia (two cases of blast-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, two cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia of the null-cell type, and one case of acute myelogenous leukemia). Among all categories of leukemias, except ATL and TML, more cases were negative than positive for anti-p24 activity. All of 79 sera from normal Japanese, including 39 collected from the endemic ATL area of southwest Japan, were negative for antibodies to HTLV p24. All the positive reactivities observed were highly specific to HTLV. The only competition observed in the precipitation of HTLV p24 was with HTLV or with cell lines expressing HTLV and not with various animal retroviruses or a large number of human and subhuman primate cell lines, not known to be producing HTLV. The data strongly indicate an association of HTLV with the increased incidence of ATL in parts of Japan, probably with other forms of leukemias in Japan, and, less commonly, with certain T-cell malignancies in the United States.","['Kalyanaraman, V S', 'Sarngadharan, M G', 'Nakao, Y', 'Ito, Y', 'Aoki, T', 'Gallo, R C']","['Kalyanaraman VS', 'Sarngadharan MG', 'Nakao Y', 'Ito Y', 'Aoki T', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Viral Proteins/*immunology']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.79.5.1653 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Mar;79(5):1653-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.79.5.1653.,,PMC346034,,,,,,

Whole agar culture staining revealed that especially macrophage colonies increased in comparison with normal controls. After removal of carbonyl iron-laden cells with a magnet or deprivation of cells adherent to glass from BM cells, the number of macrophage colonies markedly reduced in comparison with the number of colonies formed by untreated BM cells, suggesting that some of the macrophage colony-forming cells (M-CFC) may have phagocytic and/or adherent activity. Radiation sensitivity and thymidine suicide rate of these M-CFC were not different from those of granulocyte colony-forming cells (G-CFC).

In 25 of these patients we have also investigated the in vitro glucocorticoid sensitivity by measuring dexamethasone inhibition of radiolabelled uridine and thymidine incorporation into the leukemic blasts. In patients with AML, GR levels were mostly high but did not correlate with the in vitro sensitivity, response to chemotherapy or survival. On the other hand, in the 19 patients with ALL there seemed to be a correlation between GR and in vitro sensitivity and between GR and clinical responsiveness to glucocorticoid therapy. Furthermore, patients with low levels of either TdT or GR seemed to be associated with poor prognosis. TdT activity and GR, however, did not associate with one another.

These experiments were conducted in an attempt to determine why dThd, although effective as a cytostatic agent against L1210 in vitro, is ineffective against L1210 in (BALB/c X DBA/2)F1 (CD2F1) mice. Systemic variations of dThd concentration and exposure times were examined in both a growth-inhibition assay and a soft agar cloning assay in vitro. The growth of cells exposed to 0.1 - 1.0 mM dThd for 15 hours was inhibited dramatically during exposure, but growth recovered to control rate rapidly when dThd was washed off the cells. With 96 hours of exposure to 1.0 mM dThd, growth rate did not return to control rate up to 120 hours after washing. Cloning efficiency was reduced to less than 1% of control by prior 96-hour exposure of L1210 cells to more than 0.5 mM dThd. Concentrations of deoxycytidine (dCyd) of 1.0 microM partially reversed cytotoxicity caused by dThd greater than 0.1 mM, and 10 microM dCyd completely reversed this cytotoxicity. In vivo plasma dThd concentrations during ip injections of 3,600 mg dThd/kg body weight every 8 hours for 4 days (approximately lethal dose for 10% of animals treated) ranged from 10 to 0.1 mM, but these concentrations were ineffective in prolonging survival time of L1210-bearing mice. Plasma concentrations of dCyd prior to dThd exposure were less than 1.0 microM. Following injection of dThd (3,600 mg/kg body wt), plasma dCyd was 2.8 +/- 0.5 microM (normal mice) and 6.1 +/- 0.5 microM (L1210-bearing mice). Thus the rise of dCyd in plasma following dThd administration in vivo prevented the cytotoxicity of dThd seen in vitro from being manifested in vivo in CD2F1 mice.","['Zaharko, D S', 'Ramonas, L M']","['Zaharko DS', 'Ramonas LM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Clone Cells', 'Deoxycytidine/blood/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L1210/mortality/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Spleen/analysis', 'Thymidine/blood/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1982 May;68(5):875-80.,,,,,,,,

At present the concept is being enlarged to include consideration of a new aspect: stem cell genetics, at the molecular level. Some questions are still to be answered. What is the basis for genetic regulation of ""commitment,"" that is, the transition from pluripotent stem cells to committed progenitor cells? Does neoplasia involve changes in the genetic material of hemopoietic stem cell? To illustrate the ways in which genetic approaches may be used to provide new answers to these important questions, a minimal model of commitment at the molecular level is presented. The model is based on the assumption that movable genetic elements may play a hitherto-unsuspected role in the early stages of stem cell differentiation. It provides a simple explanation for the apparent close association between loss of potential for stem cell renewal and commitment. The possibility that analogous movable genetic elements may be involved in both the development of neoplastic cells and the differentiation of normal cells is also discussed. The need for caution in interpreting evidence for apparent differences in the genetic material of normal and neoplastic cells is stressed.","['Till, J E']",['Till JE'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol Suppl,Journal of cellular physiology.

C57BL/6 (B6) (Fv-2rr) mice have been found to differ from B6.S (Fv-2ss) mice not only in their response to this virus but also in the proliferative state of their erythropoietic progenitor cells BFU-E: in B6 mice the majority of BFU-E are normally quiescent, while in B6.S mice approximately 50% are actively synthesizing DNA at any time. We have shown that B6 but not B6.S marrow contains a macromolecule that negatively regulates DNA synthesis specifically of BFU-E in vitro. Evidence is presented that this macromolecule is a physiological negative regulator active in vivo in B6 mice. A new liquid culture system is described in which FV and erythropoietin (epo) act synergistically on Ficoll-Isopaque separated bone marrow cells to give rise after 7 days to large numbers of CFU-E detectable in 2-day plasma cultures with and without epo. Inclusion of concentrated B6 but not B6.S bone marrow supernatant in liquid cultures drastically curtailed the amplification of CFU-E by FV and epo. These studies indicate that both DNA synthesis and the BFU-E stage of differentiation are necessary conditions for initiating the effects of polycythemia-inducing FV.

It has become increasingly important therefore to develop treatment regimens for curable All that are effective for disease control but carry minimal risks of late detrimental consequences. For other children current therapy is still inadequate and treatment failure occurs. For these children current altered treatment strategy must be developed that includes intensification of some treatment components, since improved methods of disease control are the primary consideration. In this paper the clinical and laboratory methods by which risk groups can be defined at diagnosis have been described. We have increasingly effective means by which the expected treatment outcome with current therapy can be defined at diagnosis. This assignment to a specific risk group is important to provide children with ALL with the most appropriate therapy for their expected clinical response. These studies of clinical utility also pose biological questions concerning the relationship to such things as white blood count, leukemic cell karyotype, and initial proliferative activity to the likelihood of drug resistance emerging. During the coming decade there will no doubt be an increasing emphasis on a biological characterization of leukemic cell populations.

(1) Seven out of the 110 cases were karyotypically normal. (2) A variant Ph1 translocation was observed in three cases. In one case, the leukemic cells contained two reciprocal translocations, i.e., a t(3;9) (q21;q34) and a t(17;22)(q21;q11); therefore, a Ph1 chromosome was masked by a translocation of the deleted material from the 17q onto the band q11 of the long arm of a chromosome No. 22. In the second case, a variant Ph1 translocation involved chromosomes No. 9, 20, and 22, resulting in a karyotype interpreted as 46,XX,t(9q+;20q+;22q-); in this rearrangement, one of the segments, i.e., 9q31 or 9q33, seemed to be interstitially deleted and inserted into the interstitial region (q11) of a chromosome No. 20 and the 22q11 leads to qter was translocated onto the 9q. This is the first case in which chromosome No. 20 was involved in a variant Ph1 translocation. In the third case, the karyotype of leukemic cells was interpreted as 46,XX,t(5;9;22)(q13;q34;q11). (3) The frequency of Ph1-negative CML and that of Ph1-positive CML with various types of Ph1 translocation from 15 studies reported as series of 25 or more cases, including the present study, have been tabulated. The incidence of a variant Ph1 translocation was 4.1% (42/1027 cases of Ph1-positive CML); of the 42, 13 were of a simple type and 29 of a complex type. (4) In one case of the present study, a masked Ph1 by a translocation of material onto the short arm of the 22q- was observed in the blastic crisis but not in the chronic phase. From the present study and a review of the published cases, it appears that the incidence of such a ""masked"" Ph1, which cannot be detected by conventional Giemsa staining, is less than 0.6% in CML cases.

With three exceptions, all patients were in the blastic (CML) or the terminal phase. In 28 patients, the aberrant chromosome No. 17 arose by clonal evolution from the karyotype found at diagnosis or before the terminal phase. The abnormalities encountered were an isochromosome for the long arm, i(17q), (26 cases), translocations involving No. 17 (12 cases), trisomy 17 (three cases), and ring 17 (one case). In 35 patients, there was an unbalanced structural aberration of at least one of the No. 17 chromosomes. In every case (35/35), detailed analysis of the structurally abnormal No. 17 revealed loss of the distal part of the short arm (or possibly most of the short arm). Gain of the long arm (or at least its proximal part) was also common, but not invariably present (26/35).

The marrows of two cases had 8-21 translocations associated with an iso-X chromosome in the female patient and with 9q13- and a missing Y in the male patient. Usually, AML patients with a 8-21 translocation have been considered to have a good prognosis; however, our cases had rather short survival times. Therefore, the prognosis of AML with an 8-21 translocation but associated with other abnormalities is still not clear. Centromere spreading (CS), which was originally reported in marrow cells of megaloblastic anemia (B12 and folic acid deficiency), was detected in leukemic cells, disappeared during remission, and reappeared on relapse. These findings suggest that CS may be a new type of abnormality in AML. In two patients with atypical hypoplastic anemia and hemolytic anemia, chromosome abnormalities were detected at the anemic stage. One case with CS was associated with atypical hypoplastic anemia and developed AML after 1 year; the other with 48,XY,+i(1q),+3,/12 and -14 had hemolytic anemia and developed AMMoL 3 weeks later. Interestingly, identical clones were detected both before and after the clinical diagnosis of leukemia. These cases strongly support the concept that some chromosome abnormalities precede the clinical manifestations of leukemia. The present study also revealed that lymphocytes in ANLL respond poorly to PHA in the presence of high numbers of blasts but do respond well to mitogens during remission. Therefore, the response of lymphocytes to PHA may serve as one criterion for determining remission.","['Shiraishi, Y', 'Taguchi, H', 'Niiya, K', 'Shiomi, F', 'Kikukawa, K', 'Kubonishi, S', 'Ohmura, T', 'Hamawaki, M', 'Ueda, N']","['Shiraishi Y', 'Taguchi H', 'Niiya K', 'Shiomi F', 'Kikukawa K', 'Kubonishi S', 'Ohmura T', 'Hamawaki M', 'Ueda N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', 'Centromere', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Pokeweed Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Preleukemia/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(82)90037-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(82)90037-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1982 Feb;5(1):1-24. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(82)90037-1.,,,,,,,,

Structural analyses were performed by gas-liquid chromatography and by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids using glycosidases. We found that, in contrast to normal leukocytes and chronic leukemia cells which have only a single tetraosylceramide species, these acute myelomonoblastic leukemia cells have approximately equal amounts of both globo- and neolactotetraosylceramide. This is the first population of human leukocytes in which we found two families of neutral glycosphingolipids to be present. The ganglioside fraction was composed of appreciable quantities of both NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer (GM3, hematoside) and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer (sialoparagloboside).

Treatment with glycosidases or exposure of cells to tunicamycin failed to show any change in the molecular weight of the antigen when examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition, it failed to bind to lectin affinity columns of concanavalin A, lentil lectin or ricinus communis lectin. This is consistent with the absence of N-asparagine linked oligosaccharide chains on the antigen. Pulse-chase labelling of protein p24 shows a post-translational modification resulting in a molecular weight increase of approx. 500-1000. Alkaline treatment resulted in a decrease in molecular weight of approximately the same amount, suggesting that p24 contain some O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide. Protein p24 has a basic pI of 7.3 which is unchanged after neuraminidase treatment. Protein P24/Ba-2 cannot be labelled by either the lipophilic photoactivatable nitrene reagent, hexanoyldiiodo-N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)tyramine, or with [32P]phosphate. This suggests that the molecule is non-integral in nature and that it does not form an intimate association with the lipid matrix.

The promise of the project was not considered to merit a prospective, controlled, randomized multicenter study, and therefore a retrospective, non-controlled, non-randomized pilot study was elected. One antimetabolite-treated group (cytosine arabinoside and thioguanine) and two busulfan-treated patient groups were studied. One of the latter two groups received splenic irradiation in addition to busulfan. No statistically significant differences between the busulfan groups were found in the time to achieve remission, the length of the first, unmaintained remission, the frequency of blastic metamorphosis or the cost of treatment. The actuarial survival curves of all three groups were similar. The antimetabolite induction was well tolerated and led to a statistically significantly more rapid remission than busulfan. However, the remission was significantly shorter, and no significant difference in the frequency of blastic metamorphosis was found between the groups. The median cost (from diagnosis to death) of hospitalization, visits, treatment, and part of the loss of production was approximately 106 000 Sw. cr. in the busulfan + radiotherapy group, 116 000 in the busulfan group, and 178 000 in the antimetabolite group. It is suggested that a prospective, randomized, controlled study could confirm that the present antimetabolite induction may lead to a more rapid remission induction in CML without more side-effects. However, to prevent early relapse, antimetabolite induction should be combined with busulfan maintenance treatment.","['Ogier, C', 'Reizenstein, P']","['Ogier C', 'Reizenstein P']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Acta Med Scand,Acta medica Scandinavica,0370330,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/economics/radiotherapy', 'Radiography', 'Spleen/diagnostic imaging', 'Thioguanine/*therapeutic use']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.0954-6820.1981.tb09840.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Med Scand. 1981;210(5):409-13. doi: 10.1111/j.0954-6820.1981.tb09840.x.,,,,,,,,

Systemic heparinization markedly increased the depressive effect of uraemic plasma compared with controls.

All 12 E-rosette positive cases were strongly acid phosphatase (AcP)-positive, showing a homogeneous pattern of distinct granular AcP-activity in more than 85% of the lymphoblasts (median: 96%) significantly different from the median of 26% granulated blasts found in (non-T, non-B)-ALL cases. Counting blasts with granular AcP-activity proved to be both easier than using a scoring system for the AcP-reaction and more efficient in terms of discriminating ability between the subgroups. Significant clinical and haematological features characterizing the T- and AcP-positive cases included: (1) Predominance of young adult men, (2) presence of a mediastinal mass, (3) involvement of skin and serous membranes, (4) only slightly affected haemoglobin concentration at presentation, (5) difficulty in obtaining complete remission, (6) shorter duration of first complete remission and (7) shorter survival rate. It is confirmed that AcP-staining of lymphoblasts is an easy, reproducible and inexpensive method for identifying the T-cell variety of ALL.","['Boesen, A M', 'Ellegaard, J', 'Hokland, P', 'Lassen, L B']","['Boesen AM', 'Ellegaard J', 'Hokland P', 'Lassen LB']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,['EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)'],IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/*analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*classification/enzymology/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rosette Formation']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1981.tb00457.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1981 Aug;27(2):87-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1981.tb00457.x.,,,,,,,,

All mice segregating the Mov-3 locus activate virus and develop viremia and leukemia. The integrated provirus (i.e., Mov-3 locus) was molecularly cloned from Mov-3 liver DNA as a 16.8 kilobase long EcoRI fragment. Comparison of the cloned and genomic Mov-3 specific EcoRI fragment by restriction enzyme analysis showed no differences in the size of the fragments, indicating that no major sequence rearrangements occurred during cloning. The genomic and cloned Mov-3 DNAs were compared for methylation and infectivity. Analysis with Hha I showed that the genomic proviral and the flanking mouse sequences were methylated at cytosine residues, in contrast to the cloned Mov-3 locus. The cloned Mov-3 locus, however, was highly infectious in a transfection assay (1 x 10(-3) plaque-forming unit per viral genome) in contrast to the genomic Mov-3 DNA (less than 10(-7) per viral genome). Our results suggest that genes containing 5-methylcytosine are not expressed after transfection into susceptible cells and that removal of the methyl groups by molecular cloning in prokaryotes leads to expression generating infectious proviral DNA. If gene expression of transfected DNA is controlled by mechanisms that are relevant for gene expression in the animal, this suggests that DNA methylation may play a causative role in eukaryotic gene regulation.","['Harbers, K', 'Schnieke, A', 'Stuhlmann, H', 'Jahner, D', 'Jaenisch, R']","['Harbers K', 'Schnieke A', 'Stuhlmann H', 'Jahner D', 'Jaenisch R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/physiology', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/physiology', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.12.7609 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Dec;78(12):7609-13. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.12.7609.,,PMC349318,,,,,,

F-MuLV and SFFV were cloned in SC1 cells to give a cell line 643/22N, which released only F-MuLV and SC204, a nonproducer cell line carrying SFFV. On superinfection with specific helper viruses, SC204 yielded further cell lines, which released SFFV in conjunction with 1) Friend, 2) Moloney, or 3) Gross helper viruses. With the use of an in vitro colony formation assay to monitor erythropoiesis in the bone marrow of inbred DBA/2J mice infected with any of the virus preparations containing SFFV plus helper virus, the erythroid precursor cell population was found to become erythropoietin-independent and amplified; adult mice infected with any of the helper viruses alone did not develop any symptoms of Friend disease. Thus the biologic activity of the FV-P complex was unaffected by replacement of the F-MuLV with an unrelated helper virus (Moloney or Gross). These results indicated that the SFFV component of FV-P is responsible for modifying erythroid differentiation in adult mice.","['Fagg, B', 'Ostertag, W']","['Fagg B', 'Ostertag W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1982 Mar;68(3):457-60.,,,,,,,,

The L5178Y/MP subline proved to be highly resistant to both TG-Pt(II) and thioguanine; the resistance ratios to the two compounds were almost identical. The subline showed high resistance to selenoguanine, but the cross-resistance to SeG-Pt(II) was negligible. Whether the compounds exhibit the delayed cytotoxicity characteristic of purine antagonists was also investigated. Delayed cytotoxicity was demonstrated for TG-Pt(II) as well as for thioguanine and other purine antagonists but not for SeG-Pt(II) or cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II). Experiments on cross-resistance and delayed cytotoxicity showed differences in the cytotoxicities of TG-Pt(II) and SeG-Pt(II): TG-Pt(II) exerted its activity through its hydrolysis product thioguanine, whereas SeG-Pt(II) compound was cytotoxic itself.","['Kanzawa, F', 'Maeda, M', 'Sasaki, T', 'Hoshi, A', 'Kuretani, K']","['Kanzawa F', 'Maeda M', 'Sasaki T', 'Hoshi A', 'Kuretani K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '69203-91-4 (platinum thioguanine)', '73572-63-1 (selenoguanine platinum(II))', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Guanine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L5178/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Thioguanine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1982 Feb;68(2):287-91.,,,,,,,,

In uncomplicated deaths from L/S, weights of splanchnic lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus were greatest in females. The cell-mediated and humoral antibody responses of L/S-P were significantly poorer against 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and sheep red blood cells, poorer against skin homografts, but better against bovine serum albumin than those of healthy littermates.

Oxidative metabolism and enzyme content of whole cells and isolated mitochondria.,37-54,"Untreated or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)-treated Friend erythroleukaemia (EL) cells from 15- and 72-h-cultures were harvested and the mitochondria were isolated by homogenization and differential centrifugation. Aliquots of the original cell suspensions or the final mitochondrial suspensions were either fixed for electron microscopy, assayed for enzyme activities, or introduced into a 1-ml Clarke oxygen electrode chamber. Whole BrdUrd-treated cells exhibited notable morphological alterations (see accompanying paper) but no effect was observed on whole-cell respiration. Morphologically, isolated mitochondria exhibited a highly condensed matrix and a greatly expanded outer compartment. Functionally, these mitochondria oxidized a variety of substrates at high state-3 (ADP-stimulated) rates (60-210 ng atoms O/min per mg protein) and displayed adequate respiratory control and ADP/O ratios. In the mitochondria isolated from BrdUrd-treated EL cells (both 15- and 72-h cultures), the state-3 oxygen consumption rates, respiratory control ratios, and ADP/O ratios generally decreased compared to their matched controls. These functional deficiencies coincided with in situ increases in the volume of the mitochondrial compartment and conspicuous (30-100%) increases in the specific and total activities of several mitochondrial enzymes. In addition, the mitochondria isolated from the 72-h group (treated and untreated) displayed immediate alterations when BrdUrd was added to the electrode chamber.

The patient had shown symptoms of progressive cerebral damage subsequent to a second cycle of prophylactic high-dose cytostatic therapy combined with cranial irradiation. Pathoanatomic examination revealed extensive florid recurrency of meningosis and leukemic encephalosis with scalloped calcified necroses measuring up to 5 cm, in the medullar layer of brain and cerebellum. Located predominantly near the ventricular area, encapsulated necroses showed many fibrous vessels with thickened walls and stenosed or obstructed lumina. The cerebral cortex remained largely unaffected by tissue destruction. Besides methotrexate toxicity and the enhancing effect of irradiation the vascular involvement was interpreted as a particularly important factor. Formal pathogenesis is attributed to combined chemo- and radiotherapy in parallel to leukemic infiltration of vascular walls and partial obstruction of lumina by tumor emboli. Wall damage, severe fibrosis, and consecutive nutritional defects result in the destruction of cerebral tissue. The preferential occurrence of necroses in cortex-adjacent medullar layers is explained by the relatively poor blood supply of this border zone between meningeal and intracerebral tissue, no safe conclusion can be drawn pathoanatomically with regard to the actually fatal factor, whether it is the leukemic infiltration of vascular walls, the effect of cytostatic agents, or that of irradiation. The proposed multifactorial pathogenesis of cerebral calcification may be supported by computed tomography (CT) intra vitam.","['Muller, K M', 'Menne, R', 'Bachmann, K D', 'Grobe, H']","['Muller KM', 'Menne R', 'Bachmann KD', 'Grobe H']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Calcinosis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/*pathology/therapy', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Necrosis', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00410537 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1981;102(1):81-91. doi: 10.1007/BF00410537.,,,,,,,,

Untreated CML patients had a mean level of 732 micrograms NCA/l, poorly controlled patients 421 micrograms/l and well-controlled patients 160 mu/l. These values differ significantly from the mean of healthy persons, which was 71 micrograms NCA/l. The serum NCA levels were related to the number of maturing myeloid cells in blood, and to the clinical course in the chronic phase of CML. In blast crisis low values with a mean of 109 micrograms NCA/l was found. Patients with ANLL had a low mean level, 50 micrograms/l. Low levels of NCA could not be attributed to antibodies to NCA. NCA is a normal myeloid differentiation antigen. Despite this, its occurrence in serum in leukemic patients differs from normal.

The model system developed for this study affords an opportunity to follow these events in a conveniently short period. The flow microfluorometric analysis revealed that, with respect to DNA content, the quiescent nuclei exhibit distribution in G1, S and G2 phases, as do the nuclei of the control, exponentially growing cells. It was found further that the induction of quiescence arouses two waves of migration of preexisting cytoplasmic proteins toward the nucleus: an early one, during the transition to quiescence clearly showing density dependence, and a late one, in the established resting state. While the early-cycled proteins are undetectable in mass and once they have reached the nucleus have a short life time and, thus, could be considered as regulatory molecules, the late-cycled proteins accumulate within the nucleus and are associated most probably with structural reorganization of the resting nuclei; moreover, the late-cycled nonhistone proteins were found localized, at least partly, in the nuclear protein matrix structure. Control experiments confirmed that the early and late-cycled proteins have been synthesized in the cytoplasm in the proliferative state but are cycled intranuclearly only if the resting state has been induced. When finally the resting cells were stimulated to proliferate, the accumulated presynthesized and newly synthesized nonhistone proteins undergo a rapid degradation which suggests that the new cellular programme may require a complete elimination of the 'resting' nonhistone proteins.","['Yancheva, N', 'Djondjurov, L']","['Yancheva N', 'Djondjurov L']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1982.tb05787.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1982 Jan;121(2):309-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1982.tb05787.x.,,,,,,,,

Four of seven patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelocytic leukemia and two of four patients with previously untreated acute myelocytic leukemia achieved complete remission. Of five treatment failures, two patients had leukemia which was clearly resistant to high-dose ara-C, and three patients died of infections or hemorrhagic complications during periods of pancytopenia. Three patients with acute myelocytic leukemia in remission received high-dose ara-C as consolidation therapy following previous courses of intensive, multiagent consolidation chemotherapy. Two of these three patients had prolonged thrombocytopenia following high-dose ara-C. Five patients with refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia were treated. Three patients achieved partial remission, and two patients had drug-resistant disease. Complete or partial disappearance of measurable disease parameters was seen in three of three patients with refractory lymphoma. Response was seen in five of five patients with meningeal leukemia, including complete response in one patient with extensive meningeal infiltration. Toxicity of this regimen was generally moderate and limited to pancytopenia and mild nausea. Patients who had received prior multiagent consolidation chemotherapy appeared to be at greater risk for hematopoietic toxicity. Patients who had received prior cranial irradiation or intrathecal chemotherapy appeared to be at greater risk for neurological toxicity. Plasma levels of ara-C immediately after completion of the infusion were 17.96 +/- 8.02 (S.D.) and 35.0 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml for doses of 2 and 3 g/sq m, respectively. From 160 to 720 min following completion of the infusion, the plasma levels of drug were comparable to steady-state levels achieved with a continuous infusion of ara-C at 100 mg/sq m over 24 hr. A high degree of penetration into the central nervous system was demonstrated. High-dose ara-C has substantial activity against leukemic and lymphomatous cell populations, including cell populations resistant to conventional doses of the drug, and is an effective treatment modality for patients with these diseases. The high degree of penetration into the central nervous system suggests that this drug regimen may be useful as consolidation therapy for patients at high risk for central nervous system disease.","['Early, A P', 'Preisler, H D', 'Slocum, H', 'Rustum, Y M']","['Early AP', 'Preisler HD', 'Slocum H', 'Rustum YM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Brain/drug effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Eye/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Apr;42(4):1587-94.,,,"['CA 21071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 5834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

In an original cell line, THP-1-O, cultured again from -80 degrees cryopreservation, more than 80% of the cells adhered to the glass substrate with marked morphological change within 3 hr of TPA treatment. Adherent cells became flat and amoeboid in shape, and many microvilli and flaps of the cell surface disappeared. Well-developed Golgi apparatus, rough endoplasmic reticula, and a large amount of free ribosomes were seen in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, in THP-1-R cells cultured continuously without cryopreservation for 26 months, approximately 80% of the cells adhered to the substrate 48 hr after TPA treatment. Round and ovoid shapes were kept in THP-1-R cells treated with TPA. Surface Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G were present on more than 90% of THP-1-O and THP-1-R cells and were little affected by treatment with TPA. Sixty to 70% of the TPA-treated THP-1-O and THP-1-R cells were able to phagocytize yeasts and immunoglobulin G-coated sheep erythrocytes. Less than 20% of the untreated THP-1 cells were able to phagocytize yeasts and immunoglobulin G-coated sheep erythrocytes. In histochemical staining, alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase was enhanced after treatment with TPA. Lysozyme activity in culture supernatants was not affected by TPA treatment. When exposed to latex beads and TPA, increased 14CO2 production from [1-14C]glucose in THP-1-O cells was observed. These results indicate that, after treatment with TPA, human monocytic leukemia cells may be converted into mature cells with functions of macrophages.","['Tsuchiya, S', 'Kobayashi, Y', 'Goto, Y', 'Okumura, H', 'Nakae, S', 'Konno, T', 'Tada, K']","['Tsuchiya S', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Goto Y', 'Okumura H', 'Nakae S', 'Konno T', 'Tada K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phorbols)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Muramidase/analysis', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phorbols/*toxicity', 'Rosette Formation', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*toxicity']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Apr;42(4):1530-6.,,,,,,,,

The DNase activity present in the extracts was sensitive to inhibition by G-actin and was, therefore, presumed to be DNase I. When the MEL cells were induced to differentiate by culturing in the presence of 1.8% Me2SO for 3 or 4 days, the apparent activity of the DNA ligase decreased to approximately 12% of the value in untreated MEL cells. In contrast, the apparent DNase I activity of the extracts from Me2SO-treated cells increased over that in extracts from untreated cells by a factor of 2. The activity of acid phosphatase, a lysosomal enzyme, remained unchanged. When strain DR-10, a mutant of the MEL cells which does not undergo Me2SO-induced differentiation, was treated with Me2SO, the DNA ligase and DNase activities of extracts from these cells remained unchanged as compared to extracts from untreated DR-10 cells. Therefore, the marked increase in the level of DNA ligase activity appeared to be related to the process of differentiation in the Me2SO-treated MEL cells.","['Scher, B M', 'Scher, W', 'Robinson, A', 'Waxman, S']","['Scher BM', 'Scher W', 'Robinson A', 'Waxman S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Ligases)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (Polynucleotide Ligases)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Ligases/*analysis', 'Deoxyribonucleases/*analysis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Polynucleotide Ligases/*analysis']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Apr;42(4):1300-6.,,,"['AM 16690-06/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 244020-3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Since primitive hemopoietic cells can be stimulated to form colonies of identifiable progeny under appropriate conditions in vitro, it should in theory, be possible to obtain such information. However, hemopoietic colonies of human origin rarely contain more than 1000 cells, and in handling such small samples, cell loss has historically been a major problem. We now describe a method that has allowed from two up to more than 50 metaphases per colony to be obtained from most erythroid and granulopoietic colonies harvested individually from standard methylcellulose assay cultures. Of key importance is the selection of large but still immature colonies and the use of polylysine coated slides, which ensures recovery of 80 - 90% of the sample. The method yields reproducibly high quality metaphases suitable for analysis after G, Q, and fluorescent-reverse banding. Cytogenetic analysis of 58 colonies removed individually from cultures initiated with a mixture of male and female cells showed both male and female colonies to be present as expected. In all instances only one type of metaphase was ever found in a single colony. A procedure for measuring the incidence of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in the progeny of primitive hemopoietic progenitors has also been established.

The synthesis of beta- plus gamma-chains exceeded that of the alpha-chains. In contrast, physiologic hemoglobin F production occurring in newborn infants and increased hemoglobin F production due to rapidly regenerating erythropoiesis in hereditary spherocytosis and after acute erythroblastopenia are characterized by a well balanced globin chain synthesis. These studies indicate that in distinct cases of juvenile erythroleukemia the genuine reversion to fetal erythropoiesis may be associated not only with a depression of hemoglobin synthesis but also with an imbalanced globin chain synthesis. Unlike adult cases of erythroleukemia without reversion to fetal erythropoiesis the imbalance of globin chain synthesis seems to be a more generalized phenomenon in these cases of juvenile erythroleukemia which is not confined to a particular red cell population.","['Schroter, W', 'Gahr, M', 'Prindull, G', 'Jentsch, E']","['Schroter W', 'Gahr M', 'Prindull G', 'Jentsch E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00320681 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1982 Jan;44(1):7-13. doi: 10.1007/BF00320681.,,,,,,,,

Discontinuous albumin density gradient centrifugation and depletion of E-rosette-forming cells resulted in purified fractions of acute myeloid leukemia cells. From these fractions, growth of large leukemic colonies was obtained in the PHA-leukocyte feeder (PHA-LF) colony technique in 12 of 14 patients. The standard double agar layer techniques with a leukocyte feeder for granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells (GM-CFC) supported colony formation in only four cases. The PHA-LF leukemic colony-forming cells (CFC) were found to be of low buoyant density (always less than or equal to 1.062 g.ml-1) when compared to normal marrow GM-CFC (peak at 1.065 g.ml-1). The density profile of PHA-LF CFC paralleled the distribution of the nucleated cells in 8 cases, but in 4 patients, the cFC peak was found at a distinctly lower density; this suggested that a specific leukemic subpopulation had a colony-forming capacity. In three of the four patients with colony growth in the double layer agar technique, it was evident that these CFC had density properties different from those of PHA-LF CFC. These findings suggest that cells giving rise to large colonies in the PHA-LF and double layer agar assays represent distinct leukemic subpopulations.","['Swart, K', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Swart K', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/*pharmacology', 'Rosette Formation']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74420-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1982 Apr;59(4):816-21.,,,,,,,,

It is suggested that the assays measured distinct cellular stages of myeloid differentiation and the findings indicate that prior to diagnosis the neoplasm had evolved into subsets with progressive dedifferentiation. Differences of growth in vitro correlated with the different roles of these clones in the clinical history of the disease.

We tested the properties, together with clinical risk factors, as attributes contributing to the variation in remission induction and survival. As univariate parameters, self-renewal and Ara-C sensitivity contributed to remission induction, but only self-renewal was related to survival. In multivariate analysis, self-renewal, age and percentage blasts in the marrow contributed to outcome variation; drug sensitivities were not significant.

These compounds inhibited blast colony growth at very high concentrations (10(-6)-10(-4) M). In contrast, hydrocortisone (HC) had highly variable effects on blast colony growth. HL60 cells were resistant to HC at concentrations up to 10(-4) M but blast CFC showed a wide range of response. Some patients were resistant to HC at all concentrations treated, while others were inhibited by concentrations as low as 10(-8) M. The inhibitory effect of HC was also observed on 3H-TdR incorporation by stimulated peripheral blood blasts. Inhibition by HC was not blocked by progesterone, suggesting this effect was not mediated by specific hormone receptors. These data indicate differences in the response of blast cells in ANLL and normal progenitors to steroid hormones. Cells from patients with ANLL display variable inhibition by HC which is probably not mediated by specific receptors.","['Taetle, R', 'Guittard, J P']","['Taetle R', 'Guittard JP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Hormones)', '08J2K08A3Y (Dihydrotestosterone)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Dihydrotestosterone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Hormones/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'Testosterone/pharmacology']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1982.tb01915.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1982 Feb;50(2):247-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1982.tb01915.x.,,,['CA23100-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

The leukaemic cells in the microgranular APL cases were characterized by striking nuclear folding or lobulation; granulation was present in most of these cells but was less abundant and finer than in typical APL. In three microgranular APL cases a distinctive small leukaemic promyelocyte with unusual nuclear lobulation and deeply basophilic cytoplasm containing few or no visable granules was the predominant leukaemic cell. This small hyperbasophilic promyelocyte was also present as a minor population of cells in the other five microgranular APL case and in 28 of the 31 typical APL cases. Ultrastructurally the most abundant promyelocytes in microgranular APL had smaller and usually fewer granules than in typical APL; other characteristic ultrastructural features of APL were found with equal frequency. The median blood leucocyte count was significantly higher in microgranular APL, 83.0 x 10(9) x 10(9)/l, than in typical APL, 1.8 x 10(9)/l (P less than 0.01). The median duration of complete remission (CR) for microgranular APL, 6.5 months, was shorter than the 21 + month median CR for typical APL. The morphological characteristics of microgranular APL may mimic those of myelomonocytic leukaemia; however, the presence of cells with multiple Auer rods, large inclusions of Auer-like material and the small hyperbasophilic promyelocytes are important distinguishing features.

The action of busulphan on the in vivo kinetics of circulating progenitor cells (colony forming cells) was measured using an agar culture system which involved scoring of total colonies and clusters at 7 days and of granulocyte, monocyte and eosinophil colonies at 14 days. High dose busulphan was found to be effective in suppressing circulating granulocyte, monocyte and eosinophil progenitor cells. The effect of busulphan on progenitor cells was rapid and their levels fell by at least 85% within five days. By contrast, the white blood cells fell by only 9% and the platelets fell by 10% over this time. Subsequently, the white cell count and platelet count fell to near normal levels.

In view of comparable patient composition in both treatment groups, the favorable prognosis in BFM patients has to be related to the mode of induction therapy.","['Henze, G', 'Langermann, H J', 'Kaufmann, U', 'Ludwig, R', 'Schellong, G', 'Stollmann, B', 'Riehm, H']","['Henze G', 'Langermann HJ', 'Kaufmann U', 'Ludwig R', 'Schellong G', 'Stollmann B', 'Riehm H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*blood/complications', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Thymus Gland/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1981 Winter;3(4):369-76.,,,,,,,,

Five of these patients showed Auer rods in their myeloblasts, but met other criteria for RAEB. Median survival of the Auer rod-positive group was 14 months (range 2-27) from diagnosis with survival of 7 months after Auer rods were first observed. Median survival for the Auer rod-negative group was 12 months. Two patients developed overt acute leukemia, both from the Auer rod-negative group. The clinical course of Auer rod-positive RAEB, like that of Auer rod-negative RAEB, was one of progressive bone marrow failure complicated by infection, serious bleeding and the development of absolute transfusion requirement. These findings suggest that Auer rod-positive RAEB is a morphologic variant dysmyelopoietic syndrome that may pursue a similar clinical course to Auer rod-negative disease. Formulation of a separate treatment approach for those RAEB patients who possess Auer rods would appear ill advised.","['Weisdorf, D J', 'Oken, M M', 'Johnson, G J', 'Rydell, R E']","['Weisdorf DJ', 'Oken MM', 'Johnson GJ', 'Rydell RE']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*ultrastructure', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Preleukemia/diagnosis', 'Syndrome']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830110408 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1981 Dec;11(4):397-402. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830110408.,,,,,,,,

They are termed ""Colony forming Unit, CFUC"", and such cells are detectable in bone marrow and peripheral blood. Bone marrow cells from 15 control patients with regular myelopoiesis contained 86 +/- 46 CFUC/10(5) bone marrow cells and 23 +/- 14 CFUC/ml blood. In 10 patients with aplastic anemia, only 0-10, 5 CFUC/10(5) BM-cells were found and no CFUC were detectable in the peripheral blood. 17 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia showed a moderate elevation of bone marrow CFUC (X = 105), while the circulating CFUC were markedly elevated (105-42.000/ml). The circulating CFUC were closely correlated with the number of leukocytes (p less than 0,001). In 12 patients with primary osteomyelofibrosis, the number of circulating CFUC was also (raised (325-22.199/ml) and again, a correlation with the number of leukocytes was observed (p less than 0,05). As, on the other hand, there was no difference in the leukocyte count between the control group and patients with osteomyelosclerosis, the simultaneous assessment of circulating leukocytes and CFUC proves a diagnostic tool. Pancytopenia with a hypercellular bone marrow results from either neoplastic or metabolic alterations of haemopoiesis; in pancytopenia with neoplastic infiltration or transformation, the number of CFUC was lowered, whereas it was slightly elevated in pancytopenia due to metabolic alterations. In patients with acute leukaemia, only a minority of cells was capable of proliferation in vitro. The growth of leukaemic cells in culture, their prolonged survival along with the expression of functional properties may be clinically used for a more subtle classification of blast populations. The data on patients with acute leukaemia indicate, that basic mechanisms of normal blood cell regulation operate in leukaemic haemopoiesis as well.","['Hinterberger, W']",['Hinterberger W'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Austria,Acta Med Austriaca Suppl,Acta medica Austriaca.

All the effective inhibitors of heme synthesis decreased the incorporation of labelled leucine into protein in spleen erythroid cells. Hemin completely restored protein synthesis to the control levels in isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) and penicillamine treated erythroid cells. These two specific inhibitors of heme synthesis were used for the study of the effect of heme on globin mRNA synthesis. Newly synthesized [3H]-uridine labelled globin mRNA was isolated by hybridization to globin cDNA covalently bound to the cellulose column. INH and penicillamine inhibited [3H] uridine incorporation into globin mRNA. The addition of hemin to INH or penicillamine treated cells almost completely restored globin mRNA synthesis. Moreover, hemin alone slightly increased the incorporation of [3H] uridine into globin mRNA. Similar results were obtained in experiments with Friend erythroleukemia cells of the Fw line. These cells are deficient in ferrochelatase enzyme activity and heme synthesis is not significantly increased after induction of differentiation by chemical inducers. The cells induced by butyric acid were incubated for 2 h with or without 100 muM hemin. The incorporation of [3H] uridine into globin mRNA was measured. A 38% increase in globin mRNA synthesis was seen in cells incubated with hemin as compared with cells incubated without hemin. These results seem to indicate that heme affects transcription or processing of globin mRNA precursors. Heme inhibitors also reduce [3H] uridine incorporation into other poly(A)-containing RNA in erythroid spleen cells incubated in vitro. In agreement with these results hemin causes increase of synthesis of some other poly(A)-containing RNA in Friend cells described above.","['Fuchs, O', 'Hradilek, A', 'Borova, J', 'Neuwirt, J', 'Travnicek, M']","['Fuchs O', 'Hradilek A', 'Borova J', 'Neuwirt J', 'Travnicek M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Acta Biol Med Ger,Acta biologica et medica Germanica,0370276,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine)', 'V83O1VOZ8L (Isoniazid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Hemin/metabolism', 'Isoniazid/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Penicillamine/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Spleen/cytology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Biol Med Ger. 1981;40(7-8):915-25.,,,,,,,,

The results confirmed those first published by the authors in 1978 and led them to propose new measures aimed at reducing the toxicity of ACM. Depending on the dosage, complete or partial (more than 50%) remissions were obtained in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. In the 19 patients with acute lymphoid leukaemia, complete remission was observed in 2 and partial remission in 2. Among the 9 patients with non-hodgkin lymphoma, there was 3 complete and 1 partial remissions.

To examine the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro derivatives, a new synthesis of 17 was developed from 8-deaza-2,4-dichloro-6-methylpteridine. Treatment of the latter with aqueous base gave the corresponding pteridin-4(3H)-one, which was aminated with ammonia to give 8-deaza-6-methylpterin (9). Bromination of 9 gave mainly 8-deaza-6-(tribromomethyl)pterin, which on reaction with p-aminobenzoyl-L-glutamic acid resulted in the formation of the 9-oxo derivative of 17. In contrast, bromination of the 2-acetyl derivative of 9 gave mainly the corresponding 6-(bromomethyl)pterin, which was converted to 17 in 23% yield (from 9). Hydrogenation of 17 at atmospheric pressure and room temperature was unsuccessful either in a basic medium or formic acid. In trifluoroacetic acid, overreduction occurred to give a mixture containing 8-deaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-6-methylpterin and the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro derivative of 17. The latter was characterized by conversion to the methenyl analogue 21, which was also prepared by hydrogenation of the 10-formyl derivative of 17. Treatment of 21 with hydroxide gave 8-deaza-10-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid.

The carrier-mediated influx of araC into purified blasts from patients with AML, ALL, and acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) has been compared to that of normal lymphocytes and polymorphs. Blasts showed a larger mediated influx of araC than mature cells, since mean influxes for myeloblasts and lymphoblasts were 6- and 2.3-fold greater than polymorphs and lymphocytes, respectively. Also, the mean influx for myeloblasts was fourfold greater than the mean for lymphoblasts. The number of nucleoside transport sites was estimated for each cell type by measuring the equilibrium binding of [(3)H]nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), which inhibits nucleoside fluxes by binding with high affinity to specific sites on the transport mechanism. The mean binding site numbers for myeloblasts and lymphoblasts were 5- and 2.8-fold greater, respectively, than for the mature cells of the same maturation series. The mean number of NBMPR binding sites for myeloblasts was fourfold greater than for lymphoblasts. Patients with AUL were heterogeneous since blasts from some gave values within the myeloblastic range and others within the lymphoblastic range. The araC influx correlated closely with the number of NBMPR binding sites measured in the same cells on the same day. Transport parameters were measured on blasts from 15 patients with AML or AUL who were then treated with standard induction therapy containing araC. Eight patients entered complete remission, while seven failed therapy, among whom were the three patients with the lowest araC influx (<0.4 pmol/10(7) cells per min) and NBMPR binding (<3,000 sites/cell) for the treated group. In summary, myeloblasts have both higher araC transport rates and more nucleoside transport sites than lymphoblasts and this factor may contribute to the greater sensitivity of AML to this drug.

In blastic crisis the blast cells are peroxidase negative and do not possess cytoplasmic inclusions. Acute transformation occurs without any additional chromosome damage. The second, more common form is less severe because of longer chronic phase but it has a short and grave acute stage. The blast cells present definite signs of myeloid differentiation, they have basophilic or neutrophilic cytoplasmic granules and are peroxidase positive.

Small glycopeptides (M.W. 2500 to 3500), typical of most mammalian cells except erythrocytes, represented a minor component in these cells. The large glycopeptides were labeled efficiently with fucose, glucosamine, and galactose but only poorly with mannose. They were found not to be glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, or mucin-type glycopeptides and were not susceptible to exoglycosidases, but they were partially degraded by endo-beta-galactosidases. These characteristics are similar to those of the large glycopeptides synthesized by erythrocytes, by another human myeloid leukemia cell line (K562), and by human and murine teratocarcinoma cells. High-molecular-weight glycopeptides predominated on another human myeloid leukemia cell line KG1, but they were expressed at low levels on both a human monocytic leukemia cel line (THP-1) and a human T-lymphoblastoid cell line (Jurkat). When HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate into macrophage-like cells with phorbol esters, the proportion of large glycopeptides decreased, and the production of small glycopeptides predominated. This shift was observed within the first several hr after exposure to phorbol esters and was temporally related to the acquisition of adherent properties by the induced cells. In contrast, when HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate into granulocytes by dimethyl sulfoxide, hypoxanthine, or retinoic acid, they continued to synthesize glycopeptides similar to uninduced cells. Human peripheral blood granulocytes synthesized primarily large glycopeptides, whereas monocytes and lymphocytes synthesized mostly small glycopeptides. These results indicate that the synthesis of high-molecular-weight glycopeptides is a property of human myeloid leukemia cell lines and that it persists throughout myeloid differentiation.

Both the monoclonal antibody and ricin A chain retained their original biological activity after conjugation. The ricin A chain portion of this conjugate effectively inhibited protein synthesis in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Its antibody-combining site attached to the membrane of CALLA-bearing cells, whereupon both components of the molecule, antibody and A chain, could be detected using fluorescein-labeled antibody probes directed against either mouse F(ab')2 or ricin A chain. This conjugate proved to be a potent cytotoxin for CALLA-positive Nalm-1 cells growing in vitro and produced 50% inhibition of proliferation at levels of 2 x 10(-10) M. In contrast, CALLA-negative cell lines were unaffected until levels of conjugate approached 10(-6) M. When tested for cytotoxic action on Nalm-1 cells, the composite conjugate molecule was at least 2000 times more effective than J-5 antibody alone, ricin A chain alone, or a noncovalent mixture of these components. Cytotoxicity of the conjugate could be blocked completely by addition of antibodies specific for either mouse immunoglobulin or ricin A chain. Direct comparison of the in vitro cytotoxicity of CALLA-directed univalent Fab versus bivalent F(ab')2 carriers of ricin A chain revealed 70-fold greater efficacy for the latter conjugate. This differential could not be accounted for by differences in A chain activity or binding affinity for the cell membrane but appeared related to the ability of the multivalent agent to induce modulation and internalization of CALLA determinants. No overt toxic effects were noted when the F(ab')2-A chain conjugate was administered i.v. to rabbits at levels as high as 20 mg/kg single injection or 5 mg/kg for 5 days. The unique specificity characteristics and high potency of this cytotoxic conjugate indicate that it has significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of CALLA-bearing human leukemias and lymphomas.","['Raso, V', 'Ritz, J', 'Basala, M', 'Schlossman, S F']","['Raso V', 'Ritz J', 'Basala M', 'Schlossman SF']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Rabbits', 'Ricin/*immunology/metabolism']",1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Feb;42(2):457-64.,,,"['CA19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Reference intervals for these alarms were established using blood specimens from 15 healthy subjects. The system was tested using blood specimens from four patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 11 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). The UA was the best alarm overall, but for seven of the AML specimens the IA or the SA alarm was superior. The high peroxidase (HPX) and the remainder alarms were inferior to the other alarms.

Results, however, are not so satisfactory as i.v. administration of this enzyme, because the levels of L-asparagine do not fall for a sufficient length of time due to the antagonistic action of the L-asparagine-synthetase. To avoid the L-asparagine rebound we have utilized, by extracorporeal route, L-glutaminase together with L-asparaginase, in order to reduce L-asparagine and L-glutamine levels. We have therefore performed a series of experiments in vitro and in vivo either using L-asparaginase alone or together with L-glutaminase. Results show that, contrary to what happens when L-asparaginase is used alone, L-asparagine levels decrease and remain low even after 24 hours from the treatment, when L-glutaminase is added to the system.

The proliferative response to these stimulator cells was evaluated in both the total lymphocyte population and in subpopulations with different affinity receptors for sheep red blood cells (SRBC), on the second, fourth and sixth days of culture. No DNA synthesis was induced by the K562 cell line, while Bri8 cells induced a proliferative response greater than that observed against PBL. No differences in the DNA synthesis pattern were observed when NBMC and FLC were used as stimulators which was comparable with that for PBL. There was a correlation between the degree of activation of the culture and the changes in size of the responding SRBC binding cell population (ET+). A progressive increase with duration of the cultures in the number of SRBC high avidity cells (EH+) and a parallel contraction of the SRBC low avidity (EL+) and E- cell populations was generally observed, so that EH+ and ET+ fractions gave similar values at the later time points.

High levels of TdT activity are associated with a clinical response to remission inducing therapy with vincristine and prednisone in a high proportion of patients (50%-90%), irrespective of clinical and morphologic diagnosis.

In this model we postulate two kinds of chromosomal changes: (1) primary, active changes caused by direct interaction between the oncogenic agent and the hereditary material of the host cell. These changes are mainly somatic mutations, but may also be associated with directed structural changes visible in the microscope; and (2) secondary, passive changes arising randomly by nondisjunction and structural rearrangements. They are followed by selection of cells with changes that amplify the primary change and thus appear as nonrandom chromosome patterns. This hypothesis is discussed in the light of 1827 cases of human malignancy in which we have recently surveyed and systematized chromosomal aberrations. Special support for the idea of somatic mutations as the initiator of malignant development comes from work of Knudson and collaborators in human retinoblastoma. The Ph1 chromosome, predominant during the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), is proposed as an instance of a primary change, whereas the chromosome changes during the blastic crisis of CML will illustrate the secondary changes. The most common of these secondary changes is actually the doubling of the Ph1 and thus an amplification of the primary change. The increase in number of copies of a specific chromosome reported by Green and collaborators demonstrates that this kind of amplification can result in direct response to the need for a specific gene located in that chromosome.","['Levan, G', 'Mitelman, F']","['Levan G', 'Mitelman F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Haematol Blood Transfus,Haematology and blood transfusion,101169459,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-67984-1_26 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematol Blood Transfus. 1981;26:160-6. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-67984-1_26.,,,,,,,,

The fact that human myeloid cells of the HL-60 line can be made to differentiate in vitro into macrophage-like cells by 12-O-tetradodecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) prompted us to investigate the generation and release of PAF during this transformation. Both passive release of PAF at pH 9.5, and active release, following phagocytosis of C3b- and C3d-opsonized yeast spores, and stimulation with C5a anaphylatoxin from untreated and TPA-treated HL-60 cells, PMN, and plastic-adherent normal human monocytes were studied.

Inhibition of PAF release by a selective inhibitor of phospholipase A2 and labeling of PAF with sodium 14C-acetate indicated that PAF generation is a two-step process: (1) release of PAF precursor from cell membranes and (2) its acetylation.

Hemin had no effect on iron uptake into noninduced cells. After the induction by DMSO, hemin inhibited iron uptake into Friend cells and this effect of hemin became more pronounced with the further progress of differentiation. The reduction of cellular iron accumulation was caused mainly by inhibition of iron incorporation into heme, iron uptake into the non-heme pool was little influenced by hemin treatment. Inhibition of heme synthesis by isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) caused an accumulation of iron in mitochondria in DMSO-induced cells, but not in uninduced cells. On the basis of these results, a specific system transporting iron to mitochondria induced by DMSO treatment is suggested as a target for the inhibitory action of hemin. In Friend cells of the Fw line which are deficient in ferrochelatase, heme has no effect on iron uptake.

An experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that membrane filter techniques are sufficiently sensitive to detect blasts in CSF contaminated by amounts of leukemic blood too small to be detected visually. Blood from a leukemic patient with 130,000 cells/cu mm was serially diluted in CSF from 1:20 to 1:1,600,000 and membrane filters from each dilution were examined.

The majority of these tumor-specific DNA sequences could be reassociated with unique-copy DNA from both normal and malignant cells and were not expressed in normal lymphoid cells, including those of an established strain immortalized by Epstein--Barr virus and multiplied in culture. It is concluded that a great number of new transcription units, in the range of 2500-3000 per cell genome, were activated after spontaneous malignant transformation of lymphoid cells.","['Hanania, N', 'Shaool, D', 'Poncy, C', 'Harel, J']","['Hanania N', 'Shaool D', 'Poncy C', 'Harel J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Cytoplasm/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.10.6504 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Oct;78(10):6504-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.10.6504.,,PMC349068,,,,,,

Of 51 clones, 3 were selected for further study. Ten-fold more natural killer (NK) effector cells were required to lyse YAC clone 6 and subclone 6-28 cells compared with clone 19 cells or the YAC parent cell line. The maximum plateau level of cytolysis of the NK-resistant (NKR) variants (20%) never approached that of the NK-sensitive (NKS) variants or YAC parental cells (60%) even after prolonged incubation (20 hr). NKR variants appeared with equal frequency (0.10) on cloning YAC cells that had not been treated with mutagen but these variants were highly unstable with respect to NK sensitivity and were not studied further. Cytolysis of both NKR and NKS lines was mediated by nylon-nonadherent asialo-GM1+ effector cells, and effectors from poly(I) . poly(C)-boosted mice preferentially lysed the NKS lines. The NKR alteration did not appear to change the NK target structure (NK-TS): (i) unlabeled NKR cells competed equally with NKS cells in reciprocal unlabeled-target competition assays; (ii) the frequency of target--effector conjugates was identical with NKR or NKS lines; and (iii) normal rabbit serum, which contains antibodies thought to react with the NK-TS, reacted equally against both NKR and NKS targets. The NKR alteration was selective for NK cells and did not result in a resistance to lysis in general; NKR and NKS variants were equally susceptible to (i) cytolysis mediated by alloimmune or lectin-dependent effector T cells and (ii) antibody- and complement-mediated lysis. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the NKR variants have an altered acceptor site on the target cell membrane that normally binds the ""lytic moiety"" delivered by the effector cell.","['Roder, J C', 'Beaumont, T J', 'Kerbel, R S', 'Haliotis, T', 'Kozbor, D']","['Roder JC', 'Beaumont TJ', 'Kerbel RS', 'Haliotis T', 'Kozbor D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Genetic Variation', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutation']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.10.6396 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Oct;78(10):6396-400. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.10.6396.,,PMC349046,,,,,,

Cell lines representing early stages of differentiation and maturation such as KG1a, KG1 and those representing later stages such as ML-1-3 and HL-60 were found to express discretely different sets of cell surface glycoproteins. The proteins (such as Gp130) present on mature granulocytes appear only in cell lines representing later stages of maturation. The quantity and structure of the carbohydrate chains susceptible to endo-beta-galactosidase (""lactosaminoglycan"") are also significantly different among cell lines. A small quantity of essentially unbranched lactosaminoglycan is present on KG1a and KG1 cells, whereas a significant quantity of branched lactosaminoglycan is present on the more mature ML-1-3 and HL-60 cells. The process of myeloid maturation from promyeloblast to granulocyte is accompanied by the disappearance of the 105- and 95-kilodalton glycoproteins, the appearance of Gp130, and a great increase in the quantity and branching structure of lactosaminoglycan.

This study expands the base of information on the potential of these in vitro transformation systems, and the lack of responses with some of the chemicals underscores the need for incorporation of exogenous metabolic activating systems into these assay systems.","['Dunkel, V C', 'Pienta, R J', 'Sivak, A', 'Traul, K A']","['Dunkel VC', 'Pienta RJ', 'Sivak A', 'Traul KA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Carcinogens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology', 'Mesocricetus', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rauscher Virus']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Dec;67(6):1303-12.,,,,,,,,

Then it was tested for its ability to discriminate between L428 cells, Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells, and various other cells. It was found that the anti L428 cell serum absorbed with tonsil cells plus acute myeloid leukemia cells stained only L428 cells, Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells, and neutrophils. The anti L428 cell serum absorbed with tonsil cell plus neutrophils, monocytes, and blood lymphocytes reacted with L428 cells and Hodgkin and sternberg-Reed cells from 13 cases of Hodgkin's disease. It did not react with any other cell type present in the blood or in lymphoid tissue or with cells from five cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The absorbed anti-L428 cell serum also failed to stain Daudi and HRIK cell line cells. We conclude that the anti-L428 cell serum defines an antigen that is apparently restricted in expression to L428 cells and Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells.

It also stimulated the synthesis and release of prostaglandins such as prostaglandin F2alpha, E2, and D2 by the cells. The particulate fraction of retinoic acid-treated M1 cells converted arachidonate to prostaglandins, and this conversion was almost completely inhibited by indomethacin. Retinol, retinal and retinyl acetate, but not the pyridyl analog of retinoic acid, also induced lysozyme activity and stimulated synthesis and release of prostaglandins. Indomethacin inhibited the induction of lysozyme activity by retinoic acid. The induction of lysozyme activity and the stimulation of prostaglandin E2 production were dependent on the concentration of retinoic acid. Kinetic studies showed that stimulation of prostaglandin E2 production by retinoic acid was followed by induction of lysozyme activity. The tumor promotor 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and phorbol 12,13-didecanoate inhibited the induction of lysozyme activity by retinoic acid, but 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate and phorbol did not. TPA and phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate, but not 4 alpha -phorbol didecanoate, also inhibited the stimulation of prostaglandin E2 production by retinoic acid. These results suggest that stimulation by retinoic acid of prostaglandin E2 production in M1 cells is a prerequisite for the induction of lysozyme activity.

The level of alpha-mannosidase activity was much higher in myelo(mono)genous leukemias (AML, AMoL, AMMoL, CML and CMMoL) than in lymphogenous ones (ALL, T-cell leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and CLL) without exception. The beta-galactosidase activity also differed as a result of alpha-mannosidase, except in T-cell leukemia. In T-cell leukemia it was within the range of normal lymphocytes, but in the other lymphogenous leukemias it was significantly below normal. N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activity in myelo(mono)genous leukemic cells was above the range of normal granulocytes. The changes in these enzyme levels were consistent. The lymphocytic or myelocytic nature of three cases of acute undifferentiated leukemia could be determined by enzyme studies. In two cases it was lymphocytic and in one it was myelocytic. The enzymatic abnormalities were also found in morphologically mature neutrophils from patients but not only chronic types (CML, CMMoL) but also acute types (AMoL, AMMoL) of leukemias, and were similar to those of their respective leukemic cells.

This nonmetabolizable analog is concentrated in these cells by utilizing the energy of the Na+ electrochemical gradient. The effect of TPA is to increase the ouabain-sensitive component of uptake of AIB (and of the K+ analog 86Rb+). Transport changes are not observed until 30 min after application of the promoter and reach a maximum in about 6 hr. The effects are blocked by cycloheximide. The flux results are consistent with a model in which the membrane potential is increased and, with it, the driving force on the coupled Na+-AIB movement. The effect is possibly mediated by a change in electrogenicity of the Na:K pump. TPA raises the steady-state accumulation levels of AIB. By altering external K+ in the presence of valinomycin, the membrane potential may be adjusted and, with it, the accumulation of AIB. Over a wide range of membrane potentials, TPA-treated cells accumulate more AIB than do controls, suggesting a possible change in the internal Na+ activity.","['Becker, J H', 'Cook, J S']","['Becker JH', 'Cook JS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Aminoisobutyric Acids)', '0 (Phorbols)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Aminoisobutyric Acids/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Clone Cells', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Nov;41(11 Pt 1):4512-7.,,,['CA 09336/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

Differing effects of hemin and inhibitors of cell division were observed in the absence of irreversible differentiation and suggest different molecular mechanisms controlling globin gene expression.","['Erard, F', 'Dean, A', 'Schechter, A N']","['Erard F', 'Dean A', 'Schechter AN']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Glutamine/pharmacology', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*blood', 'Time Factors']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84754-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Dec;58(6):1236-9.,,,,,,,,

Among these, 24 patients were found to have similar chromosome alterations that appeared to involve specifically chromosomes 8 and 21. Banding studies on at least 7 of these patients confirmed the presence of a translocation between these two chromosomes. Of 160 ANLL patients, 142 were scored for neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (neutrophil AP) at the time of diagnosis. Fifty-nine patients showed a low neutrophil AP score, 42 a normal value, and 41 a high value. All patients with 8;21 (or C/G) translocation had a low neutrophil AP score and leukemic cells with maturation (M2 of FAB classification) in the bone marrow. In vitro liquid culture for 2 wk of 8;21 translocated leukemic cells revealed no increase of neutrophil AP activity nor increase of mature granulocytes, whereas 9;22 translocated chronic myelocytic leukemia cells with a low neutrophil AP score did so. Neutrophil AP score at the time of diagnosis in acute myelocytic leukemia is very useful for detecting 8;21 translocation AML and for studying the pathophysiology and genetic alterations of the characteristic subgroup of AML with 8'21 translocation.","['Kamada, N', 'Dohy, H', 'Okada, K', 'Oguma, N', 'Kuramoto, A', 'Tanaka, K', 'Uchino, H']","['Kamada N', 'Dohy H', 'Okada K', 'Oguma N', 'Kuramoto A', 'Tanaka K', 'Uchino H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations/blood/enzymology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Cytogenetics', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84749-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Dec;58(6):1213-7.,,,,,,,,

To determine the effect of recent or concurrent glucocorticoid therapy on the number of measured tumor glucocorticoid receptor sites, 18 patients with leukemia and lymphoma were studied. Baseline determinations of numbers of glucocorticoid receptors were performed on the malignant cells circulating in the patients' peripheral blood. Glucocorticoid therapy was then instituted consisting of dexamethasone 4 mg p.o. every 6 hr. Repeat determinations of the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites were performed within 24 hr and at various subsequent times from the start of therapy. When compared to baseline receptor numbers, 16 of 18 patients demonstrated a decrease in receptor number (median decrease 1651 sites/cell) after the start of glucocorticoid therapy. The magnitude of the change in receptor number was independent on the initial number of receptors.

Levels of constitutive and dibenzanthracene-induced AHH activity were found to be similar among the three groups by analysis of variance.

Agglutination of erythroleukemia cells was produced by wheat germ agglutinin; whereas, concanavalin A, Ricin, soybean agglutinin and fucose-binding protein were either ineffective or much less efficacious. Treatment of leukemia cells with the inducer of erythroid differentiation dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) caused a progressive accumulation of hemoglobin-containing cells in culture and a decrease in the rate of agglutination by wheat germ agglutinin, which began at 24 h after exposure to the polar solvent, reached a nadir at 48 h, and remained essentially constant thereafter. The binding of radioactive wheat germ agglutinin by untreated control erythroleukemia cells increased with time in culture, reaching a maximum value at 48 h, and decreased progressively thereafter. Although an increase in 3H-labeled wheat germ agglutinin binding also occurred in DMSO-treated cells, the level bound was significantly lower than that observed in control cells at 24-96 h. The treatment of erythroleukemia cells with various concentrations of DMSO resulted in a decrease in the number of wheat germ agglutinin receptor sites. Other inducers of differentiation (i.e., dimethylformamide, bis(acetyl)diaminopentane) also inhibited the rate of wheat germ agglutinin-induced agglutination of erythroleukemia cells while, in contrast, the inducer tetramethylurea did not. These studies indicate that membrane changes occur during differentiation and suggest that there may be more than one mechanism involved in the initiation of maturation which ultimately leads to the common pathway of erythroid development.","['Sartorelli, A C']",['Sartorelli AC'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Wheat Germ Agglutinins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythrocyte Aggregation/drug effects', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*physiology', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology/*physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Kinetics', 'Lectins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Wheat Germ Agglutinins']",1981/11/20 00:00,1981/11/20 00:01,['1981/11/20 00:00'],"['1981/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(81)90014-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(81)90014-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1981 Nov 20;649(1):105-12. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(81)90014-6.,,,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

(1) Continuous labelling with [3H]dU was used to compare incorporation of label into DNA with the specific radioactivities of thymine nucleotides separated by paper chromatography. (2) Cells were also labelled with [3H]dU at 13 degrees C, and 'chased' in unlabelled medium at 37 degrees C in order to quantify the proportion of thymine nucleotides incorporated into DNA and the proportion degraded. Only 40% of labelled thymine nucleotides were incorporated into lymphocyte DNA during a 'chase', whereas 100% were incorporated by MOLT 4 cells (a lymphoblastoid cell line of thymic origin, Thy-ALL line). Unincorporated nucleotides were rapidly degraded in lymphocytes, but degradative activity was very low in MOLT 4 cells. The results described here reinforce our previous conclusions [Taheri, Wickremasinghe & Hoffbrand (1981) Biochem. J. 194, 451-461] that there is a single thymine nucleotide compartment in Thy-ALL cells, but at least two pools in lymphocytes and bone-marrow cells. This compartmentation of nucleotides in human cells is consistent with a model which proposes that deoxyribonucleotides are localized near replication forks by the activity of multienzyme complexes [Mathews, North & Reddy (1978) Adv. Enz. Regul. 17, 133-156]. Our results also suggest that thymine nucleotides derived by the 'de novo' mechanism may be more highly localized than those derived by salvage. In cells from patients with megaloblastic anaemia owing to deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate or in normal cells treated with methotrexate, there was a massive accumulation of labelled dUMP and decreased incorporation of label into DNA. There was no measurable incorporation of labelled deoxyuridine residues into DNA of megaloblastic cells, but deoxyuridine residues were detected in DNA of cells treated with methotrexate.","['Taheri, M R', 'Wickremasinghe, R G', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Taheri MR', 'Wickremasinghe RG', 'Hoffbrand AV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythrocytes, Abnormal/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Megaloblasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Thymine Nucleotides/*biosynthesis']",1981/04/15 00:00,1981/04/15 00:01,['1981/04/15 00:00'],"['1981/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj1960225 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1981 Apr 15;196(1):225-35. doi: 10.1042/bj1960225.,,PMC1162986,,,,,,

(2) Cellular thymine nucleotides were labelled with [3H]thymidine at 13 degrees C, followed by incubation at 37 degrees C in unlabelled medium. Incorporation of label into DNA and loss of label from the nucleotide pools were monitored during the 'chase' period at 37 degrees C. (3) The experiments described in (2) above were repeated in the presence of the DNA-synthesis inhibitor cytosine arabinoside, in order to demonstrate more clearly and to quantify degradative pathways for thymine nucleotides. In phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes and in bone-marrow cells, only a proportion (25-60%) of labelled thymine nucleotide was incorporated into DNA, the rest being rapidly degraded and lost from the cell. In contrast, an established cell line (HPB-ALL) from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia of thymic origin incorporated 100% of its exogenously labelled thymine nucleotides into DNA. These results indicated that alternative metabolic routes are open to thymine nucleotides in human cells. In lymphocytes from patients with megaloblastic anaemia and in normal lymphocytes treated with methotrexate, the utilization of labelled thymine nucleotides for DNA synthesis was more efficient than in controls. These results offer an explanation for the observation of a normal pool of thymidine triphosphate in the cells of patients with untreated megaloblastic anaemia even though the amount of this compound available for DNA synthesis appears to be decreased.","['Taheri, M R', 'Wickremasinghe, R G', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Taheri MR', 'Wickremasinghe RG', 'Hoffbrand AV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Anemia, Megaloblastic/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Thymine Nucleotides/*metabolism']",1981/02/15 00:00,1981/02/15 00:01,['1981/02/15 00:00'],"['1981/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj1940451 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1981 Feb 15;194(2):451-61. doi: 10.1042/bj1940451.,,PMC1162768,,,,,,

In leukaemic leucocytes cultivated in vitro in the time period of 34 h in the rate of protein synthesis in homocysteine--containing medium was similar to the rate of protein synthesis in the medium devoid of methionine.,"['Tautt, J', 'Maj, S', 'Chlopkiewicz, B', 'Koziorowska, J']","['Tautt J', 'Maj S', 'Chlopkiewicz B', 'Koziorowska J']",['pol'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Acta Haematol Pol,Acta haematologica Polonica,0262610,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Culture Media', 'Homocysteine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Methionine/*administration & dosage']",1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Haematol Pol. 1981 Apr-Jun;12(2):69-75.,Wplyw braku metioniny egzogennej na synteze bialka w prawidlowych i bialaczkowych krwinkach bialych w hodowli in vitro.,,,,,,,

The infected cells exhibited a normal morphology at the nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C) and a transformed morphology at the permissive temperature (33 degrees C). A new viral protein was detected 2 hr after shift to the permissive temperature as a polyprotein with an estimated Mr of 85,000 (p85). Scanning electron microscopy of the cells within 5 hr after shifting them to the permissive temperature showed that they became smaller and rounded with numerous elongated microvilli.

By 48 hr, the cells had the morphology of a fully transformed cell. Concomitant with the changes in the morphology were alterations in the cytoplasmic microtubule complex. At the nonpermissive temperature, the complex consisted of a lacy network of microtubules. Within 5 hr at the permissive temperature, the lacy network was still present but the microtubules were more diffusely stained and less discernible. By 48 hr, the microtubules were so diffuse that the lacy network could not be recognized.

Abnormal findings on physical examination were diffuse shotty lymphadenopathy without hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of the extremities was normal. There was no evidence of increased bruising or bleeding. Laboratory data revealed a hemoglobin of 11.2 gm/dl, white blood cell count of 26,200/cu mm, and platelet count of 21,000/cu mm. Serum uric acid level was 4.2 mg/dl. The remainder of the laboratory findings were within normal limits. Bone marrow examination revealed a hypercellular marrow replaced with lymphoblasts. Immunologic evaluation showed these cells to have no surface immunoglobin and no rosette formation with sheep red blood cells. The patient received vincristine 1.5 mg/M2 daily, oral prednisone at 40 mg/M2 daily, L-asparaginase 6,000 IU/M2 for nine intramuscular doses, and methotrexate 12 mg intrathecally. After 28 days, bone marrow aspiration showed that the leukemia was in remission. He then received 2,400 rad cranial irradiation over three weeks, along with four more doses of intrathecal methotrexate, given once weekly. Maintenance consisted of monthly pulses of vincristine (1.5 mg/M2), prednisone (40 mg/M2 for five days), daily oral 6-mercaptopurine (75 mg/M2), and weekly oral methotrexate (20 mg/M2). After six months of maintenance, the patient was given a scheduled course of reinduction therapy with vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase. Eleven months after diagnosis both testes were noted to be enlarged on physical examination. Wedge biopsy of both testes revealed leukemic infiltration. Examination of the bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at that time were unremarkable. The patient was treated with vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase again for four weeks and received intrathecal methotrexate as central-nervous-system (CNS) prophylaxis. Twenty-four hundred rad were given to both testes at 200 rad/day with decrease in testicular size. Maintenance consisted of monthly pulses of vincristine and prednisone with oral methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. Seven months after his testicular relapse the patient had a bone marrow relapse. He expired eight months later with disseminated leukemia.","['Byrd, R L']",['Byrd RL'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', '*Testicular Neoplasms/therapy']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950090513 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1981;9(5):493-500. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950090513.,,,"['CA-11796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19372/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Once the initial blast crisis had occurred, two genetically different leukemic clones of cells, one presumably having arisen from the other, coexisted throughout the remainder of the patient's course. The initial clone comprised differentiating myeloid cells, while the second clone appeared on morphologic and cytochemical grounds to be lymphoid and blastic. A dynamic equilibrium existed between these two populations of cells, with the balance altered by chemotherapy and/or other selective pressures. The leukemic progression demonstrated in this case is consistent with the concept of clonal evolution of malignant cell populations.

Our results showed that cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) had less than half the amount of neutral glycolipid per cell than did cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Chromatographic mapping of the neutral glycolipids from these cells showed that AML cells had less of the polar, long-chain neutral glycolipids than did CML cells. The studies confirmed that over 99% of the neutral glycolipids were contained in a population of compounds with 1, 2, 3, and 4 sugar-containing neutral glycolipids whose structures are: Glc 1 --> 1 ceramide; Gal 1 --> 1 ceramide; Gal 1 --> 4 Glc 1 --> 1 ceramide; Gal 1 --> 4 Gal 1 --> 1 ceramide; GlcNAc 1 --> 3 Gal 1 --> 4 Glc 1 --> 1 ceramide; and Gal 1 --> 4 GlcNAc 1 --> 3 Gal 1 --> 4 Glc 1 --> 1 ceramide. Lactosyl ceramide was the major glycolipid in both AML and CML cells. The studies show that human myeloid leukemia cells have the same neutral glycolipids as normal neutrophils. The alterations in neutral glycolipid distribution in leukemia suggest that they might be useful as ""differentiation markers"", with the morphologically more ""mature"" leukemias having more complex glycolipids. We were unable to detect novel or ""malignancy-associated"" neutral glycolipids in any of the leukemias we studied.-Klock, J. C., J. L. D'Angona, and B. A. Macher.

The Ki for dC was similar to values found with partially purified deoxycytidine kinase. The change in Ara-CTP concentration was associated with a proportional reduction in inhibition of DNA synthesis. dC decreased the effects of Ara-C by inhibition of Ara-CTP production, rather than by production of dCTP and competition with Ara-CTP.

It was found that the inhibition of DNA synthesis by doxorubicin compared well with results obtained with in vivo assays for the determination of clonogenic hematopoietic (CFU-S) and leukemic (LCFU-S) cells. It was found that doxorubicin at concentrations ranging from 0.1--1.0 mu g . 10(-7) cells inhibits DNA synthesis of leukemic cells to 60% and that of hematopoietic cells to 90%. Higher doxorubicin concentrations further inhibit DNA synthesis of only hematopoietic cells. These results were confirmed with clonogenic assays.

Five of the six patients who died had experienced a delay of greater than 48 hours from diagnosis to referral, and only one of the 12 patients who survived was not promptly referred for treatment at the time of diagnosis (P = 0.004). A mathematical model, the logit of the fraction of the initial wbc count versus the logarithm of time after starting therapy, was used to describe the response of the wbc count to chemotherapy. This logit analysis reduced the data for individual patients to a linear function, permitting statistical description of the population as a whole.

To determine the utility of glucocorticoid receptor levels for predicting response to glucocorticoid therapy, lymphoblasts were studied for receptors on nine occasions, and the patients were then treated with dexamethasone as a single agent. Response to glucocorticoid therapy appeared to correlate with lymphoblast receptor level. Five of six patients with greater than 4,500 total receptor sites per cell responded; all three patients with less than 4,500 receptors failed to respond. Glucocorticoid receptor level did not correlate with response to combination chemotherapy, duration of remission, or survival. Glucocorticoid receptors were studied at the initial presentation and following relapse in five patients. In two patients, the receptor level did not change following therapy; both patients at diagnosis had leukemias resistant to glucocorticoids. Three patients at relapse developed leukemias with lower receptor levels; these patients had leukemias sensitive to glucocorticoids at diagnosis. Our data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor levels of lymphoblasts may be useful in predicting response to glucocorticoid therapy in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

The patients developed monocytosis, usually with accompanying leukocytosis, at intervals ranging from 3.5 to 24 months after splenectomy. In all patients, there was a corresponding increase in the numbers of mature monocytes in the bone marrow. Survival times from the detection of monocytosis ranged from five to eight months. Of the 28 cases reported in the literature, only two were considered by the authors of this study to have the characteristics of chronic monocytic leukemia, and of these, only one had features identical to those reported in the present series. The remainder represent a variety of hematologic disorders including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, acute leukemia, histiomonocytic proliferations that cannot be sub-classified, and cases in which the data are insufficient for analysis. The differential diagnosis includes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, chronic malignant histiocytosis, and hairy cell leukemia. In chronic monocytic leukemia, in contrast to hairy cell leukemia, splenectomy does not appear to be beneficial.

In agreement with previous reports, an erythroid differentiation was observed. A minority of immature, but hemoglobinized erythroblasts were identified both by electron microscopy and by immunofluorescence using an antibody to gamma-globin chains. Embryonic and fetal hemoglobin (Hb) were synthesized. Hemin increased the number of erythroblasts as well as the absolute amount of Hb synthesized: the Hb pattern was also significantly modified. By cytochemical ultrastructural detection of peroxidase activity (PA), a weak PA, distinct from granulocytic peroxidases, was found exclusively in the nuclear envelope and rough endoplasmic reticulum in a small number proportion of cells. In its localization this PA resembled that of normal and leukemic promegakaryoblasts. The addition of sodium butyrate or dimethylformamide markedly increased the number of these cells (up to 30%) but did not modify their cytoplasmic maturation. No modification of Hb synthesis was observed. Cloning of the K 562 line revealed a marked heterogeneity from one clone to another in Hb production, in the phenotype of Hb synthesis, and in the inducibility by butyrate or dimethylformamide. An inverse relationship between the number of cells with PA and Hb production was found in the different clones. Recloning some of these primary clones resulted in secondary clones, which displayed properties similar to those from which they had originated. All attempts to obtain granulocytic differentiation by addition of different inducers failed.

Presenting features included hepatosplenomegaly (5/6), respiratory infections (4/6), pallor (2/6) and skin infections (1/6). Haematological features included a leucoerythroblastic anaemia with leucocytosis and thrombocytopenia, and a hyperplastic marrow with a slight excess of blasts. Fetal haemoglobin was normal in four patients and mildly raised in the other two. Neutrophil function tests showed defective chemotaxis with reduced killing, despite a normal NBT test. Cytogenetic analysis of the marrow showed a preponderance of cells with monosomy 7; the blood lymphocytes were cytogenetically normal. In three patients the disease progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) after 3 weeks to 23 months; the only patient who remitted did so in response to 6-mercaptopurine and prednisolone, but relapsed 16 months later. A fourth child developed massive splenomegaly which initially responded to 6-mercaptopurine and prednisolone, but progressed to myelofibrosis 11 months later. A fifth child died from anaemia and respiratory infection without progression to leukaemia and the sixth patient has not yet developed leukaemia. Monosomy 7 is the diagnostic criterion of one of the more common myeloproliferative states in childhood and carries a high risk of progression to AML. The acute phase is usually resistant to chemotherapy, but even in responsive cases treatment does not result in elimination of the abnormal clone. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation should be considered in cases with a suitable donor.","['Sieff, C A', 'Chessells, J M', 'Harvey, B A', 'Pickthall, V J', 'Lawler, S D']","['Sieff CA', 'Chessells JM', 'Harvey BA', 'Pickthall VJ', 'Lawler SD']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/diagnosis/*genetics']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb07220.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1981 Oct;49(2):235-49. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb07220.x.,,,,,,,,

These preparations have proved suitable for analysis by zone electrophoresis, using a specific stain to detect activity after separation. In a survey of succinate dehydrogenase from various tissues and different individuals, no evidence for genetic heterogeneity due to the expression of either multiple loci or alternative alleles at the succinate dehydrogenase locus was found. However, epigenetic heterogeneity in both molecular size and charge was seen and various explanations for the occurrence of the isoenzymes are explored. Estimates of molecular size (93,300 +/- 9100) suggest that the smallest active unit of succinate dehydrogenase accounts for the major part of the solubilized activity. Kinetic studies have shown that the apparent Km values for succinate (0.9 mM) and PMS (0.4 mM) are comparable to those previously described for the beef heart enzyme, and these parameters were not significantly altered when the enzyme was removed from the membrane milieu. However a marked non-succinate-dependent activation of the membrane-associated enzyme at 38 C is apparently lost on solubilization, and this observation may have some bearing on earlier reports of an apparent decrease in Vmax on solubilization of succinate dehydrogenase.","['Shaw, M A', 'Edwards, Y', 'Hopkinson, D A']","['Shaw MA', 'Edwards Y', 'Hopkinson DA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Genet,Biochemical genetics,0126611,['EC 1.3.99.1 (Succinate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Starch Gel', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Humans', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Myocardium/enzymology', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity', 'Succinate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Testis/enzymology', 'Tissue Distribution']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00484006 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Genet. 1981 Aug;19(7-8):741-56. doi: 10.1007/BF00484006.,,,,,,,,

Because the therapeutic agent is potentially leukemogenic, the possibility cannot be definitely excluded that the development of CML is not a mere coincidence.","['Wanders, J', 'Wattendorff, A R', 'Endtz, L J', 'den Nijs, J J', 'Leeksma, C H']","['Wanders J', 'Wattendorff AR', 'Endtz LJ', 'den Nijs JJ', 'Leeksma CH']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Sweden,Acta Med Scand,Acta medica Scandinavica,0370330,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Mercaptopurine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Myasthenia Gravis/*drug therapy', 'Thymectomy']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.0954-6820.1981.tb09807.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Med Scand. 1981;210(3):235-8. doi: 10.1111/j.0954-6820.1981.tb09807.x.,,,,,,,,

Production by leukemic cells of colony-stimulating activity and non-production of leukemia-associated inhibitor.,139-43,"A 36-year-old woman with acute myeloblastic leukemia (M2) achieved complete remission in Feb. 1973, after ten weeks of chemotherapy with rubidomycin-cytosine arabinoside. She received weekly immunotherapy with bacillus Calmette-Guerin and allogeneic non-irradiated blast cells and monthly chemotherapy with thioguanine-cytosine arabinoside as maintenance. The bone marrow remained normocellular for 20 months. A first relapse occurred after this period. A second remission was achieved by seven courses of different cytostatic combinations. A second relapse, refractory to all cytostatic combinations tried, occurred in June 1976. She was thereafter in relapse until her death in July 1980. Autopsy showed extensive leukemic infiltration in bone marrow, liver, spleen, pericardium, stomach, and lymph nodes. Cytochemistry, surface markers, the capacity to stimulate lymphocytes, the in vitro growth pattern (colony-forming unit culture) of bone marrow and biochemical analyses did not give any remarkable results. In contrast, the peripheral blood cells produced a normal amount of colony-stimulating activity, which is significantly more than that produced by the blood from other leukemia patients. In liquid culture, the peripheral blood cells from this patient also seemed to live longer and mature more than cells from other leukemia patients. Finally, the peripheral leukemic cells from this patient seemed to produce far less leukemia-associated stem cell inhibitor than cells from other leukemia patients. The normal colony-stimulating activity production by leukemic cells and the absence of leukemia-associated stem cell inhibitor may therefore explain the long survival of this patient in relapse.","['Giannoulis, N', 'Reizenstein, P', 'Ost, A']","['Giannoulis N', 'Reizenstein P', 'Ost A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Acta Med Scand,Acta medica Scandinavica,0370330,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Time Factors']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Scand. 1981;210(1-2):139-43.,,,,,,,,

K-562 cells in asynchronous growth were added as target cells to adherent mononuclear blood cells, either freshly isolated or cultured in vitro for 4 and 12 days. After 24 hours of co-culture, the non-adherent cells were gently removed and incubated further. Target cell DNA-synthesis and cellular DNA content were examined by methyl-3H-thymidine incorporation and by flow cytofluorometry, respectively. Cell-proliferation curves were obtained. Monocytes cultured in vitro exert a reversible cytostatic activity, which is a partial cell cycle block in the G0/G1 phase. Target cells exposed to freshly isolated monocytes also showed accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase. These target cells did not regain their normal proliferation rate before day 3 after removal from the monocyte cultures. This effect may, however, to some extent be due to loosely adherent mononuclear blood cells removed from the monocyte cultures together with the target cells.","['Eggen, B M']",['Eggen BM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Acta Pathol Microbiol Scand C,"Acta pathologica et microbiologica Scandinavica.

A variety of diagnoses were made and categorized as follows: acute leukemia (group I), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (group II) and diverse diagnoses (group III). Levels of TdT in the range from 0 to 7.9 U/mg lyophilized blasts from the peripheral blood were found in AL. This corresponds to 0-95 U/10(8) cells. Preparations of mononuclear cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors showed TdT values up to 0.88 U/mg or 10.6 U/10(8) cells. High TdT activity was observed in a patient with AML, type M1 according to the FAB classification. In a patient with ALL (L1) cytostatic treatment effected the clearance of TdT activity from the peripheral blood cells and at the same time induced a significant increase of E rosette forming cells. Combined studies of the TdT activity and cell surface markers may enable us to define remissions and relapses of AL more precisely than it is possible by conventional cytological methods. Within the group II two patients with moderate TdT activities of 1.2 and 1.28 U/mg, respectively, were observed whose cells were of prolymphocytic or unclassifiable appearance, respectively. The TdT assay may be helpful to identify such cells of unknown origin and in addition may provide the means of discrimination between such cases and ALL patients who mostly show high TdT activities. Another result of our studies was the finding of moderate TdT activity of 1.2 U/mg with cells from the pleural effusion of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Cells from malignant effusions from a patient with melanoma and a patient with teratoid carcinoma showed no TdT activity.

N-Substitution increases the effectiveness of all classes of agents as inducers of maturation as judged by an increase in potency. N-Cyclohexylacetamide appeared to be a particularly effective compound, causing 92% of the population to synthesize hemoglobin at a concentration which was not inhibitory to cell replication. In the lactam series, an increase in ring size was paralleled by an increase in the potency of unsubstituted compounds, but ring size had less effect on N-substituted lactams. Increasing the chain length of the N-alkyl substituent had little additional effect on a series of lactam and 2-pyridone derivatives; however, some decrease in maximal induction occurred with butyl- and hexyl-substituted 2-pyridones.

A histone polypeptide (HP) with an apparent molecular weight of 12,500 has been identified among the acid-extractable chromosomal proteins of DMSO-treated HL-60 cells. The detection of HP in total chromatin, total cell proteins or acid extracts of intact HL-60 cells treated with DMSO indicates that HP is present in intact cells and is not generated during the isolation procedures used for preparation of chromatin or histones. No radiolabelled HP was detected when chromatin was isolated from a mixture of radiolabelled mouse cells and HL-60 cells treated with DMSO. The relative increase in the amount of HP in DMSO-treated HL-60 cells correlates with a concomitant decrease of histone H2A. Fingerprint analysis of tryptic digests shows HP to be related to histone H2A. Generation of HP from endogenous and exogenous H2A. Generation of HP from endogenous and exogenous H2A is probably due to a proteolytic enzyme associated with the chromation of the differentiated HL-60 cells. HP was not observed in chromatin from a number of human or mouse hematopoietic tissues and cell lines but low levels of HP were detected in human lymphocytes and granulocytes prepared from peripheral blood of normal donors. HP was also detected in leukocytes from patients with acute leukemia.

Of 949 samples tested, higher than normal differentiating activity was detected in patients with infections (31% of sera tested) and with acute myeloid leukemia in relapse (35% of sera tested). The higher activity of the latter sera was correlated with the concurrent presence of infections in the relapse leukemic patients. Elevated differentiating activity was also observed in sera from patients with neutrophil levels below 1,000/microliter even if infections were not present. The study indicates that patients with acute myeloid leukemia are able to elevate serum differentiating activity in response to infections or neutropenia and that the serum differentiating factors could play a role in suppressing myeloid leukemic populations by enforcing differentiation in the leukemic cells.","['Metcalf, D']",['Metcalf D'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neutropenia']",1981/05/15 00:00,1981/05/15 00:01,['1981/05/15 00:00'],"['1981/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910270503 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1981 May 15;27(5):577-84. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910270503.,,,"['R0I-CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I-CA-25972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

The genetic control of regression.,341-8,"The genetic control of spontaneous regression of erythroleukemia was studied in parental and hybrid mice in which leukemia was induced by the regressing strain of Friend virus (RFV). Because in previous studies parental regressor mouse strains tested (N/PLCR, SIM, NIH Swiss) all had the FV-1n/n genotype and the progressor mouse strains (SIM.R, BALB/c) had the Fv-1b/b genotype, we detemined the influence of Fv-1 alleles on regression. Genes which influence regression were dominant and had partial penetrance in (progressor x regressor) F1 mice. Regression occurred in hybrid mice which inherited the Fv-1b/b genes of each of the progressor mouse strains. Regression and Fv-1 alleles also segregated independently in (N/PLCR x BALB/c) F2 mice, in random-bred Swiss mice heterozygous for the Fv-1 gene, in partially inbred Swiss recombinant progressor and regressor mouse lines, and in hybrid mice carrying the Fv-1b/b gene of SIM.R mice. Regressor SIM and progressor SIM.R mice, which were bred to be congeneic at the Fv-1 locus, also differ with respect to recovery from viremia, suggesting that their Rfv-3 genes differ and influence regression. Crosses of SIM and SIM.R mice with the A.BY (Rfv-3s/s) mouse strain confirmed that SIM and SIM.R carry Rfv-3r/r and Rfv-3s/s, respectively. We conclude that Fv-1b/b is not inhibitory to regression nor is the Fv-1 gene a genetic deteminant in the process. The data suggest that regression is influenced by several genes, including those (Rfv-1, Rfv-2, Rfv-3) shown to affect recovery from leukemia in other systems.","['Dietz, M', 'Fouchey, S', 'Furmanski, P']","['Dietz M', 'Fouchey S', 'Furmanski P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Genotype', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous']",1981/03/15 00:00,1981/03/15 00:01,['1981/03/15 00:00'],"['1981/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910270313 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1981 Mar 15;27(3):341-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910270313.,,,"['CA 14,100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

As regards the prognostic significance of the cytogenetic finding, the survival seemed to be the longest among patients with mosaic karyotypes i.e. when further aberrations occurred in some Ph1-positive cells. The course of the disease was the most favourable in the presence of i(17q), especially in patients whose cells had i(17q) as the only aberration.

Ultrafiltration at low pH led, however, to the appearance of a significant cytotoxic activity in all of seven autochthonous and in three of four allogeneic combinations. Identical treatment of control AB sera did not result in any similar activity. The results show that potentially cytotoxic antibodies to leukemia-associated antigens are present in the acute stage of acute myelogenous leukemia. However, they do not express complement-dependent cytotoxicity in untreated sera. After ultrafiltration at low pH significant complement-dependent cytotoxicity was detectable in most of the sera. One possible explanation is that cytotoxic antibodies to leukemia-associated antigens are present in the form of circulating immune complexes.

Both possess characteristics of thymus-independent, bursal-equivalent (B) lymphocytes.

The Slg- ClgM+ phenotype, coupled with morphologic features, is consistent with NALM-6-MI being arrested at a stage early in B-lymphocyte differentiation (a ""pre-B"" cell). The predominant banded chromosome karyotype of NALM-6-B is pseudodiploid with a translocation of chromosomal material from the long arm of a chromosome 5 to the short arm of a chromosome 12 (5q-/12p+) and a marker Y chromosome. NALM-6-MI possesses the same marker Y chromosome and a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5(5q-) since in most cells material missing from chromosome 5 does not appear on the short arm of chromosome 12. Within the limits of resolution available with the banding technique, no other karyotypic differences are observed in the two cell lines. The history of the two cell lines, the karyotypic analysis, and the pattern of immunoglobulin markers indicate the possible clonal evolution of NALM-6-MI from NALM-6-B and implicate a portion of the long arm of chromosome 5 in lymphoid differentiation of these leukemic cell lines.","['Hozier, J', 'Lindquist, L', 'Hurwitz, R', 'LeBien, T', 'Kersey, J']","['Hozier J', 'Lindquist L', 'Hurwitz R', 'LeBien T', 'Kersey J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*analysis', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male']",1980/09/15 00:00,1980/09/15 00:01,['1980/09/15 00:00'],"['1980/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910260305 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1980 Sep 15;26(3):281-4. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910260305.,,,"['CA-14413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Leukemic infiltration was found in six cases (27%) and another two were considered as doubtful cases. Interstitial space and subepithelial areas were the preferred sites of infiltration; tunica albuginea was found affected in only two cases. All patients affected were given local radiotherapy and additional chemotherapy. Interstitial oedema with fibroblasts and macrophages was the most common lesion (81%); fibrosis was observed in 20% of the cases. Changes in testicular morphology were mainly reflected by narrowing of the tubular diameter (less than 75% of average values in 63% of the cases) and decrease of the number of spermatogenic cells per 100 tubules (less than 75% of mean values in 86% of the biopsies). These changes appeared as independent of the presence of leukemic infiltrates. Conclusions. Biopsies performed in boys before suppression of therapy are considered as important; in positive cases additional local and systemic therapy must be given.

Rate of growth of leukemia L1210 cells was measured in vitro in the absence and presence of ELPT or measured when the ELPT was metabolically transformed by noninbred Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes. The animals used were either untreated or pretreated by various inducers such as phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, Aroclor 1254, or ELPT. The transformation of ELPT into its two main metabolites, 9-hydroxyellipticine (9-OHE) and 7-hydroxyellipticine, was studied and measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography in conjunction with the determination of cytotoxic activity. A large variability was observed in the bioactivation and cytotoxic efficiency of ELPT mediated by the different microsomal preparations: The more P448 and/or P1-450 forms of cytochrome were induced, the more the 9-OHE was produced and the more the cytotoxicity toward L1210 cells was enhanced. These features were compared with those elicited by the activation of cyclophosphamide, which was transformed into cytotoxic metabolites by the cytochrome P450 form specifically induced by phenobarbital-type inducers.","['Lesca, P', 'Monsarrat, B', 'Cros, S', 'Paoletti, C']","['Lesca P', 'Monsarrat B', 'Cros S', 'Paoletti C']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Aroclors)', '0 (Ellipticines)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'YQE403BP4D (Phenobarbital)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Aroclors/pharmacology', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ellipticines/*administration & dosage', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/*enzymology', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Phenobarbital/pharmacology']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Oct;67(4):871-6.,,,,,,,,

Synergism between BCG and line 10 tumor cells in the induction of an inflammatory response.,853-61,"The intradermal injection of a vaccine composed of 10(7) X-irradiated, syngeneic hepatocarcinoma line 10 (L10) cells admixed with 10(8) Mycobacterium bovis strain BCG into inbred Sewall Wright strain 2 guinea pigs induced a local acute and then chronic inflammatory response. Cellular analysis of enzymatically dispersed dermal vaccination sites and regional lymph nodes revealed quantitative differences between the cellular infiltrate induced by a mixed BCG-tumor cell vaccine and the inflammation induced by either 10(8) BCG alone or 10(7) tumor cells alone. Analysis of dermal sites from days 1 through 4 following vaccination showed that sites receiving the BCG-tumor cell vaccine contained twofold to fourfold more cells than did those induced by BCG alone and more than fourfold the number of cells induced by L10 cells alone. These results indicated that there was a synergistic interaction between BCG and L10 cells in the induction of an inflammatory response at the site of vaccination. Analysis of the superficial distal axillary lymph nodes draining the site of vaccination revealed a similar synergistic interaction between BCG and L10, such that lymph nodes draining vaccination sites had a greater total cellular content than that induced by either BCG or L10 cells administered separately. When two other tumors, also syngeneic to strain 2 guinea pigs, were tested for their ability to interact synergistically with BCG to elicit an inflammatory response, it was found that the antigenically distinct hepatocarcinoma line 1 tumor also shared this characteristic with L10, whereas the L2C B-cell leukemia did not.","['Key, M E', 'Hanna, M G Jr']","['Key ME', 'Hanna MG Jr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (BCG Vaccine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'BCG Vaccine/*immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Guinea Pigs', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Propionibacterium acnes/immunology', 'Vaccination']",1981/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Oct;67(4):853-61.,,,,,,,,

The rationale is based on a) evidence that, following drug-induced aplasia, resultant bone marrow proliferation in vivo corresponds temporally with induced humoral stimulatory activity, and on b) models that demonstrate increased cytotoxicity of beta-cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) to myeloblasts cultured in humoral stimulatory activity (HSA). CD2F1 mice bearing L-1210 leukemia received a course of 60 mg Ara-C/kg every 8th hour (q.8 h) three times on day 0 and on another day in sequence (0,1 through 0,7). The longest survival (250% of controls) was in animals whose second course began on day 3, the time of peak HSA as measured by DNA synthesis induced in L-1210 cells in culture. LBN rats bearing acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) were treated with 100 mg Ara-C/kg q.8 h six times beginning on day 0 and on other days in sequence (0,1 through 0,12). The longest survival was in those treated on day 0,6 (760% of controls), the time of peak serum stimulation, and tumor labeling index (LI). Thirty-seven patients with AML received a single course of therapy with 45 mg Ara-C/kg by a 72-hour infusion and 1.0 mg daunorubicin/kg every day three times. On day 8, the time of peak HSA and tumor LI, Ara-C was again infused. Complete remission was achieved in 56% (65% of all patients less than 60 yr old) with a single cycle of therapy. Median duration of chemotherapy-free remission was 10 months. Of 11 relapsing patients, 8 achieved a second remission with the same regimen. These studies demonstrated that the amount of proliferation of residual tumor and thereby sensitivity to cycle-active drugs given in sequence relates to the initial drug effect on tumor proliferation and the induction of humoral stimulation.","['Burke, P J', 'Karp, J E', 'Vaughan, W P']","['Burke PJ', 'Karp JE', 'Vaughan WP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Rats']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Sep;67(3):529-38.,,,"['CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

The subcellular localization of the env-related glycoproteins was determined by immune precipitation with antiserum against gp70, the envelope glycoprotein of the helper virus, followed by gel electrophoresis. In cells labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine, the glycoprotein encoded by the defective spleen focus-forming virus, gp55SFFV, was found primarily in the nuclear fraction and in fractions containing dense cytoplasmic membranes such as endoplasmic reticulum. A similar distribution was noted for gp85env, the precursor to gp70. The concentration of viral glycoproteins in the nuclear fraction could not be accounted for by contamination with endoplasmic reticulum. In pulse-chase experiments, neither glycoprotein underwent major redistribution. However, labeled gp85env disappeared from intracellular membranes with a half-time of 30 min to 1 h, whereas labeled gp55SFFV was stable during a 2-h chase. In plasma membrane preparations with very low levels of contamination with endoplasmic reticulum, gp70 was the major viral env-related glycoprotein detected; a minor amount of gp55SFFV and no gp85env could be detected. The unexpected result of these experiments is the amount of viral glycoproteins found in the nuclear fraction.

Infection of these cultures with a viral complex combining helper-independent murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) and a spleen focus-forming virus (SFFVp) results in a productive infection of both the replication defective SFFVp and the F-MuLV. After infection, the cultures show a dramatic elevation in the numbers of late erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E), many of which will grow in the absence of added erythropoietin, and a transient erythropoietin, independent erythropoiesis, including the production of mature, enucleated erythrocytes. Hemopoiesis eventually declines, with no evidence for the generation of Friend tumor cells. When erythropoiesis is induced in the long-term cultures by addition of anemic mouse serum before infection by polycythemia-inducing Friend virus, the generation of erythropoietin-independent CFU-E and erythrocyte formation is followed by the sustained production (greater than 40 wk) of primitive erythroid cells with low spontaneous levels (less than 5%) of hemoglobinization. Although these cells will produce spleen colonies in irradiated mice and can be cloned in soft-gel media, they do not produce autonomous, permanently growing cell lines in vitro, i.e., they retain a dependency upon the marrow-adherent layer for their continued growth. However, following a further passage on a ""virgin"" marrow environment, permanent cell lines can be established that are able to grow independently of environmental influences. Thus, this system is the first description of a complete in vitro system for the reproducible production and isolation of Friend virus-induced erythroid cell lines.","['Dexter, T M', 'Allen, T D', 'Testa, N G', 'Scolnick, E']","['Dexter TM', 'Allen TD', 'Testa NG', 'Scolnick E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,,IM,"['Anemia/blood', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythropoiesis', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.154.3.594 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1981 Sep 1;154(3):594-608. doi: 10.1084/jem.154.3.594.,,PMC2186442,,,,,,

The extinction process is illustrated with two examples. One is the quadratic map, T (r, x) = rx (1 - x), and the second is a simple model for the growth of a cellular population. The survival statistics for chronic myelogenous leukemia patients are discussed in light of these extinction processes.

Failure to demonstrate effector cell-target cell interaction and target cell specificity of the circulating cytotoxic-enhancing factor.,109-18,"The naturally-occurring antibody-independent cellular cytotoxic activity (NOCC) of normal circulating human monocytes and neutrophils was investigated employing a number of erythrocytes and the K-562 cell line as target cells simultaneously. The identity of the effector cell(s) was shown to be dependent upon or be a function of the type of target cell selected for the assay system. A number of erythrocyte targets (rabbit, horse, sheep and ox erythrocytes) were lysed to varying degrees by neutrophils and monocytes and not by lymphocytes. Irrespective of the red blood cell (RBC) target, the effector monocyte invariably possessed receptors for both C'3 and the Fc of IgG. In contrast, the cytotoxic cells using the K-562 target cell were lymphocytes. Monocytes and neutrophils were inactive. The cytotoxic-enhancing activity in normal human serum exhibits specific and non-specific properties which suggests that more than one factor is involved. With respect to the monocyte cytotoxic cells, only the rabbit erythrocytes could totally absorb the serum factor in a specific fashion. Absorption of the serum with horse, sheep or ox erythrocytes resulted in a significant loss of potentiating activity with respect to all of the erythrocyte targets but a more marked loss of activity using the absorbing erythrocytes as targets. With respect to the polymorphonuclear leucocyte effector cells, only the rabbit RBC were capable of specifically absorbing out the cytotoxic-enhancing factor present in the normal human serum. Absorption of the serum with sheep, horse or ox RBC resulted in total cross-absorption of the enhancing factor. Chicken and human RBC, which do not serve as targets for the NOCC assay, could not absorb out the cytotoxic-enhancing factor with respect to any of the target erythrocytes. The composition of the soluble serum factor(s) is under current investigation but it is not an immunoglobulin since pure serum albumin can substitute for normal serum in the NOCC assay. The mechanism of erythrocyte lysis by the cytotoxic monocyte was investigated. Mononuclear cells were incubated with target cell monolayers and with target cells under optimal rosetting conditions. No interaction between the effector and target cells could be detected. The monocytes did not adhere to the target cell monolayer nor did they form rosettes with the target cells. Thus, the results fail to corroborate or support the assumption that the cytotoxic activity of the monocyte is dependent upon conventionally-detectable receptors. Erythrophagocytosis was not observed to any significant degree under the assay conditions used. Therefore, the nature of the interaction between the cytotoxic monocyte and the erythroid target cell which results in lysis of the target cell remains to be elucidated.","['Richter, M', 'Banerjee, D', 'Sklar, S']","['Richter M', 'Banerjee D', 'Sklar S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,['0 (Culture Media)'],IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Rosette Formation']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1981 Sep;44(1):109-18.,,PMC1555109,,,,,,

The BMB were performed during the following stages of the disease: 1 at diagnosis of BT, 2 following ablative therapy and 3 during haematological recovery following autografting. In 10 of the 16 patients, BT was recognized by the presence of a distinctive infiltration with blast cells with a single large hyperchromatic nucleolus. In four of the 16 patients, the diagnosis of BT could only be made by BMB since simultaneous marrow aspiration yielded either a dry tap or no marrow fragments; in two of these four patients the BT was focal in the BMB specimen. Following ablative therapy and during haematological regeneration after autografting, BM aspirates were unsatisfactory in most cases and they were inadequate to assess cellularity or the presence of residual blasts. In contrast, sections of BMB showed clearly whether a decrease in cellularity took place or, in some, residual blasts were still present. BMB samples obtained 2 weeks after autografting showed haemopoietic regeneration consisting of discrete foci of either erythroid, granulocytic or megakaryocytic precursor cells.

Characterization of colonies.,240-54,"A method for cultivation of normal and tumour haemopoietic progenitor cells on glass coverslips inserted into the peritoneal cavity of mice is described. This technique is a modification of the method proposed by Seki (1973). Intraperitoneal injections of bone marrow cells into syngeneic mice led to the formation of erythroid, myeloid, megakaryocytic, mixed and non-identified colonies on the GC. The greatest number of erythroid colonies was seen on the 3rd-5th day after bone marrow cell injection. The majority (greater than 90%) of the erythroid colonies consisted of 16-80 benzidine-positive cells. When GC-bearing mice were rendered anaemic, the number of erythroid colonies sharply rose, whereas the number of myeloid colonies remained unaltered. The influence of irradiation on haemopoietic colony formation was also investigated. There was a linear relationship between the dose of bone marrow cells injected and the number of haemopoietic colonies formed. Areas of mono- and multilayer growth were observed on the GC. Haemopoietic colonies always occurred on a cell multilayer containing fibroblast-like cells and were never observed on a cell monolayer consisting of macrophage-like cells. When self-maintaining erythroleukaemic cells transformed by Rauscher leukaemia virus (RAL cell line) were cloned, GC tumour colonies formed not only on a multilayer but also on a monolayer. Erythroleukaemic K-2 cells, which were of the same origin as RAL cells and had undergone 500 passages in vitro, did not form colonies on the GC. The nature of haemopoietic progenitor cells (mainly erythroid) forming colonies on GC, the nature of cells providing the haemopoietic inductive microenvironment on GC, the direction of tumour progression in RAL and K-2 cells, as well as some possible applications of the GC colony assay are discussed.","['Mechetner, E B', 'Rozinova, E N']","['Mechetner EB', 'Rozinova EN']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,,IM,"['Anemia/physiopathology', 'Animals', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Glass', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*physiopathology', '*Peritoneal Cavity', 'Polycythemia/physiopathology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 1981;27(4):240-54.,,,,,,,,

As control animals, rats not immunised, or immunised with autologous muscle tissue polymer + PPD, or PPD alone, were studied. A clear-cut enhancement of tumor growth was observed in the group of animals receiving the tumor polymer, as evidenced by the largest tumors, the lowest incidence of tumor rejection and the lack of histological signs of host response against the growing chloroma. Immunisation with the PPD tuberculin, on the other hand, favorably influenced the host's immune system thus contributing to the tumor rejection and the development of pronounced host response in a high percentage of cases. The results were discussed in the light of favorable experiences gained with this mode of cancer immunotherapy in a number of clinical trials, as well as in a previous experimental DBA/2 mouse mastocytoma model.

Hourly blood samples were taken after thioguanine administration, and plasma thioguanine levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with an anion-exchange column. Prior to the chromatography the thioguanine was oxidized by alkaline potassium permanganate to the corresponding 6-sulfonate, which was monitored by means of fluorescence detection. Peak plasma levels of thioguanine were observed 2-4 h after administration and varied from 0.03-0.94 microM. Plasma levels of thioguanine were markedly lower in patients with severe nausea and emesis. Food intake at the same time as thioguanine administration also tended to lower plasma drug levels. The 30-fold range in thioguanine plasma levels observed in this study suggests that intermittent IV administration may provide a better means of standardizing the dosage of thioguanine.","['Brox, L W', 'Birkett, L', 'Belch, A']","['Brox LW', 'Birkett L', 'Belch A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)'],IM,"['Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/blood/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00253008 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1981;6(1):35-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00253008.,,,,,,,,

Five patients produced platelet reactivity values of 130--258% of controls while two gave decreased values. The two highest platelet reactivity values occurred in samples with elevated platelet counts and normal haematocrits. In contrast, when anti-platelet drugs were administered to three patients with high platelet counts, reactivity values decreased to 11--34% of controls. Clinical correlations revealed that patients with highest platelet reactivity values (165--258%) were those subjects who also exhibited thrombotic or haemorrhagic complications.

In one patient the AML had arisen de novo, while in the other it occurred four years after the patient developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and was treated with radiotherapy and combination cytotoxic chemotherapy. Both patients received anti-leukaemic treatment with doxorubicin and cytosine arabinoside and intensive haematological supportive care with transfusions of red cell, white cell and platelet concentrates obtained from normal donors. Clinically the GVHD in each patient was manifest by a severe erythematous rash, intractable diarrhoea and abnormalities in the liver function tests. On pathological examination the skin in each case showed the typical changes of GVHD. Both patients died. There have been few previous reports of GVHD occurring after accidental engraftment of immunosuppressed patients undergoing therapy for acute leukaemia. Our experience suggests that it may occur more often than has hitherto been recognised. At present there is controversy concerning the possible anti-leukaemic effects of granulocyte transfusions. Until the relative importance of the benefits and deleterious effects of cells with the potential for engraftment is determined by further studies, we recommend the routine irradiation of all cellular blood products intended for administration to acute leukaemia patients undergoing intensive cytoreductive chemotherapy.","['Lowenthal, R M', 'Menon, C', 'Challis, D R']","['Lowenthal RM', 'Menon C', 'Challis DR']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', '*Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Transfusion Reaction', 'Transplantation Immunology']",1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1981.tb04228.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1981 Apr;11(2):179-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1981.tb04228.x.,,,,,,,,

However, in four of the six patients, recovery was short-lived with reappearance of typically leukaemic culture patterns while still in remission by bone marrow and peripheral blood criteria. In individual patients, serial 7 day cultures frequently showed persisting or recurring leukaemia-associated patterns while 12 day cultures were normal. This study confirms the heterogeneity observed in the cultural characteristics of the CFUc in acute non lymphoblastic leukaemia.

The overall incidence of clonal abnormalities in first samples was 44% (15 of 34 patients), with a higher incidence in patients who had received prior therapy. The most frequent abnormalities were long-arm deletion of No. 5 (5q-; four patients), gain of all or most of a No. 8 (five patients), gain of all or most of a No. 9 (four patients), and long-arm deletion of No. 20 (three patients); these sometimes occurred in combination.

When FL cells were grown in the presence of AMS, RNA synthesis was substantially inhibited. This effect could not be attributed solely to the inhibition of de novo purine synthesis because the biosynthesis of purine nucleotides from labeled inosine was much less depressed. The ratios of ATP to protein and of GTP to protein were slightly modified as compared to the untreated controls. However, the RNA/protein ratio was decreased. Thus, the RNA content of the cells was reduced 30-40%, but the protein content was not significantly affected. When the cells were treated with AMS together with inosine at a concentration that inhibits AMS-induced differentiation, the RNA/protein ratio was increased as compared with that found in cells treated with AMS alone and approached the level of the ratio in untreated control cells. Adenosine had a similar effect in overcoming the inhibition of RNA synthesis by AMS. Because the RNA/protein ratio of FL cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or sodium butyrate, two other potent inducers, was decreased by 44%, our results suggest that a correlation exists between the RNA content of the cells and the triggering of differentiation by inducers.","['Harel, L', 'Blat, C', 'Lacour, F', 'Friend, C']","['Harel L', 'Blat C', 'Lacour F', 'Friend C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '58-60-6 (Puromycin Aminonucleoside)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Adenosine/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Inosine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Puromycin Aminonucleoside/pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.6.3882 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Jun;78(6):3882-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.6.3882.,,PMC319677,"['CA 10,000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13,047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

When HL60 cells are exposed to the phorbol diester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate [phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)], they shift from suspension to adherent on the surface of the tissue culture vessel, assume the appearance of macrophages, and acquire macrophage-associated surface markers, the enzyme-nonspecific esterase, the isozyme acid phosphatase, and the myeloid-specific esterase. Although data from other laboratories suggest that HL60 consists of stem cells that are bipotent with respect to myeloid or macrophage differentiation, unequivocal proof of bipotency or evidence that ruled out the presence of two different types of stem cells, each committed to different lines of hematopoietic differentiation, has been lacking. To resolve these two alternatives, we have developed a cloned population of HL60 cells and studied the properties of these cells when exposed to inducers of myeloid (HCONMe(2)) or macrophage (PMA) differentiation. After 120 hr of incubation with HCONMe(2), 95% of the cells acquire myeloid markers and lack specific macrophage markers, whereas the reverse is true in the presence of PMA, clearly establishing that HL60 is able to commit itself to the development of two different programs of hematopoietic differentiation. Moreover, the commitment to macrophage differentiation is irreversible after 6 hr of incubation in PMA whereas development of the myeloid program requires continuous exposure of the cells to HCONMe(2). Commitment of HL60 to macrophage differentiation by PMA is not affected by subsequent addition of HCONMe(2), whereas HCONMe(2)-induced myeloid differentiation is overridden by exposure of the cells to PMA. These data suggest that the HL60 cell may provide a model system for studying the process that generates several classes of precursor cells, each committed to different lines of hematopoietic differentiation, as well as the process that mediates the maturation of these committed precursor cells to their terminally differentiated state.","['Fontana, J A', 'Colbert, D A', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Fontana JA', 'Colbert DA', 'Deisseroth AB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Dimethylformamide/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.6.3863 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Jun;78(6):3863-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.6.3863.,,PMC319673,,,,,,

Under these conditions, the viability of ts cells treated with inducer at the nonpermissive temperature remained high (70% of that of cells induced at the permissive temperature) as judged by cloning experiments. Total RNA and protein synthesis of G1 cells treated with inducer was 44-48% of that of randomly proliferating induced cells, in contrast to thymidine incorporation into DNA which decreased to 2% of that of cells replicating at the permissive temperature. Furthermore, G1 ts cells treated with inducer accumulated hemoglobin when released from growth arrest at the permissive temperature in the presence (but not in the absence) of inducer.

Patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) were generally TdT-negative. Elevated level of TdT activity was detected in only one of 11 children with ANLL. In one patient with acute leukemia two distinct populations of cells with lymphoblastic (87%) and myeloblastic characteristics were evident. The clinical course and cell marker studies were consistent with the interpretation of a defect at the level of the common stem cell giving rise to a TdT-positive lymphoblastic cell population at diagnosis and, following the initial ALL-therapy (4 weeks), a predominant TdT-negative myeloblastic population. TdT as a marker for the modulation of chemotherapy was examined in the remission phase of the disease. Of the nine patients in the first 3 months of remission, one was found to have elevated level of TdT activity (2.5 U/10(8) cells). These data define the usefulness of TdT in the classification of acute leukemia.","['Welte, K', 'Ebener, U', 'Hinderfeld, L', 'Ritter, J', 'Henze, G', 'Kornhuber, B']","['Welte K', 'Ebener U', 'Hinderfeld L', 'Ritter J', 'Henze G', 'Kornhuber B']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*blood', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1034454 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1981 May;193(3):165-71. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1034454.,Die Bedeutung der Terminalen desoxynukleotidyl trasferase in der diagnostik der akuten Leukamie des Kindes--Ergebnisse von 63 Patienten.,,,,,,,

These consisted of a striking distention of the lateral basal intercellular spaces, cell vacuolation and patchy necrosis and was most marked when methotrexate treatment was given between 24 and 72 h before biopsy. Two mechanisms may be involved: an early direct toxic effect on the mature enterocyte coupled with interference with crypt cell generation, possibly causing ageing and loss of cells proximal to the normal extrusion zone.

B24 cells were induced to differentiate into only macrophagelike cells by an inducer of differentiation in conditioned medium (CM) of embryo cells. During cell differentiation, the ratio of the area of the nucleus to that of the cell (N.C.R.) decreased from about 55% to 10%. Decrease in the N.C.R. was used as an index of cell differentiation in analysis of the kinetics of differentiation of cells treated with various concentrations of CM. The results showed that the process of differentiation was promoted by increasing the concentration of CM, and that the transition of the cells from the undifferentiated state to the differentiated state occurred in a stochastic manner. Comparison of these morphometric results with those of autoradiography showed that the labeling index of the cells decreases gradually in association with decrease in the N.C.R. of the cells from 50% to 30%.

Possible crucial cytogenetic events in the genesis of CML.,48-51,"Two reciprocal translocations involving chromosomes 3, 9, 17, and 22 were found in a patient with seemingly Ph1-negative chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The two translocations were t(3;9)(q21;q34) and t(17;22)(q21;q11); the breakage in chromosomes 9 and 22 apparently occurred at the same point as in the usual Ph1 translocation, t(9;22)(q34;11). From the present evidence and a review of the literature it appears that the breakage on both chromosomes 9 and 22 at the special regions and the separation of the fragments are present in practically all standard and variant Ph translocations, even those in which the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 9 and (9q) does not seem to be involved in the rearrangement; however, a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 is not an obligatory result of the rearrangement, as seen in the present case. Thus, we postulate that the breakage on both chromosomes 9 and 22 at the special regions and separation of the fragments are the crucial cytogenetic events in the genesis of CML and stress the importance of paying careful attention to the terminal region of 9q, particularly when chromosome 9 does not seem to be involved in the rearrangement.","['Oshimura, M', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Vehara, M', 'Miyasaka, Y', 'Osamura, S', 'Tonomura, A']","['Oshimura M', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Vehara M', 'Miyasaka Y', 'Osamura S', 'Tonomura A']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, 1-3', '*Chromosomes, Human, 16-18', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00271166 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Genet. 1981;57(1):48-51. doi: 10.1007/BF00271166.,,,,,,,,

To prepare purified leukemic colony forming cell (CFC) suspensions for further studies, a discontinuous albumin density gradient separation method was applied to bone marrow and blood from patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia. It was found that the PHA-responding CFC were recovered, just as the leukocyte feeder layer stimulated CFC (Robinson CFC), from the light density fractions (1.056, 1.059 and 1.062 g/ml). Density profiles of the precursor cells forming colonies of Ph1 positive cells in the PHA-leukocyte feeder and Robinson assays appeared similar. T-lymphocyte progenitor cells, which also proliferate into colonies in the PHA-leukocyte feeder assay, were in majority harvested from the more dense fractions of the gradient. E-rosette tests and chromosome analysis were used to distinguish between leukemic and lymphocytic colonies. The density distributions of the PHA responsive leukemic CFC (Ph1 chromosome positive) and T-lymphocyte CFC (Ph1 negative) partially overlapped and a complete separation of leukemic and lymphocytic CFC was not achieved.","['Swart, K', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Swart K', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*pathology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1981 Jul;9(6):588-94.,,,,,,,,

Similar incubation with antibody and complement did not affect the ability of Wistar-Furth marrow to reconstitute rats that had received lethal total-body irradiation (950 R). Each of the 33 irradiated rats that received mixtures of 10(4) CI-3 and 1.6 X 10(8) nucleated bone marrow cells succumbed to leukemia within 65 days, whereas 16 of 33 rats (48%) receiving similar inocula that had been treated with antibody and complement survived greater than 180 days without evidence of tumor growth. Repeated treatment of contaminated marrow with antibody and complement following removal of mature granulocytes and erythrocytes on density gradients permitted elimination of 10(5) CI-3.","['Feeney, M', 'Knapp, R C', 'Greenberger, J S', 'Bast, R C Jr']","['Feeney M', 'Knapp RC', 'Greenberger JS', 'Bast RC Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1981/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Sep;41(9 Pt 1):3331-5.,,,"['1-R01-CA 28740-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2-507-RR05526-17/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Initially, incidence rates were higher in whites than in blacks, but during the final five years the incidence increased dramatically in blacks so that it actually exceeded the rate among whites.

As the duration of the benign phase seemed to be shorter in those over 60 irrespective of Ph1 type (P less than 0.01), the questions arose whether non-standard PhI chromosomes were simply occurring in older patients or whether they were affecting prognosis independently.

These patients had been identified in previous studies to be a group with a relatively poor prognosis. One-third of the patients had an antecedent hematologic disorder prior to treatment. Forty patients (48%) obtained a complete hematologic and clinical remission. A history of an antecedent hematologic disorder, male sex, and absence of Auer rods were adverse factors for achieving remission in this older population. More than half of the patients achieved remission in one course. The major cause of failure to obtain a remission was death due to infection, 40% of which were caused by fungi. Resistance to chemotherapy, although uncommon, was noted more frequently in patients with an antecedent hematologic disorder. Univariate and multivariate prognostic factor analysis was used to compare these patients with a historical control group treated with a program in which adriamycin was used instead of rubidazone (AdOAP). No significant difference in remission rate was detected. Cyclocytidine was used as a maintenance agent in this study, and while the median remission duration was only 37 wk, 30% of patients are expected to be in remission for 2 yr. Chemotherapy programs combining an anthracycline with cytosine arabinoside, given to older patients in similar fasion to younger patients will achieve remissions in one-half of a group of older patients.

When using target marrows containing few spontaneous colonies, increased numbers of CFU-C were found above the FC obtained from normals. No growth greater than controls was observed in those areas lacking FC. If target marrows contained large numbers of spontaneous CFU-C, actual inhibition of colony formation was produced by FC co-incubation. In contrast to normals, FC obtained from untreated AML and MPD patients typically failed to enhance granulopoiesis. Regardless of source, FC were not synergistic with the effects of placenta-conditioned media (typically being inhibitory) for colony number, but were synergistic for colony size.

One case has been studied before and after treatment with Arabinosyl-Cytosine and 6-Thioguanine. The nucleated blood cells have been separated by a discontinuous density gradient. Cells were obtained from six different gradient fractions (F1-F6: density ranging from 1.052 to 1.078). 0.5 X 10(5) cells from each density fraction have been cultured in agar culture system to evaluate the granulocyte-monocyte committed stem cells (Colony Forming Units-granulocyte monocyte: CFU-GM). Cells recovered from the same density fractions have been studied by electron microscopy to evaluate the number of less differentiated cells. A quantitative correlation between plating efficiency and blast cells number was carried out. The results indicate that the highest recovery of both CFU-GM and blast cells is present in light density fractions (specific density below 1.063). However a discrepancy between blast cell frequency and granulocyte-monocyte colony formation in the same density fractions appears to be evident. In the patient studied before and after treatment it appears that only one out of two light density fractions (F1) responds to the antiblastic treatment.,"['Astaldi, G', 'Bagnara, G P', 'Biagini, G', 'Baccarani, M', 'Brunelli, M A', 'Laschi, R']","['Astaldi G', 'Bagnara GP', 'Biagini G', 'Baccarani M', 'Brunelli MA', 'Laschi R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Geschwulstforsch,Archiv fur Geschwulstforschung,0372411,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Granulocytes/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*ultrastructure', 'Monocytes/ultrastructure', 'Thioguanine/therapeutic use']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Geschwulstforsch. 1981;51(1):63-8.,,,,,,,,

These studies have now been extended to the human promyeloblast (HL-60) cell line and myeloblasts from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia. Our results demonstrate: (i) the specific internucleotide incorporation of ara-C into human myeloblast DNA; (ii) the lability of [3H]ara-C-labeled DNA to alkali which necessitates the use of nondegrading assay conditions; and (iii) a highly significant relationship (P less than 0.0001) between the loss of clonogenicity of these cells and the extent of ara-C incorporation.

Previous studies indicate that an action of inducer, occurring during early S phase, may be critical to the expression of differentiated characteristics such as initiation of accumulation of newly synthesized alpha and beta globin mRNAs. In this investigation, the time of replication of globin genes in MELC was studied. DNA was isolated from synchronous populations of cells obtained by centrifugal elutriation. Newly replicated DNA sequences were prepared from synchronized cells cultured for 1 1/2 hr with 5-bromodeoxyuridine; bromodeoxyuridine-containing DNA was isolated by CsCl gradient centrifugation. By employing cloned probes for hybridization to newly synthesized DNA, it was found that alpha and beta globin gene sequences are replicated early in S phase, while ribosomal RNA gene sequences are replicated to about the same extent in early, middle, and late S phases.","['Epner, E', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Marks, P A']","['Epner E', 'Rifkind RA', 'Marks PA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Genes', 'Globins/*genetics', '*Interphase', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Ribosomal/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.5.3058 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 May;78(5):3058-62. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.5.3058.,,PMC319499,"['CA-13696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07367/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

The illustrations clearly show the distinction between lymphoid and myeloid disease in the four cases. A review of previously reported similar cases is summarized in two tables.

Report of three cases (author's transl)].,259-61,"Contrarily to what happens in acute leukemia, the incidence of osteolytic lesions in chronic leukemia is exceedingly low. Three patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who developed such lesions during the chronic phase of their disease form the basis of this report. Osteolytic lesions appearing during the chronic phase of CML are different from those appearing during acute leukemia or during the acute terminal phase of CML, and the differences between both types of osteolysis are briefly reviewed. In the present cases the appearance of osteolytic lesions during the chronic phase of CML preceded for a variable period the terminal acute blastic phase. Therefore this complication must be considered as a sign of poor prognosis as it relates to the subsequent course of the leukemia. Even though other authors advise local radiotherapy as the treatment of choice of osteolytic lesions, only cytostatic therapy was given to the present patients, with good results as it regards the lesions per se.","['Junca Piera, J', 'Duran Suarez, J R', 'Triginer Boixeda, J']","['Junca Piera J', 'Duran Suarez JR', 'Triginer Boixeda J']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6Q99RDT97R (Pipobroman)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*secondary', 'Bone Resorption/*etiology', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Osteolysis/*etiology', 'Pipobroman/therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Radiography', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1981/03/25 00:00,1981/03/25 00:01,['1981/03/25 00:00'],"['1981/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1981 Mar 25;76(6):259-61.,Lesiones osteoliticas en la leucemia mieloide cronica.

Since the requirements for in vitro cytotoxicity and tumor therapy differ, the present study was designed to evaluate and compare the influence of culture duration on these two effector functions. Spleen cells from inbred C57BL/6 mice primed in vivo with the Friend virus-induced leukemia FBL-3 were secondarily sensitized in vitro by culture with tumor and tested for cytotoxicity in vitro in a 4-hour 51Cr release assay and for therapeutic efficacy in vivo against established tumor. In vivo-primed cells tested directly without prior culture were effective in therapy but were not cytotoxic in vitro. Culture of primed cells for 3 days rendered them cytotoxic as measured in vitro. This cytotoxicity increased through day 5, then it plateaued. Cultured duration modified the in vivo efficacy of primed cells differently. Cells cultured for 3 days with secondary sensitization by tumor became more effective in tumor therapy than noncultured primed cells. Increasing the duration of in vitro sensitization from 3 to 5 days did not enhance in vivo therapeutic efficacy, despite a concurrent increase in in vitro cytotoxicity. However, further lengthening of the culture duration to 7 days rendered cells more effective in vivo. These discrepancies presumably reflect different effector cell requirements and/or regulation operative for tumor lysis during a short-term in vitro assay and for tumor eradication following adoptive transfer of immune cells in vivo.","['Cheever, M A', 'Greenberg, P D', 'Fefer, A']","['Cheever MA', 'Greenberg PD', 'Fefer A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Jul;67(1):169-73.,,,"['CA10777-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CB84247/CB/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Distribution of virus in sarcoma-bearing mice.,117-22,"Murine leukemia viruses were previously demonstrated to be able to infect efficiently non-virus-expressing tumors in vivo. In the present study the infectivity and tissue distribution of Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) in normal and tumor-bearing C57BL/6J (B6) mice were examined. Two syngeneic fibrosarcoma-inducing cell lines were used: Cells from a 3-methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma syngeneic to B6 mice (MCA-FS) and cells from a Harvey murine sarcoma virus-transformed, nonproducer sarcoma syngeneic to B6 mice (H-NP) were described in the preceding study. Both cell lines lacked ecotropic viral expression. F-MuLV produced in vitro was rarely able to infect normal adult B6 tissue in vivo and lacked pathogenic potential. Adult animals receiving F-MuLV remained clinically normal during 20 months of follow-up and had no detectable viremia, although some had persistently infected thymuses and long bones. In animals receiving a single dose of F-MuLV given to superinfect either the MCA-FS or the H-NP induced tumors, virion antigens were found only in tumor tissue and not in the normal host organs studied. Infectious virus was abundant in tumors; occasionally, it was found in thymuses and long bones of animals bearing superinfected H-NP tumors but rarely in other organs. Localization of F-MuLV in MCA-FS tumors appeared to be more selective with rare contamination of host organs. The presence of a rescuable sarcoma genome in H-NP may explain the discrepancy between MCA-FS and H-NP tumors. The possibility of increasing the efficiency and selectivity of infection as well as the therapeutic application of this technique are discussed.","['Iglehart, J D', 'Ward, E C', 'Huper, G', 'Thiel, K', 'Bolognesi, D P']","['Iglehart JD', 'Ward EC', 'Huper G', 'Thiel K', 'Bolognesi DP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Fibrosarcoma/immunology/*microbiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology/microbiology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Virus Infections/microbiology']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Jul;67(1):117-22.,,,"['5T32-CA09058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25863-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP33308/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Introduction of murine leukemia virus antigens on non-virus-producing murine sarcomas.,107-15,"Murine oncovirus antigens represent excellent targets for immune recognition, and virus-associated tumors are generally susceptible to various immunotherapy protocols. Virus-negative tumors, however, are nonimmunogenic and refractory to immunologic control. Therefore, the feasibility of the introduction of antigens onto non-virus-expressing tumors in situ in inbred C57BL/6J mice by systemic administration of nononcogenic murine retroviruses was investigated. Two classes of murine fibrosarcomas were studied: a 3-methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice (MCA-FS) and a Harvey murine sarcoma virus-transformed, nonproducer fibrosarcoma syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice (H-NP). Both were found to be devoid of infectious ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) or MuLV antigens. A single dose of Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) was used to superinfect MCA-FS- and H-NP-induced tumors in vivo and converted these tumors to a highly productive, virus-positive state. In vivo superinfected tumors were indistinguishable from their preinfected counterparts by competition radioimmunoassays for the virion's major envelope glycoprotein, gp71, and its group-specific antigen, p30, and by assays for infectious virus. Analysis of virus from tumor extracts proved that the antigenic specificity of the superinfected tumor was provided by F-MuLV administered systemically to the animals. Finally, an immunoperoxidase technique, applied to tumor cross sections, demonstrated the uniform appearance of viral antigens in the superinfected tumors.","['Iglehart, J D', 'Ward, E C', 'Thiel, K', 'Huper, G', 'Geier, S S', 'Bolognesi, D P']","['Iglehart JD', 'Ward EC', 'Thiel K', 'Huper G', 'Geier SS', 'Bolognesi DP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Fibrosarcoma/complications/*immunology/microbiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/complications/immunology/microbiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Jul;67(1):107-15.,,,"['5T32-CA09058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25863-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP33308/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

The amount of ferritin iron reaches saturation within less than 8 hr in MELC grown with or without DMSO. In differentiating cells grown with iron citrate there is a decrease with time in ferritin iron content concomitant with the increase in hemoglobin. Cells grown with transferrin incorporate additional amounts of iron, which are approximately equal to the amounts used for hemoglobin synthesis maintaining a constant ferritin iron level.

Thirty healthy donors and 40 patients with various types of leukaemia (20 myelogenous and 20 lymphocytic) were included in the present studies. The result was that myeloid cells had about twice the polarization value of lymphocytic cells. The use of FDA for the determination of IFP appears to be useful for differential diagnosis, at least between acute myelogenous and lymphocytic leukaemias. These 2 types of leukaemia also showed a pronounced difference in fluorescence intensity when treated with FDA, perhaps owing to a difference in uptake velocity. The previously described membrane microviscosity using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), however, did not show such a difference between these 2 leukaemias. The fluorescein-binding protein(s) was also investigated in order to clarify its effect on IFP, but there seemed little evidence for the existence of any such dyebinding protein(s). The advantages of the present method, using FDA, reside in its simplicity, rapidity and considerable sensitivity, requiring a small sample of blood usually less than 5 ml.","['Tsuda, H', 'Maeda, H', 'Kishimoto, S']","['Tsuda H', 'Maeda H', 'Kishimoto S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '1720-32-7 (Diphenylhexatriene)', 'YL39R93PRE (diacetylfluorescein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diphenylhexatriene', 'Female', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1981.117 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1981 Jun;43(6):793-803. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1981.117.,,PMC2010726,,,,,,

To determine whether high-resolution chromosome analysis could detect additional abnormalities, we studied marrow from 26 patients with ANLL, using methotrexate cell synchronization as well as a direct technique. In 24 patients, including 18 who were untreated, adequate mitoses were obtained. All demonstrated clonal chromosomal abnormalities, which involved a balanced translocation in 11 cases, a complete or partial monosomy in 10, and a trisomy in six. Previously reported recurring defects in ANLL were identified, including t(15;17) in two cases, -7 in two cases, and +8 in three cases. In addition, a new specific abnormality involving band 11q23 was noted in one patient with acute monocytic leukemia and in two with myelomonocytic leukemia. Our results suggest that most, if not all, patients with ANLL have chromosomal changes, and that our new technique may allow more precise identification of subtypes of ANLL with characteristic clinical and hematologic features.","['Yunis, J J', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Ensrud, K']","['Yunis JJ', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Ensrud K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', 'Chromosomes, Human, 16-18', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",1981/07/16 00:00,1981/07/16 00:01,['1981/07/16 00:00'],"['1981/07/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/16 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM198107163050304 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1981 Jul 16;305(3):135-9. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198107163050304.,,,"['CA-31024/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-26800/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

The syndrome was characterized by fever, myalgia, bone pain, and occasionally by chest pain, maculopapular rash, and conjunctivitis. Each of the eleven episodes of this syndrome occurred within 6-12 hours of drug infusion and always abated after cessation of Ara-C. Prior to the reaction, patients had been on therapy for an average of 13.5 months during which they were exposed to 2298-5387 mg/m2 (mean of 3200 mg/m2) of Ara-C. The high incidence of this syndrome (50% of our patients on the LSA2-L2 regimen and 33% of those receiving Ara-C) has not been previously reported. Considering the prolonged exposure to Ara-C and our inability to document infections in the patients or pyrogens contaminating the drug lots, the most likely explanation for this syndrome is a hypersensitivity reaction to Ara-C. Prevention of these symptoms with corticosteroids supports this contention and provides a reasonable alternative to discontinuing Ara-C.","['Castleberry, R P', 'Crist, W M', 'Holbrook, T', 'Malluh, A', 'Gaddy, D']","['Castleberry RP', 'Crist WM', 'Holbrook T', 'Malluh A', 'Gaddy D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Pain/chemically induced', 'Syndrome']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950090309 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1981;9(3):257-64. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950090309.,,,,,,,,

Thirty-seven of the patients had intermittent central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. Total follow-up from diagnosis varied from 5.75 to 27.75 years. The median time off therapy was three years (range, 8 months to 26 years). Eighty-six percent (55/64) of the patients continue in their initial remission. Eight patients had relapse, and one patient had a morphologically different leukemia at recurrence. All the relapses occurred between five to eight years from diagnosis and the cumulative rate of relapse for the period was 0.14. There was no significant difference in the rate of relapse for those receiving CNS prophylaxis (0.08) versus those not receiving CNS prophylaxis (0.19). The difference in the relapse rates for boys (0.24) versus girls (0.04) was statistically significant (P = 0.04). Isolated testicular relapse (ITR) was not seen in any of the 34 boys. The present study confirms the earlier observations by others that relapse is uncommon in ALL patients remaining in remission longer than seven to eight years. ALL patients treated with intermittent CNS prophylaxis administered throughout the period of maintenance chemotherapy appear to be at no greater risk for relapse off therapy than those treated with high-dose initial cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate. The longer duration of therapy and the use of a repetitive reinduction regimen for maintenance seem to be associated with a decreased risk of ITR after discontinuation of therapy for boys and men. There appears to be a small but definite risk of ""second"" leukemia in the long-term survivors of leukemia.","['Ravindranath, Y', 'Soorya, D T', 'Schultz, G E', 'Lusher, J M']","['Ravindranath Y', 'Soorya DT', 'Schultz GE', 'Lusher JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950090303 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1981;9(3):209-18. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950090303.,,,,,,,,

In immunofluorescence experiments spectrin and glycophorin A are found in 50-60% of the nucleated cells in normal bone marrow. These two proteins are expressed at all stages of red cell differentiation and can be traced at least to the earliest morphologically recognizable nucleated red cell precursor, the proerythroblast; the two proteins are specific for cells of the red cell series and are not found to be expressed in lymphocytic, granulocytic cells or platelets. These conclusions were drawn from studies on bone marrow in patients with a temporary block in erythropoiesis at the level of stem cells or of the pronormoblast. Bone marrow from these individuals either lacked all nucleated cells stainable for glycophorin A and spectrin or contained only pronormoblasts. Similar findings were obtained on spleen cells from mice which were made severely anemic by multiple injections with N-acetyl-phenylhydrazine.

For an anti-proliferative effect on the leukemia cells, an intracellular concentration of more than 0.5 mM was required. The uptake of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) was critically dependent on the growth rate of the leukemia cells. Low intracellular concentrations of the drug were present in cells growing slowly, whereas in rapidly dividing cells the intracellular concentration of the drug approached 5mM. When given as repeated intravenous infusions to two leukemic children, methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) exhibited sharp and transient peaks of plasma concentration, the drug having an apparent half-life in plasma of only 1-2 h. However, as in cultured cells, the drug was rapidly concentrated in the leukemia cells, reaching concentrations that were distinctly anti-proliferative. In contrast to the rapid disappearance of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) from plasma, the circulation leukemia cells retained the drug for a period of several days with only minimal decrease in the initial concentrations. Methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) was given to the patients for 1 to 2 months as intravenous infusions, the timing of which was determined by regular assays of the drug concentrations in the leukemia cells. In agreement with the results obtained with the cultured cells, and intracellular concentration of about 0.5 to 1mM was apparently required for growth-inhibitory action to occur. Regular determination of the cellular drug concentrations indicated that methylglyoxal bis(quanylhydrazone) could be given as weekly infusions.

Thymidine-induced inhibition of HL-60 cloning could be partially prevented by deoxycytidine, whereas normal myeloid cloning could not, suggesting that high-concentration thymidine may affect processes necessary for cloning in addition to deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. HL-60 growth in liquid suspension culture could be suppressed transiently by 1.0 mM thymidine, suppressed totally by greater than or equal to 5.0 mM thymidine, and rescued completely by concomitant addition of deoxycytidine.

After a complete remission is achieved, it is interesting to determine whether the ability to maintain a complete remission and the patient's survival continue to be influenced by the prognostic factors identified at diagnosis. If the maintenance of complete remission and survival continue to be influenced, it is important to determine the magnitude of this effect and its variations with time. Data from a study population of 936 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia were analyzed to determine the duration of effect for three variables showing strong prognostic influence: WBC, age at diagnosis, and sex. The strongest of these, WBC, showed a gradual attenuation of effect for children in progressively longer periods of complete continuous remission to a virtual disappearance at 24 months. Age and sex showed a similar reduction in prognostic effect with a negligible contribution at 15 months of continuous complete remission.

Children with greater than 25% L2 lymphoblasts had a significantly higher relapse rate and significantly poorer survival. Results of this study indicate that as a single variable, lymphoblast morphology is a very significant predictor of survival, haematologic remission, and complete continuous remission. Multivariate analyses show that lymphoblast morphology is again significant in determining duration of survival (P = 0.048), and is of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.089) in predicting length of complete continuous remission. The FAB classification, with minor modifications, is reproducible, useful, and prognostic in childhood ALL.","['Miller, D R', 'Leikin, S', 'Albo, V', 'Sather, H', 'Hammond, D']","['Miller DR', 'Leikin S', 'Albo V', 'Sather H', 'Hammond D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1981 Jun;48(2):199-206.,,,,,,,,

On the contrary, ADR concentrations in organs not infiltrated by leukaemic cells are the same or slightly higher than in normal rats. Possible causes for these differences are either the differential properties of normal and leukaemic cells in their uptake and excretion of ADR, or anatomical and vascular changes.

Increased numbers of myeloid precursors packed the bone marrow and infiltrated the peripheral blood. A diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was considered but could not be confirmed by laboratory studies appropriate for the types of CML usually observed in childhood. Examination of the patient's peripheral blood smears revealed many atypical monocytoid cells with unipolar hairy projections. Scanning electron microscopy showed these to be leukemic monoblasts with characteristic broad-based ruffles on the cell surface. A population of myeloid precursors possessing narrow ridge-like profiles was also observed. Progressive infiltration of the spleen caused hypersplenism which necessitated splenectomy. Subsequently, massive liver and bone marrow involvement led to the patient's death. Terminally, the proliferating blast cells were demonstrated to be leukemic monoblasts by analysis of cytochemical staining patterns, surface immunoglobulins, serum lysozyme levels, and monocyte-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity studies. The findings in this case are most compatible with a diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a condition not previously described in childhood. Several myeloproliferative disorders with prolonged survival have been reported in children, but special studies were not performed to determine which cell lines were abnormally proliferating. The similarities between these children and our patient with CMML suggest that monocyte studies may be useful in the diagnosis of these unusual disorders, provide insights into their pathogenesis, and aid in the selection of appropriate therapy.","['Thomas, W J', 'North, R B', 'Poplack, D G', 'Slease, R B', 'Duval-Arnould, B']","['Thomas WJ', 'North RB', 'Poplack DG', 'Slease RB', 'Duval-Arnould B']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (naphthylbutyrate esterase)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/ultrastructure', 'Leukocytes/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830100210 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1981;10(2):181-94. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830100210.,,,,,,,,

SDS-PAGE analysis of immunoprecipitates formed between ATS and radiolabeled cell-surface components of human thymocytes demonstrated that ATS bound a 48,000-molecular-weight component that could be adsorbed to Sepharose 4B coupled with Les culinaris hemagglutinin and could be labeled by periodate-tritiated borohydride, indicating that HTA is a sialoglycoprotein.

Thirty-seven of the patients had iron-excreting goblet cells. The presence of iron has been confirmed by X-ray microanalysis and by electron microscopic histochemistry. In addition to iron-excreting goblet cells, most of these patients had iron-containing macrophages in lamina propria. This may indicate that the two types of cells co-operate in the excretion process.

Doxorubicin first was complexed to phosphatidylcholine and then entrapped in anionic vesicles. Quantitation of myocardial injury was accomplished through examination of thin sections of cardiac tissue by light microscopy. At treatment levels of either 20 or 40 mg/kg (total dose), mice receiving liposomal doxorubicin had toxicity scores indistinguishable from or only slightly greater than those of saline-treated controls. Similar total doses of free drug produced moderate to severe myocardial damage and yielded much higher toxicity scores. Mixture of free doxorubicin with empty liposomes did not alleviate cardiac toxicity, indicating that the drug must be entrapped within phospholipid vesicles for reduction in toxicity. The inhibition of body growth produced by free doxorubicin at both dose levels was also completely eliminated by encapsulation in liposomes. Doxorubicin liposomes were also tested for chemotherapeutic potential against L-1210 and P-388 murine leukemias. In all cases, treatment with liposomal doxorubicin produced increases in life-span greater than that observed for free drug. We conclude that anionic liposomes can function as efficacious carriers of doxorubicin. These vesicles possess improved therapeutic action as reflected by their ability to reduce cardiac toxicity, overcome growth inhibition, and increase antileukemic activity.","['Forssen, E A', 'Tokes, Z A']","['Forssen EA', 'Tokes ZA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Liposomes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anions', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Liposomes/*administration & dosage', 'Mice']",1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.3.1873 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Mar;78(3):1873-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.3.1873.,,PMC319237,['CA-21271/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

Specific binding of [3H]PDB to both HL-60 and R-35 cells at 37 degrees C reached a maximum within 15-20 min. Maximal specific [3H]PDB binding to HL-60 cells was followed by a decline (down regulation) of radioactivity. This down regulation was temperature dependent, because no loss of radiolabel occurred by 1 hr at 4 degrees C. The down regulation of bound [3H]PDB seen in HL-60 cells at 37 degrees C was not observed with R-35 cells. Prior exposure of the HL-60 cells but not of R-35 cells to 1 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 90 min at 37 degrees C caused a marked reduction in the specific binding of [3H]PDB. When [3H]PDB binding was carried out at 4 degrees C, [3H]PDB bound to both cell types in a rapid, specific, and reversible manner. At equilibrium, HL-60 and R-35 cells were found to contain almost the same number of binding sites, which had dissociation constants of about 50 nM, indicating that the failure of R-35 cells to undergo PDB-induced differentiation was not associated with any change in the affinity or in the number of [3H]PDB binding sites. These results indicate that the down regulation of specific [3H]PDB binding may be a crucial early event in the control of phorbol ester-induced terminal differentiation in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, we suggest that such down regulation may be involved in other cellular and biochemical effects of phorbol diester tumor promoters.","['Solanki, V', 'Slaga, T J', 'Callaham, M', 'Huberman, E']","['Solanki V', 'Slaga TJ', 'Callaham M', 'Huberman E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carcinogens/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/*metabolism', 'Phorbols/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.3.1722 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Mar;78(3):1722-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.3.1722.,,PMC319205,['40-636-77/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,

These colony-forming cells, which form large erythroid colonies (10(4)-10(5) cells) in methylcellulose, can be detected late after infection with either the anemia-inducing (FV-A) or polycythemia-inducing (FV-P) isolates of Friend virus. Colony formation by these cells is dependent only on fetal calf serum as an exogeneous growth factor. The presence of these colony-forming cells in FV-P-infected spleens could not be detected until at least 3 weeks after virus infection, even though the most rapid increase in spleen weight occurred earlier, between 1 and 2 weeks after infection. Thereafter, the numbers of colony-forming cells increased sharply up to 5 weeks after infection with FV-P, beyond which time the mice generally did not survive. After infection with FV-A, colony-forming cells were detected only at 8-12 weeks and their numbers generally increased thereafter. Permanent cell lines were established from a significant fraction of FV-P and FV-A-induced colonies, and these cell lines could be chemically induced to synthesize hemoglobin. All individual colonies produced complete Friend virus complex. However, virus production appeared to decline in at least some cell lines. Both FV-P- and FV-A-induced colonies contained cells capable of forming spleen colonies in irradiated recipients and subcutaneous tumors in unirradiated mice. Thus, the assay method described here appears to detect a unique class of malignant Friend virus-transformed cells that can be detected only in the advanced stages of Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia.","['Mager, D L', 'Mak, T W', 'Bernstein, A']","['Mager DL', 'Mak TW', 'Bernstein A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Species Specificity', 'Spleen/microbiology']",1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.3.1703 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Mar;78(3):1703-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.3.1703.,,PMC319201,,,,,,

Differentiation in these cells was determined by increases in the percentage of morphologically mature cells and in lysozyme activity. Treatment of the HL-60 cells with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), phorbol 12,13-didecanoate or other inducers of terminal differentiation such as dimethylsulfoxide and retinoic acid resulted in increased levels of putrescine. However, no increase in putrescine could be detected after PMA treatment of a HL-60 cell variant that exhibited a decreased susceptibility to PMA-induced terminal differentiation. Similarly, no increase in putrescine was observed with two non-tumor-promoters (phorbol 12,13-diacetate and 4-O-methyl-PMA) or with anthralin, a non-phorbol tumor promoter. In addition to enhancing putrescine levels, PMA also increased the amount of spermidine and decreased the amount of spermine. The increase in putrescine and spermidine preceded the expression of the various differentiation markers. Unlike the changes observed in the polyamine levels after PMA treatment, the activities of ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases, which are polyamine biosynthetic enzymes, did not significantly change. alpha-Methylornithine and alpha-difluoromethylornithine and methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), which are inhibitors of the polyamine biosynthetic enzymes, did not affect differentiation in control or PMA-treated cells. Because of these observations, we suggest that the change in polyamine levels involve biochemical pathways other than the known biosynthetic ones. By-products of these pathways may perhaps be the controlling factors involved in the induction of terminal differentiation in the HL-60 and other cell types as well.","['Huberman, E', 'Weeks, C', 'Herrmann, A', 'Callaham, M', 'Slaga, T']","['Huberman E', 'Weeks C', 'Herrmann A', 'Callaham M', 'Slaga T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'Spermidine/metabolism', 'Spermine/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.2.1062 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Feb;78(2):1062-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.2.1062.,,PMC319946,['40-636-77/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,

This compromised state is a result of the chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer treatment as well as the natural existing disease state. Infection remains the leading immediate cause of death in persons with leukemia. Previous reports have described oral complications secondary to this neoplasm and its medical management; however, relatively few studies of the incidence of systemic complications secondary to oral disease have been reported. This study analyzed the incidence of acute infectious episodes in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Thirty-eight patients were randomly selected for review; of these patients, twelve (32 percent) had identifiable acute oral infection associated with the presence of a febrile state (greater than 101 degrees F). Seven of the twelve (58 percent) had no other identifiable sources of infection. The periodontium was the oral site most frequently involved, followed by mucosal and periapical loci. Most acute oral infections were associated with profound granulocytopenia (less than 100/microliters). The data suggest that oral disease plays a clinically important role in the development of systemic complications in ANLL patients.","['Peterson, D E', 'Overholser, C D']","['Peterson DE', 'Overholser CD']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, and oral pathology",0376406,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agranulocytosis/etiology', 'Bacterial Infections/*etiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Diseases/*microbiology', 'Periodontal Diseases/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0030-4220(81)90148-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol. 1981 Apr;51(4):390-3. doi: 10.1016/0030-4220(81)90148-1.,,,,,,,,

In vitro survival and growth of symbiotic leukemia cells depended on close association with the adherent cells from the initial explants or other sources. Pseudo-emperipolesis was a remarkable morphologic manifestation of symbiosis common to all cell lines, i.e., the leukemia cells were beneath the adherent cells in close contact. Cell interaction in symbiotic leukemias was studied with a representative symbiotic leukemia AKRL-3 and a cell line B6TE-A from normal thymic epithelium. Failure of the culture supernatant of the adherent cells to support the growth of leukemia cells indicated that the function of the adherent cells was mediated by close cell contact. During the culture, many symbiotic cell lines changed growth patterns and eventually grew independently. Consistent isolation of symbiotic cell lines from most primary leukemias, as well as consideration of the role of the thymus in leukemogenesis, may indicate that the lymphoid leukemias are basically symbiotic complexes of neoplastic lymphocytes and their microenvironments in their natural history.

The propensity of these cells to form heterotypic aggregates with normal syngeneic spleen cells, those obtained from mice carrying the respective leukemias in ascitic form, and syngeneic lung cells also were determined. Con A caused agglutination of all five types of leukemia cells and the resulting agglutination patterns had certain characteristics. Threshold concentrations of Con A, below which no significant cytoagglutination occurred, were very low. A steady increase in zeta, a previously defined index of agglutination that simultaneously takes into account the number of free cells and the number and size of the aggregates, was observed with increasing concentrations of Con A until a plateau was reached at 25-50 microgram/ml and this extended over a wide range of lectin concentrations (50-1,000 micrograms/ml). Self-aggregation of leukemia cells was not observed, and their propensity to form heterotypic aggregates with syngeneic lung cells was negligible. However, all leukemia cell lines formed measurable aggregates with spleen cells from both normal and leukemia-bearing mice; these aggregates usually reached a maximum plateau between 30 and 35 minutes of incubation and remained constant thereafter. Aggregation of leukemia cells with spleen cells from leukemic mice always was greater than that with spleen cells from normal mice. Con A agglutinability of leukemia cells was correlated with their propensity to form heterotypic aggregates, which suggests that Con A agglutinability of leukemia cells was correlated with their propensity to form heterotypic aggregates, which suggests that Con A receptor carbohydrate moieties may be involved in the intercellular adhesion leading to heterotypic aggregate formation.","['Phondke, G P', 'Madyastha, K R', 'Madyastha, P R', 'Barth, R F']","['Phondke GP', 'Madyastha KR', 'Madyastha PR', 'Barth RF']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)'],IM,"['*Agglutination/drug effects', 'Animals', '*Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Concanavalin A/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lung/immunology', 'Mice', 'Particle Size', 'Spleen/immunology']",1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1981 Apr;66(4):643-7.,,,"['CA16503/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA27615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM22814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

The inhibitory effect of different phorbol diesters and their analogues correlated with their potency as tumor promoters, the most effective agent being 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Both peripheral blood cells and targets specifically bound TPA, and natural killing could be inhibited by pretreatment of either cell population with TPA, though this was less effective than direct addition of TPA to the assay. Cells that had been pretreated with TPA released TPA and metabolites of tPA during subsequent incubation in fresh medium. This release of tPA was evidently responsible for the inhibition of natural killing by pretreated target cells; in experiments where labeled and unlabeled target cells were mixed, pretreatment of unlabeled targets with TPA inhibited killing of labeled targets. Suppression of natural killing by TPA was greatly reduced when adherent cells were removed from the peripheral blood cells, suggesting that monocytes mediate suppression. Inhibition of natural killing by TPA provides a model for examining the regulation of natural killing.
