Randomisation was stratified on the initial oral status (good vs. bad IOS). Intensive oral hygiene care included an initial treatment of dental lesions and tooth and gum brushing during aplasia. Limited oral hygiene care excluded preventive dental treatment and gingival and tooth brushing. Mucositis was classified as absent, mild, moderate or severe, according to the clinical aspects of the different sites in the mouth and to two scales of pain evaluation. Of the 150 evaluable patients (75 in each group), 134 developed moderate/severe mucositis (64 in the INT group and 70 in the LIM group) (log-rank test P < 0.02). The superiority of intensive oral care was observed both in patients with and without total body irradiation (TBI) and in patients with a good or bad IOS; the observed risk of mucositis was reduced by 70% in each of these four subgroups. Duration of moderate/severe mucositis was, although not significantly, lower in the INT group (17 days, S.D. = 12) than in the LIM group (19 days, S.D. = 13). The median time of mucositis occurrence was 11 days in the INT group and 9 days in the LIM group. Contrary to a widespread belief, the percentage of documented septicaemia was not higher in patients who underwent intensive oral care. We conclude that, although statistically significant, the superiority of intensive oral hygiene care is not clinically impressive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Borowski, B', 'Benhamou, E', 'Pico, J L', 'Laplanche, A', 'Margainaud, J P', 'Hayat, M']","['Borowski B', 'Benhamou E', 'Pico JL', 'Laplanche A', 'Margainaud JP', 'Hayat M']","['Dental Oncology Department, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Eur J Cancer B Oral Oncol,"European journal of cancer.

Mice primed with Pristane were found to have IL-6 in their sera and peritoneal fluid only at a few time points following Pristane treatment; this was determined by IL-6-specific ELISA. When the same samples were analysed on IL-6-addicted B9 cells, stimulatory activity was found at all time points.

Comparison of motility studies of OI-M-treated HL-60 bulk populations with control bulk populations demonstrates coinduction of CD11b and CD11c surface upregulation with chemotactic responsiveness to a gradient of the chemoattractant human C5a. Separation of motile from nonmotile cell subpopulations after exposure to C5a further reveals that individual cells which respond to this chemoattractant express increased levels of both CD11b and CD11c relative to unresponsive cells.

Inhibition of topoisomerase II activity occurred via one of two mechanisms of drug action: (i) direct inhibition of the strand-passing activity or (ii) stabilization of cleavable complex formation. Although the majority of compounds evaluated inhibited P4 DNA unknotting activity catalysed by DNA topoisomerase II up to 100 microM, derivatives bearing 1'-substituents containing SO2 moieties (e.g. 1'-NHSO2Me and 1'-SO2NH2 groups) were generally the most potent inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II-mediated DNA religation, being effective at concentrations of 1-5 microM. No obvious correlation was observed between the cytotoxicity of individual drugs and linear DNA formation in the in vitro topoisomerase II assays, either across the whole drug series or within similar subgroups. However, a selected group of drugs with different cytotoxicities (compounds 5, 12 and 30; Table I) stimulated DNA topoisomerase II-mediated DNA strand breaks in intact Jurkat cells by 3.5-, 11- and 2.2-fold, respectively, at a concentration of 10 microM, while compounds 31 and 32 did not produce protein-associated DNA strand breaks in whole cells.

On the other hand, exposure of the p19 MA protein was not observed on the virus-treated U937 cells although gp46 was detected. This was not due to inefficient binding of the HTLV-I to the U937 cells, since the methanol-fixed cells were p19 MA protein-positive.

From the viewpoint of treatment, malignant lymphoma is classified into five major categories; aggressive lymphoma, indolent B-lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL). Based on the results of the clinical chemotherapy trials conducted by the cooperative oncology groups in Western countries and the Lymphoma Study Group (LSG) in Japan, the state of the art of chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma is described. In aggressive lymphoma of advanced stages, after establishment of CHOP therapy (first generation), better results were reported in the United States for single institute single-arm studies of non-cross resistant alternating multiagent chemotherapy (second generation) and high relative dose intensity chemotherapy (third generation). However, recent multicenter phase III studies, comparing CHOP with third generation regimens, revealed that CHOP remains the best available treatment, because of similar failure-free and overall survival with lower cost and lower severe toxicity. More recently, the results of the International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors Project were reported. Based on the number of the five unfavorable factors present, such as age, stage, LDH, performance status and the number of extranodal disease sites, a new predictive model ""international index"" for aggressive lymphoma was developed.

Repeated isolation of such strains was seen in 8 of 17 patients during a follow-up period of > or = 4 weeks and in 1 of 6 patients during a follow-up period of > or = 16 weeks. Ten patients developed bacteremia (mortality, 1 of 10). On the basis of the number of patients with leukemia admitted to the hematology-oncology service, the incidence of bacteremia caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli increased from < 0.5% in 1988-1989 and 0.8% in 1990-1991 to 4.5% in 1992-1993 (P < 0.01). MICs for nine isolates obtained from cultures of blood from different patients ranged between 8 and 16 microgram/ml (ciprofloxacin and PD 131628), 8 and 32 microgram/ml (ofloxacin and BAY Y 3118), and 16 and 32 microgram/ml (sparfloxacin) and indicated resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, doxycycline, and chloramphenicol. Of nine isolates obtained from cultures of blood from different patients and that were subjected to genomic DNA typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of XbaI digests, seven were typeable. Among these, four different genotypes were identified, suggesting both the independent development and the horizontal spread of resistant clones of E. coli.","['Kern, W V', 'Andriof, E', 'Oethinger, M', 'Kern, P', 'Hacker, J', 'Marre, R']","['Kern WV', 'Andriof E', 'Oethinger M', 'Kern P', 'Hacker J', 'Marre R']","['Section of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital and Medical Center, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', 'A4P49JAZ9H (Ofloxacin)']",IM,,"['Anti-Infective Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Cancer Care Facilities', 'Cross Infection/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Drug Utilization', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Escherichia coli/*drug effects', 'Escherichia coli Infections/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Ofloxacin/therapeutic use']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.38.4.681 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1994 Apr;38(4):681-7. doi: 10.1128/AAC.38.4.681.,PMC284525,,,,,,,,

We report our experience in patients with Ph-positive ALL and review their clinico-laboratory characteristics, response to different therapies, and overall prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1980, 41 newly diagnosed patients with Ph-positive ALL were referred to our service. In addition to confirmation of their diagnosis by morphologic studies of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy specimens, patients underwent cytogenetic, immunophenotypic, and molecular studies. Thirty-five patients received vincristine-Adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD) or cyclophosphamide (CVAD) induction regimens, and 6 patients were treated with other combinations. Thirty-seven patients received salvage therapy that included VAD, high-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C)-containing regimens, methotrexate-asparaginase, and high-dose chemotherapy with autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). RESULTS: The 41 patients were among 334 patients with ALL (12%) seen during that same period. Patients with Ph-positive ALL were older and had a significantly lower incidence of anemia and a higher incidence of peripheral leukocytosis, FAB L2 (French-American-British) morphology, common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigens (CALLA), and CD34 marker positivity. With induction chemotherapy, 23 of 41 Ph-positive ALL patients (56%) achieved complete remission, and their median survival and remission duration were 11 months and 9 months, respectively. Thirteen of 31 Ph-positive ALL patients (42%) achieved complete response with high-dose ara-C regimens during salvage therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, patients with Ph-positive ALL are usually older, have FAB L2 morphology, and are CALLA-positive and CD34-positive. These patients have a poor prognosis when treated with conventional approaches with lower overall complete response rate, shorter remission duration, and shorter survival. There appears to be a selective sensitivity to high-dose ara-C in these patients that suggests a possible role of this agent as part of early consolidation or induction regimens.","['Preti, H A', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Giralt, S', 'Beran, M', 'Pierce, S', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Preti HA', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giralt S', 'Beran M', 'Pierce S', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, M.

Since cytotoxic drugs are of limited benefit at this stage, splenectomy becomes necessary in 70% of patients. Intravenous gammaglobulin has been advocated as an alternative to prednisone as the primary form of treatment. A prospective, randomized comparison was carried out between oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day; group 1; n = 17), high-dose intravenous gammaglobulin (400 mg/kg on days 1 through 5; group 2; n = 13), or a combination of both agents given on the same schedule (group 3; n = 13). The groups were well matched clinically and hematologically. No mortality occurred after initiating therapy, but one patient experienced a cerebrovascular accident. Response, defined as a platelet count greater than 50 x 10(9)/L, was achieved in 82%, 54%, and 92% of patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, but was only significant between groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.0365). The median times to peak platelet counts were 8.5 days (range 7 to 21 days), 7 (range 5 to 10 days), and 7 (range 3 to 23 days), respectively. Although there was a trend in favor of the steroid-administered groups, relapse was not significantly different, which occurred at a median of 184, 32, and 76 days, respectively, nor was the average time to splenectomy different at 339, 59, and 98 days, respectively. At a minimum of 2 years of follow-up, 5 of 17 in group 1, 2 of 13 in group 2, and 1 of 13 in group 3 had achieved platelet counts of greater than 100 x 10(9)/L and, therefore, did not require splenectomy. In contrast, where this indication was present for failure to respond, 8 of 12 (67%) in group 1, 4 of 8 (50%) in group 2, and 9 of 12 (75%) in group 3 remain in complete remission. Significantly more patients in group 2 than group 3 experienced a relapse (P = 0.0365). It is concluded that in previously untreated adults with symptomatic immune thrombocytopenia, gammaglobulin offers no advantage over conventional corticosteroid administration as the primary form of therapy. Additionally, more intense immunosuppression, resulting from the use of both agents combined, is no better than single agent corticosteroid agents and appears to be an unnecessary and unwarranted expense.","['Jacobs, P', 'Wood, L', 'Novitzky, N']","['Jacobs P', 'Wood L', 'Novitzky N']","['University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, Republic of South Africa.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Thrombocytopenia/*drug therapy/*immunology/therapy']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(94)90048-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(94)90048-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1994 Jul;97(1):55-9. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(94)90048-5.,,,,,,,,,

Despite the trait for resistance, E3 embryos developed the specific heart tumors previously described in outbred E3 embryos. The CB line (B12/B12, C/AE) was more susceptible than the congenic line CC (B4/B4, C/AE). In both lines, the heart was the unique target at E3 for MC29. No tumors of the heart or other organs appeared upon infection at E5 or E10. In the A subgroup susceptible line 6 (B2/B2, C/E) both heart (50%) and skin (100%) were transformed upon E3 infection. Hybrids of line 6 with the CB line expressed skin (100%) and heart (95.4%) tumors. On the other hand, the 6 x CC combination revealed 96.7% of skin tumors while heart tumors occurred only in 1 of 31 embryos (3.2%). To distinguish the respective influences of the MHC and of the tv-a allele, crosses with the la line (B7/B7, C/O) were carried out and tested with MC29. The findings indicate that resistance of the embryos to MC29 heart tumors is associated with the B4/B4 haplotype, supporting the interpretation that the MHC has a role in MC29 cell tropism and v-myc expression. The target cells in tumors were determined by immunofluorescence staining. Cells infected in the heart belonged to the myogenic lineage, as expected from previous studies. In skin anomalies the epidermal cells were double-stained with anticytokeratin and anti-env antibodies, many cells in the dermis also reacted with anti env antibodies.","['Hlozanek, I', 'Corbel, C', 'Dieterlen-Lievre, F']","['Hlozanek I', 'Corbel C', 'Dieterlen-Lievre F']","[""Institut d'Embryologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire du C.N.R.S., Nogent sur Marne, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,IM,,"['Alpharetrovirus/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Inbred Strains', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics/immunology', 'Chick Embryo/*microbiology', 'Chickens/*genetics/*immunology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Disease Susceptibility/veterinary', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart Neoplasms/genetics/microbiology/veterinary', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*physiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/microbiology/veterinary']",,1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(84)71451-6 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1994.1451 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1994 Aug 15;203(1):29-35. doi: 10.1006/viro.1994.1451.,,,,,,,,,

Titers of the mutant virus were comparable to those of wild-type preparations, even when supernatants were prepared from undifferentiated P19 embryonal carcinoma cells.

In some cases, the retroviral sequences are small fragments of viral genomes. In a few cases the sequences for complete retroviruses exist, but contain small defects which prevent the production of infectious virus. While the ability of reversions of these defects to produce retroviruses has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis and chemical-mediated mutagenesis, the presence of spontaneously occurring reversions has not been completely evaluated. We characterized an infectious ecotropic retrovirus spontaneously expressed in aged DBA/2 mice, which carries the complete but defective Emv-3. Although this endogenously produced retrovirus was related to the endogenous Emv-3 sequence, it had undergone recombination with another retroviral sequence to correct the defect which resided in the gag of Emv-3. Thus, recombination of endogenous ecotropic retroviral sequences may be a mechanism to produce infectious retroviruses in adult animals that contributes to pathologic disease.","['Bartman, T', 'Murasko, D M', 'Sieck, T G', 'Turturro, A', 'Hart, R', 'Blank, K J']","['Bartman T', 'Murasko DM', 'Sieck TG', 'Turturro A', 'Hart R', 'Blank KJ']","['Graduate Program in Molecular Biology and Genetics, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Genes, gag', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic']",,1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(84)71448-6 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1994.1448 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1994 Aug 15;203(1):1-7. doi: 10.1006/viro.1994.1448.,,['gag'],,,"['GENBANK/L33407', 'GENBANK/L37060']",,,,

An important problem is the cost of preparation; but we may consider that this treatment, for example in ITP, reduces hospitalization for children, necessity of platelets' transfusions, use of steroids and, therefore, their collateral effects. Hence, we assert that the social cost of the management of ITP disease is not higher in children treated with IVIG. Furthermore, short hospitalization for IVIG therapy contributes to accept this disease.

Induction of IL2R alpha mRNA by TCR/CD3 ligands in a murine T cell clone and in short-term splenic T cell cultures was inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitors and by CsA. This result was contrary to previous observations in JURKAT T leukemia cells and human peripheral blood T cells, suggesting a difference in the mechanisms of IL2R alpha gene induction in these different cell types. The CsA sensitivity of IL2R alpha mRNA induction represented a direct effect on the TCR/CD3 response, and was not due to CsA-sensitive release of the lymphokines IL2 or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and consequent lymphokine-mediated induction of IL2R alpha mRNA. The NF-kappa B site of the IL2R alpha promoter was essential for gene induction through the TCR/CD3 complex, and the induction of reporter plasmids containing multimers of this site was significantly inhibited by CsA. Northern blotting analysis indicated that while the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B was constitutively expressed and not appreciably induced upon T cell activation, mRNA for the p105 precursor of p50 NF-kappa B was induced in response to TCR/CD3 stimulation and this induction was sensitive to CsA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and antiserum against the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B indicated that p50 was a component of the inducible nuclear complex that bound to the IL2R alpha kappa B site. Appearance of the kB-binding proteins was insensitive to CsA at early times after activation (approximately 15 min), but was partially sensitive to CsA at later times. Based on these results, we propose that the NF-kappa B site of the IL2R alpha promoter mediates at least part of the CsA sensitivity of IL2R alpha gene induction in untransformed T cells, possibly because de novo synthesis of p105 NF-kappa B is required for sustained IL2R alpha expression.","['McCaffrey, P G', 'Kim, P K', 'Valge-Archer, V E', 'Sen, R', 'Rao, A']","['McCaffrey PG', 'Kim PK', 'Valge-Archer VE', 'Sen R', 'Rao A']","['Division of Tumor Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],['CA42471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,1994/06/11 00:00,1994/06/11 00:01,['1994/06/11 00:00'],"['1994/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/22.11.2134 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1994 Jun 11;22(11):2134-42. doi: 10.1093/nar/22.11.2134.,PMC308132,,,,,,,,

Out of 22 patients, 13 showed hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal in 12 cases, monoclonal in the one left) and 2 read positive for Coomb's and Ana-test respectively. The involvement of T-cell immunity in the course of MDS can be explained if we consider the clonal origin of such diseases. Among myelodysplastic patients the ones affected by LMMC, AREB and AREB-T show the heaviest immunological abnormalities: in these cases the whole of T-cells subsets and NK cells as well are affected.

Peripheral blood smear demonstrated 69.5% abnormal cells and a T-cell origin was demonstrated on cell marker study by flow cytometry. Immunological examinations, including serum HTLV-1 antibody were negative. Lymph node biopsy revealed malignant lymphoma; diffuse large, immunoblastic. The clonality of the T-cell malignancy was shown by detecting rearrangement of T-cell receptor beta gene. A diagnosis of PTCL, high grade, immunoblastic, was made. The patient received various chemotherapeutic agents and achieved a short remission, then died 5 months after the diagnosis. The classification of T-cell lymphoma was established by Suchi and the Kiel classification. Many ATL/L cases have been reported in Japan before the above classification was affirmed, although there have been few reports of ATL/L-like diseases in which serum HTLV-1 antibodies were negative. The case reported here was HTLV-1 negative, although the patient was diagnosed as ATL/L-like disease, because the results of various laboratory examinations were similar to these of HTLV-1 positive cases. Characteristics of this case included a female patient and leukemic clinical features, because the gender preponderance of PTCL, high grade, immunoblastic is male and the clinical features of the disease are not usually leukemic.

One hundred million cells of the promyelocytic leukemia-derived cell line HL60, which do not have such a gene rearrangement, were irradiated with 100 Gy of X-ray, after which RNA was extracted and examined for any rearrangements of BCR and ABL genes. Five kinds of bands were observed in the HL60 cells irradiated with 100 Gy of X-ray, and it became clear that these positive bands contain both BCR gene and ABL gene by the direct sequencing method. Furthermore, these gene rearrangements included not only the rearrangements specifically identified with CML but also atypical rearrangements which are not generally observed clinically. The induction by X-irradiation of such gene changes characteristic of malignant tumors, which are closely associated with radiation carcinogenesis, suggests that they are the initial gene changes in radiation carcinogenesis.","['Akiyama, M']",['Akiyama M'],,['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Translocation, Genetic']",14,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1994 May;35(5):454-60.,,,,,,,,,

Marrow smears showed the presence of phagocytic histiocytes consisting of 18% total nuclear cells. A diagnosis of reactive histiocytosis (RH) was made. She recovered spontaneously, but suffered two episode of recurrence during subsequent chemotherapy. Reactive histiocytosis is characterized by proliferation of histiocytes which phagocyte blood cells in immunodeficient cases, e.g. a myelosuppressive state after chemotherapy. RH causes high fever and prolonged myelosuppression. It is considered to be one of the poor prognostic factors in AML during chemotherapy, and spontaneous recovery is rare.

In the bone marrow of myelofibrosis, proliferation of megakaryocytes is often noticed. We therefore investigated the TGF-beta expression in the bone marrow megakaryocytes from 12 chronic myeloproliferative disorder patients with myelofibrosis by immunohistochemical analysis. About all the specimen showed strong positivity for TGF-beta. In order to examine whether megakaryoblasts produce TGF-beta, we then measured TGF-beta activity in the conditioned medium (CM) of megakaryoblasts from a patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia who had profound myelofibrosis. The CM showed strong collagen synthesis stimulating activity which was nullified by addition of anti TGF-beta antibody. Since TGF-beta exists as latent form in platelets, TGF-beta was considered to be altered from active to latent form during megakaryocytes differentiation. In this context, MEG-01, a megakaryoblastic cell line which produces active TGF-beta was underwent differentiation to produce platelet-like bleb with TPA treatment. During the differentiation, MEG-01 showed the decrease of active TGF-beta production and increase of latent TGF-beta together with the production of LTBP. These results suggest that megakaryoblasts produce active TGF-beta and may may cause myelofibrosis, while more differentiated megakaryocytes produce latent TGF-beta. Mechanism by which megakaryoblast escape from negative autocrine of active TGF-beta was also investigated. MEG-01 was found to express mutated p53 which is considered to be responsible for impaired signal transduction of TGF-beta.","['Kogawa, K', 'Mogi, Y', 'Morii, K', 'Takimoto, R', 'Niitsu, Y']","['Kogawa K', 'Mogi Y', 'Morii K', 'Takimoto R', 'Niitsu Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical University.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)'],IM,,"['Blood Platelets/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism/physiology']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1994 Apr;35(4):370-5.,,,,,,,,,

We now demonstrate that AML14 cells can be stimulated by a combination of these cytokines to produce mRNA encoding all the eosinophil granule proteins, including major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), and the Charcot-Leyden crystal (CLC) protein (eosinophil lysophospholipase). The production of the mature proteins was demonstrated by Western blotting, and ultrastructural analysis demonstrated the presence of immature secondary granules in cells that had been induced to differentiate to eosinophils.

AP-1 elements generally transduce signals involving protein kinase C; the CRE site mediates a cAMP response, involving protein kinase A. Thus, this element has the potential to receive signals through divergent signaling pathways. Nuclear protein binding studies using extracts from THP-1 monocytic cells treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which stimulates, or dexamethasone (Dex) or pentoxifylline (PTX), which inhibit TNF production, respectively, suggest that two low-mobility complexes could be involved in regulation through this promoter region. PTX and Dex increase binding of both these complexes compared with untreated cells; approximately 2 hours after LPS induction, the upper complex becomes undetectable. This upper complex is composed of ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2, a cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein) homodimers; the lower is a heterodimer of jun/ATF2. LPS induces c-jun and thus may enhance formation of jun/ATF2 complexes, which could be activating complexes. In this case, the simultaneous presence of both complexes, which would occur in the presence of Dex or PTX, could reduce the amount of TNF transcription through competitive binding. Through in vitro competitive binding studies comparing the binding affinities of the TNF promoter sequence and a consensus CRE, we further suggest how variation of endogenous binding sequences from consensus may be an important property for regulatory control of particular genes.","['Newell, C L', 'Deisseroth, A B', 'Lopez-Berestein, G']","['Newell CL', 'Deisseroth AB', 'Lopez-Berestein G']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.

Transfectants were stimulated to secrete IL-2 by immobilized OKT3 + PMA and by soluble CD73 mAb + PMA. The amount of IL-2 synthesized by individual clones in response to CD73 mAb + PMA was proportional to the IL-2 response to immobilized OKT3 + PMA. CD73 transfectants of Jurkat mutants defective in the TCR, in p56lck, or in the tyrosine phosphatase CD45 did not secrete IL-2 in response to CD73 mAb + PMA, suggesting a role for the CD3/TCR-signaling complex in CD73-mediated signal transduction. A transmembrane form of CD73 was expressed in Jurkat cells by fusing the extracellular portion of CD73 to the transmembrane domain of human tissue factor. Although as a group, clones expressing transmembrane CD73 synthesized less IL-2 in response to CD73 mAb + PMA than clones expressing the GPI-anchored form of the molecule, the responses of the two groups overlapped considerably. In contrast to previous studies with Ly-6, Qa-2, and CD55, the GPI anchor is not critical for activation through CD73.","['Resta, R', 'Hooker, S W', 'Laurent, A B', 'Shuck, J K', 'Misumi, Y', 'Ikehara, Y', 'Koretzky, G A', 'Thompson, L F']","['Resta R', 'Hooker SW', 'Laurent AB', 'Shuck JK', 'Misumi Y', 'Ikehara Y', 'Koretzky GA', 'Thompson LF']","['Immunobiology and Cancer Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City 73104.']",['eng'],"['CA08906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56050/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/chemistry/*immunology"", 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Aug 1;153(3):1046-53.,,,,,,,,,

When viewed by light microscopy, these neutrophils were almost normal in appearance, except for the presence of ring shaped nuclei and cytoplasmic vacuoles. Electron microscopy showed that neutrophilic promyelocytes and early myelocytes in the bone marrow frequently possessed unique rounded granules consisting of clustered parallel tubules, of 29-31 nm in diameter, and occasional amorphous electron dense material. These parallel tubules showed a hexagonal array; the granules were termed parallel tubular granules (PTGs). PTGs were positive for electron microscopic myeloperoxidase, and were seen exclusively in neutrophilic promyelocytes and early myelocytes.

In the absence of TNF receptors, only the human hairy-cell leukemia (HCL)-derived cell line JOK-I revealed constitutive cell-surface expression of LT but not TNF-alpha. Immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-LT monoclonal antibody (MAb) 9B9 from cell-surface radioiodinated JOK-I cells revealed that a cell-surface lymphotoxin molecule (25 kDa) is expressed in association with a 33-kDa molecule. Enzymatic digestion with F/N-glycosidase and O-glycosidase showed that both proteins contained N-linked carbohydrate residues, whereas only the 25-kDa molecule contained O-linked sugar residues. Analysis of mRNA expression revealed specific transcripts of LT-alpha and LT-beta in JOK-I cells. Resting tonsillar B cells did not express cell-surface LT. However, LT-beta mRNA was observable in unstimulated tonsillar B cells, whereas LT-alpha mRNA, cell-surface LT and LT secretion could only be detected upon in vitro activation. Thus LT-beta and alpha appear to be sequentially expressed in human B cells. Neoplastic B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL), being devoid of constitutive cell-surface LT expression, could be induced to express surface LT by in vitro stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC). Constitutive LT-beta transcripts, however, could also be detected in 4 out of 5 cases of BCLL. In contrast, human HCL cells displayed constitutive cell expression of lymphotoxin-alpha and beta.

These results suggest that specific expression of growth factor proteins by the leukemic cells may selectively regulate the fibrosis of the bone marrow as well as the tumor formation of AMKL. The expression of adhesion molecules and growth factor proteins by the leukemic cells and the deposition of extracellular matrix are discussed in relation to the myelofibrosis as well as the tumor-forming nature of AMKL.","['Kitagawa, M', 'Yoshida, S', 'Ishige, I', 'Minami, J', 'Kuwata, T', 'Tanizawa, T', 'Kamiyama, R']","['Kitagawa M', 'Yoshida S', 'Ishige I', 'Minami J', 'Kuwata T', 'Tanizawa T', 'Kamiyama R']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,,"['Collagen/analysis', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/analysis', 'Fibronectins/analysis', 'Growth Substances/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Laminin/analysis', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/analysis', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/analysis']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0046-8177(94)90307-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0046-8177(94)90307-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1994 Jul;25(7):723-6. doi: 10.1016/0046-8177(94)90307-7.,,,,,,,,,

In this report, the ASP-I-encoding gene, ASP1, has been identified by homology cloning based on the structures of ASPs from other organisms. Its deduced protein product has a subunit M(r) of 41,414, and shows substantial sequence homology to the bacterial amidohydrolase family. The product of the S. cerevisiae ASP3 gene, a further member of this family, encoding the nitrogen catabolite-regulated cell-wall ASP II, has 46% overall sequence identity to ASP1. Duplication of ancestral asparaginase genes, resulting in separate intra- and extracellular isozymes, appears to have occurred independently in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages. Exact physical mapping of the new cloned ASP1 gene locates it 73% of the distance from the left telomere of chromosome IV, at a position precisely matching the known genetic map location of ASP1. This, along with the structural features of the clone, confirms that ASP1 is the structural gene encoding cytoplasmic ASP I in S. cerevisiae. Sequence analysis of the ethylmethanesulfonate-induced asp1-12 allele of strain XE101-1A revealed a C-->T transition altering Ala176 to Val. This residue lies within a highly conserved region, and the results suggests a critical function for Ala176 in ASP function. Expression of ASP1 and other recombinant ASPs may allow access to improved products for use in the chemotherapy of leukaemia.","['Sinclair, K', 'Warner, J P', 'Bonthron, D T']","['Sinclair K', 'Warner JP', 'Bonthron DT']","['Human Genetics Unit, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Asparaginase/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Fungal', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/enzymology/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,1994/06/24 00:00,1994/06/24 00:01,['1994/06/24 00:00'],"['1994/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['0378-1119(94)90200-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(94)90200-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1994 Jun 24;144(1):37-43. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(94)90200-3.,,['ASP1'],,,['GENBANK/Z27406'],,,,

As an initial step to explore the link between AIDS and hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease, the present study determined whether pulmonary hypertension is present in a well-characterized murine model of retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency. In agreement with previous reports, mice infected with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus developed polyclonal B and T cell activation followed by progressive and severe B and T cell immunodeficiency. At 12 wk postinfection, when persistent immunodeficiency was established, mice were anesthetized, and right ventricular systolic pressure was determined in open-chest, mechanically ventilated animals. Mean right ventricular systolic pressure was 14.7 +/- 1.3 mm Hg in control animals and was increased significantly to 22.5 +/- 3.2 mm Hg in virus-infected mice. Right ventricular hypertrophy was also present in infected mice as evidenced by a 27% increase in the ratio of right to left ventricular weights; there were no group-dependent differences in the left ventricular to total-body weight ratio. Morphometric evaluation indicated that medial thickness in muscularized pulmonary arteries, expressed as a percentage of the external diameter, was 9.6 +/- 0.4% in control lungs and increased to 14.4 +/- 0.5% in lungs from infected animals. Qualitative histopathologic analysis suggested increased perivascular collagen deposition in lungs from infected animals relative to control animals.

Immunohistochemical and histochemical stainings were used to clarify the relationship between blood transfusion and iron deposition in the islet. Disease of the lymphohemopoietic system (leukemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia) or liver (carcinoma and/or cirrhosis) accounted for 86.1% of the patients' main diagnosis. Sixteen of them had slight hemosiderin deposition (Group 1), twenty cases had severe hemosiderin deposition (Group 2). Another ten cases were used as controls (Group 3). The cases had a similar age distribution to Group 1 and 2, with neither blood transfusion nor hemosiderin deposition. The volume of blood transfusion was 6.1 +/- 3.6, 17.5 +/- 12.2 L for Groups 1 and 2, respectively. The plasma glucose was 137.8 +/- 54.4 and 170.6 +/- 108.4 mg/dL, respectively. Four cases in Group 1 and 14 cases in Group 2 had glycosuria. The number of islet cells with hemosiderin increased with the enlargement of transfusion volume (r = 0.664, P < 0.001). Plasma glucose also related with the percentage of hemosiderin positive islet cell (r = 0.386, P < 0.025). In severely iron-overloaded cases, hemosiderin was selectively deposited in B cells of the islet. It was concluded that large amounts of blood transfusions for non-congenital disease can induce selective hemosiderin deposition and impairment of pancreatic B cell that may result in hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus of the patients.","['Lu, J P', 'Hayashi, K']","['Lu JP', 'Hayashi K']","['Department of Pathology, Shanghai Medical University, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,['9011-92-1 (Hemosiderin)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hemochromatosis/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Hemosiderin/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Islets of Langerhans/*chemistry/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Transfusion Reaction']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1994.tb02592.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 1994 Mar;44(3):194-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1994.tb02592.x.,,,,,,,,,

Scattered leukemia lesions were divided into two groups: A and B: (A) consisted of one or a few conspicuously large foci and many small foci, and (B) had no such large foci. The interval from the first appearance of orthochromatic erythroblasts to autopsy was short in animals with solitary lesions, slightly longer in those with scattered lesions in group (A), and still longer in group (B). Conspicuously large foci were predominantly localized in the bone marrow, while small foci were scattered in the bone marrow, spleen and liver. The (A) scattered lesions were considered to represent the early metastatic stage, since they consisted of the combination of large and small foci, and the time interval from the first appearance of erythroblasts to autopsy was between that of solitary lesions and (B) scattered lesions.

CNTF inhibited ES cell differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. The most effective concentration was 10 ng CNTF per ml of medium. The effects of CNTF on ES cell differentiation and proliferation were comparable to those of LIF at the same concentration. BRL cell-conditioned medium was less effective at preventing ES cell differentiation but induced their proliferation very markedly. Both ES cell clones efficiently formed chimaeras after long-term culture with CNTF as the only differentiation inhibiting agent. The ability of these ES cells to colonize the germ-line is the ultimate proof that CNTF can preserve the pluripotency of ES cells.","['Wolf, E', 'Kramer, R', 'Polejaeva, I', 'Thoenen, H', 'Brem, G']","['Wolf E', 'Kramer R', 'Polejaeva I', 'Thoenen H', 'Brem G']","['Lehrstuhl fur Molekulare Tierzucht, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Transgenic Res,Transgenic research,9209120,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chimera', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Culture Media', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01973982 [doi]'],ppublish,Transgenic Res. 1994 May;3(3):152-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01973982.,,,,,,,,,

In non neoplastic human lymphoid tissues, bcl-2 protein is strongly expressed in the small recirculating lymphocytes of the follicular mantle zone; it is expressed less intensely in T-cell areas, and is almost absent from germinal center cells. Bcl-2 mRNA, in contrast to bcl-2 protein, is strongly expressed on most of the latter cells, a similar phenomenon also being observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Resting PBL express both bcl-2 mRNA and protein, while most lymphoblasts in mitogen-stimulated PBL cultures lose bcl-2 protein and become apoptotic, despite expressing higher levels of mRNA. Posttranscriptional regulation of the bcl-2 gene may cause this paradoxical down-regulation of bcl-2 protein and may play an important role in the clonal selection of lymphocytes. Bcl-2 protein is frequently expressed in follicular lymphomas bearing the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, but it is also widely expressed in many other B- and T-cell lymphomas without bcl-2 rearrangement, showing that mechanisms other than t(14;18) translocation may deregulate bcl-2 expression. Many lymphoid and myeloid cell lines also express bcl-2 protein with no correlation being shown with differentiation stage. Thus, it is conceivable that bcl-2 protein may play a role in the oncogenesis of many hematolymphoid malignancies by interfering with programmed cell death, in concert with other oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.","['Akagi, T', 'Kondo, E', 'Yoshino, T']","['Akagi T', 'Kondo E', 'Yoshino T']","['Department of Pathology, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reference Values', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409051655 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Mar;13(1-2):81-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199409051655.,,['bcl-2'],,,,,,,

We report here the results of retreatment with CdA given to 6 previously CdA-treated patients who had progression off therapy. Two initially had a complete remission and 4 a partial remission. The median time from the start of initial CdA-treatment to retreatment was 19 months (range 8-28 mos). The tumor cell response to CdA was assessed by calculating the elimination rate of circulating leukemia cells. The lymphocyte half-life varied in the different patients, but was similar in all six patients when comparing the first CdA-course with CdA-treatment at relapse, with a correlation coefficient of r2 = 0.89. However, the toxicity towards thrombopoiesis was greater at relapse than during the initial treatment in four of the six patients. CLL cells do not seem to acquire resistance to CdA, but retreatment with CdA at relapse following CdA-induced remission is hampered by more severe drug-related cytopenia.

In addition, the extracellular part of both receptors are shedded by proteolytic cleavage and exist as soluble receptors which bind to TNF in plasma and other biological fluids. Normal B cells produce TNF and express TNF receptors (R), mainly p75, upon stimulation. TNF costimulates DNA synthesis via the p75 receptor in normal B cells. The B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) produce TNF and have the capacity to express both receptor types. Also in malignant B cells the p75 receptor is dominant. TNF induce DNA synthesis in CLL cells via both receptors. CLL patients have elevated serum levels of soluble (s) TNFR and this is more pronounced in advanced disease. In conclusion, there is considerable support for TNF as an autocrine growth factor in CLL. However, the net effect of TNF is determined by the quantitative relationship between TNFR on the cell surface, TNF in plasma and sTNFR in plasma, and the affinities between TNF-p55 and TNF-p75. Due to increasing serum levels of sTNFR the significance of TNF as a growth factor is probably less important in advanced disease.","['Waage, A', 'Espevik, T']","['Waage A', 'Espevik T']","['Department of Medicine, University of Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",34,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409051650 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Mar;13(1-2):41-6. doi: 10.3109/10428199409051650.,,,,,,,,,

It is therefore proposed that the FAB classification of MDS is used in children in order to improve diagnostic precision and to facilitate epidemiologic, clinical, and therapeutic comparisons. The true incidence of childhood MDS is unknown but the rate may approximate the incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia. A pooled analysis of eight larger series representing 110 children less than 15 years old at diagnosis with de novo MDS classified according to the FAB recommendations showed that the more aggressive subtypes dominated, which partly may reflect that the less advanced cases are underdiagnosed. The median age at presentation was 6.0 years. The male/female ratio was 1.6. Monosomy 7 was the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality. The median survival was 13 months and the probability of survival three years from diagnosis was 16%. Spontaneous remission may be observed very infrequently. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) represents the only potentially curative treatment. The survival rate three years after BMT is about 50%. Major differences between childhood and adult MDS exist with respect to the distribution of FAB subgroups, the rate of progression, and the cytogenetic findings.

We have shown that anti-Tac(Fv) binds to low affinity IL2R's on fresh chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells and can target either toxin to kill those cells. Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40, containing the truncated form of PE without its binding domain, was cytotoxic to malignant cells from 8 of 8 ATL patients tested, with IC50's ranging from 0.11 to 5.5 ng/ml. Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40KDEL, a derivative of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 which contains the KDEL carboxyl terminus, was more cytotoxic toward cells from all ATL patients and also killed CLL cells from 8 of 16 patients. DT388-anti-Tac(Fv), containing amino acids 1-388 of DT fused to the amino terminus of anti-Tac(Fv), was less cytotoxic than anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 on ATL cells from 4 of 5 patients, but was cytotoxic toward CLL cells from 12 of 16 patients. DT388-IL2, where IL2 is substituted for anti-Tac(Fv), is similar to DAB389IL2, an IL2-toxin currently in clinical trials. DT388-IL2 and DAB389IL2 differ by only a few amino acids and have equal cytotoxic activity. DT388-IL2 was cytotoxic toward ATL cells from all patients tested, but usually required much higher concentrations than anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 and was poorly active against CLL cells. Thus, recombinant toxins containing anti-Tac(Fv) are cytotoxic toward freshly isolated CLL and ATL cells and will be studied further as potential therapy for IL2R-related disorders.","['Kreitman, R J', 'Pastan, I']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,,"['*ADP Ribose Transferases', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bacterial Toxins/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diphtheria Toxin/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Exotoxins/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains', 'Immunotoxins/biosynthesis/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*therapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virulence Factors']",65,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Mar;13(1-2):1-10.,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 protein has been detected in normal immature myeloid cells and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. To assess its functional role in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, we performed serum-free cultures of CD34+ normal marrow cells, of bcl-2-positive myeloid lines, and of AML cells in the presence of bcl-2 sense, nonsense, and antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. In all antisense-treated cultures, we observed (1) an inhibition of bcl-2 protein expression by day 4 to 6 of culture; (2) a decrease in cell survival duration; and (3) a decrease in the number of clonogenic cells present in the culture. Moreover, exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in more effective killing of AML cells in the presence of antisense oligomers.

Rearranged V-J TCR gamma-gene segments were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Because most of the biopsy tissue or bone marrow samples contained significant amounts of admixed nonmalignant T-cells, direct DNA sequencing of the PCR products yielded mixed sequence data because of coamplification of clonal together with polyclonal TCR gamma V-N-J junctions. Reliable data could only be obtained by cloning the V gamma-J gamma PCR products and sequencing several (4 to 10) randomly chosen clones. In the polyclonal samples, all PCR-derived clones differed in their specific V-N-J junctions, as expected. In the two T-cell lines and in most of the T-cell malignancies, monoclonal PCR products could be identified by the demonstration of clonally restricted V-N-J junctions. In most cases, this information yielded the desired clone-specific sequence and showed a background population of polyclonal TCR gamma cells in each specimen, except for those that were obtained from the T-ALL samples, the cell lines, or the NHL samples with high tumor cell fraction. The results obtained by PCR-directed sequencing were confirmed by temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) that showed distinct DNA bands only with the PCR products containing predominant (ie, monoclonal) TCR gamma V-N-J junctions. By combined sequence and TGGE analysis, it was found that PCR/TGGE is able to distinguish between monoclonal and polyclonal TCR gamma-PCR products. This finding prompted us to complete the analysis of the TCR gamma locus in the samples by PCR/TGGE using primer mixes which covered all possible V gamma and J gamma recombinations. Monoclonality was shown with all mixes by PCR/TGGE in 21 of 24 (87%) of the lymphoproliferations. In summary, the present study shows that the combination of amplifying TCR gamma V-N-J junctions by PCR with the identification of clonal PCR products by TGGE and DNA sequencing is a reliable method for the characterization of clonal TCR gamma sequences.","['Kneba, M', 'Bolz, I', 'Linke, B', 'Bertram, J', 'Rothaupt, D', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Kneba M', 'Bolz I', 'Linke B', 'Bertram J', 'Rothaupt D', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Georg-August University, Goettingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Electrophoresis', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics']",,1994/07/15 00:00,1994/07/15 00:01,['1994/07/15 00:00'],"['1994/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78771-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 15;84(2):574-81.,,,,,,,,,

Overall, 78 cases (81%) had HRX rearrangements detected by Southern blot analysis performed with a single HRX cDNA probe, whereas 18 cases (19%) had germline HRX. Of the 78 cases with HRX rearrangements, only 50 had abnormalities of 11q23 detected cytogenetically. Molecular abnormalities of HRX were associated with early treatment failure and a very poor outcome. Estimated event-free survival for patients with HRX rearrangements was 19% (SE, 7%) at 3 years, compared with 46% (SE, 17%) for patients with germline HRX (P = .033 by the two-sided logrank test). Therefore, infants with ALL and molecular abnormalities of HRX represent a group with an extremely high rate of failure who clearly need innovative or experimental treatment. Furthermore, cytogenetic analysis alone failed to detected 36% of HRX rearrangements, suggesting that molecular analysis be performed on all infants with ALL to identify this group of high-risk patients.","['Rubnitz, J E', 'Link, M P', 'Shuster, J J', 'Carroll, A J', 'Hakami, N', 'Frankel, L S', 'Pullen, D J', 'Cleary, M L']","['Rubnitz JE', 'Link MP', 'Shuster JJ', 'Carroll AJ', 'Hakami N', 'Frankel LS', 'Pullen DJ', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305-5324.']",['eng'],"['CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Survival Rate', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1994/07/15 00:00,1994/07/15 00:01,['1994/07/15 00:00'],"['1994/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78770-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 15;84(2):570-3.,,['HRX'],,,,,,,

In concert with binding of ligand, these receptors from heterodimers with the retinoic X receptor (RXR) and transactivate RAR/RXR-responsive genes. Retinoids can differentiate leukemic cell lines in vitro and induce clinically complete remissions in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Synthetic ligands to the RAR and RXR receptors have been developed that selectively bind and activate RAR/RXR (TTAB) and RXR/RXR dimers (SR11217). We investigated the affect of these ligands, either alone or in combination, on in vitro growth and differentiation of cells from the HL-60, KG-1, THP-1, and WEHI-3 myeloid cell lines as well as on clonal growth of fresh myeloid leukemic blasts from patients. Clonal inhibition of proliferation of these cells was studied in soft agar cultures. Cells were plated in the presence of either one or a combination of retinoids at concentrations of 10(-5) to 10(-10) mol/L. TTAB inhibited 50% clonal growth at an effective dose (ED50) that was about 1,000-fold lower than the concentration of SR11217 required to achieve an ED50 for the same leukemic cells. Combination of both ligands at a variety of concentrations showed no synergistic effects. Superoxide production (nitroblue tetrazolium reduction) and CD11b expression as parameters of differentiation of HL-60 cells were also examined. Results paralleled those of clonal growth, with SR11217 being markedly less potent than TTAB. These results show that the ligand selective for RXR-homodimers has little effect on either inducing differentiation or inhibiting clonal growth of leukemic cells. The differentiating and antiproliferative effects of retinoids are mainly induced through RAR/RXR heterodimers, and development of therapeutic analogs should focus on this category of retinoids.","['Dawson, M I', 'Elstner, E', 'Kizaki, M', 'Chen, D L', 'Pakkala, S', 'Kerner, B', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Dawson MI', 'Elstner E', 'Kizaki M', 'Chen DL', 'Pakkala S', 'Kerner B', 'Koeffler HP']","['Bio-Organic Chemistry Laboratory, SRI International, Menlo Park, CA.']",['eng'],"['CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA51933/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '107430-51-3 (4-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-anthracenyl)benzoic', 'acid)', '146670-35-1 (SR 11217)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*physiology', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/15 00:00,1994/07/15 00:01,['1994/07/15 00:00'],"['1994/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78755-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 15;84(2):446-52.,,,,,,,,,

Mature granulocytes show a markedly limited life span and rapidly undergo apoptosis. To further define the relationship between apoptosis and granulocyte differentiation, we used retroviral vector-mediated gene transduction to introduce the normal bcl-2 gene into the HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line and determined the response of these bcl-2-transduced HL-60 cells to the induction of granulocyte differentiation by retinoic acid (RA). Although the bcl-2-transduced HL-60 cells showed the same differentiative response to RA as did the parental HL-60 cells, the life span of the RA-induced, bcl-2-transduced HL-60 granulocytes was markedly prolonged compared with that of the RA-induced parental HL-60 granulocytes. DNA fragmentation studies indicate that this prolonged life span resulted from diminished apoptosis in the bcl-2-transduced cells. These studies indicate that bcl-2 is involved in regulating apoptosis in maturing granulocytes. Because bcl-2 over-expression did not interfere with RA-induced granulocyte differentiation, it appears that granulocyte differentiation and apoptosis are under distinct and separate regulatory controls.","['Park, J R', 'Robertson, K', 'Hickstein, D D', 'Tsai, S', 'Hockenbery, D M', 'Collins, S J']","['Park JR', 'Robertson K', 'Hickstein DD', 'Tsai S', 'Hockenbery DM', 'Collins SJ']","['Program in Molecular Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],['CA55397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/15 00:00,1994/07/15 00:01,['1994/07/15 00:00'],"['1994/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78754-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 15;84(2):440-5.,,,,,,,,,

For comparison, six cases of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) known to display nonmutated rearranged VH genes and six cases of follicle center lymphomas (FCLs) known to display mutated rearranged VH genes were included in our study. The VH region sequences of the six MCLs showed, like those of the six B-CLL cases, no or very little somatic mutations, in contrast to the VH sequences of the six FCL cases, all of which were highly mutated. This is indicative of MCL, like B-CLL, being derived from naive pre-germinal center B cells and furthermore underscores the postulated relationship of MCLs with the B cells of the normal follicular mantle zone because it has recently been shown that this mantle zone is solely or at least largely composed of naive (nonmutated) B cells.","['Hummel, M', 'Tamaru, J', 'Kalvelage, B', 'Stein, H']","['Hummel M', 'Tamaru J', 'Kalvelage B', 'Stein H']","['Institute of Pathology, Klinikum Steglitz, Free University Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,,"['Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', '*Mutation']",,1994/07/15 00:00,1994/07/15 00:01,['1994/07/15 00:00'],"['1994/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78749-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 15;84(2):403-7.,,,,,,,,,

The need was recognized when it became apparent in the 1950s and 1960s that meningeal relapse heralded hematologic relapse and a fatal course and that its incidence increased as systemic chemotherapy became more effective in controlling hematologic and visceral leukemia. Evasion of a biologic safety net, the blood-CSF barrier, is required to prevent meningeal leukemia. Three methods are used: meningeal radiotherapy, intrathecal administration of antileukemia drugs, and high-dosage intravenous antileukemia drugs. Recent and current clinical studies reflect a continuing dialogue about which methods are preferable and under what circumstances. For prevention of meningeal leukemia, extended intrathecal therapy and intensive systemic chemotherapy appear to be as effective as radiotherapy for most patients. For treatment of overt meningeal leukemia, meningeal radiotherapy may be necessary. However, its administration compromises subsequent systemic chemotherapy so that delay may be advisable to allow intensive systemic chemotherapy for control of concurrent hematologic and visceral leukemia, whether clinically evident or not. For patients with meningeal leukemia at diagnosis, cranial irradiation may be delayed or possibly omitted if evidence of disease is minimal and intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy are intensive. For those who develop meningeal leukemia while on therapy or after its completion, cranial or craniospinal irradiation is probably required as well as intensive intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy. Hopefully, current and future studies will dispel the uncertainties and better quantitate risks and benefits of alternative methods. Whatever method is used, careful attention to technical details is required to assure optimal efficacy at the least possible expense in immediate toxicity and late sequelae.","['Pinkel, D', 'Woo, S']","['Pinkel D', 'Woo S']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/prevention & control/therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Meninges/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/prevention & control/therapy']",104,1994/07/15 00:00,1994/07/15 00:01,['1994/07/15 00:00'],"['1994/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78743-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 15;84(2):355-66.,,,,,,,,,

It encodes a 683-amino-acid protein containing a secretory signal sequence and four homologous internal domains. Here we show that treatment of several types of cells, including human melanoma cells, human mammary epithelial cells, human keratinocytes, and human fibroblasts, with TGF-beta resulted in a significant increase in beta ig-h3 RNA. A portion of the beta ig-h3 coding sequence was expressed in bacteria, and antisera against the bacterially produced protein was raised in rabbits. This antisera was used to demonstrate that several cell lines secreted a 68-kD beta IG-H3 protein after treatment with TGF-beta. Transfection of beta IG-H3 expression plasmids into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells led to a marked decrease in the ability of these cells to form tumors in nude mice. The beta IG-H3 protein was purified from media conditioned by recombinant CHO cells, characterized by immunoblotting and protein sequencing and shown to function in an anti-adhesion assay in that it inhibited the attachment of A549, HeLa, and WI-38 cells to plastic in serum-free media. Sequencing of cDNA clones encoding murine beta ig-H3 indicated 90.6% conservation at the amino acid level between the murine and human proteins. Finally, the beta ig-h3 gene was localized to human chromosome 5q31, a region frequently deleted in preleukemic myelodysplasia and leukemia. The corresponding mouse beta ig-h3 gene was mapped to mouse chromosome 13 region B to C1, which confirms a region of conservation on human chromosome 5 and mouse chromosome 13. We suggest that this protein be named p68 beta ig-h3.","['Skonier, J', 'Bennett, K', 'Rothwell, V', 'Kosowski, S', 'Plowman, G', 'Wallace, P', 'Edelhoff, S', 'Disteche, C', 'Neubauer, M', 'Marquardt, H']","['Skonier J', 'Bennett K', 'Rothwell V', 'Kosowski S', 'Plowman G', 'Wallace P', 'Edelhoff S', 'Disteche C', 'Neubauer M', 'Marquardt H', 'et al.']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pharmaceutical Research Institute Seattle, WA 98121.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '148710-76-3 (betaIG-H3 protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA', '*Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.1994.13.571 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1994 Jun;13(6):571-84. doi: 10.1089/dna.1994.13.571.,,['&bgr;ig-h3'],,,['GENBANK/L19932'],,,,

The blast cells were cytochemically and immunophenotypically consistent with the acute myelogenous leukemia with minimal myeloid differentiation subtype of the FAB classification. From the review of the literature on blastic transformation of ET, acute leukemia with an M4 or M7 phenotype occurred more frequently. In addition, three valuable factors to predict the leukemic transformation of ET appear to be karyotypic abnormalities, such as involvement of chromosome 21, previous therapies with a mutagenic potential, and the capability of bone marrow cells to form in vitro spontaneous colonies as in CML.","['Shibata, K', 'Shimamoto, Y', 'Suga, K', 'Sano, M', 'Matsuzaki, M', 'Yamaguchi, M']","['Shibata K', 'Shimamoto Y', 'Suga K', 'Sano M', 'Matsuzaki M', 'Yamaguchi M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Blast Crisis/blood/etiology/pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/etiology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/*complications/pathology', 'Time Factors']",13,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000204260 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1994;91(2):84-8. doi: 10.1159/000204260.,,,,,,,,,

At present, lineage commitment of acute leukaemias can be achieved in more than 98% of cases by applying a standardized panel of mAbs to pan-B-cell (CD19, cyCD22), pan-T-cell (cyCD3, CD7) and pan-myeloid antigens (CD13, CD33, MPO) that are expressed either on the surface or in the cytoplasm of the earliest progenitors of the respective cell lineage. Further subclassification of ALL based on the analysis of antigens more closely associated with different maturational stages of B- and T-cell lineage has proven useful for the identification of biologically and clinically distinct entities in both B-cell precursor and T-lineage ALL. Immunophenotyping in about 2800 patients recruited for the German multicentre trials has shown that children and adults differ markedly in frequency distribution of immunological subgroups, with a higher adult incidence of immature B-cell precursor (i.e., pre-pre-B ALL) and T-lineage ALL immunophenotypes (i.e., pre-T ALL). Detailed immunological analyses using a broad panel of mAbs have recently documented typical ALL cases inappropriately expressing myeloid antigens (My+ ALL) as well as morphologically/cytochemically defined acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with lymphoid-associated markers (Ly+ AML). Based on our own results and a critical review of published data, leukaemic blasts in 5-20% of ALL patients disclose My+ ALL, whereas a coexpression, mostly of T-cell-associated antigens, can be identified in 10-25% of AML cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Ludwig, W D', 'Reiter, A', 'Schott, G', 'Schwartz, S', 'Thiel, E']","['Ludwig WD', 'Reiter A', 'Schott G', 'Schwartz S', 'Thiel E']","['Abteilung fur Innere Medizin mit Schwerpunkt Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Steglitz, Freie Universitat Berlin, Bundesrepublik Deutschland.']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/classification/diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/immunology']",70,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Wien Klin Wochenschr. 1994;106(8):231-2, 233-7.",,,,Immunphanotypisierung akuter lymphatischer Leukamien: Diagnostische Aspekte und klinische Relevanz.,,,,,

Photolysis of S-nitrosoglutathione at 545 nm exhibited a quantum yield of 0.056 +/- 0.002 and was best approximated by a first-order process with kobs = 4.9 x 10(-7) +/- 0.3 x 10(-7) s-1.

Amplified oncogenes can reside intrachromosomally, within homogeneously staining regions (HSRs), or extrachromosomally, within double minute chromosomes (DMs). Since previous studies have shown that low concentrations of hydroxyurea (HU) can eliminate DMs, we studied the use of HU as a gene-targeting agent in tumor cells containing extrachromosomally amplified oncogenes. In a neuroendocrine cell line (COLO 320), we have shown that HU can eliminate amplified copies of c-myc located on DMs, leading to a reduction in tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether the observed reduction in tumorigenicity was due to differentiation, we next investigated whether HU could induce differentiation in HL60 cells containing extrachromosomally amplified c-myc. We compared the effects of HU, as well as two other known differentiating agents (dimethyl sulfoxide and retinoic acid), on c-myc gene copy number, c-myc expression, and differentiation in HL60 cells containing amplified c-myc genes either on DMs or HSRs. We discovered that HU and dimethyl sulfoxide reduced both c-myc gene copy number and expression and induced differentiation in cells containing c-myc amplified on DMs. These agents failed to have similar effects on HL60 cells with amplified c-myc in HSRs. By contrast, retinoic acid induced differentiation independent of the localization of amplified c-myc. These data illustrate the utility of targeting extrachromosomal DNA to modulate tumor phenotype and reveal that both HU and dimethyl sulfoxide induce differentiation in HL60 cells through DM elimination.","['Eckhardt, S G', 'Dai, A', 'Davidson, K K', 'Forseth, B J', 'Wahl, G M', 'Von Hoff, D D']","['Eckhardt SG', 'Dai A', 'Davidson KK', 'Forseth BJ', 'Wahl GM', 'Von Hoff DD']","['Cancer Therapy and Research Center of South Texas, San Antonio 78229.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Metaphase', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/05 00:00,1994/07/05 00:01,['1994/07/05 00:00'],"['1994/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.14.6674 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jul 5;91(14):6674-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.14.6674.,PMC44265,"['HER-2', 'N-myc', 'c-myc', 'neu']",,,,,,,

The mouse TL genes constitute one of the best defined systems among nonclassical class I genes in the T region of the MHC. To elucidate the function and the evolution of TL genes and their relationship to classical class I genes, seven TL DNA sequences, including one from a Japanese wild mouse, were examined and compared with those of several mouse and human classical class I genes. The TL genes differ from either classical class I genes or pseudogenes in the extent and pattern of nucleotide substitutions. Natural selection appears to have operated so as to preserve the function of TL, which might have been acquired in an early stage of its evolution. In a putative peptide-binding region encoded by TL genes, the rate of nonsynonymous (amino acid replacing) substitution is considerably lower than that of synonymous substitution. This conservation is completely opposite that in classical class I genes, in which the peptide-binding region has evolved to diversify amino acid sequences so as to recognize a variety of antigens. Thus, it is suggested that the function of TL antigens is distinct from that of classical class I antigens and is related to the recognition of a relatively restricted repertoire of antigens and their presentation to T-cell receptors.","['Obata, Y', 'Satta, Y', 'Moriwaki, K', 'Shiroishi, T', 'Hasegawa, H', 'Takahashi, T', 'Takahata, N']","['Obata Y', 'Satta Y', 'Moriwaki K', 'Shiroishi T', 'Hasegawa H', 'Takahashi T', 'Takahata N']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', '*Genes, MHC Class I', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Mice/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1994/07/05 00:00,1994/07/05 00:01,['1994/07/05 00:00'],"['1994/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.14.6589 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jul 5;91(14):6589-93. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.14.6589.,PMC44248,['TL'],,,,,,,

Concomitant production of lysophospholipids suggests that phospholipases A2 play a major role in this fatty acid release reaction. The fatty acid release at acidic conditions depends on the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations at the 10(-8)-10(-7) M range and is enhanced by membrane-permeant diacylglycerols, although this enhancement seems independent of protein kinase C activation. On the other hand, the fatty acid release at alkaline conditions is potentiated by vanadate, and this potentiation is counteracted by genistein, suggesting a role of tyrosine phosphorylation in this release reaction. GTP[gamma S], an activator of G proteins, greatly enhances the fatty acid release. Aluminum fluoride, another activator of heterotrimeric G proteins, also greatly potentiates this release reaction. Phorbol ester increases the fatty acid release at alkaline conditions, to some extent, whereas it counteracts the vanadate-induced potentiation of fatty acid release. The results imply that several phospholipases A2 are coupled to receptors for their activation, thereby functioning in the transmembrane control of cellular events.","['Tsujishita, Y', 'Asaoka, Y', 'Nishizuka, Y']","['Tsujishita Y', 'Asaoka Y', 'Nishizuka Y']","['Department of Biochemistry, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', ""71376-97-1 (guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate))"", '8ZYQ1474W7 (Sodium Fluoride)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Electroporation', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/*metabolism', 'Genistein', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Guanosine Diphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*enzymology', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",,1994/07/05 00:00,1994/07/05 00:01,['1994/07/05 00:00'],"['1994/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.14.6274 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jul 5;91(14):6274-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.14.6274.,PMC44183,,,,,,,,

It was found that the sera of leukemic mice contained elevated levels of colony stimulating activity (CSA) when compared with normal mouse sera. Media conditioned by L1210 cells in vitro (L1210-CM) contained CSA which stimulated normal bone marrow myeloid colony growth and an auto-stimulatory activity (ASA) which stimulated L1210 cell proliferation. We studied the effects of trans-retinoic acid (RA) and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) on the production of growth substances by L1210 cells. When L1210-CM was prepared in the presence of RA and VD3, the CSA and ASA were markedly inhibited. A combination of the two agents was more effective than either agent. Mice inoculated with 1 x 10(5) L1210 suspension culture cells treated with either agent or both combined survived significantly longer than controls. Mice inoculated with L1210 cells treated with the two agents combined survived longest. By using antibodies, preliminary analysis of growth substances generated in L1210-CM showed that it contains primarily GM-CSF and M-CSF-like activities which were distinct from ASA. Combination antibody titer assays revealed that ASA was not significantly inhibited with anti-GM-CSF and anti-M-CSF antibodies, while CSA was inhibited by between 61 and 84%. We conclude that RA and VD3 synergistically inhibit the release of growth-enhancing substances by L1210 cells which may reduce the growth advantage of leukemic cells and the resulting leukocytosis in lymphocytic leukemia.","['Moqattash, S', 'Abraham, N G', 'Lutton, J D']","['Moqattash S', 'Abraham NG', 'Lutton JD']","['Department of Human and Clinical Anatomy, College of Medicine, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Pronase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/physiology', 'Growth Substances/*biosynthesis', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Pronase/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90091-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Jul;18(7):531-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90091-4.,,,,,,,,,

However, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) promotes the proliferation of these cells. TNF regulates some of its cellular responses via the transcription factor NF-kappa B. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrate that TNF treatment of B-CLL and HCL cells in vitro resulted in the augmentation of NF-kappa B levels. In haemopoietic cell lines, TNF induction of NF-kappa B is mediated via the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates and by the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). We have used activators and inhibitors of these pathways to unravel TNF signalling in the cells of ten patients with B-CLL and two with HCL, using the increase in NF-kappa B levels following TNF treatment as an end point. Raising glutathione levels with N-acetyl cysteine substantially reduced NF-kappa B induction by TNF in two of four samples tested. These data suggest that redox mechanisms are involved in TNF signalling in these cells. Treatment with the PKC activator phorbol myristate acetate failed to activate NF-kappa B suggesting that this enzyme does not mediate the induction of NF-kappa B in these cells. However, the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine inhibited TNF induction of NF-kappa B in four of five samples, suggesting that staurosporine-sensitive protein kinases (other than PKC) are involved in the signalling pathway. Our results suggest that PKC-independent pathways, including pathways sensitive to redox reagents, mediate the induction of NF-kappa B by TNF in chronic B-leukaemia cells. Additionally, these data suggest that defects in PKC-mediated pathways may contribute to the general reluctance of B-CLL and HCL cells to respond to mitogenic signals.","['Jabbar, S A', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Wickremasinghe, R G']","['Jabbar SA', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Wickremasinghe RG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, U.K.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1P9D0Z171K (Butylated Hydroxytoluene)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Butylated Hydroxytoluene/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*physiopathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90090-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Jul;18(7):523-30. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90090-6.,,,,,,,,,

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) undertook this phase II study of the new antifolate, trimetrexate (TMTX), to evaluate its response rate and toxicity in chemotherapy-naive patients with malignant mesothelioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were accrued to this protocol. Because of concerns about TMTX toxicity in patients with malignant effusions and/or hypoalbuminemia, the first 17 patients were treated at a dose of 6 mg/m2 daily for 5 days every 21 days. Because minimal toxicity was observed, the subsequent 35 patients were treated at a dose of 10 mg/m2. RESULTS: Two of 17 patients (12%) in the 6-mg/m2 treatment group had a partial response (PR) and four of 34 eligible patients (12%) in the 10-mg/m2 treatment group had a PR or regression (R) of assessable disease. No patient achieved a complete response (CR). Median survival durations were 5.0 and 8.9 months in the 6- and 10-mg/m2 treatment groups, respectively, while the 2-year survival rates were identical at 18%. At the 10-mg/m2 dose, toxicity was tolerable, with one toxic death from sepsis and a 12% rate of grade 4 thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients (age 1 to 20 years) with higher-risk B-lineage ALL were entered onto this protocol. Following standard four-drug remission induction, 80 patients received 12 intensive 2-week cycles of MTX/MP: MTX 200 mg/m2 i.v. push, then 800 mg/m2 i.v. 24-hour infusion on day 1; MP 200 mg/m2 i.v. in 20 minutes, then 800 mg/m2 i.v. 8-hour infusion day 2; MTX 20 mg/m2 intramuscularly day 8; and MP 50 mg/m2 by mouth days 8 to 14. Age-based triple intrathecal therapy (MTX, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine) was administered for CNS prophylaxis. Continuation therapy was weekly MTX/MP (as on days 8 to 14) for 2 years. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients (98%) entered remission. There were 28 relapses (marrow, n = 11; marrow and CNS, n = 2; isolated CNS, n = 9; testes, n = 5; ovaries, n = 1). No overt relapse occurred during the intensive phase of therapy. The event-free survival (EFS) rate at 4 years is 57.4% +/- 9.1% (SE).

CONCLUSION: Combined data from this and our previous trial suggest that intensive MTX/MP may produce long-term disease-free survival in 70 to 75% of children with B-lineage ALL. In comparison to other intensive regimens, intensive MTX/MP is easy to administer, effective, and relatively nontoxic. If patients at risk for failure of MTX/MP can be identified prospectively, more aggressive regimens could be restricted to this smaller (25% to 30%) cohort.","['Camitta, B', 'Mahoney, D', 'Leventhal, B', 'Lauer, S J', 'Shuster, J J', 'Adair, S', 'Civin, C', 'Munoz, L', 'Steuber, P', 'Strother, D']","['Camitta B', 'Mahoney D', 'Leventhal B', 'Lauer SJ', 'Shuster JJ', 'Adair S', 'Civin C', 'Munoz L', 'Steuber P', 'Strother D', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.']",['eng'],"['CA 03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*B-Lymphocytes', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.7.1383 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Jul;12(7):1383-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.7.1383.,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was a retrospective analysis of 214 patients reported to the Lymphoma Registry of the European Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) between January 1981 and December 1992, including 105 patients undergoing marrow transplantation in first complete remission (CR). Data on all patients were reviewed, and analysis of prognostic factors conducted. RESULTS: The actuarial overall survival rate at 6 years for the entire group is 42%. Disease status at ABMT was the major determinant of outcome: 6-year actuarial overall survival was 63% for patients transplanted in first CR, compared with 15% for those with resistant disease at the time of transplantation. Transplantation in second CR resulted in a 31% rate of actuarial overall survival at 6 years. For patients transplanted in first CR, univariate analysis failed to identify any factors at presentation that predicted for outcome after transplantation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ABMT is effective therapy for adults with LBL, even in patients with disease that is resistant to conventional-dose therapy. Results for patients transplanted in second CR are superior to those reported for conventional-dose salvage regimens. The results in first CR require verification in a prospective randomized clinical study.","['Sweetenham, J W', 'Liberti, G', 'Pearce, R', 'Taghipour, G', 'Santini, G', 'Goldstone, A H']","['Sweetenham JW', 'Liberti G', 'Pearce R', 'Taghipour G', 'Santini G', 'Goldstone AH']","['Cancer Research Campaign, Wessex Medical Oncology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.7.1358 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Jul;12(7):1358-65. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.7.1358.,,,,,,,,,

The earlier interpretation as a ""leakage"" of the blood-CSF barrier for serum proteins could be revised by introduction of a ""population variation coefficient"" of the CSF/serum quotients for IgG, IgA and IgM (delta Q/Q) which is evaluated as a function of increasing albumin quotients (QAlb). The data presented here are based on specimens from 4380 neurological patients. These population variation coefficients were found to be constant over two orders of magnitude of normal and pathological CSF protein concentrations (QAlb = 1.6.10(-3)-150.10(-3)). This constancy indicates that there was no change in blood-CSF barrier related structures with respect to diffusion controlled protein transfer from blood into CSF and hence no change in molecular size dependent selectivity. The pathological increase of plasma protein concentrations in CSF in neurological diseases could also be explained quantitatively by a decrease of CSF flow rate due to its bifunctional influence on CSF protein concentration: reduced volume exchange, and as newly stated, increased molecular net flux into CSF without change of permeability coefficients. Again, on the basis of a changing CSF flow rate, the hyperbolic functions, which describe empirically the changing quotient ratios between proteins of different size (e.g. QIgG:QAlb) with increasing CSF protein content (QAlb) can likewise be derived from the laws of diffusion as the physiologically relevant description. The hyperbolic discrimination line between brain-derived and blood-derived protein fractions in CSF in the quotient diagrams for CSF diagnosis can be further improved on the basis of the large number of cases investigated. Other physiological and pathological aspects, such as high CSF protein values in the normal newborn, in spinal blockade, in meningeal inflammatory processes, CNS leukemia or polyradiculitis as well as animal species dependent variations can each be interpreted as due to a difference or change in the CSF flow rate.","['Reiber, H']",['Reiber H'],"['Neurochemisches Labor, Universitat Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Neurol Sci,Journal of the neurological sciences,0375403,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Blood Proteins/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/*physiology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/*physiology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diffusion', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Nervous System Diseases/*physiopathology', 'Permeability', 'Reference Values', 'Rheology']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-510X(94)90298-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-510x(94)90298-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurol Sci. 1994 Apr;122(2):189-203. doi: 10.1016/0022-510x(94)90298-4.,,,['J Neurol Sci. 1994 Nov;126(2):240-5.

Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) specifically attenuated cysteinyl leukotriene production without affecting the biosynthesis of non-cysteinyl leukotrienes. The inhibition of cysteinyl leukotriene biosynthesis was prevented only by specific PKC inhibitors (staurosporine and bisindolylmaleimide) but not by inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (genistein, tyrphostin 47, and herbimycin A), protein kinase A (KT5720), or the oxidative burst (apocynin). Similar results were obtained when LTC4 synthase enzymatic activity was measured directly in the presence of saturating concentrations of exogenously added substrates. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of PKC activation on cysteinyl leukotriene formation in intact cells was attributable to effects on the LTC4 synthase enzyme. The mechanism of inhibition of LTC4 synthase by PKC activation was determined by kinetic analysis to be noncompetitive in both eosinophil-like HL-60#7 cells and monocytic THP-1 cells. Contrary to the effect of PKC activation on cysteinyl leukotriene biosynthesis, the formation of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 was elevated twofold to threefold after PMA treatment, which was prevented by the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine. We propose a regulatory model in which PKC activation shifts the profile of eicosanoid mediators produced by eosinophils from cysteinyl leukotrienes to prostanoids.","['Ali, A', 'Ford-Hutchinson, A W', 'Nicholson, D W']","['Ali A', 'Ford-Hutchinson AW', 'Nicholson DW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '118409-60-2 (tyrphostin 47)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 4.4.1.20 (leukotriene-C4 synthase)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cysteine', 'Down-Regulation', 'Eosinophils/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukotrienes/*biosynthesis', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phenols/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins/biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tyrphostins']",,1994/07/15 00:00,1994/07/15 00:01,['1994/07/15 00:00'],"['1994/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Jul 15;153(2):776-88.,,,,,,,,,

The limited number of primary cells available from marrow for analysis has brought attention to some leukemic cell lines which show enhanced megakaryocyte marker expression following incubation with inducing agents, the most common of which is phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). We developed an alternative induction protocol for the megakaryocytic leukemic cell line CMK, which involved incubation of the cells with IL-3 and the nucleoside analog, ribavirin, for 1-2 weeks. This treatment was neither toxic nor cytostatic and yielded increased levels of the surface glycoproteins GPIIb/IIIA and GPIb-IX. Levels of some megakaryocytic messages (GPIIIa, GPIX) showed a marked rise by 12 days of incubation in the inducer combination. This was due to a synergistic interaction between IL-3 and ribavirin which influenced both transcriptional and posttranscriptional events. Light and electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of large polyploid cells, with morphological features similar to those of megakaryocytes, in the induced cultures. Analysis of the heterogeneity of response in the cell population to the induction regimen after several days of treatment suggested that cells which failed to display surface markers had been stimulated by the inducers but did not have sufficient time to complete expression of that marker. The results were consistent with the view that the cells in the starting population were distributed along a temporal expression pathway, and those which were first to express the earliest marker would also lead in the expression of a later marker. The order of expression was the same as that during normal megakaryocyte development.","['Majumdar, A', 'Kerby, S', 'Stenberg, P E', 'Mullikin, B', 'Beckstead, J H', 'Cooney, D A', 'Seidman, M M']","['Majumdar A', 'Kerby S', 'Stenberg PE', 'Mullikin B', 'Beckstead JH', 'Cooney DA', 'Seidman MM']","['Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Rockville, Maryland 20850.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Surface/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry/metabolism/*pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/genetics', 'Ribavirin/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041600105 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1994 Jul;160(1):29-39. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041600105.,,,,,,,,,

The degree of the induction of nitro blue diformazan positive cells by the bufadienolides correlated well with their inhibitory activities against Na+,K(+)-ATPase prepared from K562 cells in vitro. N+,K(+)-ATPases from a variant K562 clone (ouabain resistant, OuaR) and murine leukemia cell line M1-T22, which were insensitive to the bufadienolides in terms of growth inhibition and cell differentiation, appeared to be refractory to bufalin in vitro. A binding study of 3H-bufalin and 3H-ouabain revealed that saturated levels of both ligands associated with K562 cells were virtually similar; however, affinity of 3H-bufalin was considerably higher than 3H-ouabain. The saturated level of 3H-bufalin observed in the OuaR cells was approximately half of that observed in K562 cells without a change in its affinity. Association of 3H-bufalin with K562 cells was completely blocked by pretreatment of the cells with cold ouabain at concentrations saturating the binding sites. These results suggest that bufalin acts on the cells by binding to sites on the cell membrane which also bind ouabain.

TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta are known to initiate signaling through a pathway involving hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide (Kolesnick, R. N., and Golde, D. W. (1994) Cell 77, 325-328). In this system, ceramide acts as a second messenger stimulating a ceramide-activated serine/threonine protein kinase. The present studies demonstrate that LPS, like TNF and IL-1, stimulates ceramide-activated protein kinase activity in human leukemia (HL-60) cells and in freshly isolated human neutrophils. Lipid A, the biologically active core of LPS, enhanced kinase activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. As little as 10 nM lipid A was effective, and a maximal effect occurred with 500 nM lipid A, increasing kinase activity 5-fold. Native LPS similarly induced kinase activation. This effect of LPS was markedly enhanced by LPS binding protein and required the LPS receptor CD14. In contrast to TNF and IL-1, LPS did not cause sphingomyelin hydrolysis and thus stimulates ceramide-activated protein kinase without generating ceramide. Molecular modeling showed strong structural similarity between ceramide and a region of lipid A.

In 2 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines, K562 and RWLeu4, the IC50 of AZT was 8 mumol/l and 28 mumol/l respectively, after a 5-day exposure, and the IC50 of HU was 80 mumol/l and 70 mumol/l respectively. In the presence of various concentrations of HU (1 mumol/l-100 mumol/l) the IC50 of AZT in both cell lines was significantly reduced and subsequent isobologram analysis revealed synergistic activity. Similarly, analysis of [3H]AZT incorporation into the DNA fraction of these cells indicated that exposure to AZT+HU resulted in an increased incorporation of AZT into DNA when compared to incubation in AZT alone. Biochemically, this effect appeared to be related to a decrease in dTTP pools caused by HU. The combination AZT+HU has also been demonstrated to exert a synergistic effect in inhibiting colony growth of bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) from patients affected by Ph1+ CML in chronic phase.

Colony forming assays were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 6 HCL patients. To remove HCs, PBMCs were subjected to complement-mediated lysis, T cells were removed by E-rosette formation. Assays were done with and without recombinant human (rh) interleukin-3 (IL-3) and rh granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). All 6 patients exhibited a severe reduction of their circulating progenitor cell (CPC) compartment. There was no correlation between the degree of colony reduction and the number of HCs. However, a correlation was found between the numbers of CPCs of HCL patients and healthy donors and the monocyte counts in these groups (r = 0.8573, p < 0.001). The removal of autologous HCs, but also of T cells, resulted in a significant increase in colony formation (BFU-E, CFU-GM, CFU-mix). In none of the experiments, however, did colony numbers come close to the normal range. This was only achieved by supplementation of the culture medium with rh IL-3 and rh GM-CSF. The results suggest that the haematopoietic failure observed in HCL patients is probably due to an inadequate supply of CSFs as well as to an inhibitory activity of HCs and T cells which might exert their effects in a synergistic fashion. There is also evidence that the lack of monocytes plays a role in the development of the haematopoietic insufficiency in HCL.","['Schwarzmeier, J D', 'Gasche, C G', 'Hilgarth, M F', 'Reinisch, W W', 'Gobl, S', 'Berger, R']","['Schwarzmeier JD', 'Gasche CG', 'Hilgarth MF', 'Reinisch WW', 'Gobl S', 'Berger R']","['Department of Haematology, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Granulocytes/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*physiology', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00093.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1994 May;52(5):257-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00093.x.,,,,,,,,,

Upon incubation of isolated nuclei for 45 min at 37 degrees C, we have found that two of the antibodies, directed against proteins of the inner matrix network (M(r) 125 and 160 kDa), gave a fluorescent pattern different from that observed in permeabilized cells. By contrast, the fluorescent pattern did not change if nuclei were kept at 0 degrees C. The difference was more marked in case of the 160-kDa polypeptide. The fluorescent pattern detected by the third antibody, which recognizes the 180-kDa nucleolar isoform of DNA topoisomerase II, was unaffected by heat exposure of isolated nuclei. When isolated nuclear matrices prepared from heat-stabilized nuclei were stained by means of the same three antibodies, it was possible to see that the distribution of the 160-kDa matrix protein no longer corresponded to that observable in permeabilized cells, whereas the fluorescent pattern given by the antibody to the 125-kDa polypeptide resembled that detectable in permeabilized cells. The 180-kDa isoform of topoisomerase II was still present in the matrix nucleolar remnants. We conclude that a 37 degrees C incubation of isolated nuclei induces a redistribution of some nuclear matrix antigens and cannot prevent the rearrangement in the spatial organization of one of these antigens that takes place during matrix isolation in human erythroleukemia cells. The practical relevance of these findings is discussed.","['Neri, L M', 'Santi, S', 'Marugg, R A', 'Riederer, B M', 'Capitani, S', 'Cataldi, A', 'Martelli, A M']","['Neri LM', 'Santi S', 'Marugg RA', 'Riederer BM', 'Capitani S', 'Cataldi A', 'Martelli AM']","['Istituto di Anatomia Umana Normale, Universita di Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)']",IM,,"['Antibodies', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nuclear Matrix/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(84)71199-2 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1994.1199 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1994 Jul;213(1):275-85. doi: 10.1006/excr.1994.1199.,,,,,,,,,

A marked enhancement of endogenous poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity in the cell was detected at a relatively early stage of cell death, whereas other nucleosides and nucleotides tested were ineffective on poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity, suggesting that the enzyme activation is closely related to apoptosis. The observed Ado effect was not mediated by Ado receptors, in contrast to the Ado-induced apoptotic death of thymocytes, judging from the facts that all of the receptor agonists tested did not substitute for Ado and that a receptor antagonist did not inhibit the effect of Ado. Ado transport into the cell seemed to be essential for the induction of apoptosis, since an inhibitor of Ado transport (dipyridamole) strongly suppressed apoptosis. Cytochalasin B blocked Ado-induced apoptotic body formation without affecting activation of endogenous poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity in the cell. Thus, the process of apoptosis in HL-60 cells induced by Ado seems to be separated into at least two steps, an initial step of DNA degradation and a following morphological change. While the adenine moiety of Ado was essential for its apoptosis-inducing activity, the sugar was replaceable, and various analogs with modified sugar were inducers of apoptosis, although they were less efficient than Ado.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Yoshihara, K', 'Tsuyuki, M', 'Kamiya, T']","['Tanaka Y', 'Yoshihara K', 'Tsuyuki M', 'Kamiya T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Nara Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Adenine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Adenosine/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Coformycin/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Deoxyguanosine/pharmacology', 'Guanosine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/physiology', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(84)71196-7 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1994.1196 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1994 Jul;213(1):242-52. doi: 10.1006/excr.1994.1196.,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, we have demonstrated that, during affinity chromatography, the CBP70-CBP35 association can be modified by the binding of lactose to CBP35. To determine whether the CBP70-CBP35 association could be disrupted in the nucleus upon lactose binding to CBP35, the behaviors of CBP70 and CBP35 were analyzed in membrane-depleted nuclei of HL60 cells, incubated with or without lactose. This study was performed by using an antiserum that cross-reacts with CBP35 and CBP70, an antiserum that was specifically raised against CBP70, and a monoclonal antibody (Mac 2) reactive against CBP35. Taken together, the results of indirect immunofluorescent staining, immunoblotting experiments, and quantitative flow-cytofluorometric analysis show that (i) CBP70 and CBP35 are present and colocalized in the nuclei incubated without lactose, (ii) all the CBP70 molecules left the nuclei incubated in the presence of lactose, while CBP35 molecules, probably bound to RNA, remained inside the nuclei, and (iii) glucose failed to have the same effect as lactose. These results strongly suggest that, in membrane-depleted nuclei, CBP35 and CBP70 interactions can be altered by a conformational change of CBP35 induced by the binding of lactose to its carbohydrate-recognition domain.","['Seve, A P', 'Hadj-Sahraoui, Y', 'Felin, M', 'Doyennette-Moyne, M A', 'Aubery, M', 'Hubert, J']","['Seve AP', 'Hadj-Sahraoui Y', 'Felin M', 'Doyennette-Moyne MA', 'Aubery M', 'Hubert J']","['Laboratoire de Glycobiologie et de Reconnaissance Cellulaire, INSERM U180, UFR Biomedicale des Saints-Peres, (Universite Rene Descartes, Paris V, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (saccharide-binding proteins)', 'J2B2A4N98G (Lactose)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Differentiation/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carrier Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Galectin 3', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lactose/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nuclear Envelope/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(84)71190-6 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1994.1190 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1994 Jul;213(1):191-7. doi: 10.1006/excr.1994.1190.,,,,,,,,,

DNA fragmentation occurs in two stages. The first is initiated by a previously undescribed endonucleolytic activity that cleaves DNA into 50- to 300-kb fragments. Electron microscopy showed that this degree of cleavage was sufficient to cause the chromatin to undergo condensation. The second stage of fragmentation is catalyzed by the previously described calcium-magnesium endonuclease. The enzyme activity responsible for the initial fragmentation of DNA was found to be distinct from that causing subsequent internucleosomal DNA cleavage based upon its cation requirements, independence of proteolysis and lack of inhibition by zinc. Both activities were found to preexist in nuclei from thymocytes, liver, HL60, and IL2-dependent CTLL cells. Thus, in apoptosis DNA degradation involves two distinct endonucleolytic activities, with only the first activity being essential for cell death.","['Walker, P R', 'Weaver, V M', 'Lach, B', 'LeBlanc, J', 'Sikorska, M']","['Walker PR', 'Weaver VM', 'Lach B', 'LeBlanc J', 'Sikorska M']","['Institute for Biological Sciences, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Nucleolus/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/enzymology/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/enzymology/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(84)71178-5 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1994.1178 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1994 Jul;213(1):100-6. doi: 10.1006/excr.1994.1178.,,,,,,,,,

In order to analyze the nature and the functionality of the IL-11 receptor we developed a proliferative assay using the human multifactor-dependent cell line TF1. We showed that a blocking monoclonal antibody GPX7 raised against the gp130/IL-6 receptor transducing subunit was also able to inhibit the IL-11-triggered TF1 line proliferation. In addition, involvement of gp130 in IL-11 signaling was demonstrated by an induction of the transducing protein phosphorylation in response to IL-11, as observed for IL-6. In contrast, the blocking monoclonal antibody B-R6, which recognized the gp80/IL-6 binding subunit failed to interfere with the IL-11 proliferative signal in the TF1 cell line. Similarly, we did not observe any competition between IL-6 and IL-11 for a putative common binding site on the cell surface. These results suggest that the IL-11 binding component is different from the gp80/IL-6 receptor.

One such protein is the heterodimeric enzyme phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). We recently found that this enzyme is also rapidly activated following TcR/CD3 triggering and that immunoprecipitated PI3K was activated in vitro by direct tyrosine phosphorylation. Here we show that TcR/CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PI3K in Jurkat T leukemia cells depend on the presence of the p56lck tyrosine kinase: in a variant of the Jurkat T cell line lacking p56lck, JCaM1, these responses were absent. We also show that p56lck directly activates PI3K purified from transfected COS-1 cells, indicating that other T cell-specific proteins are not required for the process. Finally, tryptic peptide maps show that p56lck phosphorylates three tyrosine residues in the p85 alpha subunit of PI3K and two in p110 of PI3K. Our results suggest that p56lck is required for activation of PI3K in Jurkat T cells and can itself directly activate it by phosphorylating one or several stimulatory sites.","['von Willebrand, M', 'Baier, G', 'Couture, C', 'Burn, P', 'Mustelin, T']","['von Willebrand M', 'Baier G', 'Couture C', 'Burn P', 'Mustelin T']","['Division of Cell Biology, Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],['GM-48960/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",IM,,"['Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830240137 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1994 Jan;24(1):234-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830240137.,,,,,,,,,

However, our analysis suggests, for the first time, that the bovine leukemia virus envelope head will not adopt the typical 'jelly-roll' fold of the influenza A hemagglutinin head, but most likely folds into another type of 'Greek-key' structure corresponding to the overall topology of constant immunoglobulin domains. We constructed a three-dimensional model for the bovine leukemia virus envelope head by homology modeling using the crystal structure of the human histocompatibility antigen HLA-A2 alpha 3 domain. Furthermore, we propose a general model for the oligomeric organization of this head, based on the hemagglutinin trimer. The proposed structural organization of bovine leukemia virus external glycoprotein is further supported by antipeptide and monoclonal antibody reactivities. Our modeling study suggests that the loops of the two neutralizing peptides located in the head are adjacent at the top of the domain and define a potential interaction site of the external glycoprotein with its cellular receptor. This site is topologically similar to the binding site of hemagglutinin with its cellular receptor, sialic acid. The other neutralizing peptides are located within a small domain linking the head to the stem. These data are of interest for defining other oncoviral glycoproteins heads and receptor-binding sites.","['Callebaut, I', 'Portetelle, D', 'Burny, A', 'Mornon, J P']","['Callebaut I', 'Portetelle D', 'Burny A', 'Mornon JP']","['Departement des Macromolecules Biologiques--Laboratoire de Mineralogie-Cristallographie, CNRS URA09, Universites Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Glycoproteins/*chemistry', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/chemistry', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/chemistry', 'Lentivirus/chemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*chemistry', 'Models, Structural', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Protein Conformation', '*Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Retroviridae/*chemistry', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb18879.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1994 Jun 1;222(2):405-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb18879.x.,,,,,,,,,

Industrial hygienists assigned hydrocarbon (HC) exposure frequency scores for several jobs, departments, and job functions. We computed standardized mortality ratios for the total cohort, HC exposure frequency groups, and tank truck drivers, and we also used Poisson regression techniques to model mortality for selected causes of death according to HC exposure frequency. Results indicate overall mortality below that of the general Canadian population for all marketing distribution workers [Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 0.88]. Mortality from aortic aneurysms was significantly elevated in all marketing/distribution workers (SMR = 1.79) but was due to raised mortality in nonexposed workers (SMR = 2.80). Tank truck drivers showed significantly elevated mortality due to leukemia (SMR = 3.35) based on five deaths. The leukemia findings were not evident in the larger group of marketing distribution workers classified as exposed to hydrocarbons (SMR = 1.01). No other cause of death was elevated in truck drivers. The leukemia findings are suggestive of a possible influence due to exposure to HCs in tank truck drivers, although other explanations cannot be ruled out. Other findings of elevated mortality in the marketing distribution group are generally not statistically significant. These included moderately increased mortality due to multiple myeloma, malignant melanoma, and kidney cancer. Small numbers of observed and expected deaths limit concise interpretations for these diseases.","['Schnatter, A R', 'Katz, A M', 'Nicolich, M J', 'Theriault, G']","['Schnatter AR', 'Katz AM', 'Nicolich MJ', 'Theriault G']","['Exxon Biomedical Sciences, Inc., East Millstone, NJ 08875-2350.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Hydrocarbons)', '0 (Petroleum)']",IM,,"['Canada/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons/adverse effects', 'Kidney Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Petroleum/*adverse effects', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.93101s685 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1993 Dec;101 Suppl 6:85-99. doi: 10.1289/ehp.93101s685.,PMC1519999,,,,,,,,

Over 99% of the workers were successfully traced. Their mortality was compared with that of all males in the national population. The mortality from all causes of death is lower than that of the comparison population in both studies, and reduced mortality is also found for many of the major nonmalignant causes of death. In the refinery study, some increased mortality patterns are found for diseases of the arteries, and no healthy worker effect is found in the distribution center study for ischemic heart disease. Mortality from all neoplasms is lower than expected overall in both studies, largely due to a deficit of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung. Mortality from malignant neoplasm of the kidney is increased overall in the distribution center study, and in drivers in particular. The mortality from this disease increases with increased time since first exposure. The observed deaths from leukemia are slightly less than expected in the refinery study and slightly more than expected in the distribution center study. One refinery shows increased mortality due to in myeloid leukemia, and mortality is increased among refinery operators.

Mortality patterns of distribution workers in the United States.,63-76,"In this study, the cohort consisted of 18,135 distribution employees with potential exposure to gasoline for at least one year at land-based terminals (n = 9,026) or on marine vessels (n = 9,109) between 1946 and 1985. The primary objective of the study was to determine the relationship, if any, between exposure to gasoline and mortality from kidney cancer or leukemia. In addition, other causes of death of secondary interest included multiple myeloma and heart diseases. The mortality of the cohort was observed through June 30, 1989. The results of this study indicated that there was no increased mortality from either kidney cancer or leukemia among marketing and marine distribution employees who were exposed to gasoline in the petroleum industry when compared to the general population. Among the land-based terminal employees, the kidney cancer standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 65.4 (12 deaths) and leukemia SMR was 89.1 (27 deaths). For the marine cohort, the SMRs were 83.7 for kidney cancer (12 deaths) and 70.0 for leukemia (16 deaths), respectively. More importantly, based on internal comparisons, there was no association between mortality from kidney cancer or leukemia and various indices of gasoline exposure. In particular, neither duration of employment, duration of exposure, age at first exposure, year of first of exposure, job category, cumulative exposure, frequency of peak exposures, nor average intensity of exposure had any effect on kidney cancer or leukemia mortality. For acute myeloid leukemia, a nonsignificant mortality increase was found in land-based terminal employees (SMR = 150.5, 13 deaths), but no trend was detected when the data were analyzed by various gasoline exposure indices. This nonsignificant excess was limited to land-based terminal employees hired before 1948. On the other hand, a deficit of mortality from acute myeloid leukemia was observed among marine employees (SMR = 74.2, 5 deaths). For the two cohorts combined, SMR for acute myeloid leukemia was 117.1 based on 18 deaths. We did not find any relationship in our study between gasoline exposure and mortality from multiple myeloma or heart diseases. In general, we did not find any significantly increased mortality, either overall or from specific causes, associated with gasoline exposure in this study of marketing and marine distribution employees.","['Wong, O', 'Harris, F', 'Smith, T J']","['Wong O', 'Harris F', 'Smith TJ']","['Applied Health Sciences, San Mateo, CA 94401.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['0 (Gasoline)'],IM,,"['Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Gasoline/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'United States/epidemiology']",,1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.93101s663 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1993 Dec;101 Suppl 6:63-76. doi: 10.1289/ehp.93101s663.,PMC1520018,,,,,,,,

Mechanistic studies suggest that gasoline is not mutagenic and that the probable mechanism for the male rat renal tumors involves a rat-specific protein, alpha 2u-globulin, whose binding with highly branched aliphatic compounds results in renal tubule cell death and, in turn, a proliferative sequence that increases renal tubule tumors.

To evaluate the probability that a specific degree of exposure will produce an adverse effect, risk assessment methods must be used. This paper reviews much of the published information and evaluates the various risk assessments for benzene that have been conducted over the past 20 years. There is sufficient evidence that chronic exposure to relatively high concentrations of benzene can produce an increased incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Some studies have indicated that benzene may cause other leukemias, but due to the inconsistency of results, the evidence is not conclusive. To predict the leukemogenic risk for humans exposed to much lower doses of benzene than those observed in most epidemiology studies, a model must be used. Although several models could yield plausible results, to date most risk assessments have used the linear-quadratic or conditional logistic models. These appear to be the most appropriate ones for providing the cancer risk for airborne concentrations of 1 ppb to 10 ppm, the range most often observed in the community and workplace. Of the seven major epidemiology studies that have been conducted, there is a consensus that the Pliofilm cohort (rubber workers) is the best one for estimating the cancer potency because it is the only one with good exposure and incidence of disease data. The current EPA, OSHA, and ACGIH cancer potency estimates for benzene are based largely on this cohort. A retrospective exposure assessment and an analysis of the incidence of disease in these workers were completed in 1991. All of these issues are discussed and the implications evaluated in this paper. The range of benzene exposures to which Americans are commonly exposed and the current regulatory criteria are also presented.","['Paustenbach, D J', 'Bass, R D', 'Price, P']","['Paustenbach DJ', 'Bass RD', 'Price P']","['McLauren/Hart Environmental Engineering, ChemRisk Division, Alameda, CA 94062.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*adverse effects/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Pollution/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', '*Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",268,1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.93101s6177 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1993 Dec;101 Suppl 6:177-200. doi: 10.1289/ehp.93101s6177.,PMC1520014,,,,,,,,

Of three recently conducted studies of gasoline-exposed workers, one shows strong associations with leukemia and MM, a second suggests some association with leukemia and did not analyze data for MM, and the third study is not possible to evaluate because of a major problem with study design. Other diseases of particular interest in relation to gasoline exposure are kidney cancer, malignant melanoma, and heart disease. One study suggests an association with kidney cancer, but the second study did not. There appears to be no association between employment in refineries or gasoline exposure and heart disease. However, evaluation of risk of kidney cancer and heart disease is somewhat difficult because investigators did not control for cigarette smoking, even though it is related to these diseases. This is of particular concern when studying gasoline-exposed workers, who because of the explosive nature of gasoline probably smoke less than the general population used for comparison of mortality. Some studies of refinery workers and gasoline-exposed workers in particular show an excess risk of death from malignant melanoma.

NK cell function was estimated by means of a radioactive chromium (51Cr) assay in which human erythroleukaemia K562 cells were used as the target. Diazepam suppressed NK cell function in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-7)-10(-5) M) and a positive correlation was found between the dose of diazepam and inhibition detected by percentage killing of K562 cells.

Electron microscopic analysis and immunohistochemical staining were also performed to examine the nature of the HTLV-I integrated SCCs. SCCs derived from all four patients consisted of either HTLV-I integrated or nonintegrated cells. HTLV-I integrated SCCs also produced viral messenger RNA which was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as well as viral protein which was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Phenotypically, these SCCs containing HTLV-I proviral DNA were shown to be all cell types as observed by electron microscopic analysis and immunohistochemical analysis.

The process of cell preparation, hybridization and visualization of the probes within the nuclei lasts between 16 and 24 h. Because of these features the method is ideal for monitoring engraftment after sex-mismatched bone marrow transplant (BMT). So far, the FISH technique has been applied to assess the degree of chimerism in either unseparated peripheral blood cells or unseparated bone marrow cells. However, for early detection of rejection or relapse, the degree of chimerism in subpopulations of cells is probably more informative. A new FISH protocol was developed with the aim of simultaneously visualizing the surface antigens by fluorescent antibodies and X or Y chromosomes with fluorescent probes. After development of the new FISH protocol, it was applied to patient samples after sex-mismatched BMT. The degree of chimerism was assessed comparing the results of the new FISH protocol with a 'standard' FISH protocol which is employed both in our and other laboratories to detect chromosomes in interphase nuclei. Both methods gave similar results. The new FISH protocol was applicable for the detection of Y and X chromosomes. The clinical relevance of this new FISH protocol is illustrated by the results obtained on peripheral blood samples of five BMT patients who were mixed chimeras after sex-mismatched BMT. A clear distinction between engraftment of T and B cells was noted. In some patients the T cells were of donor origin while the B cells were of host origin.","['Gerritsen, W R', 'Jagiello, C A', 'Bourhis, J H']","['Gerritsen WR', 'Jagiello CA', 'Bourhis JH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/genetics', 'Blood Cells/*chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chimera', 'Female', '*Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/therapy', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', '*X Chromosome', '*Y Chromosome', 'beta-Thalassemia/therapy']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Apr;13(4):441-7.,,,,,,,,,

The anticancer activity of VP-16 is thought to be schedule-dependent. We investigated a 6-h and a 34-h infusion of VP-16 to compare pharmacokinetic parameters and toxicity. Blood samples were taken from a total of 16 patients during infusion time (6 h and 34 h, respectively) and thereafter up to 2 days after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). VP-16 concentrations were measured in all plasma samples with HPLC technique and electrochemical detection and the results were analyzed with a pharmacokinetic data analysis system. All calculated pharmacokinetic parameters in the two patient groups were essentially similar. There were no statistically significant differences in half-lives, mean residence time, volume of distribution, total clearance and area under the curve. The treatment-related toxicity was not different between groups. The major difference was the maximal concentration in the case of 6-h infusions (122 +/- 35 micrograms/ml) and in the case of 34-h infusions (23.2 +/- 4.9 micrograms/ml) and the duration of VP-16 concentrations with > 10 and > 1 microgram/ml.

We hypothesized that use of unrelated donors with increased degrees of histoincompatibility, as determined by standard serological techniques, would be associated with increased difficulty in achieving engraftment and more frequent graft failure. Engraftment was analyzed in 108 patients with hematologic disease who underwent BMT from a fully serologically HLA-matched unrelated donor (n = 40) or a partially serologically HLA-matched unrelated donor (n = 68). These patients were compared with 236 patients who received BMT from matched sibling donors (MSD group) over the same time period. Primary graft failure occurred in 5% of the MSD group, 6% of the serologically matched URD group and 15% of the partially serologically matched URD group (p = 0.06). Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors relating to primary graft failure showed the only significant variable to be full or partial serological HLA-matching in the URD group. Secondary graft failure occurred in 0.7% of the MSD group, 15% of the serologically matched URD group and 25% of the partially serologically matched URD group (p < 0.0001).

The TCR gamma/delta repertoire was studied kinetically during the first month and then 1 year post-BMT whereas alpha/beta peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBTL) were studied within the first 3 months and 1 year post-BMT. Through these two studies, we found 7 of 26 patients with over-represented TCR gamma/delta subsets during the early period post-BMT. Moreover, during this period the V gamma 9V delta 2 frequency among gamma/delta T cells was found to be higher than among normal donors. Study on TCR alpha/beta T cells also revealed abnormally expanded V-specific subset (5 of 10 patients within 3 months following BMT) demonstrating that repertoire alteration early after BMT is a general phenomenon concerning potentially all T cell subsets. More surprisingly, the alpha/beta T cell repertoire was also found to be altered late after BMT (7 of 15 patients after 1 year post-BMT presented one or more overepresented alpha/beta TCR subset).

Since oxidative stress has been implicated in the signaling pathway, the use of antioxidants to inhibit NF-kappa B activation has gained attention. In the present study, we examined the effects of catechol derivatives, nitecapone and OR-1246, which have been identified to possess potent antioxidant properties, on NF-kappa B activation by monitoring its DNA binding activity. Both nitecapone and OR-1246 (10-300 microM) inhibited NF-kappa B activation induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in Jurkat T (acute human leukemia) cells. Nitecapone was a better inhibitor than OR-1246. The observed effects may, at least in part, be due to the ability of the two compounds to directly inhibit DNA binding activity of activated NF-kappa B. The inhibitory capability of OR-1246 on NF-kappa B DNA binding does not appear to be a sole mechanism, as it did not inhibit NF-kappa B activation induced by okadaic acid. Hence, catechol derivatives inhibit NF-kappa B transcription factor through multiple mechanisms, and nitecapone and OR-1246 may be useful as therapeutic agents targeting NF-kappa B.","['Suzuki, Y J', 'Packer, L']","['Suzuki YJ', 'Packer L']","['Department of Molecular & Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],['CA 47597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Catechol O-Methyltransferase Inhibitors)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pentanones)', '132759-68-3 (OR 1246)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '98BS722498 (nitecapone)']",IM,,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Catechol O-Methyltransferase Inhibitors', 'Catechols/*pharmacology', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Pentanones/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1994 Feb;32(2):299-305.,,,,,,,,,

At pH > or = 5, NCp10 binds one zinc atom and the complexation induces a folding of the CysX2CysX4HEsX4Cys box, similar to that observed for the zinc-binding domains of HIV-1 NC protein. The three-dimensional structure of NCp10 has been determined in aqueous solution by 600 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. The proton resonances could be almost completely assigned by means of phase-sensitive double-quantum-filtered COSY, TOCSY and NOESY techniques. NOESY spectra yielded 597 relevant structural constraints, which were used as input for distance geometry calculations with DIANA. Further refinement was performed by minimization with the program AMBER, which was modified by introducing a zinc force field. The solution structure is characterized by a well-defined central zinc finger (rmsd of 0.747 +/- 0.209 A for backbone atoms and 1.709 +/- 0.187 A when all atoms are considered), surrounded by flexible N- and C-terminal domains.

Nevertheless, establishment of genotype-phenotype relationships has been particularly elusive.

The results of the studies are as follows: (1) Among 65 patients investigated for the postremissional therapy, the 5-year survival probabilities were 0.20 +/- 0.13 (mean +/- SE) in the group treated with ATRA alone, 0.47 + 0.10 (mean +/- SE) in the group using chemotherapy alone and 0.42 +/- 0.09 (mean +/- SE) in the group treated with chemotherapy and ATRA. (2) The main severe adverse effects in the ATRA treatment include retinoic acid syndrome, renal failure, and thrombosis. These sequelae were observed more frequently in cases with persistent, marked elevation of white blood cell count without significant maturation of leukemic promyelocytes. (3) APL is not a homogeneous disease in that among 50 patients studied at the molecular level, although a PML-RARA fusion gene was detected in 45 cases, one had a variant translocation t(11;17) bearing fusion gene PLZF-RARA, one presented no obvious structural alteration of the PML gene while the RARA gene was rearranged, and three patients had no rearrangement of either PML or RARA genes. (4) Using RT/PCR to detect minimal residual disease, we found positive rates of 22%, 18.4%, and 11.5%, respectively, 12, 24, and 36 months after CR. This observation justifies the use of chemotherapy for at least 3 years after CR induced by ATRA.

Molecular studies have revealed that the leukemia cells in this disease use a restricted repertoire of conserved immunoglobulin variable region genes (Ig V genes) that generally have not undergone somatic mutation. Studies indicate that this polyreactive autoantibody activity expressed in CLL is dependent upon the third complementarity determining region (CDR) of the heavy chain variable region and on proper pairing of the Ig light and heavy chains. In this light, the high frequency at which CLL patients have leukemia cells that make IgM autoantibodies does not appear secondary to the genetic constraints on the potential diversity of the antibodies that may be expressed in this disease. Rather, even though they express nonmutated Ig V genes, CLL B cells appear to have been selected for their ability to bind self-antigens. Conceivably, normal B cells that express such autoantibodies may be perpetually stimulated, thereby increasing their risk for malignant transformation into CLL. Alternatively, anti-self-reactivity may enhance the survival of a B cell clone subsequent to its malignant transformation. In either case, the autoantibody activity of the immunoglobulins expressed by leukemia B cells may be an important factor in the etiopathogenesis of this disease.","['Kipps, T J']",['Kipps TJ'],"['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.']",['eng'],"['AG04100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,,"['Autoantibodies/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology']",39,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1993;19(3):615-25; discussion 631-2.,,,['Blood Cells. 1993;19(3):626-30; discussion 631-2.

This deoxyadenosine analog was selected from 25 candidate compounds because it was resistant to deamination by ADA and because it had a favorable therapeutic index. The lymphoid specific action of this drug is a function of the high deoxycytidine kinase and low 5' nucleotidase activity of lymphocytes. The drug appears to trigger apoptosis, very likely by preventing the repair of nicks in double-stranded DNA. Accordingly, 2-CdA has been found effective against a variety of lymphoid neoplasms. Hairy cell leukemia has proved to be most sensitive to its action, with approximately 80% of patients achieving a complete, long-lasting remission after a single five- or seven-day infusion. 2-CdA also shows promise in the treatment of autoimmune disorders.","['Beutler, E', 'Carson, D A']","['Beutler E', 'Carson DA']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],['RR00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,['146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)'],IM,,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",37,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1993;19(3):559-68; discussion 569-72.,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, GM-CSF induces rapid increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation and proliferative responses in HL-60 cells pretreated for 3 days in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Similarly, HL-60 cells pretreated with retinoic acid or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 were also capable of responding to GM-CSF. Interestingly, each of these treatments resulted in increased expression of the src-like tyrosine kinase hck. Stimulation with GM-CSF increased hck autophosphorylation in DMSO-treated HL-60 cells, suggesting that hck is a component of the GM-CSF signal transduction pathway. To determine if hck has a role in the DMSO-induced recoupling of the GM-CSFR, we overexpressed hck in HL-60 cells. The resulting cell line (HL-60/hck) expresses hck mRNA and protein at levels comparable with DMSO-treated HL-60 cells. Stimulation of HL-60/hck cells with GM-CSF results in activation of hck, increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and increased proliferation. These results show that cytokine receptors can exist in an uncoupled form and suggest that in HL-60 cells, appropriate levels of the src-like tyrosine kinase hck are critical for functional coupling of the GM-CSFR to biologic responses.","['Linnekin, D', 'Howard, O M', 'Park, L', 'Farrar, W', 'Ferris, D', 'Longo, D L']","['Linnekin D', 'Howard OM', 'Park L', 'Farrar W', 'Ferris D', 'Longo DL']","['Laboratory of Leukocyte Biology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, MD.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78800-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 1;84(1):94-103.,,,,,,,,,

ME-1 cells are responsive to colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-4, and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and exhibit monocyte-macrophage differentiation. We isolated three subclones, ME-F1 from ME-1, and ME-F2 and ME-F3 from two sublines of ME-1. These subclones had different morphologic, cytochemical, phenotypic, and cytogenetic features. They represented different monocytic-lineage differentiation stages and exhibited different responses to IL-3, GM-CSF, and especially IL-4. IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-4 enhanced proliferation and differentiation to macrophage-like cells in the ME-F1 subclone. However, they enhanced only proliferation of ME-F2 cells and only differentiation to macrophage-like cells in the ME-F3 subclone. To elucidate possible differences in signal transduction mechanisms in ME-F1, ME-F2, and ME-F3 cells following stimulation by CSFs, we studied the effects of IL-3 and IL-4 on protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Both IL-3 and IL-4 induced a rapid, transient decrease of cytosolic PKC in ME-F1 cells, but did not affect PKC activity in ME-F2 and ME-F3 cells. The PKC inhibitors, 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) and calphostin C inhibited IL-3-induced enhancement of proliferation and differentiation of ME-F1 cells, but did not inhibit enhancement of proliferation of ME-F2 cells and differentiation of ME-F3 cells. Our data suggest that PKC-dependent signal transduction is considerably related to IL-3-induced proliferation and differentiation of ME-F1 cells. In addition, it was demonstrated that the two subclones, ME-F2 and ME-F3, lost one of the two responses of ME-F1 cells to CSFs, either proliferation or differentiation, and simultaneously lost PKC-dependent response to CSFs.","['Yanagisawa, K', 'Sato, M', 'Horiuchi, T', 'Hasegawa, H', 'Fujita, S']","['Yanagisawa K', 'Sato M', 'Horiuchi T', 'Hasegawa H', 'Fujita S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Ehime University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78799-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 1;84(1):84-93.,,,,,,,,,

However, the physiologic function of annexin VIII remains unknown. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) the annexin VIII gene is highly expressed, but its expression is undetectable in the blasts of other acute leukemias. In the present investigation, we showed using the APL-derived NB4 cell line that expression of the annexin VIII gene is regulated at the transcription level during induced differentiation by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The half-life of the annexin VIII mRNA is about 5 to 6 hours, as determined by using actinomycin D as a transcription inhibitor. Analysis of the expression of annexin VIII protein in NB4 cells and in APL samples showed a consistent expression of a predominant 36-kD protein and a weak 72-kD protein. After ATRA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells, the annexin VIII protein level reduced gradually, but a detectable level persisted even after 4 days of induction. Because annexin VIII mRNA becomes undetectable after 48 hours of ATRA induction, this result indicates that annexin VIII is a relatively stable protein. A multiple tissue Northern blot analysis was performed, and we found that annexin VIII is normally expressed in the placenta and the lung. Cellular localization of the annexin VIII protein was determined by immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation. These results indicated that annexin VIII is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane. The annexin VIII is neither an extracellular protein nor associated with the cell surface suggesting that it does not play a role in blood coagulation in vivo. The plasma membrane localization and its property as a phospholipase inhibitor suggests that annexin VIII may have a role in the signal transduction pathway in the APL cells.","['Sarkar, A', 'Yang, P', 'Fan, Y H', 'Mu, Z M', 'Hauptmann, R', 'Adolf, G R', 'Stass, S A', 'Chang, K S']","['Sarkar A', 'Yang P', 'Fan YH', 'Mu ZM', 'Hauptmann R', 'Adolf GR', 'Stass SA', 'Chang KS']","['Molecular Hematopathology Program, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-55577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Annexins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)']",IM,,"['Annexins/analysis/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phospholipases A/physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78822-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 1;84(1):279-86.,,,,,,,,,

According to French-American-British criteria, these cases could not be classified as classical B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and its variant forms, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, or leukemic phase non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; follicular or intermediate type). The immunophenotype pattern (high surface Ig and CD25 expression, and little or no reactivity with CD5, CD23, and CD11c) and cytomorphologic features of these neoplasms suggested an origin in the marginal zone of the spleen. Molecular analysis did not show any involvement of the dominantly acting oncogenes generally associated with lymphoid malignancies (c-myc, bcl-2, bcl-1, Ras), but mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene involving exons 5, 6, and 8 were found in 6 cases (6 of 15, 40%). In 4 cases, the p53 alterations consisted of a point mutation leading to amino acid substitution. In the remaining 2 cases, an insertion or deletion resulting in a frame-shift of the protein was observed. In all but 1 of the cases, the wild-type sequence at the mutation site was barely visible, implying the loss of the normal p53 allele in leukemic cells. All of the cases showed a clinical course compatible with that of low-grade NHL, regardless of the p53 loss/mutation. Overall, our data suggest the existence of a form of splenic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma of possible marginal zone origin in which p53 inactivation may play an important pathogenetic role.","['Baldini, L', 'Fracchiolla, N S', 'Cro, L M', 'Trecca, D', 'Romitti, L', 'Polli, E', 'Maiolo, A T', 'Neri, A']","['Baldini L', 'Fracchiolla NS', 'Cro LM', 'Trecca D', 'Romitti L', 'Polli E', 'Maiolo AT', 'Neri A']","['Servizio di Ematologia, Istituto di Scienze Mediche, Universita di Milano, Ospedale Maggiore, IRCCS, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78821-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 1;84(1):270-8.,,['p53'],,,,,,,

Western blotting was used to determine the level of RB protein present in peripheral blood leukemia cells and results were confirmed in 26 patients by immunohistochemistry. The leukemic cells from 22/113 AML patients (19%) contained RB protein at levels that were equal to or less than the level of RB observed in the mononuclear cell fraction of peripheral blood from normal individuals (Low RB). Levels of RB greater than that of normal blood (Elevated RB) were seen in 91 patients (81%). The median survival of patients with low RB was significantly shorter than that seen in patients with elevated RB, 12 weeks versus 40 weeks (P = .02). Remission induction frequency was 36% in low RB patients compared with 68% in AML patients with elevated RB (P = .01). Multivariate analysis showed that low RB protein level was an independent prognostic factor predictive or poor survival after allowing for other known prognostic factors. These data suggest that a low level of the RB protein at the time of diagnosis is associated with shortened survival in AML patients because of inferior response to conventional therapy. Monitoring of the RB level could identify a subgroup of AML patients with an extremely poor prognosis when treated with chemotherapy alone, who would be eligible for alternative therapeutic strategies.","['Kornblau, S M', 'Xu, H J', 'Zhang, W', 'Hu, S X', 'Beran, M', 'Smith, T L', 'Hester, J', 'Estey, E', 'Benedict, W F', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Kornblau SM', 'Xu HJ', 'Zhang W', 'Hu SX', 'Beran M', 'Smith TL', 'Hester J', 'Estey E', 'Benedict WF', 'Deisseroth AB']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA54672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Cycle', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*analysis']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78819-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 1;84(1):256-61.,,,,,,,,,

Blasts from the remaining patients produced disseminated occult leukemia that was only detected by polymerase chain reaction.

No obvious association was noted between occurrence of leukemia in SCID mice and clinical or laboratory features presented by patients, including age, sex, or leukocyte count at diagnosis. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that leukemic blasts from children with newly diagnosed AML, especially inv(16) AML, can cause disseminated human leukemia in SCID mice without exogenous cytokine support.

Our results show that L-CFU has a heterogeneous but immature phenotype lacking on the expression of differentiation antigens (CD14, CD15, CD41a). In addition, we observed that the L-CFU phenotype is different from that of the whole blast cell population. Interestingly, L-CFU showed a higher expression of HLA-DR antigens with respect to their progeny. Upon analyzing whether the L-CFU phenotype was related to both the morphological and immunological features of AML blast cells, it was observed that, while there is no correlation with the FAB classification, there was a partial relationship between the immunological phenotype of AML blast cells and that of L-CFU. Accordingly, the more immature AML cases showed a more differentiated L-CFU phenotype (HLA-DR+, CD9+, FMC27+) when compared with cases with a more mature blast cell phenotype. These results suggest that those AML cases with a relatively immature myeloblastic phenotype may arise from a progenitor cell that has undergone partial differentiation and that is unable to acquire myeloid differentiation antigens, while those AML cases with mature blast cells might emerge from a very early L-CFU that has the capacity to undergo a greater degree of differentiation.","['del Canizo, M C', 'Almeida, J', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Orfao, A', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Lopez Borrasca, A']","['del Canizo MC', 'Almeida J', 'San Miguel JF', 'Orfao A', 'Gonzalez M', 'Lopez Borrasca A']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Tetraspanin 29', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01737422 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1994 May;68(5):233-6. doi: 10.1007/BF01737422.,,,,,,,,,

This forms a part of the bone marrow transplantation programme for the management of certain haematological malignancies at the Leicester Regional Centre. Between July 1986 and October 1990, we treated 31 patients with such a regimen. Full respiratory function tests (RFT) were carried out, prior to TBI, in the majority of patients. After a mean follow-up period of 34 months, 13 patients were alive; full RFT were repeated in all of them. Of the total of 31 patients, only one patient died, from late non-specific pneumonitis; in this case, high dose busulphan was added to conventional cyclophosphamide and TBI. Another patient died as a direct result of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Comparison of pre- and post-TBI RFT showed no resultant obstructive, restrictive or transfer factor defects. In the three patients who did not have pre-TBI RFT, post-TBI RFT did not reveal any significant change from expected values for age, sex and height.

From transient transfection experiments using the reporter plasmid containing exon 1 and its 2.3 kilobases upstream of the c-myc gene fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, it was indicated that this suppression was mainly attributable to the level of transcription initiation. Deletion down to 95 base pairs upstream of the P2 promoter did not change the suppressive effect of RA on c-myc gene expression. Mobility shift assays with respect to the P2 promoter region revealed that the 15-base pair fragment located between P1 and P2 promoters was responsive to the RA treatment. This fragment included the E2F binding site in the c-myc P2 promoter region, and a difference of shifted bands between RA-treated and untreated HL60 cells was due to complex formation of E2F and retinoblastoma protein. The present results suggest that E2F plays an important role in the process of cell differentiation by RA and that a change of the E2F binding pattern induced by RA contributes to the suppression of c-myc gene expression preceding granulocytic differentiation.","['Ishida, S', 'Shudo, K', 'Takada, S', 'Koike, K']","['Ishida S', 'Shudo K', 'Takada S', 'Koike K']","['Department of Gene Research, JFCR, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*drug effects/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1994 Mar;5(3):287-94.,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,

Differentiation of U-937 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of the serine/threonine protein kinase C, was associated with transcriptional activation of EGR-1 promoter-reporter constructs. The EGR-1 promoter contains six CC(A/T)6GG (CArG) motifs. The two 5'-most distal CArG sequences conferred TPA inducibility. In contrast, there was little effect of TPA on EGR-1 transcription in a TPA-resistant U-937 cell variant, designated TUR. Treatment of both U-937 and TUR cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, was associated with induction of monocytic differentiation and EGR-1 transcription through the 5'-most CArG element. Since these findings supported the involvement of serine/threonine protein phosphorylation in the regulation of EGR-1 expression, we studied activation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 serine/threonine kinases, pp70S6K and pp90rsk. Although both kinases participate in regulating cell growth, there was no detectable activation of pp70S6K during TPA- or okadaic acid-induced monocytic differentiation.

Primary cultures of 322 tumour samples were analysed. Both cyclosporins showed resistance-modifying activity in all haematological tumours tested, and in solid tumours activity was observed in ovarian carcinoma and childhood tumours. Little or no effect was found in the remaining tumour types, including breast, renal and adrenal cortical carcinomas and adult sarcomas. In most of the responsive cases the interaction between the modifier and the cytotoxic drug was synergistic. There was a tendency to higher activity in samples from previously treated patients, and an inverse relationship between degree of cytotoxic drug resistance and resistance-modifying activity was noted. No difference in potency between CsA and PSC could be discerned. The results indicate differential in vitro resistance-modifying activity of the cyclosporins depending on tumour type. The results also suggest that treatment with resistance modifiers should be considered also for primary therapy of drug-sensitive tumours.

In the sensitive HL60 cell line, ID50 and LD50 values of 5.6 and 5.3 microM, respectively (HePC), and of 3.8 and 4.2 microM, respectively (ET-18-OCH3) were obtained. In the more resistant K562 cell line, these values were 69.1 and > 97 microM, respectively (HePC) and 7.8 and 76.8 microM, respectively (ET-18-OCH3). Treatment of both cell lines with HePC and ET-18-OCH3 (25 microM) for 2 h did not lead to PKC translocation. However, a 30% reduction of PKC activity, mainly due to a decrease in the cytosolic compartment, was found. Half maximal stimulation of PKC translocation by phorbolester (TPA) in HL60 and K562 cells, which were pretreated for 2 h with 25 microM of the lipids, resulted in a 20-30% decrease of membrane-bound PKC, whereas the cytosolic form was found to be unchanged. In the same experimental setting, dioctanoylglycerol (DIC8)-stimulated PKC translocation was not affected by HePC or ET-18-OCH3. However, a 10-20% reduction of PKC enzyme activity in the membrane and in the cytosolic fraction was obtained. These findings indicate that HePC and ET-18-OCH3 do not interfere with PKC translocation but rather mediate a general decrease of the enzyme activity in the membrane and cytosol of the cells. Since the extent of PKC inhibition was somewhat similar in the sensitive HL60 and the resistant K562 cell line, inhibition of PKC is probably not a prerequisite for the antiproliferative action of HePC and ET-18-OCH3.","['Berkovic, D', 'Berkovic, K', 'Fleer, E A', 'Eibl, H', 'Unger, C']","['Berkovic D', 'Berkovic K', 'Fleer EA', 'Eibl H', 'Unger C']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Clinic Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', '53EY29W7EC (miltefosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(94)90428-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(94)90428-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1994;30A(4):509-15. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(94)90428-6.,,,,,,,,,

More recently, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis were noted in transgenic mice carrying the tax gene of human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). To evaluate the involvement of HTLV-I Tax in autoimmunity, its effect on expression of autoantigens was investigated. A metallothionein promoter-driven p40tax expression plasmid, pMAXRHneo-1, was stably transfected into Molt4 and Jurkat cells and the p40tax protein was induced with CdCl2. trans-Activation or trans-repression of autoantigens by HTLV-I Tax was studied by Western blot analysis utilizing autoantigen-specific murine monoclonal and rabbit polyvalent antibodies as well as sera from 161 autoimmune patients. Induction of p40tax of HTLV-I had no significant effect on levels of expression of common autoantigens U1 snRNP, Sm, Ro, La, HSP-70, topoisomerase I/Scl70, PCNA, and HRES-1. Expression of two potentially novel autoantigens, 44 and 46 kDa, was induced by p40tax as detected by sera of progressive systemic sclerosis patients, BAK and VAR. By contrast, expression of 24- and 34-kDa proteins was suppressed in response to induction of p40tax as detected by sera of systemic lupus erythematosus patients PUS and HOR. Because none of these patients were infected by HTLV-I, a protein functionally similar to p40tax may be involved in eliciting autoantigen expression and a subsequent autoantibody response in a minority of patients with PSS and SLE. Sera of autoimmune patients may also be utilized to detect novel proteins trans-activated or trans-repressed by p40tax of HTLV-I.","['Banki, K', 'Ablonczy, E', 'Nakamura, M', 'Perl, A']","['Banki K', 'Ablonczy E', 'Nakamura M', 'Perl A']","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York, Syracuse 13210.']",['eng'],['SO7 RR-05648-23/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,,"['Autoantigens/*biosynthesis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1994.10.303 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1994 Mar;10(3):303-8. doi: 10.1089/aid.1994.10.303.,,['tax'],,,,,,,

RA (0.1 microgram/ml) significantly potentiated calcium ionophore-stimulated production of LTC4 synthesis. DEX inhibited the RA-induced enhancement of LTC4 synthesis by up to approximately 95% in intact cells when stimulated with calcium ionophore. RA-induced LTC4 synthase activity, which was determined by enzyme assay, was also inhibited by DEX by 65% in a cell-free system. This discrepancy of inhibition between the intact and cell-free systems was due to a partial inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity by DEX in the intact cells. These results indicate that the production of LTC4 is predominantly regulated at a level of LTC4 synthase. The induction of new LTC4 synthase activity by RA and inhibition of the RA-induced activity by DEX are important regulatory mechanisms of LTC4 synthesis.","['Hamasaki, Y', 'Abe, M', 'Matsumoto, S', 'Ichimaru, T', 'Kobayashi, I', 'Tanaka, E', 'Matsuo, M', 'Hara, N', 'Miyazaki, S']","['Hamasaki Y', 'Abe M', 'Matsumoto S', 'Ichimaru T', 'Kobayashi I', 'Tanaka E', 'Matsuo M', 'Hara N', 'Miyazaki S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukotriene C4/*biosynthesis', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Rats', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1165/ajrcmb.11.1.8018338 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 1994 Jul;11(1):49-56. doi: 10.1165/ajrcmb.11.1.8018338.,,,,,,,,,

PBM cells exposed to BCF were evaluated by a standard cytotoxic assay, using K562 cells as a target, in the presence or absence of lymphokines. In vitro incubation of PBM cells with BCF resulted in a consistent decrease of NK cell activity (mean level of suppression about 50%; p < 0.001).

N, N' Bis-[3(ethylamino)-propyl]1-7- heptane diamine (BEPH), and its octane (BEPO), and butane (BESPM) derivative, were shown by electron microscopy and/or Rhodamine 123 uptake studies to alter the structural integrity of mitochondria when both cell lines were treated at the approximate IC50 dose of each drug. At this dose, BEPH had no marked effects on levels of the naturally occurring polyamines, putrescine, spermidine or spermine, in either cell line whereas BEPO and BESPM treatment did result in pool depletion. Southern blot analysis demonstrated a time and dose-dependent loss of mitochondrial DNA from BEPH-treated L1210 cultures suggesting that loss of mitochondrial integrity extended to the DNA level. Treatment of L1210 cells with all three analogs revealed marked reductions in the activity of two mitochondrial enzymes citrate synthase and cytochrome C oxidase. HeLa cells treated with all three analogs exhibited markedly reduced levels of ATP, complete loss of cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and near total depletion of uridine triphosphate (CTP) and near total depletion of uridine triphosphate (UTP). There was also a loss of colony forming ability in HeLa cells which could be nearly completely reversed by the addition of either uridine or cytidine suggesting that NTP reduction may be the primary antiproliferative determinant in these cells. Growth inhibition by BEPH in L1210 cells was markedly potentiated by the glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose, which had no such effect in otherwise untreated cells. This suggests that BEPH treatment of L1210 cells results in impairment of mitochondrial ATP synthesis and activation of the glycolytic pathway for energy production. 2-deoxyglucose treatment also completely prevented the increase of ATP by BEPH treatment of L1210 cells. It is concluded that all three bisethyl polyamines alter HeLa and L1210 mitochondria both structurally and functionally and that these alterations may play a primary role in the antiproliferative activity of these agents in HeLa cells. In L1210, the different spectra of cellular biochemical changes following bisethyl polyamine treatment suggests that additional mechanisms may be in effect.","['Snyder, R D', 'Beach, D C', 'Loudy, D E']","['Snyder RD', 'Beach DC', 'Loudy DE']","['Marion Merrell Dow Research Institute, Cincinnati, Ohio 45215.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '121749-39-1 (N(1),N(11)-diethylnorspermine)', ""122560-21-8 (N,N'-bis(3-(ethylamino)propyl)-1,8-octanediamine)"", ""132004-62-7 (N,N'-bis(3-(ethylamino)propyl)-1,7-heptanediamine)"", '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.57 (diamine N-acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.3.1 (Citrate (si)-Synthase)']",IM,,"['Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase/metabolism', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*metabolism', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Diamines/*toxicity', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1994 Mar-Apr;14(2A):347-56.,,,,,,,,,

The cleavage of rRNA from intact ribosomes was used as the assay for both RNase L and the increased endoribonuclease activities. Novel rRNA cleavage products (NCP) were generated by extracts of Ficoll-purified mononuclear cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients and in the granulocytic fraction of both patients and healthy controls. Determination of the time course of rRNA degradation demonstrated that the novel cleavage products were rapidly derived from the further endoribonucleolytic degradation of the RNase L derived specific cleavage products. Prolonged incubation of mononuclear cell extracts from healthy controls also yielded the novel rRNA cleavage products. Comparisons of the kinetics of NCP production suggest that the novel endoribonuclease activity can be approximately 240-fold greater in PBMC extracts from CML patients than controls. Analysis of peripheral blood WBC count and differential indicated that the increased RNase activities were associated with the presence of immature granulocytic cells in the peripheral blood (p = 0.001, Fisher's exact test). However, these activities were also found in the mononuclear cells of a CML patient in lymphoid blast crisis. Since CML is a stem cell disease, the novel endoribonuclease activity may be indicative of active disease, rather than a marker for immature granulocytes. Thus, the RNase L and increased endoribonuclease activities may play a functional role in the biology of chronic myelogenous leukemia and may be important in the mechanism of action of interferon therapy in this disease.","['Hubbell, H R', 'Kariko, K', 'Suhadolnik, R J', 'Brodsky, I']","['Hubbell HR', 'Kariko K', 'Suhadolnik RJ', 'Brodsky I']","['Department of Neoplastic Diseases, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA29545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA37020/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,,"['Endoribonucleases/*blood', 'Granulocytes/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/enzymology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*enzymology', 'RNA, Ribosomal/metabolism', 'Reference Values']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1994 Mar-Apr;14(2A):341-6.,,,,,,,,,

Based on data from the Danish Cancer Registry for 1943-1989, previous cancers in 831 anal cancer patients were compared with cancers in 12,376 matched population controls, and subsequent cancers in 955 anal cancer patients were compared with expected numbers based on population rates. Overall, previous cancers were in excess among anal cancer patients (odds ratio (OR) = 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.1). Elevated risks were observed especially for the vulva/vagina (OR = 15.4, 95% CI 4.9-48.0), cervix (OR = 4.3, 95% CI 2.7-6.9), and lymphoma/leukemia (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.5-10.4). Subsequent cancers were also in excess (relative risk (RR) = 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.7), particularly for the lung (RR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-3.7), bladder (RR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-4.6), breast (RR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3), vulva/vagina (RR = 12.3, 95% CI 4.0-28.7), and small intestine (two cases) (RR = 10.8, 95% CI 1.2-39.0). Colorectal cancers were reduced (RR = 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9). The data support a multifactorial etiology for anal cancer, in which an infectious agent and smoking may be involved. The association with lymphatic/hematopoietic cancers may indicate a possible role for immunodeficiency in anal cancer development. Multiple cancers occurred predominantly in patients diagnosed with anal cancer at a young age (< 60 years), which raises the possibility of a genetic predisposition for some cases. The authors recommend that, in future hypothesis generating and hypothesis testing multiple cancer studies of rare malignancies, the combined study of cancer events both prior to and following an index cancer should be considered.","['Frisch, M', 'Olsen, J H', 'Melbye, M']","['Frisch M', 'Olsen JH', 'Melbye M']","['Epidemiology Research Unit, Danish Epidemiology Science Centre, State Serum Institute, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Anus Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infections/complications', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', '*Population Surveillance', '*Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a117154 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1994 Jul 1;140(1):12-9. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a117154.,,,,,,,,,

However, the level of risk is nearly the same in both groups, about twofold, despite a tenfold difference in average dose to active bone marrow (8 Gy vs 0.7 Gy, respectively). High-dose cell killing has been postulated as one explanation for this apparent inconsistency. To examine whether chromosome aberration rates observed in lymphocytes many years after exposure might serve as population markers of cancer risk, blood samples were taken from 60 women treated for BGD (34 with radiation) and cytogenetic data compared with previous results from 96 women irradiated for cervical cancer. Remarkably, the rate of stable aberrations, which reflects nonlethal damage in surviving stem cells, was only slightly higher among the cancer patients. Thus the lower-dose regimens to treat benign disorders resulted in much higher aberration yields per unit dose than those for cervical cancer. Assuming that the fraction of cytogenetically aberrant stem cells that survive radiotherapy contributes to the leukemogenic process, these data are then consistent with the epidemiological observations of comparable overall leukemia risks seen in these two irradiated populations. Accordingly, for patient populations given partial-body radiotherapy, stable aberrations at a long time after exposure appear to serve as biomarkers of effective risk rather than as biomarkers of radiation dose received.","['Kleinerman, R A', 'Littlefield, L G', 'Tarone, R E', 'Sayer, A M', 'Cookfair, D L', 'Wactawski-Wende, J', 'Inskip, P D', 'Block, A', 'Ramesh, K H', 'Boice, J D Jr']","['Kleinerman RA', 'Littlefield LG', 'Tarone RE', 'Sayer AM', 'Cookfair DL', 'Wactawski-Wende J', 'Inskip PD', 'Block A', 'Ramesh KH', 'Boice JD Jr']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['N01-CP8-5604/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP9-5614/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Y01-CP-80505/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphocytes/*radiation effects', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Uterine Diseases/*radiotherapy']",,1994/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1994 Jul;139(1):40-6.,,,,,,,,,

These findings suggest that cytoprotection against photoperoxidation and photokilling is mediated at least in part by selenoperoxidase (SePX) action. Similar protection against photoinactivation of an intrinsic membrane enzyme, the Na+,K(+)-ATPase, has been observed. Thus, irradiation of MC540-sensitized Se(-) cells resulted in an immediate and progressive inactivation of ouabain-sensitive Na+,K(+)-ATPase; by contrast, activity loss in Se(+) cells was preceded by a prominent lag. Enzyme photo-inactivation in Se(-) cells was inhibited by ebselen, an SePX mimetic, confirming that SePX(s) is (are) involved in natural protection. Desferrioxamine treatment (iron sequestration/inactivation) resulted in higher hydroperoxide levels and slower Na+,K(+)-ATPase inactivation during MC540/light exposure, whereas ferric-8-hydroxyquinoline treatment (iron supplementation) had the opposite effect. Thus, iron appears to play an important role in both of these processes. In contrast, photoinactivation of another intrinsic enzyme in L1210 cells, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), was unaffected by selenium or iron manipulation. On the basis of these findings, we propose that lipid peroxidation plays an important role in the photoinactivation of Na+,K(+)-ATPase, but not AChE. This is consistent with the fact that Na+,K(+)-ATPase's active site lies within the membrane bilayer, whereas AChE's active site lies outside the bilayer.","['Lin, F', 'Girotti, A W']","['Lin F', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],['1-PO1-CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Light', 'Lipid Peroxidation/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Photochemistry', 'Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Selenium/deficiency', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/antagonists & inhibitors/*radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1994.tb05041.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1994 Mar;59(3):320-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1994.tb05041.x.,,,,,,,,,

We have now found that curcumin is also phototoxic to mammalian cells, using a rat basophilic leukemia cell model, and that this phototoxicity again requires the presence of oxygen. The spectral and photochemical properties of curcumin vary with environment, resulting in the potential for multiple or alternate pathways for the exertion of photodynamic effects. For example, curcumin photogenerates singlet oxygen and reduced forms of molecular oxygen under several conditions relevant to cellular environments. In addition, we detected carbon-centered radicals, which may lead to oxidation products (see accompanying paper). Such products may be important reactants in curcumin's phototoxicity since singlet oxygen and reduced oxygen species alone could not explain the biological results, such as the relatively long lifetime (t1/2 = 27 s) of the toxicant responsible for decreased cell viability.","['Dahl, T A', 'Bilski, P', 'Reszka, K J', 'Chignell, C F']","['Dahl TA', 'Bilski P', 'Reszka KJ', 'Chignell CF']","['Department of Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics, School of Veterinary Medicine, Tufts University, Boston, MA 02111.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Curcumin/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Photochemistry', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1994.tb05036.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1994 Mar;59(3):290-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1994.tb05036.x.,,,,,,,,,

These include 2 of 19 patients with normal karyotypes as well as 3 of 4 patients with trisomy 11. To characterize the abnormal ALL-1 genes, we cloned the ALL-1 rearrangements from two patients with trisomy 11. Characterization of the clones, together with Southern blot analysis, indicates that the ALL-1 rearrangement in both patients is the result of a direct tandem duplication of a portion of the ALL-1 gene spanning exons 2-6. The partial ALL-1 duplication is also detected by Southern blot analysis in a patient with a normal karyotype. RNA PCR and DNA sequence analysis show that the partially duplicated ALL-1 gene is transcribed into mRNA capable of encoding a partially duplicated protein. Partial duplication of ALL-1, in which a portion of a putative protooncogene is fused with itself, represents an additional genetic mechanism for leukemogenesis.

The loss of E2A-tal-1 DNA binding is correlated with elevated expression of mRNA encoding the dominant negative HLH proteins, Id1 and particularly Id2. Moreover, recombinant Id proteins inhibit the E2A-tal-1-specific DNA binding activity from undifferentiated M1 cells. These results suggest that E2A-tal-1 heterodimers may play a role in preventing terminal differentiation in the myeloid lineage and provide a possible explanation for oncogenic transformation induced by ectopic tal-1 expression in acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias.","['Voronova, A F', 'Lee, F']","['Voronova AF', 'Lee F']","['DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Palo Alto, CA 94304-1104.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (Idb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf7l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmacytoma', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Repressor Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/06/21 00:00,1994/06/21 00:01,['1994/06/21 00:00'],"['1994/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.13.5952 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jun 21;91(13):5952-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.13.5952.,PMC44115,['E2A'],,,,,,,

The TAL1 gene products possess a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif, a protein-dimerization and DNA-binding domain found in several transcription factors. TAL1 polypeptides interact, in vitro and in vivo, with class A bHLH proteins (e.g., E47) to form heterodimers with sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. In this study, we show that TAL1 can regulate the transcription of an artificial reporter gene that contains binding sites for bHLH heterodimers involving TAL1. Transcription of the reporter is strongly induced by E47-E47 homodimers and moderately induced by TAL1-E47 heterodimers. Thus, in a cellular environment that allows formation of E47-E47 homodimers (e.g., in the absence of Id regulatory proteins) TAL1 can repress transcription by recruiting E47 into bHLH complexes with less transcriptional activity (i.e., TAL1-E47 heterodimers). However, in other settings TAL1 can activate transcription because TAL1-E47 heterodimers are more resistant to negative regulation by Id proteins. Hence, TAL1 can potentially regulate transcription in either a positive or negative fashion.","['Hsu, H L', 'Wadman, I', 'Tsan, J T', 'Baer, R']","['Hsu HL', 'Wadman I', 'Tsan JT', 'Baer R']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['eng'],['CA46593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Idb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Repressor Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",,1994/06/21 00:00,1994/06/21 00:01,['1994/06/21 00:00'],"['1994/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.13.5947 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jun 21;91(13):5947-51. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.13.5947.,PMC44114,"['SCL', 'TAL1', 'TCL5']",,,,,,,

We have previously shown that residue 21 in the first helix of GM-CSF plays a critical role in both biological activity and high-affinity receptor binding. We have now generated analogues of GM-CSF mutated at residue 21, expressed them in Escherichia coli, and examined them for binding, agonistic, and antagonistic activities. Binding experiments showed that GM E21A, E21Q, E21F, E21H, E21R, and E21K bound to the GM-CSF receptor alpha chain with a similar affinity to wild-type GM-CSF and had lost high-affinity binding to the GM-CSF receptor alpha-chain-common beta-chain complex. From these mutants, only the charge reversal mutants E21R and E21K were completely devoid of agonistic activity. Significantly we found that E21R and E21K antagonized the proliferative effect of GM-CSF on the erythroleukemic cell line TF-1 and primary acute myeloid leukemias, as well as GM-CSF-mediated stimulation of neutrophil superoxide production. This antagonism was specific for GM-CSF in that no antagonism of interleukin 3-mediated TF-1 cell proliferation or tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated stimulation of neutrophil superoxide production was observed. E. coli-derived GM E21R and E21K were effective antagonists of both nonglycosylated and glycosylated wild-type GM-CSF. These results show that low-affinity GM-CSF binding can be dissociated from receptor activation and have potential clinical significance for the management of inflammatory diseases and certain leukemias where GM-CSF plays a pathogenic role.","['Hercus, T R', 'Bagley, C J', 'Cambareri, B', 'Dottore, M', 'Woodcock, J M', 'Vadas, M A', 'Shannon, M F', 'Lopez, A F']","['Hercus TR', 'Bagley CJ', 'Cambareri B', 'Dottore M', 'Woodcock JM', 'Vadas MA', 'Shannon MF', 'Lopez AF']","['Division of Human Immunology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],['CA 45822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, Arg(21)-)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', '*Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,1994/06/21 00:00,1994/06/21 00:01,['1994/06/21 00:00'],"['1994/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.13.5838 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jun 21;91(13):5838-42. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.13.5838.,PMC44092,,,,,,,,

Although physicochemical studies of Escherichia coli-derived IFN-gamma, as well as its crystal structure, demonstrate that it is a homodimer in solution (M(r) 34,000), previous radiation inactivation studies yielded a functional size for IFN-gamma of 63-73 kDa in an antiviral assay. To understand the relationship between the solution form of IFN-gamma and the moiety that actually binds to the cellular receptor and activates cells, we examined irradiated nonradioactive and 32P-labeled IFN-gamma for its migration in SDS/polyacrylamide gels (to determine its physical integrity), its binding to cells, its reactivity in an ELISA, and its antiviral activity. The functional size of IFN-gamma differed in the assays, being 22 +/- 2 kDa for the physical destruction of IFN-gamma, 56 +/- 2 kDa for the cellular binding assay, 45-50 kDa for reactivity in the ELISA, and 72 +/- 6 kDa for antiviral activity. The results from the binding assays constitute direct evidence that IFN-gamma binds to its cellular receptor as a dimer. However, for antiviral activity, the functional mass is equivalent to a tetramer. This is consistent with models involving ligand-induced receptor dimerization, whereby two dimers acting in concert (equivalent to the target size of a tetramer) are required to activate cells in the antiviral assay.","['Langer, J A', 'Rashidbaigi, A', 'Garotta, G', 'Kempner, E']","['Langer JA', 'Rashidbaigi A', 'Garotta G', 'Kempner E']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway 08854.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Encephalomyocarditis virus/*drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Escherichia coli', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/chemistry/*radiation effects/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Receptors, Interferon/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*drug effects']",,1994/06/21 00:00,1994/06/21 00:01,['1994/06/21 00:00'],"['1994/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.13.5818 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jun 21;91(13):5818-22. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.13.5818.,PMC44088,,,,,,,,

Expression in vivo in inflamed human vessels and atherosclerotic human and Watanabe rabbit vessels.,836-49,"BACKGROUND: Monocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium, an important component of an inflammatory response, is one of the earliest detected events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We have identified a monocyte adhesion molecule, recognized by monoclonal antibody (mAb) IG9, on the cell surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1, or lipopolysaccharide. Endothelial cell expression in vitro and in vivo of the protein recognized by mAb IG9 (IG9 protein) was further characterized. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The kinetics of cytokine-induced IG9 protein expression on HUVEC were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. TNF-alpha-treated HUVEC surface proteins, labeled with [125I]Na, were solubilized in NP-40 detergent and immunoprecipitated with mAb IG9 to determine the molecular weight of the IG9 protein. The functional role of the IG9 protein in monocyte binding in vitro to cytokine-activated endothelial cells was established in adhesion assays utilizing U937 cells (human promyelomonocytic cell line) and human peripheral blood monocytes. Minimally oxidized or modified low density lipoproteins (MM-LDL) have previously been shown to induce monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells for up to 48 hours after exposure. In order to characterize the adhesion molecule(s) contributing to this increase in monocyte binding, MM-LDL-treated HUVEC and human aortic endothelial cells were assayed for monocyte adhesion molecule expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, mAb IG9-mediated alterations in MM-LDL-induced monocyte binding were studied in endothelial-monocyte adhesion assays. To assess IG9 protein expression in vivo, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of inflamed human tissues obtained from lung and healing myocardial infarctions, in addition to sections of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Tissue sections from atherosclerotic Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit aortas were also included in these studies. RESULTS: The IG9 protein, undetected on untreated HUVEC, was expressed on their cell surface within 3 hours of treatment with TNF-alpha, peaked at 4 to 9 hours, and persisted for up to 48 hours as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A similar kinetic profile was elicited by interleukin-1 and lipopolysaccharide, whereas interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) had minimal effect on IG9 expression. The IG9 protein has a molecular weight of 105,000 as determined by immunoprecipitation studies with TNF-alpha-treated HUVEC protein lysates. mAb IG9 significantly inhibited the binding of U937 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes to TNF-alpha-treated HUVEC and had no effect on peripheral blood lymphocyte or granulocyte adhesion. Treatment of human aortic endothelial cells or HUVEC with MM-LDL for 24 hours induced IG9 protein expression 3-fold above background with no concomitant increase in binding of antibodies to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin, or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), endothelial cell adhesion proteins involved in monocyte binding. mAb IG9 F(ab')2 inhibited MM-LDL-induced monocyte adhesion to HAEC by 23%. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the endothelial cell lining of vessels in human lung and heart with evidence of inflammation characterized by an extensive mononuclear cell infiltration exhibited reactivity with mAb IG9, whereas vessels with no evidence of inflammation in the same sections as well as in sections from normal lung and heart were nonreactive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Calderon, T M', 'Factor, S M', 'Hatcher, V B', 'Berliner, J A', 'Berman, J W']","['Calderon TM', 'Factor SM', 'Hatcher VB', 'Berliner JA', 'Berman JW']","['Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.']",['eng'],"['CA09173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL30568/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL37025/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Aorta', 'Arteriosclerosis/*metabolism/*pathology', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coronary Vessels/*metabolism/pathology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lung/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Umbilical Veins']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1994 Jun;70(6):836-49.,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Immunoglobulins (Ig) and cardiolipin reactivity were evaluated in red blood cell (RBC) eluates and in the sera of patients with SLE and controls by a solid phase enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: aCL were detected in sera of 2 patients with SLE with active hemolytic anemia. The RBC eluates of these patients contained Ig (mainly IgG) with significant cardiolipin reactivity. RBC eluates from healthy volunteers failed to demonstrate measurable amounts of Ig whereas Ig eluted from RBC of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with active hemolysis but no aCL did not react with cardiolipin. Furthermore, under treatment, one patient went into complete remission with resolution of the hemolysis, negative Coombs' tests and lower serum aCL. The other patient, however, continued to demonstrate both high sera aCL and positive Coombs' tests.

Leukotriene (LT)D4 induced a concentration-dependent biphasic response consisting of a transient phase (up to 5-fold peak increase) followed by a sustained phase, showing characteristics of a receptor-operated calcium channel. Homologous desensitization to LTD4 was observed. The responses to LTD4 were reduced by 80 to 90% in calcium-free buffer. The responses to LTD4 in a calcium-free buffer were dependent upon the duration of prior exposure of the cells to a calcium-free environment. The response at 30 or 60 min after exposure to calcium-free buffer was greater than that at earlier time points (time-dependent sensitization). Similar responses were obtained with THP-1 cells exposed to EDTA-containing buffer. It is speculated that such time-dependent sensitization is a result of changes at the receptor level. The responses to LTD4 were blocked by two specific LTD4 antagonists, MK-0571 and ICI-204,219, in a concentration-dependent manner. When given after addition of LTD4, MK-0571 or ICI-204,219 reversed the sustained phase of the LTD4-induced response, suggesting that maintenance of the response requires persistent activation of the LTD4 receptor. ICI-204,219 was 5 to 10 times more potent than MK-0571 (IC50 values of 1.1 and 9.3 nM, respectively), in agreement with results from radioligand binding studies reported separately.","['Chan, C C', 'Ecclestone, P', 'Nicholson, D W', 'Metters, K M', 'Pon, D J', 'Rodger, I W']","['Chan CC', 'Ecclestone P', 'Nicholson DW', 'Metters KM', 'Pon DJ', 'Rodger IW']","['Department of Pharmacology, Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research, Kirkland, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leukotriene Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phenylcarbamates)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tosyl Compounds)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', '73836-78-9 (Leukotriene D4)', 'AJT72OTM42 (cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2)', 'LRF7RW46ID (leukotriene D4 receptor)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'XZ629S5L50 (zafirlukast)']",IM,,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukotriene Antagonists', 'Leukotriene D4/*pharmacology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Phenylcarbamates', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Leukotriene/*physiology', 'Sulfonamides', 'Tosyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1994 Jun;269(3):891-6.,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric analysis allowed evaluation of the relative number of apoptotic cells (APC) to apoptotic bodies (APB) with a sub G0/G1 DNA content. Addition of 1 mM Hcy to HL-60 cells exposed to 5 to 100 microM c3Ado was followed by a large increase in the number of APC and a simultaneous decrease in the number of APB. The effects of Hcy on both the formation of APC and APB was dose-dependent; however, Hcy concentrations above 250 microM were required for inhibition of APB formation to take place. Fluorescence microscopic examination of unfixed cells stained with acridine orange demonstrated different morphology of APC between cultures treated with c3Ado or c3Ado plus Hcy. Whereas APC in cultures treated with 100 microM c3Ado displayed pronounced cytoplasmic membrane blebbing, only minor blebbing was displayed by APC in cultures treated with 25 microM c3Ado and 1 mM Hcy. Extensive nuclear fragmentation was observed in APC regardless of Hcy addition. By cell sorting we demonstrate the presence of APC with the same DNA content as viable G0/G1 and S-phase cells in cultures treated with 25 microM c3Ado and 1 mM Hcy, indicating that cells in all cell cycle phases undergo apoptosis in these cultures. Neither the formation of APC nor APB in apoptosis initiated by cycloheximide or dactinomycin were influenced by 1 mM Hcy.

It has been shown that the density of cells in culture can modulate the growth regulatory activities of TNF, the mechanism of which, however, is not understood. In this report, we investigated the effect of cell density on the expression of TNF receptors. The receptors were examined on epithelial cells (e.g., HeLa), which primarily express the p60 form, and on myeloid cells (e.g., HL-60) known to express mainly the p80 form. We observed that binding of TNF to both cell lines decreased with increase in cell density. Scatchard analysis of binding on HeLa and HL-60 cells revealed a 4- to 5-fold reduction in the number of TNF receptors without any significant change in receptor affinity in both cell types at high density. The decrease in TNF receptor numbers at high cell density was also observed in several other epithelial and myeloid cell lines. The downmodulation at high cell density was unique to TNF receptors, since minimum change in other cell surface proteins was observed as revealed by fluorescent activated cell sorter analysis. Neutralization of binding with antibodies specific to each type of the receptors revealed that both the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor were equally downmodulated. A decrease in leucine incorporation into proteins was observed with increase in cell density, suggesting a reduction in protein synthesis. Since inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide also leads to a decrease in TNF receptors, it is possible that the density-dependent reduction in TNF receptor number is due to an overall decrease in protein synthesis. The density-dependent decrease in TNF receptors was accompanied by a decrease in intracellular reduced glutathione levels. A reduction in the number of receptors on TNF sensitive tumor cells induced by cell-density correlated with increase in resistance to the cytokine.","['Pocsik, E', 'Mihalik, R', 'Ali-Osman, F', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Pocsik E', 'Mihalik R', 'Ali-Osman F', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.

This effect was far stronger than that of VP-16. However, it did not show any marked effect on topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage. BE-22179 was ineffective in inhibiting the DNA relaxation by topoisomerase I at concentrations up to 10 microM, but showed DNA-intercalating ability (DNA unwinding) at 30 microM. The structure of BE-22179 is quite novel for a topoisomerase II inhibitor. Echinomycin, a quinoxaline antibiotic structurally related to BE-22179, interfered with DNA relaxation by topoisomerase II, though the effect was not due to inhibition of the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II but to conformational change of DNA based on its intercalation into DNA.

A chromosome study of seven former workers with chronic bronchitis revealed a stable type of aberration, the average abnormality being 10.9 +/- 4.4 percent, which is equivalent to those of atomic bomb survivors exposed at 1.2 km from the hypocenter. The SCE rate observed in 16 former workers ranged from 4.9 +/- 2.1 to 17.8 +/- 3.9, which was significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.03). One of the CML patients showed an extremely high percentage of missing Y chromosomes along with t(9;22) translocation which is a specific chromosome aberration for the disease. Furthermore, the patient had almost a 3 times higher SCE rate compared to the control group and a high incidence of chromosome abnormality (12.1%) of the peripheral lymphocytes.

A-MuLV induced PCs in 21 of 25 mice with a mean post-pristane latency period of 46 +/- 9 days, compared to 134 +/- 25 days in controls exposed to pristane alone. delta XB, a mutant of type IV c-abl with a deletion of the SH3 domain, was equally effective in inducing PCs in 7 of 7 mice with a latency period of 49 +/- 7 days, indicating that gag sequences are not required for rapid PC induction. The delta XB delta Nar mutant that carried a large C-terminal deletion in addition showed only a negligible activity, if any, suggesting that PC acceleration requires the C-terminal domain in the same way as lymphoid transformation and in contrast to fibroblast transformation. BCR-ABL fusion constructs encoding an 185-kDa protein as in acute leukemia, or a 210-kDa protein as in chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), did not accelerate pristane-induced PC development in the N-myc transgenic mice, in contrast to their known ability to immortalize lymphoid cells in vitro. Only one of 14 non-transgenic littermates developed a pre-B lymphoma after A-MuLV infection, and none of 10 normal littermates infected with delta XB virus developed a construct-carrying tumor. This result suggests that PC acceleration is due to co-operative interaction of the N-myc transgene and activated abl. Infection of N-myc transgenic bone marrow or spleen cells with A-MuLV in vitro led to the outgrowth of pre-B lymphomas after transplantation to pristane-treated BALB/c recipients. The lymphoma-inducing activity of A-MuLV depends on its high titer, since diluted A-MuLV or the lower-titered delta XB induced only PCs under the same conditions. The v-abl, delta XB and BCR-ABL-carrying viruses generated immortalized lymphoblastoid lines in vitro, regardless of the presence of the N-myc transgene, suggesting that lymphoid transformation is a direct function of appropriate abl sequences in contrast to PC acceleration.","['Sugiyama, H', 'Wang, Y', 'Jackson, P', 'Sawyers, C L', 'Klein, G']","['Sugiyama H', 'Wang Y', 'Jackson P', 'Sawyers CL', 'Klein G']","['Microbiology and Tumorbiology Center (MTC), Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['5 RO1 CA 14054-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Terpenes)', '26HZV48DT1 (pristane)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/microbiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/physiology', '*Genes, abl', '*Genes, myc', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Plasmacytoma/*genetics/*microbiology', 'Precancerous Conditions/*genetics/*microbiology', 'Spleen/cytology/microbiology', 'Terpenes/pharmacology']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910580122 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Jul 1;58(1):135-41. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910580122.,,"['N-myc', 'c-abl', 'gag', 'myc', 'v-abl']",,,,,,,

Fourteen patients (seven allogeneic BMT [allo-BMT], seven autologous BMT [ABMT]) were treated for primary bone marrow failure (no granulocyte recovery after BMT), and 11 cases (all allo-BMT) received rhGM-CSF for secondary bone marrow failure (absolute neutrophil count lower than 0.5 x 10(9)/L after a previously sustained granulocyte recovery). Two allo-BMT and three ABMT patients with primary bone marrow failure achieved a granulocyte response to rhGM-CSF. In contrast, nine patients with primary graft failure did not respond to rhGM-CSF (four ABMT, three HLA-identical T-depleted BMT, one minor mismatch BMT, one unrelated BMT). Ten of 11 allo-BMT patients treated for secondary bone marrow failure attained an ANC higher than 0.5 x 10(9)/L, but most became severely neutropenic again at a median time of 4 weeks. The possible cause triggering graft failure (graft-vs.-host disease [GVHD], cytomegalovirus [CMV] infection) remained unsolved in most of these cases.

We found that (i) in contrast to 6- to 72-hour incubation periods typically used in assays with solid tumor cells, most of the invasive cell populations tested here required only 2 to 4 hours to cross the Matrigel layer; (ii) unlike that of PMNL, whose invasiveness was stimulated by the addition of FMLP, the invasive rate of cultured leukemic cells was not affected by this chemoattractant; (iii) the rate of invasion was inversely proportional to the Matrigel concentration per filter but varied with the Matrigel batch used; (iv) the most consistent results were obtained when 2.5 to 4 x 10(5) cells were added to the top portion of the blind well; and (v) of all leukemic cells tested, the least differentiated myeloblastic KG-1 cells exhibited the highest invasive potential, which was comparable to that of normal PMNL.

Sixty-three cases of Fusarium infection have been reported in immunocompromised patients, 44 cases since 1985. These included patients with hematological malignancies (58 cases), especially acute leukemia (43 cases). The main sites of infection were the skin (46 cases), blood (28 cases) and lungs (13 cases). The infection was mostly diagnosed by means of skin biopsy but also by means of positive blood cultures. Forty-three strains were identified, 19 of which were Fusarium solani. Amphotericin B treatment was given in 55 cases, often combined with other antifungal agents, leukocyte transfusions or granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor. The outcome was fatal in 36 of the 63 cases reported, often due to resistance of the strain to antifungal agents, particularly amphotericin B (20 of 33 strains tested). The most important risk factor seems to be profound and prolonged aplasia. Deep mycoses due to Fusarium species thus pose an important problem and are occurring in increasing numbers in immunocompromised patients.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a recently discovered cytokine, has been suggested to play a role in the cancer cachexia syndrome through its ability to decrease lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. This study explores the mechanism by which LIP decreases LPL activity in cultured adipocytes and determines its effects on fatty acid synthesis and lipolysis to see if it shares the same catabolic effects on fat cells as seen with other cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). LIF decreased LPL activity in cultured adipocytes by 44% compared with an 85% decrease produced by TNF. Although the percent decrease in LPL activity is not as great in LIF-incubated adipocytes as in TNF-incubated adipocytes, the half-maximal doses for both cytokines are similar. LPL messenger RNA levels paralleled LPL activity in the LIF-treated adipocytes, suggesting that the effect of LIF on LPL activity is predominantly mediated through transcriptional regulation. In contrast to TNF, LIF tended to increase the de novo synthesis of fatty acids. Acetyl coenzyme-A carboxylase messenger RNA levels paralleled the changes seen in fatty acid synthesis for both cytokines. LIF caused a small increase in lipolysis, whereas TNF increased lipolysis by greater than 2-fold. These results demonstrate that the catabolic effects of LIF are weaker than those of TNF and are predominantly directed toward decreasing LPL activity, which may contribute to the hyperlipidemia associated with infection, inflammation, and cancer.","['Marshall, M K', 'Doerrler, W', 'Feingold, K R', 'Grunfeld, C']","['Marshall MK', 'Doerrler W', 'Feingold KR', 'Grunfeld C']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco.']",['eng'],['DK-07418/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adipocytes/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipolysis', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.135.1.8013346 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1994 Jul;135(1):141-7. doi: 10.1210/endo.135.1.8013346.,,,,,,,,,

It is currently in clinical trials. Its reduction to diaminocyclohexane (DACH)-dichloroplatinum(II) [DACH-Pt(II)Cl2] or closely similar species is essential for binding to DNA to produce the desired antitumor effects. We have studied the pharmacokinetics of tetraplatin in mice after intraperitoneal administration with the reducing agent glutathione (GSH). The systemic absorption of tetraplatin (5 mg/kg) with GSH (31 mg/kg) was faster than of tetraplatin alone. Peak plasma platinum (Pt) levels of 0.89 and 1.44 micrograms Pt/ml were observed at 15 min and 2 hr after administration of tetraplatin with and without GSH, respectively, and the Pt then decayed biphasically when administered with GSH and monophasically when administered alone. The plasma Pt level was 4-fold lower (0.17 vs. 0.71 micrograms Pt/ml) by 24 hr when tetraplatin was administered with GSH compared with its administration alone. DACH-Pt(II)Cl2 (4.21 mg/kg, ip) gave similar plasma Pt kinetics to that seen with the combination of tetraplatin and GSH. Pt levels in kidney 24 hr after administration of tetraplatin+GSH or of DACH-Pt(II)Cl2 were lower (1.6-fold) than after tetraplatin alone. Plasma and ascitic fluid from tumor-bearing mice demonstrated equivalent abilities to reduce tetraplatin rapidly. However, tetraplatin treatment of intraperitoneal-inoculated L1210/0 (parent) or L1210/DDP (cisplatin-resistant) tumor cells was unaffected by GSH. As GSH lowered systemic tetraplatin exposure in vivo without compromising antitumor activity against peritoneal tumor models, the combination of thiol and tetraplatin may be clinically useful in the treatment of intraperitoneal disseminated cancers.","['Kido, Y', 'Khokhar, A R', 'Yoshida, M', 'Thai, G W', 'Siddik, Z H']","['Kido Y', 'Khokhar AR', 'Yoshida M', 'Thai GW', 'Siddik ZH']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['P030 CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA41581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA50380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'SFK1SGY8V1 (ormaplatin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Ascitic Fluid/metabolism', 'Glutathione/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Platinum/blood', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 1994 Mar-Apr;22(2):312-7.,,,,,,,,,

We show that the spontaneous differentiation could be a result of extensive losses of amplified c-myc genes by the findings: (a) the spontaneously differentiated HL-60 cells express Mac-1 (CR3, CD11b/CD18) antigen, irreversibly stop the uptake of [3H]thymidine, and die by apoptosis; (b) these cells, when isolated, and when the copy number of c-myc genes is precisely quantitated, show extensive losses of c-myc genes; and (c) low concentrations of hydroxyurea increase the percentage of spontaneously differentiated cells in which the number of c-myc genes is further decreased.

The MDS patients studied were classified into three groups according to the pattern of telomere length reduction. The first group had telomere shortening at the time of disease diagnosis. In four of the six MDS patients in this group, the disease progressed within 6 months postdiagnosis and each of them survived for less than 1 year. Moreover, in this group four patients showed a 5q anomaly with or without additional changes, and 50% of patients in this group had complex chromosome abnormalities. The patients in the second group showed reductions in telomere length after disease progression; two of these three patients showed gradual disease progression and had one or two chromosome abnormalities. The third group comprised the remaining seven MDS patients; they showed no telomere reduction by disease evolution. Two patients in this group experienced rapid disease progression. These results may indicate that telomere reduction is linked to disease evolution in some MDS patients, perhaps as a result of genomic instability because patients with complex chromosome abnormalities were clustered in the first group. However, because some MDS patients show disease progression without telomere reduction, genetic changes, including point mutations of certain gene(s), may also contribute to disease progression.

To test for this effect in the human lines, we used a steady-state replication assay which measures the inhibition of DNA chain elongation (based on the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into nascent DNA strands) as a function of the number of platinum-DNA adducts present on the DNA following cisplatin treatment. With this technique we demonstrated a 4.5-fold increase in the replicative bypass ability of the C13* line compared to the 2008 line and a 2.3-fold increase in the bypass ability of the A2780/DDP line compared to the A2780 line. To confirm these results, we performed a pulse-chase replication assay on the 2008 and C13* lines. This assay differs from the first in that DNA chain elongation is measured in a time-dependent manner. With the pulse-chase assay we observed a 4.8-fold increase in the replicative bypass ability of the C13* line compared to the 2008 line. We then examined the specificity of this enhanced bypass by repeating the steady-state assay with the 2008 and C13* lines using as damaging agents 1,2-diaminocyclohexanedichloroplatinum(II), UV radiation (producing pyrimidine dimers), and benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide. In both cell lines, 1,2-diaminocyclohexanedichloroplatinum(II)-DNA adducts caused a greater inhibition of DNA chain elongation than cisplatin-DNA adducts. The level of enhanced bypass of 1,2-diaminocyclohexanedichloroplatinum(II)-DNA adducts in the resistant line was 2.1-fold (approximately 2-fold less than the level of enhanced bypass observed with cisplatin-DNA adducts). There was no evidence of enhanced bypass in the resistant line when cells were treated with UV light or benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide. These results indicate that the bypass response in the C13* line has some degree of specificity for cisplatin adducts. The specificity of bypass in these cell lines coincided well with the specificity of resistance to each agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Mamenta, E L', 'Poma, E E', 'Kaufmann, W K', 'Delmastro, D A', 'Grady, H L', 'Chaney, S G']","['Mamenta EL', 'Poma EE', 'Kaufmann WK', 'Delmastro DA', 'Grady HL', 'Chaney SG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],['CA34082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (cisplatin-DNA adduct)', '55097-80-8 (7,8-Dihydro-7,8-dihydroxybenzo(a)pyrene 9,10-oxide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,,"['7,8-Dihydro-7,8-dihydroxybenzo(a)pyrene 9,10-oxide/pharmacology', '*Cisplatin/analogs & derivatives/analysis/*pharmacology', '*DNA/analysis', '*DNA Adducts', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jul 1;54(13):3500-5.,,,,,,,,,

The potential clinical utility of BA is limited by the apparent difficulty of achieving effective concentrations because of its rapid metabolism and short plasma half-life. In this study we addressed two approaches that may achieve effective concentrations of BA in vivo. One strategy is to use BA derivatives as prodrugs that can be metabolized to yield effective BA concentrations in vivo over a sustained period of time. Another strategy is to define agents that are synergistic with BA so that the desired effect can be achieved at lower concentrations of BA. In this study monobutyrin (MB) and tributyrin (TB) were studied in vitro for their effects on inducing differentiation of human myeloid leukemia HL60 cells and murine erythroleukemia cells. On a molar basis TB was about 4-fold more potent than either BA or MB for inducing differentiation of HL60 cells. BA, MB, or TB induced erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells. On a molar basis TB was 3- to 4-fold more potent than BA, whereas MB was much less potent than BA. Combinations of all-trans-retinoic acid with either BA, MB, or TB induced myeloid differentiation of HL60 cells synergistically. We saw marked reductions in the doses of each agent that were needed in combination to achieve the same effect as single agents. For example, 130 microM TB, 110 nM all-trans-retinoic acid, and a combination of 13 microM TB plus 13 nM all-trans-retinoic acid all induced half-maximal differentiation of HL60 cells. Our results suggest that the readily available TB may be an effective prodrug of BA and may be useful either as a sole agent or in combination with other agents for cytodifferentiation therapy of human malignancies.","['Chen, Z X', 'Breitman, T R']","['Chen ZX', 'Breitman TR']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '26999-06-4 (1-butyrylglycerol)', 'S05LZ624MF (tributyrin)']",IM,,"['Butyrates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Glycerides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prodrugs/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Triglycerides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jul 1;54(13):3494-9.,,,,,,,,,

A. Anderson, B. Kalyanaraman, and J. B. Feix, Cancer Res., 53: 806-809, 1993). In this work, we show that salicylic acid enhances the binding of MC540 prior to illumination, as well as the light-stimulated uptake of MC540 by target L1210 murine and K562 human leukemia cells. Acetylsalicylic acid, 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acids, and sodium benzoate also enhance MC540 uptake. The irradiation dose responses for loss of cell survival and enhanced MC540 uptake are well correlated, both being shifted to earlier time points in the presence of salicylate. Salicylic acid also enhanced photodynamic cell killing of A549 lung carcinoma and NIH:OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma cells, two cell types which are relatively resistant to MC540-mediated photosensitization. Cellular uptake of the anionic, potential-sensitive oxonol dye, bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)-trimethine oxonol, is also increased by salicylate in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, cellular uptake of the cationic cyanine dye, 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine, is unaffected by salicylate. These studies suggest that increased uptake of MC540 is the basis of salicylate enhancement and that changes in plasma membrane potentials may play a mechanistic role in the potentiation of MC540 binding and cell killing.","['Feix, J B', 'Anderson, M S', 'Kalyanaraman, B']","['Feix JB', 'Anderson MS', 'Kalyanaraman B']","['Biophysics Research Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR01008/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Salicylates)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', '8SKN0B0MIM (Benzoic Acid)', 'O414PZ4LPZ (Salicylic Acid)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Benzoates/therapeutic use', 'Benzoic Acid', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Salicylates/*therapeutic use', 'Salicylic Acid']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jul 1;54(13):3474-8.,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicities, measured by either a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide or a clonogenic assay, were maximal for the C6 complex, which was up to 12-, 40-, and 6-fold more potent than C3 against wild-type, cisplatin-resistant, and tetraplatin-resistant models, respectively, and up to 2-fold more potent than C8 against these cell lines. In general, cross-resistance to mixed amine analogues was partial in cisplatin- and tetraplatin-resistant cells and decreased (in L1210/DDP and 2780CP) or increased (in L1210/DACH and 2780TP) with increase in the alicyclic ring size. The increase in ring size resulted in a corresponding increase in partition coefficient, which correlated directly with intracellular accumulations of mixed amine analogues in all cell lines. However, the intracellular DNA-platinum adducts, and not cellular platinum content, was the pharmacological entity that corresponded closely to potencies of the molecules. DNA adduct formation was disproportionate to the level of cellular drug accumulation. For instance, complex C8, which accumulated to the greatest extent in any given cell line, produced adduct levels that were similar to or lower than those produced by C6. A partial explanation for this observation was the demonstrated reduced rate of binding of C8 to DNA. This study has highlighted the significance of alicyclic ring size in modulating the potency, cross-resistance profile, and biochemical pharmacology of mixed amine platinum(II) complexes in sensitive and cisplatin- or tetraplatin-resistant tumor cells.","['Yoshida, M', 'Khokhar, A R', 'Siddik, Z H']","['Yoshida M', 'Khokhar AR', 'Siddik ZH']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.

In fact, colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage cell growth was stimulated by exposure to CS and TS (as well as their ether analogues) at concentrations above 100 microM. Furthermore, pretreatment of colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage cells with TS or CS appears to protect these normal cells from the lethal effect of doxorubicin exposure.

The inhibition of cellular growth by DDATHF was effectively prevented by adenosine or deoxyadenosine, whereas guanosine or deoxyguanosine only partially prevented the growth inhibition produced by this folate antimetabolite, implying that the depletion of both ATP and GTP, which occurs with this agent, was responsible for its growth inhibitory effects. In contrast, the induction of differentiation by DDATHF was completely abolished by the presence of guanosine or deoxyguanosine, suggesting that the depletion of intracellular guanine nucleotides by DDATHF represents the event that is essential to the induction of differentiation by this folate analog. This possibility was supported by the observation that the concentration of dGTP was not decreased in cells treated with DDATHF under the conditions employed. Both guanine nucleosides selectively restored intracellular GTP pools depleted by the treatment with DDATHF to their normal level, whereas only adenine nucleosides completely restored the levels of both ATP and GTP to their normal intracellular concentrations. The relationship between guanine nucleotide pools and the induction of HL-60 differentiation by DDATHF was further supported by the finding that maturation and the depletion of intracellular GTP by DDATHF were not reversed by guanine nucleosides in HL-60 cells deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity. The findings provide support for the hypothesis that the terminal differentiation of these leukemic cells by DDATHF is the result of the depletion of intracellular GTP pools.","['Sokoloski, J A', 'Pizzorno, G', 'Beardsley, G P', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Sokoloski JA', 'Pizzorno G', 'Beardsley GP', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Purine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1993;5(8):293-9.,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Fourteen patients: 10 with non Hodgkin lymphomas and four with Hodgkin disease were studied. The prevalence was 5% of the total number of patients with AIDS. Seven patients of the former and none of the latter had previously uncomplicated HIV infection. The following histologic types were observed: two Burkitt lymphoma, 4 undifferentiated lymphomas and 4 immunoblastic lymphomas among the non Hodgkin cases and two with mixed cellularity, one lymphocytic depletion and one undetermined among the Hodgkin's cases. Eighty percent of the patients with non Hodgkin lymphoma and 50% of the patients with Hodgkin disease presented a IV-B stage. The median of survival was 2.5 months (limits 1-8) for non Hodgkin cases and 11 months (limits 1-36) for the patients with Hodgkin disease.

The rate of inclusion in EORTC cooperative clinical trials was significantly lower than for younger patients despite specific protocols proposed for the elderly since 1983, thus confirming the important selection bias of most published series on elderly AML patients. Compared with treatment results in patients < 60 years, complete remission (CR) rate was lower (33.3% v 65.4%, P < 0.0001), with a marked drop in patients older than 70, and induction death rate was higher (21.3% v 12.5%, P = 0.04). Intrinsic characteristics of leukaemic cells, especially expression of the MDR1 gene, in vitro growth of the leukaemic clonogenic cells and sensitivity to daunorubicin-(+)cytosine arabinoside, did not differ according to age, except that there was a higher incidence of previous myelodysplastic syndromes and a lower incidence of good prognostic cytogenetics in the elderly patients. Thus, treatment failure in elderly AML patients appears to be mainly due to host-related factors (especially performance status and age < or > or = 70 years), and to inadequate treatments. Some elderly patients may have been undertreated because of the planned anthracycline dose reduction, resulting in a higher rate of 'resistant' AML, i.e. patients surviving the induction period without entering into CR, than in younger patients (45.4% v 22.1%, P < 0.0001). 11 patients (4.7%) with untreated or 'resistant' AML survived more than 1 year, while receiving only supportive care. These slowly progressive AML patients were characterized by a good performance status, and lower circulating blast cells and bone marrow blast counts.","['Baudard, M', 'Marie, J P', 'Cadiou, M', 'Viguie, F', 'Zittoun, R']","['Baudard M', 'Marie JP', 'Cadiou M', 'Viguie F', 'Zittoun R']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Selection Bias']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb03256.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jan;86(1):82-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb03256.x.,,,,,,,,,

The duration of second remission improved significantly with increasing intensity of treatment and bone marrow transplantation was followed by fewer relapses than chemotherapy. Analysis of factors influencing the duration of second remission showed that only length of first remission was of additional significance; the median duration of second remission being only 19 months in children with a first remission of less than 4 years and 62 months in those with longer first remissions. 29 children electively stopped chemotherapy a second time but only 11 of these remain still in second remission with recurrences occurring for up to 7 years from the the time first relapse. Only three of the 24 long-term survivors had no significant late effects of treatment; these were most marked in children who had received a second course of radiotherapy.

IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha stimulated 3H-TdR uptake in leukaemic blasts in a dose-dependent fashion. The IL-1-induced DNA synthesis of cALL cells could not be prevented by the addition of neutralizing antibodies against IL-3, GM-CSF, IL-6 or TNF-alpha. Similarly, the TNF-alpha-stimulated 3H-TdR incorporation of leukaemic blasts was not affected by the addition of antibodies towards IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-3, GM-CSF or IL-6. These observations suggest that IL-1 as well as TNF-alpha stimulated growth could not be attributed to the endogenous production of factors, corresponding to the antibodies used in these experiments. Both IL-1 as well as TNF-alpha mediate their action through interaction with specific cell surface receptors. Recently two distinct types of IL-1 receptors (IL-1-Rs), IL-1R(p80) and IL-1-R(p65), as well as two distinct types of TNF-receptors (TNF-Rs), TNF-R (p55) and TNF-R (p75) have been identified. Both types of TNF-Rs exist also in soluble forms (sTNF-Rs), while soluble IL-1-Rs (sIL-1-Rs) have not yet been found naturally. In this study we show that sIL-1-R as well as sTNF-R modulate the effects of their corresponding cytokine in a dose-dependent bimodal fashion; at lower concentrations they augmented while at higher concentrations they inhibited the cytokine-stimulated DNA synthesis of cALL blasts in vitro. It may therefore be concluded from this study that soluble receptors for both IL-1 and TNF, at least in vitro, are functional and interfere with their corresponding cytokine bioactivity.","['Carter, A', 'Haddad, N', 'Draxler, I', 'Israeli, E', 'Raz, B', 'Tatarsky, I']","['Carter A', 'Haddad N', 'Draxler I', 'Israeli E', 'Raz B', 'Tatarsky I']","['Department of Haematology, Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb03247.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jan;86(1):22-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb03247.x.,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis and loss of the bcl-2 protein is prevented in CLL cells cultured in the presence of interleukin-4. In this study we analysed the effects of alpha-IFN on the DNA fragmentation, bcl-2 protein levels and cell survival in purified B-cells from 16 CLL patients. Alpha-IFN (10(3) U/ml) reduced the degree of spontaneous DNA fragmentation of CLL cells after a 30 h culture period (from a mean of 22.2% in control cultures to 10.5%, P < 0.01). This inhibition was accompanied by preservation of bcl-2 protein and an increased survival of CLL cells compared to control cultures. In parallel, alpha-IFN inhibited hydrocortisone induced DNA fragmentation in CLL cells. The effects of alpha-IFN on DNA synthesis of CLL cells were variable (in two patients a decrease and in seven an increase in 3H-thymidine uptake) and did not correlate with the effect on DNA fragmentation. In conclusion, our data suggest that alpha-IFN, like IL-4 and gamma-IFN, inhibits apoptosis of CLL cells. These in vitro data indicate that the clinical responses of some CLL patients to alpha-IFN cannot be explained by a direct cytotoxic effect of alpha-IFN on circulating CLL cells. Alternatively, alpha-IFN may inhibit the proliferation of the small fraction of clonogenic CLL progenitors, or interfere with cellular interactions necessary for the survival and growth of CLL cells.","['Panayiotidis, P', 'Ganeshaguru, K', 'Jabbar, S A', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Panayiotidis P', 'Ganeshaguru K', 'Jabbar SA', 'Hoffbrand AV']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital and School of Medicine, London.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/blood', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb03269.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jan;86(1):169-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb03269.x.,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we report the finding of a novel doubly spliced pX mRNA in two out of eight HTLV-1-infected cell lines and in one out of 13 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HTLV-1-infected individuals. The second splicing for this novel pX mRNA is different from that for the known doubly spliced pX mRNA. A novel acceptor site in this splicing was generated by a single point mutation (G to A) at nucleotide 7,337 of the pX gene. This mRNA contained a complete open reading frame that encodes an amino-terminal truncated p27rex protein with 189 amino acids. A new 25-kD protein was detected in the cell lines expressing the novel pX mRNA by an antibody against the carboxy-terminal peptide of p27rex and was termed p25rex. Although the function of p25rex is not clear, we clarified that p25rex is a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein and its function is different from the transcriptional regulator function of p27rex. The possibility that the mutated virus is replicable only in cells coinfected with the wild type HTLV-1 may explain why the incidence of the mutants observed here is low.","['Orita, S', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Saiga, A', 'Kubota, R', 'Osame, M', 'Igarashi, H']","['Orita S', 'Kobayashi H', 'Saiga A', 'Kubota R', 'Osame M', 'Igarashi H']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex/*genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/microbiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Point Mutation', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.1994.13.353 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1994 Apr;13(4):353-64. doi: 10.1089/dna.1994.13.353.,,,,,['GENBANK/D13005'],,,,

A common disease in F-344 rats, granulocytic leukemia, appears to have a window where it is sensitive to the effects of CR. Other diseases, such as pituitary adenomas, appear to have a different relationship to growth in the animal. Additionally, a model for the major disease for a number of long-lived strains of mice, lymphoma, which CR effects by inhibiting the expression of the causative agent, is being developed. Evaluation of the effects of CR on neoplasia, degenerative disease and physiological parameters suggests that the major factors in expression of these diseases is the alteration of growth factors, hormonal status, etc., and that these alterations also affect strain-specific pathologies depending on when they are changed in the life span. Effecting different diseases at different times in the life span, long-term CR, by limiting exposure to endogenous growth factors, altering physiological characteristics, and limiting exposure to food toxicants, inhibits the onset of disease, and its sequela, aging.","['Turturro, A', 'Blank, K', 'Murasko, D', 'Hart, R']","['Turturro A', 'Blank K', 'Murasko D', 'Hart R']","['Division of Biometry and Risk Assessment, National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, Arizona 72079.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,IM,,"['Aging/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', '*Energy Intake', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",24,1994/05/31 00:00,1994/05/31 00:01,['1994/05/31 00:00'],"['1994/05/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/31 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1994.tb56827.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1994 May 31;719:159-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1994.tb56827.x.,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, vaccination with the attenuated F-MuLV B3 had only a transient protective effect on M-MuLV-induced thymomas.

A truncated version of the mutant protein which included only the N-terminal domain was poorly transported but still able to interact with the receptor.

The r6gp provirus was previously generated in the frame of FeLV, subgroup B, GA clone with substitution of all but 40 C-terminal amino acid sequences of the surface glycoprotein (SU) from an endogenous FeLV provirus element (CFE-6). Although r6gp produced a normal size (85 kDa) env glycoprotein precursor, the product, unlike the precursor of the parental virus, was neither additionally glycosylated nor further processed into mature env proteins. Biochemical observations were consistent with the idea that the chimeric env polyprotein was trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and were directly supported by immunofluorescence microscopy analyses. Interestingly, the residence of the chimeric protein in the ER specifically interfered with FeLV, subgroup C (Sarma) virus infection but not the parental FeLV-B virus infection. Since FeLV-C provirus sequences could be readily detected in the infected cells, it appeared that r6gp env expression did not block entry of the challenge virus. While FeLV-B and CFE-6 env genes share an extensive overall sequence homology, a variable region (region VI) of CFE-6 near the C-terminus of SU, which was retained in the r6gp construct, exhibits a considerably higher degree of homology to FeLV-C than FeLV-B. Thus, we propose that region VI is involved in conferring specificity for the env polyprotein oligomerization in the ER, and that co-oligomerization of the trapped r6gp env with FeLV-C is the reason for specific interference with FeLV-C infection. The results also demonstrate for the first time a functional abnormality of a recombinant FeLV env gene which is structurally similar to those commonly detected in FeLV-induced feline lymphosarcomas.","['Bechtel, M K', 'Stallcup, M R', 'Bedgood, R M', 'Corey, J L', 'Pandey, R', 'Roy-Burman, P']","['Bechtel MK', 'Stallcup MR', 'Bedgood RM', 'Corey JL', 'Pandey R', 'Roy-Burman P']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],"['CA51485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK43093/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*metabolism/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Reassortant Viruses', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Viral Interference']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(84)71349-3 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1994.1349 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1994 Jul;202(1):329-38. doi: 10.1006/viro.1994.1349.,,,,,,,,,

Adult T cell leukemia derived factor (ADF), a polypeptide made of 104 amino acids, is induced by a variety of stresses including X-ray, ultraviolet, H2O2, and mitogen. ADF has a reducing activity, which catalyzes the proton transfer between thiol-radical of cystein-containing proteins. Furthermore, ADF has a protective activity of ROS which are formed by xanthine oxidase and other alternative pathways in vitro. Using a rat in vivo model of lung ischemia, we examined the protective effect of recombinant human ADF (rhADF) against ischemia reperfusion injury of the lung. Ischemia, lasting for 75 min, was induced in the left lung of rats at 23 degrees C. The lung was then reperfused. These animals were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 6, treatment with normal saline) and group 2 (n = 6, treatment with 28 micrograms/g of rhADF). One minute after the beginning of reperfusion, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) decreased significantly in both groups (p < 0.01), without any significant intergroup difference (55.5 +/- 9.8, 49.8 +/- 8.6 mm Hg, respectively). Twenty minutes after reperfusion, PaO2 was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in group 2 (113.0 +/- 8.1 mm Hg) than in group 1 (72.3 +/- 13.6 mm Hg). The wet/dry weight ratio was significantly higher in group 1 (7.31 +/- 0.54) than in group 2 (5.82 +/- 0.36). Histologically, lung injury tended to be milder in group 2 than in group 1.

Risk estimates.,155-61,"The detailed work histories of the individual workers composing the Pliofilm cohort represent a unique resource for estimating the dose-response for leukemia that may follow occupational exposure to benzene. In this paper, we report the results of analyzing the updated Pliofilm cohort using the proportional hazards model, a more sophisticated technique that uses more of the available exposure data than the conditional logistic model used by Rinsky et al.

Mortality update and exposure distribution.,147-54,"The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently completed a vital status update adding 6 years of observation on the rubber workers known as the Pliofilm cohort. Using traditional standardized mortality ratio (SMR) analysis, we investigate the impact of the additional information gathered in the NIOSH update. We also compare the effect of using three sets of job-, plant-, and year-specific exposure estimates on the evaluation of benzene's leukemogenicity. The lack of any additional cases of multiple myeloma does not support trends toward elevated risks for this endpoint (as had been observed earlier), and there is no indication of increased incidences of solid tumors (as predicted by animal studies). Qualitatively, which exposure estimates are used does not alter the conclusions. The data added in the update did not greatly modify the estimated relative risk of leukemia associated with benzene exposure, but did confirm previous findings that occupational exposure to high concentrations had leukemogenic potential. The fact that leukemia has not been observed in any individual who started employment in Pliofilm production after 1950 suggests that the observed leukemia cases could be a response to very high levels of benzene exposure that occurred during the early years of this manufacturing process.","['Paxton, M B', 'Chinchilli, V M', 'Brett, S M', 'Rodricks, J V']","['Paxton MB', 'Chinchilli VM', 'Brett SM', 'Rodricks JV']","['American Petroleum Institute, Washington, D.C. 20005.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Risk Anal,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,8109978,"['9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', '*Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S.', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Ohio/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', '*Rubber', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1539-6924.1994.tb00039.x [doi]'],ppublish,Risk Anal. 1994 Apr;14(2):147-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.1994.tb00039.x.,,,,,,,,,

The likelihood of developing chemotherapy-induced damage depended on the chemotherapeutic regimen and prescribed dose, illness, sex and degree of gonadal activity at the time of treatment. Despite of the high frequency of chemotherapy-induced gonadal damage its prevention has received a little attention.

The disease ranges in severity from a fatal leukemia-like disorder to an isolated lytic lesion of bone. Intermediate forms of the disease are usually characterized by multiorgan involvement, diabetes insipidus, and a chronic course. METHODS: To determine whether Langerhans' histiocytosis is a polyclonal reactive disease or a clonal disorder, we used X-linked polymorphic DNA probes (HUMARA, PGK, M27 beta[DXS255], and HPRT) to assess clonality in lesional tissues and control leukocytes from 10 female patients with various forms of the disease. Lymphoid clonality was also assessed by analysis of rearrangements at immunoglobulin and T-cell-receptor gene loci. RESULTS: The HUMARA assay detected clonal cells in the lesions of 9 of the 10 patients: 3 patients had acute disseminated disease, 3 had unifocal disease, and 3 had intermediate forms. The percentage of clonal cells closely approximated the percentage of CD1a-positive histiocytes in each lesion. Clonality was also confirmed in two of nine cases with the PGK or M27 beta probe. Extreme constitutional lyonization precluded assessment of clonality in the 10th case. Lymphoid clonality was ruled out in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of clonal histiocytes in all forms of Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis indicates that this disease is probably a clonal neoplastic disorder with highly variable biologic behavior. Thus, genetic mutations that promote clonal expansion of Langerhans' cells or their precursors may now be identified.","['Willman, C L', 'Busque, L', 'Griffith, B B', 'Favara, B E', 'McClain, K L', 'Duncan, M H', 'Gilliland, D G']","['Willman CL', 'Busque L', 'Griffith BB', 'Favara BE', 'McClain KL', 'Duncan MH', 'Gilliland DG']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Histiocytes', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'X Chromosome']",,1994/07/21 00:00,1994/07/21 00:01,['1994/07/21 00:00'],"['1994/07/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/21 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199407213310303 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1994 Jul 21;331(3):154-60. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199407213310303.,,,['N Engl J Med. 1994 Jul 21;331(3):191-3.

The in vitro transcriptional capacity of a preincubated rDNA promoter complex becomes exhausted very rapidly upon initiation of transcription. This is due to the rapid depletion of C* activity. In contrast, C* activity is not unstable in the absence of transcription, even in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). By using 3'dNTPs to specifically halt elongation, C* is seen to remain active through transcription complex assembly, initiation, and the first approximately 37 nucleotides of elongation, but it is inactivated before synthesis proceeds beyond approximately 40 nucleotides. When elongation is halted before this critical distance, the C* remains active and on that template complex, greatly extending the kinetics of transcription and generating manyfold more transcripts than would have been synthesized if elongation had proceeded past the critical distance where C* is inactivated. In complementary in vivo analysis under conditions where C* activity is not replenished, C* activity becomes depleted from cells, but this also occurs only when there is ongoing rDNA transcription. Thus, both in vitro and in vivo, the specific initiation-conferring component of the RNA polymerase I holoenzyme is used stoichiometrically in the transcription process.","['Brun, R P', 'Ryan, K', 'Sollner-Webb, B']","['Brun RP', 'Ryan K', 'Sollner-Webb B']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['5T32 GM07814-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM27720/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase I)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Ribosomal/genetics/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Puromycin/pharmacology', 'RNA Polymerase I/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal/biosynthesis', 'Templates, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenopus laevis']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.7.5010-5021.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Jul;14(7):5010-21. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.7.5010-5021.1994.,PMC358872,,,,,,,,

This transactivation was further enhanced in Jurkat cells treated with concanavalin A, cyclic AMP, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Deletion and cis-element transfer analyses of the human proenkephalin promoter identified a cyclic AMP-responsive AP-1 element (-92 to -86) as both necessary and sufficient to confer Tax-dependent transactivation. Different AP-1 or cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/activating transcription factor (ATF) proteins which bind this element were expressed in murine teratocarcinoma F9 cells to identify those capable of mediating Tax-dependent transactivation of human proenkephalin gene transcription. Although CREB, c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunD did not have significant effects, JunB inhibited the Tax-dependent transactivation. In contrast, ATF3 dramatically induced Tax-dependent transactivation, which was further enhanced by protein kinase A. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with recombinant fusion proteins expressed and purified from bacteria indicate that the DNA-binding activity of ATF3 is also dramatically enhanced by Tax. Chimeric fusion proteins consisting of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and the amino-terminal domain (residues 1 to 66) of ATF3 were able to mediate Tax-dependent transactivation of a Gal4-responsive promoter, which suggests a direct involvement of this region of ATF3.

In three healthy individuals studied, HSV DNA sequences were found in all blood cell types and also in bone marrow cells as well as in stem cell progenitor colonies isolated from in vitro cultures. Studies of BMT donor-recipient pairs suggested that HSV reactivation may occur in hematopoietic cells after transplantation, as the PCR signal intensity increased over time simultaneous with an increased antibody titer to HSV. In a mouse model for HSV infection, HSV DNA sequences were found in blood and bone marrow cells at the latent stage of infection, after intravenous (IV) inoculation, but not after ocular inoculation. These studies suggest that bone marrow cells may be an additional site of HSV latency capable of reactivation after BMT.

We now provide evidence that a protein responsible for ATP synthesis in mitochondria may also play a physiologic role in major histocompatibility complex-independent, lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. A 51.5-kD protein (p51.5) bearing structural and immunologic characteristics of the beta subunit of H+ transporting ATP synthase (E.C. 3.6.1.34, beta-H+ATPase, published molecular mass of 51.6 kD) was detected on the plasma membrane of three different human tumor cell lines studied. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of purified p51.5 from K562 tumor cells revealed 100% homology of 16 residues identified in the first 21 positions to the known sequence of human mitochondrial beta-H+ ATPase. Antibody directed against a 21-mer peptide in the ATP binding region of beta-H+ ATPase (anti-beta) reacted with only one band on Western blots of whole tumor extracts and tumor membrane extracts suggesting that the antiserum reacts with a single species of protein. Anti-beta reacted with the cell membranes of tumor cells as determined by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry and immunoprecipitated a 51.5-kD protein from surface-labeled neoplastic cells (but not human erythrocytes and lymphocytes). Purified p51.5 bound to human lymphocytes and inhibited natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, anti-beta treatment of the K562 and A549 tumor cell lines inhibited NK (by > 95%) and interleukin 2-activated killer (LAK) cell (by 75%) cytotoxicity, respectively. Soluble p51.5 upon binding to lymphocytes retained its reactivity to anti-beta suggesting that the ATP binding domain and the lymphocyte-receptor binding domain reside in distinct regions of the ligand. These results suggest that beta-H+ ATPase or a nearly identical molecule is an important ligand in the effector phase (rather than the recognition phase) of a cytolytic pathway used by naive NK and LAK cells.","['Das, B', 'Mondragon, M O', 'Sadeghian, M', 'Hatcher, V B', 'Norin, A J']","['Das B', 'Mondragon MO', 'Sadeghian M', 'Hatcher VB', 'Norin AJ']","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn 11203.']",['eng'],['CA-47548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.180.1.273 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Jul 1;180(1):273-81. doi: 10.1084/jem.180.1.273.,PMC2191542,,,,,,,,

Human LIF (hLIF) can bind to and activate mouse LIF (mLIF) receptors but mLIF is unable to bind to hLIF receptors. Cross-species competition of mLIF and hLIF for binding to the mLIF receptor was found to be dependent on which ligand was used as the radioactive tracer (Layton, M. J., Cross, B. A., Metcalf, D., Ward, L. D., Simpson, R. J., and Nicola, N. A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 8616-8620), and this phenomenon was investigated in the present study. We found that hLIF bound to the low affinity mLIF receptor with a 100-500-fold higher primary affinity and lower kinetic dissociation rate than mLIF, but both ligands displayed a single rate of ligand dissociation. In contrast, the binding of hLIF to low and high affinity hLIF receptors revealed two classes of binding site. The observed tracer-dependent phenomena suggested that both mLIF and hLIF interfere with the binding of each other to the mLIF receptor. A model is presented in which hLIF binds to two sites on mLIF and hLIF receptors, one of which interferes with the common site for mLIF. This model may reconcile some of the observed complexities of LIF/LIF receptor interactions.","['Layton, M J', 'Lock, P', 'Metcalf, D', 'Nicola, N A']","['Layton MJ', 'Lock P', 'Metcalf D', 'Nicola NA']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['CA22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Ligands', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Solubility', 'Species Specificity']",,1994/06/24 00:00,1994/06/24 00:01,['1994/06/24 00:00'],"['1994/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)32518-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Jun 24;269(25):17048-55.,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to apoptosis could be induced rapidly (within 1 h) by treating with relatively high concentrations of promoters. However, low physiological concentrations of promoters could also induce complete resistance to apoptosis after prolonged exposure (5-15 days of culture). Like tumor promotion in vivo, promoter-induced resistance to apoptosis was reversible after culturing in the absence of promoter.

Three patients (12%) died during induction therapy with LD ara-C; 2 had a cerebral haemorrhage and 1 developed anuria following a staphylococcal septicaemia. In conclusion, therapy with LD ara-C may be preferable to more intensive and toxic regimens in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory ANLL.","['Jensen, M K', 'Johansen, P', 'Stentoft, J', 'Jensen, M K']","['Jensen MK', 'Johansen P', 'Stentoft J', 'Jensen MK']","['Department of Haematology, Aalborg Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00652.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1994 Apr;52(4):236-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00652.x.,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective study of 53 cases.,216-21,"Fifty-three patients affected with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) younger than 50 years and observed in two hematological institutions have been retrospectively evaluated in order to verify whether this disease has different clinico-hematological features at presentation and different prognosis as compared to older cases. In our experience young cases with B-CLL diagnosis, confirmed by immunophenotype in 90.5% of patients, accounted for 7.1% of the whole CLL population. Sex distribution, mean peripheral lymphocyte count, platelet count, distribution among Rai's and Binet's stages, total tumor mass (TTM) score, histological pattern of bone marrow infiltration and lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) were similar to a series of 201 CLL cases older than 50 years. Only hemoglobin mean level was significantly higher in younger patients (13.1 +/- 2.1 vs 12.2 +/- 2.6 g/dl; p < 0.01). The overall median survival was 7.1 years. Rai and Binet staging classifications and TTM score system retained their prognostic value in this CLL population. In addition, cases fulfilling criteria of ""smoldering"" CLL, had a very long survival (75% survival probability at 16 years). Life-expectancy of younger patients was significantly longer than that of older ones (median survival, 7.1 versus 4.1 years; p < 0.05). However, when the background mortality due to non-CLL related deaths (i.e., cardiovascular complications, epithelial cancers) was removed, survival advantage of young cases disappeared. In conclusion this study confirms that prognosis of young CLL patients can be easily assessed using the current well-defined criteria. Since age is not by itself a criterion for intensifying treatment, further efforts to identify those young CLL patients who qualify for more aggressive therapy should be made.","['Molica, S', 'Brugiatelli, M', 'Callea, V', 'Morabito, F', 'Levato, D', 'Nobile, F', 'Alberti, A']","['Molica S', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Callea V', 'Morabito F', 'Levato D', 'Nobile F', 'Alberti A']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale Regionale A.

High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) served as control method.

In 12 patients on dialysis the photometer recorded significantly lower values than HPLC (P < 0.0005).

There were no statistically significant differences between the leucocyte counts, lymphocyte counts, and lymphocyte percentages of the infected and control sheep during the first 120 weeks of this study. However, one sheep did develop a leukopenia and lymphopenia 95 weeks after it became infected and died of histologically-confirmed lymphosarcoma 10 days later.

There was no significant difference in the number of lymphocyte colonies formed by BLV infected and control sheep. Nor was there a significant difference in the number of colonies formed by lymphocytes from the BLV infected sheep, when the autologous sheep serum was replaced with either pooled serum from the infected sheep or with pooled serum from the control sheep.

In various cell lines, the magnitude of drug-induced DNA-protein cross-link production correlates with the magnitude of cytotoxicity induced by the drugs. We developed a simple filter-binding assay that can measure drug-induced DNA-protein cross-links in leukemia cells obtained directly from patients because the assays most widely used for assessment of drug-induced DNA-protein cross-links in cells [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/KCl precipitation and alkaline elution] are not readily applicable for use on patient material. HL-60 human leukemia cells or freshly isolated patients' leukemia cells were incubated with Topotecan, etoposide, or amsacrine; lysed with SDS; and applied to nitrocellulose filters in a low-salt buffer. DNA is retained on the filter only if it is covalently bound to protein. The amount of DNA retained on the filter is quantified by hybridization to the alu sequence of DNA, which is distributed ubiquitously in the human genome. Using radiolabeled cells, we compared the filter-binding assay directly with the SDS/KCl precipitation assay in the detection of etoposide- or amsacrine-induced DNA-protein cross-links in HL-60 cells and amsacrine-resistant HL-60/AMSA cells. Both the SDS/KCl precipitation assay and the filter-binding assay detected etoposide-induced DNA-protein cross-links in HL-60 and HL-60/AMSA cells and detected a greater frequency of amsacrine-induced DNA-protein cross-links in HL-60 cells than in HL-60/AMSA cells. The filter-binding assay detected DNA-protein cross-links in freshly isolated leukemia cells exposed to Topotecan in vitro. The ratios of DNA retention for Topotecan-treated versus untreated cells from leukemia patients ranged from 1.8 to 11.5. The heterogeneity of this detected cross-linking was as might be expected if the assay were predictive of the antileukemic action of Topotecan, which is variable. This new filter-binding technique may be useful for predicting the sensitivity of individual patients' tumors to drugs that inhibit type I or type II DNA topoisomerases.","['Ellis, A L', 'Nowak, B', 'Plunkett, W', 'Zwelling, L A']","['Ellis AL', 'Nowak B', 'Plunkett W', 'Zwelling LA']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.

However, the bioavailability of UK-21 given orally did not seem to be good. In the present study, we focused on the antitumor and immunosuppressive activities of UK-21 given i.p. to mice. UK-21 suppressed the growth of L-1210, P388 and EL4 leukemias inoculated i.v. into corresponding syngeneic mice and both the growth of Lewis lung carcinoma transplanted s.c. and its subsequent metastasis to the lung. UK-21 showed antitumor activity at doses almost 10 times lower than those of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The side effects of UK-21, especially on immune functions, were examined in comparison with those of 5-FUR, 5-FU, and cyclophosphamide (CY) at doses producing comparable antitumor activity. The suppressive effect of UK-21 on IgM and IgG antibody formation in mice immunized with ovalbumin was clearly weaker than that of 5-FUR, 5-FU, and CY. The suppressive effect of UK-21 on thymus weight was markedly weaker than that of 5-FU and CY. The reduction of WBC counts induced by UK-21 was also lower than that produced by any other agent. The results reported herein suggest the strong possibility of UK-21 being developed as a novel anticancer drug with cytotoxic mechanisms different from those of 5-FU.

For each patient, E-MTX and E-6TGN levels were measured 2-15 (median, 6) and 2-17 (median, 7) times, respectively. From these measurements, arithmetic means of E-MTX and E-6TGN were calculated (mE-MTX and mE-6TGN, respectively). Since MTX and 6MP probably work synergistically, the product of mE-MTX and mE-6TGN was calculated for each patient (mE-MTX x 6TGN). The degree of myelosuppression was registered as the mean WBC determined following cessation of the therapy minus the mean WBC measured during the therapy (mWBCshift). The mean WBCs measured on therapy (mWBC(on)) and off therapy were highly correlated (r = 0.48, P = 0.009). The median mWBCshift was 2.7 x 10(9)/l (range, 1.4-4.8 x 10(9)/l). In a multivariate regression analysis, the best-fit model to predict the mWBCshift included mE-MTX x 6TGN, age at drug withdrawal, and mWBC in the order given [mWBCshift = 4.3 + 0.00089 x (mE-MTX x 6TGN) - 0.097 x age - 0.41 x mWBC(on); global rs = 0.66, P = 0.0002]. Thus, the patients with higher mE-MTX x 6TGN values, the younger patients, and the patients with the lowest WBC during therapy had the most pronounced degree of myelosuppression as measured by mWBCshift.

RESULTS: A diagnosis of SLVL was made, based on tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-negative peripheral villous lymphocytosis with CD19+, CD20+, HLA-DR+ phenotypes, and the involvement of spleen white pulp with these cells. Mononuclear cells in the CSF showed the same morphologic and immunocytochemical features seen in the villous lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and spleen. Splenectomy and intrathecal chemotherapy were successful in clearing leukemic cells from the CSF. CONCLUSION: In this patient with SLVL in whom leukemic meningitis developed, meningitis was found to be a possible initial manifestation of SLVL.","['Yamazaki, K', 'Shimizu, S', 'Negami, T', 'Sawada, K', 'Nanasawa, H', 'Ohta, M', 'Konda, S', 'Okuda, K']","['Yamazaki K', 'Shimizu S', 'Negami T', 'Sawada K', 'Nanasawa H', 'Ohta M', 'Konda S', 'Okuda K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Takaoka City Hospital, Toyama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Meningitis, Aseptic/*etiology', 'Microvilli/ultrastructure', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenic Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology', 'Splenomegaly/etiology']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940701)74:1<61::aid-cncr2820740111>3.0.co;2-f [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Jul 1;74(1):61-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940701)74:1<61::aid-cncr2820740111>3.0.co;2-f.,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective study of untreated adult AML patients receiving standard 7 + 3 induction followed by ""5 + 2"" and HDARA-C consolidation was undertaken to describe the relationship of the myelosuppression profiles, blood product use, and infectious morbidity, and to correlate this finding with the outcome of antileukemic therapy. Multivariate techniques were used to evaluate variables of prognostic importance. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of the patients achieved remission after a median of 35 days; almost half (48%) of these patients required more than one 7 + 3 induction course. For one, two, and three induction courses, the mean number of days the patients experienced severe neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10(9)/l) were 22.5 +/- 10.9, 39.3 +/- 14.3, and 47.4 +/- 9.7 days (P < 0.001), respectively, and the infection rates were 1.45, 2.45, and 3 infections per course (P < 0.0001), respectively. The pattern of blood product use was similar. HDARA-C consolidation was the most significant factor related to prolonged disease free survival, however the myelosuppression profiles and infection rates were surprisingly similar to those for the single 7 + 3 induction courses. CONCLUSIONS: The 7 + 3 induction regimen used in this center provided only limited antileukemic activity, while requiring multiple induction courses in a high proportion of patients. The use of multiple induction courses had consequences of prolonged myelosuppression, increased blood product use, and incremental risks of infectious complications. HDARA-C consolidation for those who experienced complete remission appeared to improve disease free survival with myelosuppression comparable with that of patients who received primary induction therapy. The infection risk was acceptable, with only a marginal increase in bacteremic and fungal infections.","['Bow, E J', 'Kilpatrick, M G', 'Scott, B A', 'Clinch, J J', 'Cheang, M S']","['Bow EJ', 'Kilpatrick MG', 'Scott BA', 'Clinch JJ', 'Cheang MS']","['Department of Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/*complications/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Manitoba', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940701)74:1<52::aid-cncr2820740110>3.0.co;2-g [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Jul 1;74(1):52-60. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940701)74:1<52::aid-cncr2820740110>3.0.co;2-g.,,,,,,,,,

An analysis of 64 cases.,174-81,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphoproliferative disorders are considered rare in Oriental patients and are thought to constitute only 2% of all leukemias in these patients, compared to 20-30% in Western patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis of Chinese patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders to define the frequency and spectrum of these disorders. METHODS: A consecutive series of Chinese patients with leukemia and lymphoproliferative disorders seen at two regional hospitals in Hong Kong were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnosis of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders was based on morphologic and immunologic criteria proposed by the French-American-British Cooperative Study Group. RESULTS: Sixty-four Chinese patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders were identified, and these patients constituted 19% of a total of 342 cases of leukemia diagnosed in 3 years. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was the most common form, occurring at a frequency of 12.5% of all leukemias. The clinicopathologic features of these patients were similar to those of Western patients, except that Chinese patients tended to present with more advanced (Rai's Stages III and IV; Binet's Stage C) and bulky (splenomegaly > 9 cm) disease, and expressed lambda light chain about six times more frequently. Other chronic lymphoproliferative disorders identified in this study included prolymphocytic leukemia, mantle zone lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, large granular lymphocyte leukemia, and Sezary syndrome.

Thirty months after the initial diagnosis was made, a population of lymphoid cells with pathologic morphology was found in the patient's peripheral blood (PB). Cell phenotyping was performed and monoclonality was analyzed in cells obtained from a removed lymph node (LN) and the PB of the patient. METHODS: The cell phenotype was examined with immunofluorescence techniques using antibodies against SIg and monoclonal antibodies against CD1, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD19, and the kappa, and lambda light chains. Gene rearrangement analysis for monoclonality determination was performed with restricted DNA (EcoRI, Hin-dIII and BamHI) hybridized with either 32P-labeled T-cell receptor DNA probe (TcR-beta) or immunoglobulin-heavy chain probe (JH). RESULTS: With regard to the cell population of the removed LN, cell phenotyping showed the predominance of CD4+ T-cells over a polyclonal B-cell population. Gene rearrangement analysis proved the monoclonal nature of the T-cells and the polyclonal nature of the B-cells. As to the PB, gene rearrangement and cell phenotyping of the lymphocytes showed the predominance of monoclonal kappa type B-cells over polyclonal T-cells. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained suggest two unrelated lymphoproliferative diseases in this patient, expressed as monoclonal T-cell population in LN and as monoclonal B-cell population in PB.","['Klein, A', 'Manor, Y', 'Abed, S', 'Leytin, V', 'Shapiro, H', 'Zemer, R', 'Radnay, J']","['Klein A', 'Manor Y', 'Abed S', 'Leytin V', 'Shapiro H', 'Zemer R', 'Radnay J']","['Department of Life Sciences, Sapir Medical Centre, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19940701)74:1<164::aid-cncr2820740126>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Jul 1;74(1):164-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940701)74:1<164::aid-cncr2820740126>3.0.co;2-7.,,,,,,,,,

Within a minute of its addition to HL60 cells, apotransferrin caused a rise in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a dose-dependent manner and the higher the apotransferrin, the quicker it was to attain the calcium peak, showing the physiological characteristics of an agonist-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. The source of calcium appears to be extracellular since this signal could be abolished by nickel or when the reaction was carried out in calcium-free medium. Addition of apotransferrin in the serum-free medium could markedly promote DNA synthesis whereas addition of iron citrate could not. However, apotransferrin could not sustain cell proliferation and hypertrophism without other growth or nutritional factors. Antitransferrin receptor antibody inhibited the growth of HL60 cells cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with transferrin and insulin in a dose-dependent manner, whereas addition of ferric citrate could not reverse cell growth. Generation of the calcium signal probably reflects the initiation of the cell activation processes which could culminate into mitogenesis. Hence, our results suggest that apotransferrin, not iron, is bioactive in HL60 cells.","['Leung, Y M', 'Zhu, W H', 'Loh, T T']","['Leung YM', 'Zhu WH', 'Loh TT']","['Department of Physiology, Medical Faculty, University of Hong Kong.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Biol Signals,Biological signals,9210083,"['0 (Apoproteins)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (apotransferrin)', '0 (diferric transferrin)', '63G354M39Z (ferric citrate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Apoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Ferric Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Transferrin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000109483 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Signals. 1993 May-Jun;2(3):117-25. doi: 10.1159/000109483.,,,,,,,,,

An immunohistochemical examination of the tumor tissue using a specific monoclonal antibody was positive for CD2 and CD4, and negative for CD8. Proviral genome integration in the tumor cells was found by Southern blotting using a 32P-labeled HTLV-I probe with EcoRI and PstI digestion. Combination chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisolone was begun postoperatively, but the patient did not respond to therapy.

With the help of a transfected cell-line expressing the heterologous human receptor it was possible to discern receptor-specific properties like internalization from those regulating their expression on the surface. Recombinant IFN-gamma binds specifically to its homologous receptor at 4 degrees C and is rapidly internalized at physiologic temperatures. For this effect to occur, ligand binding to its receptor at 37 degrees C is necessary and sufficient. This notion is confirmed since a reduction in the number of heterologous human IFN-gamma receptors on the murine cell surface occurred exclusively after treatment with human IFN-gamma. Even weak doses of ligand, insufficient to occupy all receptors, led to a pronounced disappearance of binding sites. However, both receptors are simultaneously up-regulated in the presence of TPA, indicating a separate pathway which is not species-specific. Our findings imply that similar elements of the intracellular signal transduction machinery are involved in the control of MuIFN-gamma and HuIFN-gamma receptor expression. The results indicate also that factors involved in binding, internalization, and regulation of receptor gene expression are not species-specific.","['Bader, T', 'Wietzerbin, J']","['Bader T', 'Wietzerbin J']","['Institut Curie, Unite 365 INSERM, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interferon/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1043-4666(94)90010-8 [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(94)90010-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1994 Jan;6(1):70-8. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(94)90010-8.,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported the characterization of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to OM, termed OM2, which neutralizes its functional activity. To gain information about the epitope detected by this MAb, we utilized a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) to examine OM2 binding on a series of mutant recombinant OM molecules generated by site-directed mutagenesis, encompassing amino acid insertions, deletions, or alterations throughout the molecule. Carboxy-terminal deletions of a putative amphiphilic alpha helix past residue 185 abrogated binding of the OM2 MAb; alteration of a hydrophobic residue in the helix to a neutral one also prevented antibody binding. Analysis of mutants in which cysteines involved in intrachain disulfide binding were changed to serines revealed that one of two disulphide bonds was essential for OM2 binding. Two mutant molecules containing deletions in the amino-terminal one-fourth of the molecule were not bound by OM2, while a third mutant OM molecule with a C-terminal proximal internal deletion outside of the amphiphilic alpha helix was bound. The binding pattern of MAb OM2 to the OM mutant molecules correlated well with their functional activities. The data suggest that residues in both the C-terminal alpha helix and N-terminal one-fourth of the molecule are involved in neutralizing antibody binding and functional activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Radka, S F', 'Kallestad, J C', 'Linsley, P S', 'Shoyab, M']","['Radka SF', 'Kallestad JC', 'Linsley PS', 'Shoyab M']","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism', 'Biotin', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/immunology/*metabolism', 'Rabbits/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1043-4666(94)90008-6 [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(94)90008-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1994 Jan;6(1):55-60. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(94)90008-6.,,,,,,,,,

These free radicals are normally scavenged by antioxidant enzymes. Adenosine is normally released during ischemia and protects against ischemic injuries by interacting with adenosine receptors (ARs). The mechanism underlying its cytoprotective action is unclear. In this report, we provide evidence that activation of a unique A3AR in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) leads to a 2 to 3 fold increase in activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase and also increases in the activity of glutathione reductase. Similar increases in enzyme activity were elicited in bovine and human endothelial cells, rat cardiac myocytes and smooth muscle cells. Increases in enzyme activity were attenuated by theophylline (an antagonist of the A3AR) and by pertussis toxin, implicating a role of A3AR/Gi protein in the activation. Importantly, activation of the A3AR decreased the degree of lipid peroxidation in these cells. These data provide strong evidence that the cytoprotective action of adenosine during ischemic cell injuries is mediated, at least in part, via a novel mechanism-activation of the cellular antioxidant enzymes.","['Maggirwar, S B', 'Dhanraj, D N', 'Somani, S M', 'Ramkumar, V']","['Maggirwar SB', 'Dhanraj DN', 'Somani SM', 'Ramkumar V']","['Department of Pharmacology, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield 62794.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '29193-86-0 (Phenylisopropyladenosine)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,,"['Adenosine/*physiology', 'Adenosine Deaminase/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Catalase/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/enzymology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Reductase/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma', 'Myocardium/enzymology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phenylisopropyladenosine/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/drug effects/physiology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*metabolism', 'Theophylline/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",,1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(84)71731-1 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1994.1731 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1994 Jun 15;201(2):508-15. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1994.1731.,,,,,,,,,

U937 and HL60 cells, employed as models for mononuclear cells and promyelocytic cells, respectively, were exposed to ox-LDL (20 micrograms protein/ml) for 24 hours. HPLC analysis of 1-14C-AA metabolites indicates that ox-LDL increases U937 and HL60 cell production of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE). Northern analysis indicates that ox-LDL increases U937 cell FLAP transcript levels 10-times control levels but did not appear to alter 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) mRNA levels. In contrast, ox-LDL increases HL60 cell transcript levels for FLAP and 5-LO 1.5 times and 10 times control levels, respectively. Thus, we propose that ox-LDL plays an important role in the up-regulation of the 5-LO pathway in mononuclear cells.

Some 70% of the transport activity was inhibited with IC50 values of 0.7, 1 and 7 nM respectively. No inhibition of the remaining 30% of transport activity was observed until the dilazep, dipyridamole and NBMPR concentrations exceeded 1, 0.1 and 3 microM respectively. Exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 48 h, to induce monocytic differentiation, caused a 20-fold decrease in Vmax. of both NBMPR-sensitive and NBMPR-insensitive equilibrative uridine transport. The decrease in NBMPR-sensitive uridine transport induced by PMA corresponded to a decrease in NBMPR binding sites. A 30% decrease in specific NBMPR binding sites occurred within 6 h of PMA exposure, and could be prevented by uridine and thymidine at concentrations as low as 100 microM, and by staurosporine at 40 nM. However, the protective effects of these compounds diminished with prolonged PMA exposure. No protection was observed with uracil. Exogenous protein kinase C (PKC) in the presence of ATP and PMA decreased the number of specific NBMPR-binding sites in purified HL-60 cell plasma membranes. These results suggest that a PKC-induced conformational change in substrate-binding/transporting site may be responsible for the decrease in NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transport during PMA-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Lee, C W']",['Lee CW'],"['Department of Physiology, National University of Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'F8KLC2BD5Z (Dilazep)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,,"['Affinity Labels', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dilazep/pharmacology', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uracil/pharmacology', 'Uridine/*metabolism/pharmacology']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3000407 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1994 Jun 1;300 ( Pt 2):407-12. doi: 10.1042/bj3000407.,PMC1138177,,,,,,,,

HCV seropositivity was more common in hemophiliacs treated with nonheat-treated factor concentrates (93%) compared to those receiving cryoprecipitate (37%) or nonhemophiliacs receiving red packed cells (20%) (P < 0.001). Likewise, HBV seropositivity in patients receiving the above blood products was 83%, 61% and 26% respectively (P < 0.001), and HIV seropositivity was 35%, 6% and 0% respectively (P < 0.001). Acute or chronic liver disease was documented in 4 of 14 (28%) HCV-positive patients. Increased liver enzymes were recorded in sera of 43% HCV-positive patients and 18% HBV-positive patients compared to 22% of HBV and 20% HCV-seronegative patients (P = 0.076). Of 47 HCV-positive patients 24 were coinfected by HBV and 9 had triple infection (HCV, HBV and HIV). No solitary HIV infection was found. HIV seropositivity was always accompanied by serologic evidence for HBV with or without HCV infection.","['Brenner, B', 'Back, D', 'Ben-Porath, E', 'Hazani, A', 'Martinowitz, U', 'Tatarsky, I']","['Brenner B', 'Back D', 'Ben-Porath E', 'Hazani A', 'Martinowitz U', 'Tatarsky I']","['Hematology Institute, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Israel,Isr J Med Sci,Israel journal of medical sciences,0013105,,IM,,"['Blood Component Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'HIV Seropositivity/complications/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Hemophilia A/therapy', 'Hepatitis B/complications/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Hepatitis C/complications/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Humans', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Thalassemia/therapy']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Isr J Med Sci. 1994 Dec;30(12):886-90.,,,,,,,,,

Drugs such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and arabinosylcytosine can be tested on the following tumors: sarcoma, carcinoma, leukemia and melanoma. The dose, the number of treatments per day, the total number of treatments and the time interval between the treatments are the parameters to be adjusted for each therapeutical schedule. Tumoral growth, cause of death and survival are among the results that are generated after each simulation. These results are either tabulated or plotted. In addition, four statistical tests have also been integrated to the program in order to provide with a way to check whether or not there is a significant difference in terms of survival between two groups of mice differently treated. Furthermore, the program has been elaborated to also consider some physiological phenomena met within an anticancer drug screening programme.

Samples from sixty-four patients were tested (37 with acute myelocytic leukemia, 20 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, and 7 with blastic chronic myelocytic leukemia). A D value (derived from Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) greater than 0.15 was considered positive (+). Eight of 32 newly diagnosed patients were positive for gp180 compared with 22 of 32 relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients (P < 0.001). Of the new patients, vinca/anthracycline-based induction therapy failed in 3/6 gp180(+) and 5/18 gp180(-) patients. In the R/R group, 15/16 gp180(+) and 3/6 gp180(-) patients failed to achieve complete remission (P < 0.05). In vitro drug accumulation studies performed with verapamil failed to show a correlation with clinical response. However, in a subset of patients, a striking correlation (r = .97, P = .001) was noted between the presence of gp180 as determined by the D value and the functional activity of the P-glycoprotein as expressed by increased daunorubicin accumulation in the presence of verapamil. The results suggest that 1) newly diagnosed patients can express gp180, 2) P-glycoprotein is expressed in 69% of R/R patients, 3) response in R/R patients is effected by the presence of gp180, and 4) expression of gp180 is highly correlated with its function as a drug-efflux pump in a subset of the patients studied. The complexity of clinical drug resistance is underscored by the finding that the MDR model is not applicable to all cases. In such instances, other mechanisms may play a predominant role.","['Maslak, P', 'Hegewisch-Becker, S', 'Godfrey, L', 'Andreeff, M']","['Maslak P', 'Hegewisch-Becker S', 'Godfrey L', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],['P01-CA05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990170111 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1994 Sep 1;17(1):84-93. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990170111.,,,,,,,,,

CHO-K1 cells were placed in a G0-like state using serum depletion and stimulated to reenter the cell cycle by replating into fresh, serum-containing medium. At discrete intervals after stimulation, replicate samples were stained for either PCNA, p120, or 145; stained for DNA (Coulter DNA-Prep); evaluated on the EPICS Profile I; and analyzed on the EPICS ELITE workstation. PCNA stained less than 10% of the G0 cells; in contrast, however, 30-35% of the G0 cells were positive for p120 and p145. Eight hours after stimulating G0 cells to reenter the cell cycle (during G0/G1), p120 reached 88% positivity, while p145 and PCNA were 63% and 30% positive, respectively. Cells in S phase (12 and 16 h following G0 stimulation) were greater than 90% positive for all three antigens. PCNA had the greatest change throughout the G0 reentry process, both in percentage positive and quantitatively (mean channel fluorescence).

This new method has been applied to study the molecular environment of rhodamine 123 (R123) in sensitive (K562, CEM) and multidrug-resistant (K562-R, CEM/VLB100) tumor cells. All cells exposed to R123 showed a similar distribution of fluorescence in the perinuclear region. A lower cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity corresponding to a reduced drug accumulation was observed in resistant cells, as expected in the multidrug resistance process. Fluorescence emission spectra of R123 are useful to probe the polarity of the R123 environment. Thus, fluorescence spectra of R123-treated cells have been analyzed as a linear combination of model spectra: R123 in water and R123 in tensio-active Triton X-100. In sensitive cells, emission spectra of R123 underwent a red shift, equivalent to those observed in isolated coupled mitochondria. This suggests the formation of a complex in hydrophobic sites. In contrast, R123 spectra were less shifted in resistant cells, showing two types of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic binding sites. This could be related to an intracellular redistribution of R123 in resistant cells.","['Millot, J M', 'Sharonov, S', 'Manfait, M']","['Millot JM', 'Sharonov S', 'Manfait M']","['Laboratoire de Spectroscopie Biomoleculaire, UFR de Pharmacie, Reims, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Rhodamines)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)']",IM,,"['*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Octoxynol', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Rhodamine 123', '*Rhodamines/pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Subcellular Fractions/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Water']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990170107 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1994 Sep 1;17(1):50-8. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990170107.,,,,,,,,,

Immunotoxins (IT) reactive with human myeloid leukemias were constructed by conjugating gelonin, a single-chain ribosome-inactivating protein, to murine and genetically engineered, humanized M195 antibodies via an N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyl-dithio)-propionate linkage. No losses of gelonin cytotoxic activity or M195 binding activity were observed after conjugation of up to two toxin molecules per antibody. Toxin conjugates displayed specific, potent toxicity for CD33+ cells. The murine and humanized IT were not toxic to CD33- cells and were 600 and 4500 times more potent, respectively, than free gelonin in inhibiting CD33+ HL60 cells. Treatment of HL60 cells with 1 micrograms/ml HuM195-gelonin resulted in more than 1000 times lower colony formation; normal bone marrow mononuclear cell colony-forming units treated with HuM195-IT were reduced by a factor of 10. HL60 leukemia cells could be effectively purged from an excess of normal bone marrow cells. Exposure of target cells to IT for as little as 30 min was as effective as continuous exposure of IT for up to 6 days. However, measures of the efficacy of the immunotoxin were directly related to the length of time of observation after IT exposure and were inversely related to cell concentration. M195-gelonin immunoconjugates are potential candidates for therapeutic use in in vivo or ex vivo bone marrow purging for myeloid leukemias.","['McGraw, K J', 'Rosenblum, M G', 'Cheung, L', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['McGraw KJ', 'Rosenblum MG', 'Cheung L', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['P01CA33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '75037-46-6 (GEL protein, Gelonium multiflorum)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Plant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01534423 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1994 Dec;39(6):367-74. doi: 10.1007/BF01534423.,,,,,,,,,

For childhood cancers in particular, a classification of cancers by histologic type is important for understanding the etiology and progression of the disease. METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program on 9308 microscopically confirmed malignant neoplasms in children younger than age 15, newly diagnosed during 1973-1987, were made available for analysis. Tumors were grouped histologically according to a classification previously utilized in an international volume of childhood cancer incidence. RESULTS: The most frequent histologic types were acute lymphocytic leukemia (23.6%), astrocytoma (9.6%), neuroblastoma (6.6%), and Wilms' tumor (6.4%). Acute lymphocytic leukemia accounted for 75% of childhood leukemia. The most common form of Hodgkin's disease was the nodular sclerosing subtype, which was diagnosed in 56% of all cases. Burkitt's and Burkitt-like disease accounted for approximately one third of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the sex ratio (male to female) being unusually high (5.7). Among the brain tumors, glioma was of interest because 198 cases (excluded from this analysis) were diagnosed without histologic confirmation--due, no doubt, to their inaccessibility for biopsy because they were located in the brain stem. The most common histologic type of soft tissue sarcoma was rhabdomyosarcoma, which accounted for 51% of the total, more than half of which were of the embryonal type. To the authors' knowledge, this report offers for the first time the relative frequencies of rare types of leukemias, such as megakaryoblastic leukemia, in childhood. This report also includes the frequencies of 21 rarer forms of soft tissue sarcoma. Five forms of childhood cancer had a 5-year relative survival rate of 85% or better. Of the cancers with the poorest outcome, three had relative survival rates of 46.5-49%; the relative survival rate of acute myelogenous leukemia was only 26.4%. The trends in survival over time for 21 types of childhood cancer also are included in this report. CONCLUSIONS: Further refinements in classification now are available through laboratory techniques utilizing molecular biology, immunology, and cytogenetics, which are of importance in etiologic studies, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. It would be important in the future for cancer registries to record the results of relevant laboratory tests for further analysis by subtype.","['Miller, R W', 'Young, J L Jr', 'Novakovic, B']","['Miller RW', 'Young JL Jr', 'Novakovic B']","['Clinical Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7360.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology', 'Pediatrics', 'Prognosis', '*SEER Program', 'Sex Distribution', 'United States/epidemiology']",,1995/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<395::aid-cncr2820751321>3.0.co;2-w [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Jan 1;75(1 Suppl):395-405. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<395::aid-cncr2820751321>3.0.co;2-w.,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from 31,850 cases of multiple subgroups of acute and chronic leukemia, 12,237 cases of myeloma, and 321 cases of ""other"" lymphoreticular neoplasms were collected by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The data were examined by age, sex, race, age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rate, and patient 5-year relative survival during three reporting periods: 1973-1977, 1978-1982, and 1983-1987. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence rate for all categories of leukemia combined has been constant, but there has been an increase in the relative frequency (percentage) of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) in the general population and a rising incidence rate of myeloid leukemia in the black population. The increase of ALL is offset by a decline of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and acute leukemia, not otherwise specified. The age-adjusted rate of ALL in whites, 1.5 per 100,000 per year, is twice that of blacks, 0.8. The rates for each of the major categories of leukemia are considerably higher in males than in females. Five-year survival rates changed very little for leukemias over the 15 years of the study except for ALL, in which there was a marked improvement between the first (1973-1977) (39.1%) and second (1978-1982) (51.3%) reporting period. The SEER data confirm that multiple myeloma is predominantly a disease of late adulthood and occurs more frequently in blacks and males. The incidence rate of multiple myeloma has not changed during the 15 years surveyed. The 5-year relative survival rate has remained nearly constant for multiple myeloma. There is a marked difference in 5-year relative survival rates for patients with plasmacytoma of bone marrow (45.7%), multiple myeloma (25.9%), and plasma cell leukemia (13.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Shifts in the relative frequencies of leukemia types may have been affected by changes in classification criteria, changes in the use of histologic terms over time, and the expanded use of immunophenotyping and other technology to characterize acute leukemias.

Implications for the mechanism of action of aureolic acid antibiotics.,543-51,"The copper oxidases human ceruloplasmin and Polyporous anceps laccase catalyze the oxidative coupling of mithramycin (1) and its aglycone chromomycinone (2) with p-hydroquinone to form new mithramycin-hydroquinone (3) and chromomycinone-hydroquinone adducts (4), respectively. Similar adducts could be formed by the nonenzymatic mimic of this reaction using benzoquinone and these aureolic acids in buffer solutions. FABMS of 3 indicated that the hydroquinone moiety was attached to the aureolic acid aglycone. Acid hydrolysis of 3 yielded a compound with the same chromatographic and spectroscopic characteristics as 4. Structure elucidation of 4 by NMR and MS revealed that the hydroquinone was attached to the C-5 position of the aglycone. NMR evidence indicated that 4 consisted of a mixture of ortho-substituted biphenyl rotamers. The mechanism of the copper oxidase catalyzed adduct formation reaction is presumed to involve radical formation through hydrogen removal at the 8-phenolic position, radical isomerization, and coupling with semiquinone radical also formed during enzymatic and nonenzymatic incubations. Identification of the covalent-hydroquinone adduct provides evidence that aureolic acid antibiotics can be metabolically converted to reactive radical intermediates, and it establishes the C-5 position of aureolic acid as an enzymatically reactive site. Unlike mithramycin, the mithramycin-hydroquinone adducts was inactive in the in vivo P388 leukemic antitumor test system.","['Anyanwutaku, I O', 'Petroski, R J', 'Rosazza, J P']","['Anyanwutaku IO', 'Petroski RJ', 'Rosazza JP']","['Division of Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry, University of Iowa, College of Pharmacy, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.10.3.2 (Laccase)', 'EC 1.16.- (copper oxidase)', 'EC 1.16.3.1 (Ceruloplasmin)', 'NIJ123W41V (Plicamycin)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/therapeutic use', '*Benzoquinones/*chemistry', 'Catalysis', 'Ceruloplasmin/*metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', '*Hydroquinones/*chemistry', 'Laccase', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Plicamycin/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Polyporaceae/*enzymology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0968-0896(94)80025-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0968-0896(94)80025-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 1994 Jun;2(6):543-51. doi: 10.1016/0968-0896(94)80025-1.,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we present the high level expression of human LIF (hLIF) from a chemically synthesized gene template in Escherichia coli where it comprises up to 25% of the cellular protein. The recombinant hLIF, after purification and folding, was examined using CD, FTIR spectroscopy and light scattering. CD and FTIR spectra showed that the hLIF is an alpha-helical protein and has a distinct tertiary structure. The IFTR spectrum resembles that of other four helical bundle proteins including G-CSF and IL-6. Light scattering analysis indicated that it is a monomeric protein, distinguishing it from M-CSF and interferon gamma, which also belong to the class of four helical bundle proteins but are dimeric.

Only about 7% of breast cancers occur by the age of 40; the risk of developing breast cancer prior to the age of 40 is less than 1%. The incidence trends for women in the 20-39 age group have been essentially stable, whereas for women 40 and older the rates increased steeply during the 1980s (at a faster rate than anticipated based on historical trends) and then leveled off beginning in 1987. Breast cancer mortality has been much more stable over time than incidence. Up to age 40, blacks have a higher incidence than whites. Over age 40, white rates exceed those for blacks, and the absolute and relative differences in incidence increase with advancing age. For whites, 5-year relative survival rates improved with advancing age up to age 50. Blacks under the age of 30 had survival rates similar to whites, whereas, in the older age groups, whites had somewhat better survival rates overall and by stage. The occurrence of second cancers was also analyzed in women with a first invasive breast cancer. Cancers found to occur at higher than expected rates included leukemia and cancers of the breast, ovary, and lung.","['Hankey, B F', 'Miller, B', 'Curtis, R', 'Kosary, C']","['Hankey BF', 'Miller B', 'Curtis R', 'Kosary C']","['Cancer Statistics Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

In particular, these rates were discussed in connection with the neutral theory of molecular evolution. It was common to all the five pathogenic viruses that the rate of synonymous substitution was higher than that of nonsynonymous substitution particularly when the entire gene regions were compared between different isolates. This suggests that the viral proteins are quite conservative to functional and structural changes even though most of these viral genomes are evolving at a speed extraordinarily higher than their host genomes. Thus, this feature is consistent with the neutral theory. However, it is also pointed out that positive selection may be operating on some specific sites such as antigenic sites in order for the pathogenic viruses to escape from the host immune system.","['Gojobori, T', 'Yamaguchi, Y', 'Ikeo, K', 'Mizokami, M']","['Gojobori T', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Ikeo K', 'Mizokami M']","['National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Jpn J Genet,Idengaku zasshi,9301272,,IM,,"['Base Sequence', '*Biological Evolution', 'Genes, Viral/*genetics', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Hepatitis Viruses/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/genetics']",20,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1266/jjg.69.481 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Genet. 1994 Oct;69(5):481-8. doi: 10.1266/jjg.69.481.,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the genetic heterogeneity and molecular epidemiology of disease-associated strains of HTLV-I, we enzymatically amplified, then directly sequenced representative regions of the gag, pol, env, and pX genes of HTLV-I strains from Melanesians with and without TSP/HAM, and aligned and compared these sequences with those of HTLV-I strains from patients with TSP/HAM or adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and from asymptomatic carriers from widely separated and culturally disparate populations. Overall, the HTLV-I variant from the Solomon Islander with TSP/HAM, like HTLV-I strains from asymptomatically infected Melanesians, diverged by approx 7% from cosmopolitan HTLV-I strain. No disease-specific viral sequences were found. Gene phylogenies, as determined by the unweighted pair-group method of assortment and by the maximum parsimony method, indicated that the Melanesian and cosmopolitan strains of HTLV-I have evolved along separate geographically dependent lineages, one comprised of HTLV-I strains from Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and the other composed of virus strains from Japan, India, the Caribbean, Polynesia, the Americas, and Africa.

Me-MPR is converted directly into Me-tIMP by adenosine kinase. 6-MP is converted into tIMP, and thereafter it is methylated to Me-tIMP by thiopurine methyltransferase, an S-adenosylmethionine (S-Ado-Met)-dependent conversion. S-Ado-Met is formed from methionine and ATP by methionine adenosyltransferase, and is a universal methyl donor, involved in methylation of several macromolecules, e.g. DNA and RNA. Therefore, depletion of S-Ado-Met could result in an altered methylation state of these macromolecules, thereby affecting their functionality, leading to dysregulation of cellular processes and cytotoxicity. In this study the effects of 6-MP and Me-MPR on S-Ado-Met, S-adenosylhomocysteine (S-Ado-Hcy), homocysteine and methionine concentrations are determined. Both drugs cause a decrease in intracellular S-Ado-Met concentrations and an increase in S-Ado-Hcy and methionine concentrations in Molt F4 human malignant lymphoblasts. The effects of both 6-MP and Me-MPR can be ascribed to a decreased conversion of methionine into S-Ado-Met, due to the ATP depletion induced by the inhibition of purine synthesis de novo by Me-tIMP. Both 6-MP and Me-MPR thus affect the methylation state of the cells, and this may result in dysregulation of cellular processes and may be an additional mechanism of cytotoxicity for 6-MP and Me-MPR.","['Stet, E H', 'De Abreu, R A', 'Bokkerink, J P', 'Blom, H J', 'Lambooy, L H', 'Vogels-Mentink, T M', 'de Graaf-Hess, A C', 'van Raay-Selten, B', 'Trijbels, F J']","['Stet EH', 'De Abreu RA', 'Bokkerink JP', 'Blom HJ', 'Lambooy LH', 'Vogels-Mentink TM', 'de Graaf-Hess AC', 'van Raay-Selten B', 'Trijbels FJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, St. Radboud University Hospital of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Thionucleosides)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/*biosynthesis', 'Thionucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3040163 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1994 Nov 15;304 ( Pt 1):163-8. doi: 10.1042/bj3040163.,PMC1137466,,,,,,,,

IDAol may play an important role in the clinical efficacy of IDA in patients with acute leukemia, particularly since it persists in the blood for prolonged periods after the administration of IDA.","['Fukushima, T', 'Kawai, Y', 'Urasaki, Y', 'Yoshida, A', 'Ueda, T', 'Nakamura, T']","['Fukushima T', 'Kawai Y', 'Urasaki Y', 'Yoshida A', 'Ueda T', 'Nakamura T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '86189-66-4 (idarubicinol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90106-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Dec;18(12):943-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90106-6.,,,,,,,,,

The scientific importance of CML resides in its role as a cancer prototype, permitting the identification of genes centrally involved in both neoplastic change and normal cellular differentiation. One of these genes, the fusion gene BCR/ABL resulting from the balanced translocation (9;22) has received wide attention owing to its intimate involvement in CML. Although a tremendous amount of data have been recently discovered about BCR/ABL, its exact role in leukemogenesis and normal hematopoiesis remains obscure. The study of CML cell lines has already been of considerable help in understanding the molecular events associated with the Ph chromosome [4]. Further advances are likely to be forthcoming, particularly at the molecular genetic, but also at the protein level. CML cell lines may offer an excellent means of addressing many issues as continuous cell lines represent an inexhaustible source of identical cell material that, in addition, can be made available to other researchers around the world. This overview on the thus far reported CML-derived cell lines supports the hypothesis that in some specimens of CML the target cells in which Ph translocation arises are not necessarily lineage-restricted committed progenitor cells, but are in fact in some (or all?) cases precommitted bipotential or multipotential progenitor or stem cells retaining the potential for differentiation in diverse hematopoietic directions [26]. In conclusion, established tumor cell lines with their unique phenotypic and karyotypic features have been extremely useful models for investigation of the molecular and biological characteristics of CML. Considerable progress in understanding the molecular and cell biology of CML has been achieved. Further advances in the knowledge of CML are expected to accrue with the productive use of these powerful research tools for many important unresolved issues. By so doing, these discoveries might open new avenues that promise to move clinicians closer to the goal of the prevention or cure of CML in all patients.","['Drexler, H G']",['Drexler HG'],"['German Collection of Micro-organisms & Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",57,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(94)90103-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Dec;18(12):919-27. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90103-1.,,,,,,,,,

Ocular involvement is very common in patients with chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD). These patients show clinical and histological evidence of a dry-eye condition in 60-100 per cent. A severe complication is the development of a corneal ulcer with possible corneal perforation. Two patients with a severe dry-eye condition and development of corneal stroma ulceration are described. The corneal ulcers healed after treatment with collagen-shield. HISTORY AND SIGNS: In a 13-year-old boy an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was performed in April 1989 because of Fanconi's anemia. In November 1989 a severe dry-eye condition occurred due to GvHD with skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract manifestation. In April 1991 he presented with corneal stroma ulceration of the right eye. In a 24-year-old patient an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was performed because of chronic myeloid leukemia in August 1989. In December 1989 he developed dry-eye condition due to GvHD with skin, mucosa and liver involvement. In December 1991 a corneal ulcer of the left eye occurred. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: Repeated conjunctival and corneal smears were negative. Local antibiotic and antiviral treatment showed no effect. Corneal ulcers deteriorated progressively with corneal thinning. Both patients were therefore treated with daily collagen-shields and hourly polyvinyl-pyrrolidon eye-drops resulting in healing of the corneal ulcer within 3 and 2 weeks respectively. CONCLUSION: Treatment of corneal stromal ulceration in dry eye condition caused by chronic GvHD is difficult. In noninfectious ulcers daily application of collagen-shields and hourly artificial tears may prevent severe ocular complications like corneal perforation.","['Spraul, C W', 'Lang, G E', 'Lang, G K']","['Spraul CW', 'Lang GE', 'Lang GK']",['Universitats-Augenklinik Ulm.'],['ger'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,0014133,"['0 (Ophthalmic Solutions)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'FZ989GH94E (Povidone)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Collagen', 'Corneal Ulcer/*therapy', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/therapy', 'Fanconi Anemia/*therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Ophthalmic Solutions', 'Povidone/administration & dosage', 'Tears/metabolism']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1045510 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 1994 Sep;205(3):161-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1045510.,,,,Hornhautulzerationen bei chronischer Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD): Behandlung durch Collagen-Shields.,,,,,

In contrast, in P-glycoprotein-expressing drug-resistant HL-60R and SU-4R cells, doxorubicin distribution rapidly approaches equilibrium. The simplest kinetic model of this behavior consists of rapid diffusion from extracellular fluid into the cell, followed by uptake into a nonexchangeable intracellular pool. At 3.4 microM doxorubicin, transmembrane diffusion clearance was similar for all cell lines (0.78-0.98 microliter sec-1). There was no decrease in the normalized apparent volume of distribution in the P-glycoprotein-expressing cell lines, as would be expected if an active, unidirectional efflux were present. However, in resistant cells, doxorubicin accumulation in the nonexchangeable pool was up to 15-fold slower than in sensitive cells (0.004 vs. 0.050 microliter sec-1 in HL-60R vs. HL-60; 0.004 vs. 0.058 microliter sec-1 in SU-4R vs. SU-4). No pool inflow could be detected in either SU-4 or SU-4R cells exposed to doxorubicin at 0 degrees C, indicating that the nonexchangeable accumulation requires energy. The process preventing accumulation began to saturate in SU-4R cells at 20 microM doxorubicin, whereas no evidence of saturation was seen with HL-60R, which is more highly resistant than SU4R. We propose that alteration in compartmentalization is primarily responsible for the doxorubicin resistance observed in these cell lines.","['Dordal, M S', 'Jackson-Stone, M', 'Ho, A C', 'Winter, J N', 'Atkinson, A J Jr']","['Dordal MS', 'Jackson-Stone M', 'Ho AC', 'Winter JN', 'Atkinson AJ Jr']","['Clinical Pharmacology Center, Robert H.

There are significant decreases in the number of motoneurons, interneurons, and sensory (dorsal root ganglion) neurons. Although there are several possible explanations for how afferents might regulate the maintenance of neuronal viability, we have focused attention on the putative role of neurotrophic agents in these events. Previous studies have shown that specific tissue extracts (e.g., muscle, brain), soluble proteins, growth factors, and trophic agents can promote the in vitro and in vivo survival of avian motoneurons during the period of natural cell death (embryonic days 6-10). Several of these agents were also effective following deafferentation. These included brain extract (BEX), muscle extract (MEX), conditioned medium from astrocyte cultures (ACM), as well as the following neurotrophic agents: nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), S-100, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (CDF/LIF). Both transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) were ineffective. Although considerable more work is needed to determine which (and how) specific CNS-derived trophic agents regulate motoneuron survival, the present results are consistent with the notion that neurotrophic agents released from or modulated by synaptic inputs to target neurons promote neuronal differentiation and survival in the CNS.","['Yin, Q W', 'Johnson, J', 'Prevette, D', 'Oppenheim, R W']","['Yin QW', 'Johnson J', 'Prevette D', 'Oppenheim RW']","['Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157.']",['eng'],"['NS 20402/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 31380/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tissue Extracts)']",IM,,"['Afferent Pathways/physiology', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Chick Embryo', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Denervation', 'Motor Neurons/drug effects/*physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Proteins/pharmacology', 'Solubility', 'Spinal Cord/*cytology', 'Tissue Extracts/pharmacology']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Neurosci. 1994 Dec;14(12):7629-40.,PMC6576903,,,,,,,,

Amplified long terminal repeats (LTRs) were analysed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). The results, together with previously published LTR data (a total of 180 specimens analysed), showed the presence of 12 different RFLP profiles with four major molecular subtypes. Furthermore, a fragment of 413 bp (nucleotides 22 to 434) of the U3/R region was sequenced for 12 new HTLV-I specimens originating from Central and West Africa (8 cases), Iran (1 case), Caribbean (2 cases) and Reunion Island (1 case). Phylogenetic analysis using three different techniques (maximum parsimony, neighbour-joining and UPGMA) comparing these 12 strains (including four new African HTLV-I variants) with the 30 published partial HTLV-I LTR sequences (nt 120 to 434) showed the existence of clusters of molecular variants in discrete geographical areas. The topology of the phylogenetic trees is thought to reflect HTLV-I evolution and the migrations of virally infected populations in the recent or distant past. Furthermore, there was a nearly perfect concordance between the clustering based on the LTR sequence homologies and the LTR RFLP subtypes suggesting that this rapid and simple technique is well suited to the investigation of HTLV-I molecular epidemiology. These results allow a new phylogenetic classification of HTLV-I genotypes into five major molecular subtypes: Cosmopolitan (C) subtype widespread all over the world, Japanese (J) subtype, West African (WA) subtype.

Failure of feedback controls may predispose cells to undergo apoptotic death in response to a variety of stimuli. Transformed cell lines often carry defects in one or more proteins that regulate cell cycle, and therefore can be used as a model to study how cell cycle controls cell death. The present study investigated whether TCR/CD3-induced apoptosis of human leukemic T cells is cell cycle dependent. Studies of Jurkat and Sup-T13, two human leukemic T cell lines, demonstrated that anti-CD3 Ab-driven activation results in a transient, reversible inhibition of DNA synthesis in Jurkat cells, but results in a persistent, irreversible inhibition of DNA synthesis in Sup-T13 cells. Anti-CD3 mAb blocked Jurkat cells at the G1/S interface without inducing cell death. In contrast, anti-CD3 mAb allowed Sup-T13 cells to enter S phase but inhibited progression into G2 phase and triggered cell death. Electron microscopy showed that anti-CD3 mAb-stimulated Sup-T13 cells acquired the characteristic morphology of apoptosis. The nuclear DNA appeared as oligonucleosome-sized fragments by gel electrophoresis, and as an apoptotic peak displaying lower fluorescence than the DNA content of cells in G1 phase by DNA flow microfluorometry. DNA fragmentation correlated with entry into S phase. The DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin arrested Sup-T13 cells at the G1/S interface and prevented the apoptosis. Therefore, DNA synthesis is required for executing the apoptosis program initiated by TCR/CD3 stimulation of Sup-T13 cells. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the suicide of activated cycling T cells upon encountering autoantigens may be one of the mechanisms for the immune system to prevent autoimmunity.","['Zhu, L', 'Anasetti, C']","['Zhu L', 'Anasetti C']","['Human Immunogenetics Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['AI-33484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Autoimmunity', '*Cell Cycle', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'S Phase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Jan 1;154(1):192-200.,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1987 and April 1993, 35 patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first (n = 12) or greater (n = 23) remission were stratified by remission status and randomized to undergo 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide purged autologous bone marrow transplantation after either cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation (1320 Gy in eight fractions over 4 days) (CY/TBI), or busulfan (16 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) (BU/CY) conditioning. RESULTS: At 2 years, overall survival and disease-free survival were 39% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 22-57%) and 36% (95% CI 19-52%), respectively. Patients in first complete remission had a significantly better outcome with a 2-year disease free survival of 57% (95% CI 28-86%) compared to others at 24% (95% CI 6-43%, log rank p = 0.048). For patients conditioned with CY/TBI, the estimated 2-year disease-free survival was 50% compared to 24% for patients conditioned with BU/CY (log rank p = 0.12). Estimated 2-year relapse rates were 43% vs. 70% (log rank p = 0.17), respectively. For patients in first complete remission no differences in disease-free survival (2-year estimates 67% vs. 50%, log rank p = 0.69), between the two regimens were observed. For patients in greater than first complete remission there was a trend towards improved disease-free survival in the CY/TBI arm (2-year estimates 42% vs. 9%, log rank p = 0.06). There were no differences in time to white blood cell count (WBC) engraftment, absolute neutrophil count of > 500, incidence of bacteremias, or median time to hospital discharge between the two regimens. Acute toxicities were similar. Interstitial pneumonitis developed in two patients (one on each arm), while veno occlusive disease developed in three BU/CY patients, but none of the CY/TBI patients (log rank p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide-total body irradiation provided an equivalent or better outcome to BU/CY, particularly in advanced patients, and should remain the standard by which new regimens are judged. The high relapse rate with both regimens, especially patients who were in greater than in first complete remission, emphasizes the need for early transplant and for new strategies to improve outcome.","['Dusenbery, K E', 'Daniels, K A', 'McClure, J S', 'McGlave, P B', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Blazar, B R', 'Neglia, J P', 'Kersey, J H', 'Woods, W G']","['Dusenbery KE', 'Daniels KA', 'McClure JS', 'McGlave PB', 'Ramsay NK', 'Blazar BR', 'Neglia JP', 'Kersey JH', 'Woods WG']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology, University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinics, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['CA 21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(94)00335-I [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(94)00335-i [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Jan 1;31(1):119-28. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(94)00335-i.,,,"['Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Jan 1;31(1):195-6; discussion 202-3.

We previously characterized cDNA and genomic clones for human PF4 (hPF4) and now present transient expression studies defining the promoter of the gene. 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13- acetate (TPA) induces megakaryocytic differentiation of human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, providing an excellent model system for the study of megakaryocyte-specific promoter activity. Luciferase reporter-gene constructs containing sequences from -2074 to +49 were used to map regions that may regulate PF4 gene expression. The sequence in the region -239 to -107 increased basal promoter activity by four- to five-fold in TPA-induced HEL cells. The sequence between -239 and -107 contains 53 consecutive thymidine residues. Functional studies using constructs in this region show that poly(T) and the region -187 to -107 are necessary for the total increase in activity in TPA-induced HEL cells. Mobility-shift assays show that the poly(T) tract binds TPA-inducible proteins. The results suggest a complex promoter for the PF4 gene involving a basal nonspecific promoter element between -107 and +49, a positive promoter element between -239 and -107 binding specific nuclear proteins from megakaryocyte-lineage cells, and a silencer-like region between -2074 and -1653.","['Ramachandran, B', 'Surrey, S', 'Schwartz, E']","['Ramachandran B', 'Surrey S', 'Schwartz E']","[""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA.""]",['eng'],['DK16691/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Platelet Factor 4/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Jan;23(1):49-57.,,['hPF4'],,,,,,,

Because human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) has been used as a source for stem cells in bone marrow transplantation, and because NK cells appear to be important in graft versus leukemia response, we investigated the lytic activity of freshly isolated HUCB NK cells (HUCB-NK) against tumor targets and their ability to differentiate into LAK cells following stimulation with various cytokines. Although cytotoxicity mediated by fresh HUCB-NK was low compared to that of adult peripheral blood lymphocyte-derived NK cells (PBL-NK), the ability of HUCB-NK to bind to K562 target cells (TC) was similar to PBL-NK. In addition, the PBL-NK cytotoxicity of postpartum mothers was also low compared to that of normal adult PBL-NK. When we incubated HUCB for 18 hr in either IL-2 or IL-12, we boosted the level of HUCB-NK cytotoxicity to approximately the level observed in PBL-NK and increased the level of perforin, granzyme A, and granzyme B mRNA expression. In addition, when we incubated HUCB in IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-12, TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, or TGF-beta for 5 days, we observed that HUCB was capable of generating LAK cells only when incubated with either IL-2 or IL-12. In contrast, IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma all generated LAK cells from adult PBL. When we added to the medium low-dose IL-2 and irradiated K562 as feeder cells (mini-LAK), we were unable to generate LAK activity from HUCB-NK, whereas we could generate it with PBL-NK cells under the same conditions. Addition of serum derived from HUCB in a 4-hr 51Cr release assay with PBL-NK as the effector cells (EC) and K562 as the TC resulted in a 42% decrease in PBL-NK-mediated cytotoxicity. Although we detected no TGF-beta in HUCB serum, we did detect high concentrations of soluble class I MHC (sHLA). To our knowledge, sHLA has not previously been shown to inhibit NK cytotoxicity, although the expression of class I HLA on the surface of TC has been shown to inhibit NK cytotoxicity. To study further the effect of sHLA on cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we added various concentrations of sHLA to EC mediating NK, ADCC, and CTL activities.

In addition, mature enveloped particles and images of endopinocytosis of virions are seen in the cytoplasm vacuoles suggesting the existence of a reinfection phenomenon. In this context, we decided to investigate some features of the replicative cycle, in particular the synthesis of unintegrated proviral forms. To increase the sensitivity of detection, we applied a procedure which combines the electrophoretic separation of closed circular forms and PCR amplification. By this procedure we produced evidence for the existence of supercoiled HTLV-I DNA in established cell lines from TSP/HAM and ATL and in patients peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These HTLV-I unintegrated proviral forms may play an important role in the physiopathology of HTLV-I associated diseases. Preliminary results of AZT/interferon treatment in ALT patients are largely superior to chemotherapy. The therapeutic effect of AZT, it known inhibitor of reverse transcriptase, may be through its inhibition of the synthesis of HTLV-I unintegrated proviral DNA.","['Bazarbachi, A', 'Saal, F', 'Lasneret, J', 'Poirot, Y', 'Bittoun, P', 'Hojman, F', 'Peries, J']","['Bazarbachi A', 'Saal F', 'Lasneret J', 'Poirot Y', 'Bittoun P', 'Hojman F', 'Peries J']","['UPR A0043 CNRS, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,C R Acad Sci III,"Comptes rendus de l'Academie des sciences.

CMF was increased using spin-labeled electron spin resonance techniques, and Tf-R expression was measured by flow cytometric analysis with an EPICS-750 flow cytometer/cell sorter. Treatment of K562 cells in suspension culture with IFN-gamma for as long a time as 6 hr caused an increase in CMF, and then returned to the level of control cells at 12 hr. Conversely, by 24 hr after the beginning of treatment, the rigidity of CMF was increased. Thus, the changes of IFN-gamma-induced CMF was biphasic. While the early change of CMF is related to signal generation and transmission, the later change may reflect changes in lipid compositions and/or cytoskeletal complexes of the plasma cell membrane. A significant increase of Tf-R after 6 hr and 24 hr in number was obtained by treatment of K562 cells with IFN-gamma, but at 12 hr the number of Tf-R did not differ from the control. These results suggested that the early phase of upregulation of Tf-R induced by IFN-gamma was caused by increased CMF, and the late phase of upregulation of Tf-R was due to increased rigidity of CMF. In conclusion, the state of CMF associated with a certain receptor expression in cells is not rigid and can be modulated to some extent by exogenous influences. This may open possibilities of some adjuvant therapeutic measures in malignant diseases by increasing the antigenicity of tumor cells.","['Iwagaki, H', 'Marutaka, M', 'Nezu, M', 'Suguri, T', 'Tanaka, N', 'Orita, K']","['Iwagaki H', 'Marutaka M', 'Nezu M', 'Suguri T', 'Tanaka N', 'Orita K']","['First Department of Surgery, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol,Research communications in molecular pathology and pharmacology,9437512,"['0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Spin Labels)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Cell Membrane/metabolism/physiology', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Lipid Bilayers/metabolism', '*Membrane Fluidity', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Spin Labels', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol. 1994 Aug;85(2):141-9.,,,,,,,,,

Although the seroprevalence of HTLV-I/II in volunteer blood donors in low, patients with leukemia who received multiple blood transfusions are at increased risk for HTLV-I/II infection. Patients undergoing marrow transplantation for malignant and non-malignant diseases have often received multiple transfusions prior to transplantation. The seroprevalence of HTLV-I/II in marrow transplant recipients is not known, however. We studied pre-transplant sera from 317 patients receiving allogeneic or syngeneic marrow transplant in 1988 for antibodies to HTLV-I/II using an ELISA. Six sera were positive in this assay and nine other sera had absorbance values elevated above background. One of these 15 sera was confirmed positive in a Western blot assay; six others had an indeterminate reactivity. The seropositive patient was infected with HTLV-I and not HTLV-II as determined using a synthetic peptide-based ELISA; the indeterminate sera did not show reactivity to either HTLV-I or HTLV-II in this assay. Differentiation of HTLV-I from HTLV-II infection was also shown using a modified recombinant Western blot assay in which the seropositive patient showed reactivity to recombinant HTLV-I env gp46 and not recombinant HTLV-II env gp46. These results show infection with HTLV in one of 317 patients (0.3%) prior to marrow transplantation. The clinical consequences resulting from HTLV-I/II seropositivity during the severe immunosuppression accompanying marrow transplantation are not known. Testing blood donors for HTLV-I/II as is currently practised should reduce seroprevalence of HTLV-I/II in previously transfused marrow transplant recipients.","['Loughran, T P Jr', 'Shriver, M K']","['Loughran TP Jr', 'Shriver MK']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle.']",['eng'],"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46903/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA545522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-II Antibodies)']",IM,,"['Blood Donors', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Blotting, Western', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology', 'HTLV-II Antibodies/blood', 'HTLV-II Infections/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",,1994/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Sep;14(3):433-6.,,,,,,,,,

All were > 15 years old and 45 (71%) had at least one poor prognostic factor. Twenty-nine patients with a suitable sibling underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

This report confirms that allogeneic BMT permits long-term remissions giving high levels of survival when performed shortly after entering first CR while autologous BMT, when performed in the same setting, is less successful at preventing relapse. This study also confirms the high sensitivity of ALL to the graft-versus-leukemia effect provided by allogeneic BMT. Chemoradiotherapy dose intensification delivered at autologous BMT is not sufficient to prevent relapses. Autologous BMT must therefore be augmented by other approaches of which immunotherapy may be one.","['Vey, N', 'Blaise, D', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Bouabdallah, R', 'Lafage, M', 'Sainty, D', 'Cowen, D', 'Viens, P', 'Lepeu, G', 'Blanc, A P']","['Vey N', 'Blaise D', 'Stoppa AM', 'Bouabdallah R', 'Lafage M', 'Sainty D', 'Cowen D', 'Viens P', 'Lepeu G', 'Blanc AP', 'et al.']","['Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Sep;14(3):383-8.,,,,,,,,,

Eighteen centres (82%) responded. To prevent Pneumocystis infection 17 centres routinely gave cotrimoxazole at various doses for periods varying between 3 and 12 months (or sometimes longer if chronic GVHD was present) and six centres gave nebulised pentamidine to patients intolerant of cotrimoxazole. Six centres gave penicillin for 1-3 years to allograft patients. Thirteen centres gave only CMV-negative blood products to CMV neg/neg patients, one centre gave CMV immunoglobulin and five centres continued acyclovir to 6 months.

The analysis was in two parts. Firstly, we performed serial monitoring of regenerating subsets and blastogenesis of lymphocytes. We then reviewed the incidence of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection, based on the belief that this served as a clinical indication of immunological recovery. The CD4/CD8 ratio markedly decreased in all patients, with a nadir at 3 months, due to both abnormally low levels of CD4+ cells and sustained higher levels of CD8+ cells. These abnormalities were sustained for > 12 months post-graft. Within 6 months after PBSCT, all patients showed a decreased in vitro response to mitogens including PHA, Con A and PWM but these responses gradually recovered during the subsequent 6 months. All patients had a previous history of chicken pox. The actuarial incidence of VZV was 45% at 6 months and 67% at 12 months.

In the first year following BMT for CML, PCR used to detect the leukemia-specific BCR/ABL message frequently reveals subclinical levels of persisting leukemia. In a meta-analysis of reports on qualitative PCR findings after BMT for CML in 12 recently published series, we found that for unmanipulated BMT in chronic phase, PCR detection was not associated with a higher relapse risk and that most patients became PCR negative within 2 years post-BMT. In contrast, PCR detection of BCR/ABL transcripts was a more reliable predictor in recipients of T cell-depleted BMT and in those transplanted in accelerated or blastic phase of their disease. For accurate prediction of relapse, serial quantitative PCR is necessary. It could also be used to monitor efficacy of experimental treatments of relapse with interferon or donor lymphocyte transfusions. Furthermore, studies of the association of GVHD with PCR detection of BCR/ABL message may shed light on the relationship of GVL with minimal residual disease in CML.","['Miyamura, K', 'Barrett, A J', 'Kodera, Y', 'Saito, H']","['Miyamura K', 'Barrett AJ', 'Kodera Y', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis']",64,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Aug;14(2):201-9.,,,,,,,,,

The results demonstrate that an MRP cDNA containing 5'-end coding sequences reacts with a 6-kb RNA, which is overexpressed in the resistant isolate. As resistant cells revert to drug sensitivity there is essentially a complete loss of the 6-kb RNA. Southern blot analysis indicates that the MRP gene is amplified compared to the copy number found in sensitive cells. Revertant cells no longer contain amplified MRP sequences. Western blot analysis has been conducted using an antibody prepared against the carboxyl terminus (15 amino acids) of the deduced sequence of the MRP-encoded protein. The antibody is reactive with a 190-kDa protein (P190) and with two closely migrating proteins of 65 and 70 kDa (P70), which are overexpressed in plasma membranes and endoplasmic reticulum of resistant cells. Both proteins are greatly reduced in revertant cells.

Additional antisera have also been prepared against sequence domains contained in the C-terminal region of P190. These antisera are reactive with both P190 and P70.

This is achieved in the absence of exogenously added hematopoietic growth factors because of the presence in the cultures of supportive ""stromal"" cells of the fibroblast-endothelial-adipocyte lineages. These latter cells form a confluent adherent layer with which the most primitive hematopoietic cells become associated and which locally regulates their behavior. The LTC system has thus been considered as a model of the microenvironment of the bone marrow and used to delineate potentially physiologically relevant mechanisms that regulate the proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation of primitive normal hematopoietic cells. It has also been used to analyze the molecular basis of the altered proliferative behavior that characterizes primitive neoplastic cells from patients with CML. Most of the information obtained to date has emerged from experiments designed to shift the balance of stimulatory and inhibitory factors present in order to favor either the cycling or quiescence of primitive normal or CML cells in LTC. This has been achieved either by addition of soluble factors (or antagonists) to the LTC medium or by the use of genetically engineered factor-producing stromal cells. Such experiments have allowed the identification of a number of cytokines that promote one or the other of these responses (i.e., primitive progenitor cycling or quiescence), including some that are involved in control mechanisms endogenous to the LTC system. Recent studies suggest that the retention of primitive normal cells in a reversible G(o) state in this system is mediated by the cooperating action of limiting concentrations of at least two endogenously produced inhibitory factors (transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha)), either of which, however, if added exogenously at a sufficient concentration, can exert this action on its own. Interestingly, the heightened turnover characteristic of primitive CML cells appears to be due to a selective unresponsiveness to only one of these two inhibitors (MIP-1 alpha). These findings are consistent with a complex model of the extrinsic regulation of primitive hematopoietic cells in which a multiplicity of intracellular signaling intermediates within the target cells converge at different points ultimately to control their entry into S phase. Our findings further suggest that only some of these pathways may be affected by intracellular expression of the BCR-ABL fusion gene.","['Eaves, C', 'Eaves, A']","['Eaves C', 'Eaves A']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,['0 (Growth Inhibitors)'],IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Micromanipulation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",47,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1994;20(1):83-93; discussion 93-5.,,,,,,,,,

The proportion of biopsies with residual hairy cells was similar over the 25 months of follow up, indicating a relatively stable amount of residual disease.

Although expression of the oncogene is necessary to initiate and maintain transformation, other molecular mechanisms are thought to be required for full transformation. To determine whether tumor progression in ABL oncogene-transformed lymphoid cells has a genetic basis, we examined whether progression of the malignant phenotype of transformed clones correlates with particular cytogenetic abnormalities. A modified in vitro bone marrow transformation model was used to obtain clonal Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed B lymphoid cells that were poorly oncogenic. Multiple subclones were then derived from each clone and maintained over a marrow-derived stromal cell line for several weeks. Over time, clonally related Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed subclones progressed asynchronously to full transformation. The data show that tumor progression can occur in the absence of detectable cytogenetic changes but, more importantly, that certain cytogenetic abnormalities appear reproducibly in highly malignant subclones. Therefore, three independent subclones showed deletion in a common region of chromosome 13. Other highly malignant cells carried a common breakpoint in the X chromosome, and, finally, two subclones carried an additional chromosome 5.

Although RWLeu-4 proliferation is inhibited by 1 nmol/L vitamin D3, the resistant cells (JMRD3) continue to proliferate in the presence of 100 nmol/L vitamin D3. Both cells express similar patterns of differentiation-specific antigens after treatment with vitamin D3, and both express the retinoblastoma gene product (p110Rb). Vitamin D3 treatment of the sensitive RWLeu-4 cells decreased the level of the p110Rb protein, as well as its phosphorylation. In contrast, vitamin D3 treatment of JMRD3 had no effect on p110Rb expression or phosphorylation. Both RWLeu-4 and JMRD3 express similar vitamin D3 receptors and vitamin D3-inducible enzyme activities. Differences were detected in the DNA binding characteristics of the vitamin D3 receptors as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift studies. However, sequence analysis of the DNA-binding domain and immunoblot analysis showed no differences in the receptors. We conclude that some process subsequent to vitamin D3 receptor activation is altered in JMRD3 that partially separates vitamin D3-induced inhibition of proliferation from the induction of differentiation.","['Lasky, S R', 'Posner, M R', 'Iwata, K', 'Santos-Moore, A', 'Yen, A', 'Samuel, V', 'Clark, J', 'Maizel, A L']","['Lasky SR', 'Posner MR', 'Iwata K', 'Santos-Moore A', 'Yen A', 'Samuel V', 'Clark J', 'Maizel AL']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Roger Williams Medical Center, Brown University School of Medicine, Providence, RI 02908.']",['eng'],"['P30-CA13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA50054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA50558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",,1994/12/15 00:00,1994/12/15 00:01,['1994/12/15 00:00'],"['1994/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69993-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 15;84(12):4283-94.,,"['RB1', 'c-myc', 'myc']",,,,,,,

To investigate the functional properties of IL-2 and TNF alpha on leukemic B cells, we evaluated (1) the regulation of expression of TNF receptors (TNF-R) and IL-2 receptors on leukemic B cells after culture with TNF alpha and IL-2; (2) the effect of the combination of TNF alpha and IL-2 in a proliferative in vitro assay; and (3) the expression and regulation by these cytokines of receptors for hematopoietic factors, including IL-3, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

On the other hand, IL-2 was not able to modify the expression of the above-mentioned receptors. Although each cytokine alone was unable to induce a relevant proliferation of leukemic cells, a synergistic proliferative effect was detected when these cytokines were used in combination.

On the contrary, TNF alpha was unable to affect the expression of the above-mentioned receptors. These results indicate (1) that IL-2 and TNF receptors are related to each other on leukemic cells in B-CLL and (2) that the IL-2R is involved in the regulation of other structures, ie, CSF receptors, thus pointing to another functional role of this receptor complex and the related cytokine in leukemic cells.","['Trentin, L', 'Zambello, R', 'Agostini, C', 'Enthammer, C', 'Cerutti, A', 'Adami, F', 'Zamboni, S', 'Semenzato, G']","['Trentin L', 'Zambello R', 'Agostini C', 'Enthammer C', 'Cerutti A', 'Adami F', 'Zamboni S', 'Semenzato G']","['Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Clinical Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,1994/12/15 00:00,1994/12/15 00:01,['1994/12/15 00:00'],"['1994/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69988-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 15;84(12):4249-56.,,,,,,,,,

A pool of five antibodies isolated from three different mice was used to characterize GMR alpha. This antibody pool (anti-GMR alpha) immunoprecipitated a protein with the expected molecular weight of GMR alpha from COS cells transiently transfected with the GMR alpha gene. In factor-dependent cells, GMR alpha existed as a phosphoprotein. However, its phosphorylation was not stimulated by the presence of GM-CSF. Anti-GMR alpha inhibited the GM-CSF-dependent growth of cell lines and normal bone marrow cells and inhibited the binding of iodinated GM-CSF to its receptor. Cell surface expression of GMR alpha was examined using anti-GMR alpha and flow cytometry. GMR alpha was readily detectable on both blood monocytes and neutrophils. In adherence-depleted normal bone marrow, two separate populations expressed GMR alpha. The most positive cells were predominantly macrophages, whereas the cells that expressed less GMR alpha were largely myelocytes and metamyelocytes. A small population of lin-CD34+ or CD34+CD38- cells also expressed GMR alpha, but they were not capable of significant growth in colony-forming assays. In contrast, the majority of lin-CD34+ and CD34+CD38- cells were GMR alpha-, yet they produced large numbers of myeloid and erythroid colonies in the same assay. Malignant cells from patients with leukemia were also tested for GMR alpha expression. All of the myeloid leukemias and only rare lymphoid leukemias surveyed tested positive for GMR alpha. These results show that anti-GMR alpha is useful for the functional characterization of the GMR alpha and for the detection of myeloid leukemia and that GMR alpha is expressed on certain lineages throughout hematopoietic development; however, progenitors that express the receptor may have a reduced capacity to proliferate in response to hematopoietic growth factors.","['Jubinsky, P T', 'Laurie, A S', 'Nathan, D G', 'Yetz-Aldepe, J', 'Sieff, C A']","['Jubinsky PT', 'Laurie AS', 'Nathan DG', 'Yetz-Aldepe J', 'Sieff CA']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],['GM 13452/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,1994/12/15 00:00,1994/12/15 00:01,['1994/12/15 00:00'],"['1994/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69978-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 15;84(12):4174-85.,,,,,,,,,

Despite information on the effects of RAs on hematopoietic cells, little is known about how RAs act on the hematopoietic microenvironment, especially on bone marrow stromal cells. Based on recent observations that various cytokines produced mainly by bone marrow stromal cells regulate hematopoiesis, we analyzed the effects of RAs on cytokine production by these cells. ATRA or 9-cis RA treatment of human bone marrow stromal cell line KM101, which produces macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) constitutively, enhanced mRNA levels of both cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. Both RAs also stimulated M-CSF production from primary cultures of human bone marrow stromal cells. Both retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-alpha and retinoid X receptor (RXR)-alpha were expressed constitutively in KM101 cells. ATRA did not affect the expression of either receptor, whereas 9-cis RA increased RXR-alpha mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner, but did not affect levels of RAR-alpha mRNA. These findings may have important biologic implications for both the role of RAs in hematopoiesis and the therapeutic effects of ATRA on the hematopoietic microenvironment in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).","['Nakajima, H', 'Kizaki, M', 'Sonoda, A', 'Mori, S', 'Harigaya, K', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Nakajima H', 'Kizaki M', 'Sonoda A', 'Mori S', 'Harigaya K', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology and Laboratory Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,1994/12/15 00:00,1994/12/15 00:01,['1994/12/15 00:00'],"['1994/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69970-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 15;84(12):4107-15.,,,,,,,,,

Clone 6C8 showed terminal erythroid differentiation in response to a combined treatment with Epo and dimethylsulfoxide. Clone G3 was resistant to these inducers, but responded to Epo with enhanced proliferation. We measured G protein alpha subunit levels by toxin-catalyzed adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation with [32P]-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and by semiquantitative immunoblotting with specific antisera. Native RED-1 cells expressed G alpha i2, alpha i3, alpha s, and alpha q/11, but not alpha i1 and alpha o. Terminal differentiation was associated with a selective loss (approximately 80%) of G alpha i3 and an increase in a truncated cytosolic form of G alpha i2, while the membrane levels of alpha i2, alpha q/11, and alpha s did not change significantly. Treatment of G3 cells with the inducers was without effect on G protein abundance. However, except for alpha s, G3 cells contained significantly higher levels of the different G protein alpha subunits tested. Stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors by thrombin and ADP caused a pertussis toxin (PTX)-inhibitable transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ that was markedly reduced in differentiated cells. In G3 cells, but not in 6C8 cells, thrombin also caused a PTX-sensitive inhibition of isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation. Our results show that specific alterations in G protein expression and function are associated with erythroid differentiation of erythroleukemia cells but do not prove a causal relationship. The loss of G alpha i3 may affect cellular responses that are mediated via P2T purine or thrombin receptors.","['Kesselring, F', 'Spicher, K', 'Porzig, H']","['Kesselring F', 'Spicher K', 'Porzig H']","['Department of Pharmacology, Universitat Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*analysis/classification/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoproterenol/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/analysis/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Thrombin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",,1994/12/15 00:00,1994/12/15 00:01,['1994/12/15 00:00'],"['1994/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69968-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 15;84(12):4088-98.,,,,,,,,,

The German CML Study Group.,4064-77,"As curative bone marrow transplantation is available only to a minority of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), drug therapy remains of central interest. Several nonrandomized studies have suggested that interferon-alpha (IFN) may prolong survival in CML. In a randomized multicenter study the influence of IFN versus busulfan or hydroxyurea (HU) on survival of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) CML was examined. A total of 513 Ph+ patients were randomized for treatment as follows: 133 for IFN, 186 for busulfan, and 194 for HU. IFN-treated CML patients have a significant survival advantage over busulfan-treated (P = .008), but not over HU-treated patients (P = .44). The longer survival is due to slower progression to blast crisis. Median survival of IFN-treated patients is 5.5 years [5-year survival, 59%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 48%-70%], of busulfan-treated patients, 3.8 years (5-year survival, 32%; CI, 24%-40%), and of HU-treated patients, 4.7 years (5-year survival, 44%; CI, 36%-53%). Patients who continue on IFN survive longer than those in whom IFN is discontinued before blast crisis (P = .007). Complete hematologic IFN-responders have a survival advantage over partial responders or nonresponders (P = .02). Cytogenetic IFN-responders have no significant survival advantage over nonresponders (P = .2). Patients who attain white blood cell (WBC) counts of 10 x 10(9)/L or less have a survival advantage in the IFN (P = .007) and HU (P = .05) groups. Whereas toxicity in the IFN group was considerably higher than in the busulfan or HU groups, long-lasting cytopenias necessitating discontinuation of therapy as observed with busulfan have not been seen with IFN or HU. The problems of conventional prognostic scores (Sokal's score, Score 1) that we observed in IFN-treated patients support the idea that IFN changes the natural course of CML. We conclude that, with regard to survival of CML in the chronic phase, IFN is superior to busulfan and as effective as HU. Whether and to what extent IFN is superior to HU appears to depend, at least in part, on the degree of WBC suppression by HU-therapy and on the risk profile of the patients.","['Hehlmann, R', 'Heimpel, H', 'Hasford, J', 'Kolb, H J', 'Pralle, H', 'Hossfeld, D K', 'Queisser, W', 'Loffler, H', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Heinze, B']","['Hehlmann R', 'Heimpel H', 'Hasford J', 'Kolb HJ', 'Pralle H', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Queisser W', 'Loffler H', 'Hochhaus A', 'Heinze B', 'et al.']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/12/15 00:00,1994/12/15 00:01,['1994/12/15 00:00'],"['1994/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69966-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 15;84(12):4064-77.,,,"['Blood. 1995 May 15;85(10):2998-9, 3000-2.

Twenty patients (group 1) were diagnosed as having typical ALL according to the FAB criteria supported by immunological findings. Less than 1% blast cells with azurophilic granules were detected in all cases. Myeloid cytochemistry, i.e. peroxidase and Sudan black-B stain, was negative in all cases. A minor phenotype deviation consisting of the expression of the CD13 myeloid-associated marker was detected in two patients. In seven patients (group 2) a diagnosis of ALL with a minor myeloid component was made because of the presence of a majority of lymphoid blasts and of 5-15% blast cells with morphological cytochemical and immunological features of the myeloid lineage. Abnormal metaphases were found in 6/20 (30%) patients in group 1, compared with 7/7 (100%) patients in group 2. All patients were treated by antilymphoid regimens; however, complete remission was achieved in 17/20 (85%) patients in group 1 versus 1/7 (14.3%) patients in group 2. Median survival was 16 months, range < 1-120+ in group 1 and 9 months, range < 1-15 in group 2. It is concluded that morphological, immunological and cytogenetic studies allow for the recognition of two cytological subsets of Ph+ ALL. The presence of a minor myeloid component in otherwise typical Ph chromosome-positive ALL may be associated with a distinct cytogenetic pattern and poor responses to antilymphoid therapy.","['Cuneo, A', 'Demuynck, H', 'Ferrant, A', 'Louwagie, A', 'Doyen, C', 'Stul, M', 'Cassiman, J J', 'Dal Cin, P', 'Negrini, M', 'Carli, M G']","['Cuneo A', 'Demuynck H', 'Ferrant A', 'Louwagie A', 'Doyen C', 'Stul M', 'Cassiman JJ', 'Dal Cin P', 'Negrini M', 'Carli MG', 'et al.']","['Institute of Haematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08306.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jul;87(3):515-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08306.x.,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the expression of Pgp on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells in 54 newly diagnosed patients, using a novel streptavidin-biotin complex (ABC) technique. 55% of patients at diagnosis were positive for Pgp with JSB-1, a monoclonal antibody that binds to an internal epitope of Pgp. All patients received intensive induction chemotherapy. Post-remission treatment consisted of further chemotherapy +/- bone marrow transplantation. Complete remission (CR) rates were significantly lower in the Pgp positive group than in the Pgp negative group (60% v 92%; P = 0.02). The overall survival for Pgp-positive patients was significantly shorter (329 v 534d, P = 0.004), disease-free survival was also reduced but the difference was not statistically significant (median 277 v 522d, P = 0.16). In this study CD34 expression was not predictive of response to chemotherapy nor was it associated with Pgp expression. Our results confirm the prognostic value of Pgp expression in AML at diagnosis and we suggest that Pgp could be a useful therapeutic target for reversing multi-drug resistance.

When short-term OKT3 stimulation is carried out on bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC), large numbers of CD3+ CD25+ HLA-DR+ cells are rapidly generated and autologous malignant plasma cells are killed. OKT3 may thus be exploited in autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) to purge residual plasma cells and simultaneously activate T cells to induce graft-versus-leukemia-like (GVL-like) activity upon reinfusion. However, the possible impact of ex-vivo short-term OKT3 stimulation on haematological recovery is unknown. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of OKT3 stimulation in vitro on autologous haemopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) of MM patients. Colony formation by granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-GM) was highly suppressed, although supernatants of OKT3-activated T cells contained up to 2,500 pg/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). T cell depletion completely prevented this suppression. Neutralizing antibodies against TNF-alpha, TNF-beta and IFN-gamma (which are also produced by OKT3-activated MM T cells) did not prevent it, and Transwell cultures showed that cell-to-cell contact was the main mechanism involved. OKT3-activated T cells also suppressed erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) and CFU-GM generation from HPC responsible for long-term maintenance of in vitro myelopoiesis. When tested on normal allogeneic BM, MM supernatants of OKT3-stimulated BMMC partially suppressed the generation of day 7 CFU-GM, but had no effect on day 14 CFU-GM. These data indicate that short-term stimulation of BMMC with OKT3 can be used to generate anti-tumour effector T cells for autologous adoptive immunotherapy. It is not a feasable approach for ex-vivo purging and activation procedures in ABMT because of its potent inhibition of autologous haemopoiesis.","['Attisano, C', 'Bianchi, A', 'Montacchini, L', 'Carlesso, N', 'Peola, S', 'Bruno, B', 'Roux, V', 'Ferrero, D', 'Gallo, E', 'Boccadoro, M']","['Attisano C', 'Bianchi A', 'Montacchini L', 'Carlesso N', 'Peola S', 'Bruno B', 'Roux V', 'Ferrero D', 'Gallo E', 'Boccadoro M', 'et al.']","[""Dipartimento di Medicina e Oncologia Sperimentale, Universita' di Torino, Ospedale Maggiore S.

Spontaneous megakaryocyte colonies (CFU-MK) were found in 34/40 (80%) blood and 14/18 (77.8%) bone marrow plasma clot cultures, and also observed in 27/35 (77.1%) blood and 10/18 (55.6%) bone marrow serum-free agar cultures. In the blood of 27 patients with MPD (15 ET, four PV, four CML and four PMF) and the bone marrow of 10 patients (five ET, four CML and one PV), spontaneous colony formation was observed in both plasma clot and serum-free agar cultures. However, spontaneous CFU-MK was only found in plasma clot culture, but not in agar culture in two blood (one ET and one CML) and four bone marrow cultures (one ET, two PV, one CML). The colony numbers were greatly increased in the presence of aplastic anaemia serum (AAS) under both conditions. In 17 patients (12 ET, two CML and three PV) with spontaneous megakaryocyte colonies, anti-cytokine antibody neutralizing experiments were carried out in blood cultures. Anti-IL3, anti-IL6 and anti-GM-CSF antibody, alone or in combination, at different concentrations (1, 5 and 10 micrograms/ml), were added into plasma clot or agar cultures without exogenous stimulating growth factors. The results showed that the numbers of spontaneous megakaryocyte colonies were not significantly decreased in the presence of these monoclonal antibodies in the cultures. The data indicated that the megakaryocyte progenitor growth in MPD under in vitro conditions was heterogenous, and independent of exogenous stimulatory factors in most patients and that optimal megakaryocyte colony development in MPD still requires exogenous growth factors. Three possibilities are discussed with regard to the phenomenon that the spontaneous colony formation was not decreased with the addition of anti-IL3, anti-IL6 and anti-GM-CSF antibodies.","['Li, Y', 'Hetet, G', 'Maurer, A M', 'Chait, Y', 'Dhermy, D', 'Briere, J']","['Li Y', 'Hetet G', 'Maurer AM', 'Chait Y', 'Dhermy D', 'Briere J']","['INSERM U409, Association Claude Bernard, Clichy, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*immunology', 'Interleukin-6/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology', 'Megakaryocytes/immunology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Polycythemia Vera/immunology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/immunology']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08300.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jul;87(3):471-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08300.x.,,,,,,,,,

This study documents that both fMLP and PMA induced CL was normal in PMN from patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and essential thrombocythaemia (ET). Furthermore, we monitored intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in PMN and monocytes from patients with PV, CML and ET by flow cytometry. H2O2 production in resting and PMA-stimulated cells was normal in all diseases. So also was fMLP induced H2O2 generation in ET PMN and monocytes. In contrast, fMLP-induced H2O2 production was significantly lower both in PV PMN (1.8 +/- 0.7 mean fluorescence intensity units in PV compared to 8.4 +/- 3.4 in healthy controls; P < 0.02), and in PV monocytes (0.3 +/- 0.5 compared to 2.5 +/- 0.7 in controls; P < 0.02). A less pronounced reduction of fMLP stimulated H2O2 production was noted in CML PMN (3.8 +/- 3.1 compared to 8.4 +/- 3.4 in controls; P < 0.05), and monocytes (1.3 +/- 0.6 compared to 2.5 +/- 0.7 in controls; P < 0.05). The reduction of H2O2 generation in PV and CML PMN was not attributed to subpopulations of less responsive cells. However, one ET and one CML patient showed a subpopulation of less responsive PMN. Thus intracellular H2O2 (as well as extracellular release of superoxide ions) is reduced in fMLP-stimulated PV PMN and monocytes but normal after PMA stimulation, a phenomenon that is not consistently found in other myeloproliferative disorders.","['Samuelsson, J', 'Forslid, J', 'Hed, J', 'Palmblad, J']","['Samuelsson J', 'Forslid J', 'Hed J', 'Palmblad J']","['Department of Medicine, Stockholm Soder Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Polycythemia Vera/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/metabolism', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/metabolism']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08299.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jul;87(3):464-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08299.x.,,,,,,,,,

Two molecularly cloned strains of MuLV, ts-1, a temperature-sensitive mutant of Moloney MuLV, and pNE-8, derived from a feral mouse isolate Cas-Br-E, were used in this study. Infected mice were sacrificed at regular intervals postinoculation throughout the time-course of disease. The neuropathology was evaluated using standard histological and immunohistopathological techniques. Tissue concentrations of viral proteins and potentially cytotoxic factors were compared with the histopathology in select regions of the CNS. Areas of extensive vacuolation with neuronal and oligodendroglial infection were observed in spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum. High titers of infectious virus were observed within CNS lesions, whereas low titers were observed in morphologically uninvolved areas. Western blot analysis revealed abundant production of viral envelope proteins, which correlated well with infectious virus titers. Serum quinolinic acid (QUIN) concentrations in both groups of noninfected and infected mice were similar. However, CNS tissue concentrations of QUIN, TNF alpha, and IL-6 in ts-1 infected mice were significantly higher than in pNE-8 infected or noninfected mice. The difference in concentration of these factors may be the result of greater activation of macrophages/microglia in ts-1 infected mice. During murine retroviral encephalitis, CNS damage may be mediated by direct infection of CNS cells and may be enhanced by indirect effects of neurotoxic factors possibly secreted by infected/activated macrophages.","['Nagra, R M', 'Heyes, M P', 'Wiley, C A']","['Nagra RM', 'Heyes MP', 'Wiley CA']","['Brain Research Institute, University of California Los Angeles.']",['eng'],['NS-27417/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Chem Neuropathol,Molecular and chemical neuropathology,8910358,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'F6F0HK1URN (Quinolinic Acid)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Brain/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Brain Stem/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Female', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nervous System Diseases/pathology/*virology', 'Pregnancy', 'Quinolinic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Spinal Cord/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF03160102 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Chem Neuropathol. 1994 Aug;22(3):143-60. doi: 10.1007/BF03160102.,,,,,,,,,

IFN-alpha is produced in the leukocytes infected with virus, while IFN-beta is from fibroblasts infected with virus. IFN-gamma is induced by the stimulation of sensitized lymphocytes with antigen or non-sensitized lymphocytes with mitogens. It is believed that IFN-alpha and beta originated from the same ancestral gene, whereas IFN-gamma did not. IFN has not only an antiviral activity, but also various kinds of biological activities including cell growth inhibition, immunosuppressive effects, enhancement of macrophage, natural killer (NK) cell, killer (K) cell and neutrophil functions, and cell differentiation-inducing activity. IFN also shows the antitumor activity resulting from the integration of the above-mentioned biological activities. IFN is also deeply involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases, e.g., collagen diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, fulminant hepatitis, severe pancreatitis, nephritis, multiple sclerosis, allergic diseases, and atherosclerosis. At present, IFN is clinically used in therapy against virus infections such as hepatitis B and C, and for malignancies such as renal cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma, malignant melanoma, glioblastoma, skin cancers, malignant lymphoma and chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Imanishi, J']",['Imanishi J'],"['Dept. of Microbiology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

In contrast, the halogen atom(s) were not determinants of anti-VZV activity, where the approximately equipotent 5-(1-hydroxy-2,2-dihaloethyl) compounds (3, 4, 5, 6) exhibited anti-VZV activity comparable to that of acyclovir.

Clinical trials have demonstrated a potential role for this regimen in the management of acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Autologous bone marrow transplantation continues to be limited by high relapse rates, as compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Two factors are thought to account for this observation. First, autologous transplants lack the immunologic ""graft-versus-host"" advantage of allogeneic transplants. Second, autologous grafts have the possibility of tumor cell contamination. Methods to reduce tumor cell contamination in autografts include exposure to chemical agents or monoclonal antibodies; long-term marrow cultures; and immunologic manipulation, either with immunomagnetic devices or antibody/complement combinations. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with porfimer sodium (Photofrin; manufactured by Lederle Parenterals, Carolina, Puerto Rico, under license from Quadra Logic Technologies, Inc, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) or benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD verteporfin; BPD-MA; BPD-Quadra Logic Technologies, Inc, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) may be an effective means of purging bone marrow. The ability of malignant cells to selectively accumulate photosensitizing agents may account for efficacy of PDT in bone marrow purging. The efficacy of porfimer sodium and BPD has been evaluated in cell lines known to express multidrug resistance (MDR), and the results compared with corresponding MDR-negative cell lines. Multidrug resistance-positive cell lines appear relatively resistant to BPD; porfimer sodium remains active. The reason for the differential effect of MDR positivity on the cytotoxicity of porfimer sodium and BPD is unclear, but is believed to be related to the larger size of the porfimer sodium molecule. Clinical trials evaluating PDT in bone marrow transplantation are under way.","['Mulroney, C M', 'Gluck, S', 'Ho, A D']","['Mulroney CM', 'Gluck S', 'Ho AD']","['University of California, San Diego Cancer Center 92103-8421.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0X9PA28K43 (Verteporfin)', '68335-15-9 (Hematoporphyrin Derivative)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hematoporphyrin Derivative/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Porphyrins/therapeutic use', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verteporfin']",17,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1994 Dec;21(6 Suppl 15):24-7.,,,,,,,,,

Conventional chemotherapy with hydroxyurea or busulfan continues to be the most widely prescribed modality. Recent data suggest that hydroxyurea is preferred over busulfan on the basis of survival rates, particularly among patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation. To improve on responses associated with interferon-alfa (IFN-alpha) alone, IFN-alpha has been added to drugs with selective activity against CML. Combining low-dose cytosine arabinoside and IFN-alpha improves outcome in patients with late chronic-phase CML. Preliminary results with homoharringtonine as induction therapy followed by the addition of IFN-alpha as maintenance therapy are also promising in patients with early chronic-phase CML. Enthusiasm regarding allogeneic bone marrow transplantation remains high, but there are problems related to paucity of ideal candidates, controversies regarding optimal timing, and some mortality. Interferon-alfa has been used in the immediate posttransplant period to reverse early cytogenetic relapse in a limited number of patients, which suggests that IFN-alpha also may be useful in preventing relapse in high-risk patients. In autologous bone marrow transplantation, there is interest among investigators in reducing the leukemic burden and altering the marrow microenvironment to favor normal hematopoiesis, but the effect of this alternative on survival is not yet known. Results suggest that young patients are candidates for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, whereas older patients should be offered IFN-based therapy initially.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Talpaz, M']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",21,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1994 Dec;21(6 Suppl 14):8-13.,,,,,,,,,

These observations were confirmed by us and others when larger quantities of IFN-alpha became available through recombinant DNA technology (rIFN-alpha). In contrast with our experience with chemotherapy, myelosuppression was not required for cytogenetic remission; this dissociation may be the basis for the selectivity of IFN-alpha against CML.

This effect was independent of donors, duration of the culture period, and the E:T ratio in the cytotoxic assay. As pH gradients surrounding tumor cells may reach values below pH 6.0 at the cell surface, the pH-dependence of LAK cell cytotoxicity could at least partially explain the inhibition of the natural immune response in solid tumors.

A highly basic, lysine-rich motif of the predicted ELL protein is homologous to similar regions of several proteins, including the DNA-binding domain of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The characterization of the normal functions of ELL as well as its altered function when fused to MLL will be critical to further our understanding of the mechanisms of leukemogenesis.","['Thirman, M J', 'Levitan, D A', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Simon, M C', 'Rowley, J D']","['Thirman MJ', 'Levitan DA', 'Kobayashi H', 'Simon MC', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL52094/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Gene Library', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Organ Specificity', '*Peptide Elongation Factors', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1994/12/06 00:00,1994/12/06 00:01,['1994/12/06 00:00'],"['1994/12/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/06 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.25.12110 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Dec 6;91(25):12110-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.25.12110.,PMC45386,"['ELL', 'ENL', 'MLL']",,,['GENBANK/U16282'],,,,

Forty-eight random DNAs from total human bone marrow were subjected to single-pass DNA sequence analysis to determine a limited complexity of mRNAs expressed in the bone marrow. Overall, 8 cDNAs (17%) showed no similarity to known sequences. Information from DNA sequence analysis was used to develop a differential prescreen to subtract unwanted cDNAs and to enrich for unknown cDNAs. Forty-eight cDNAs that were negative with a complex probe were subject to single-pass DNA sequence determination. Of these prescreened cDNAs, the number of unknown sequences increased to 23 (48%). Unknown cDNAs were also characterized by RNA expression analysis using 25 different human leukemic cell lines. Of 13 unknown cDNAs tested, 10 were expressed in all cell types tested and 3 revealed a hematopoietic lineage-restricted expression pattern. Interestingly, while a total of only 96 bone marrow cDNAs were sequenced, 31 of these cDNAs represent sequences from unknown genes and 12 showed significant similarities to sequences in the data bases. One cDNA revealed a significant similarity to a serine/threonine-protein kinase at the amino acid level (56% identity for 123 amino acids) and may represent a previously unknown kinase. Differential screening techniques coupled with single-pass cDNA sequence analysis may prove to be a powerful and simple technique to examine developmental gene expression.","['Orr, S L', 'Hughes, T P', 'Sawyers, C L', 'Kato, R M', 'Quan, S G', 'Williams, S P', 'Witte, O N', 'Hood, L']","['Orr SL', 'Hughes TP', 'Sawyers CL', 'Kato RM', 'Quan SG', 'Williams SP', 'Witte ON', 'Hood L']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary/*analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Swine', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/06 00:00,1994/12/06 00:01,['1994/12/06 00:00'],"['1994/12/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/06 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.25.11869 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Dec 6;91(25):11869-73. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.25.11869.,PMC45337,,,,['GENBANK/S74539'],,,,

Human IFN-gamma was also internalized and translocated to the nucleus of murine L1210 cells transfected with and expressing the human IFN-gamma receptor, but it appeared to be retained by the nucleus only transiently. IFN-gamma molecules chemically crosslinked to their cell surface receptor remain capable of being translocated to the nucleus even as part of a receptor-ligand complex.

However, the rearranged bands were much more faint than was the germ-line band. We considered the monoclonal population of B cells small. Two of the five cases recurred locally after four and nine years respectively. Because benign lymphoid hyperplasias frequently contain an occult monoclonal B-cell population, a follow-up should be conducted.

Forty children are alive in second continuous remission and 24 are alive after a second or subsequent relapse. Patients with isolated T relapse showed a significant better outcome than those with BM or CNS involvement. Most patients (62%) with isolated BM relapse showed a further disease recurrence in BM, and DFS was shorter when relapse occurred within 12 months from off-therapy. Eighty-two patients in second CR stopped the treatment a second time and showed a survival and DFS probabilities, respectively, of 69% and 43%.

All the patients presented intense granulocytopenia (< 0.5 x 10(9)/L), had intravenous catheters and were receiving wide spectrum antibiotics as treatment for bacterial infection. The diagnosis of the fungal infection was based on the growth of C. tropicalis in blood cultures together with the evidence of tissue involvement by the fungus. Fever (> 38 degrees C) was the initial symptom of the infection in all the patients, being accompanied by myalgia in 5 cases, pleuritic pain in 2 and septic shock in 1. Violaceous erthymatomous pustules disseminated over the trunk and limbs, the histologic study of which demonstrated the presence of C. tropicalis were observed in 9 patients. Septic metastasis were found in the liver (2 cases), serosae (2 cases), the psoas muscle and the brain (1 case), respectively. Eight patients underwent treatment with amphotericin B which was complemented with 5-fluorocytosin in 6, with death occurring in the remaining 2 patients prior to the start of treatment. Three patients died with active fungal infection (2 by cerebral hemorrhage and 1 by septic shock). In 2 patients the infection evolved to chronic systemic candidiasis and in the remaining 5 patients infection was resolved with hemoperipheral values returning to normal. Sepsis by Candida tropicalis is a severe complication in patients with granulocytopenia, being mainly characterized by fever, cutaneous papulae and, to a lesser extent, muscle pain. Amphotericin B alone, or in combination with 5-fluorocytosin constitute a treatment of choice in this infection, which nonetheless is associated with an undisdainful mortality.","['Terol, M J', 'Tassies, D', 'Lopez-Guillermo, A', 'Martin-Ortega, E', 'Blade, J', 'Cervantes, F', 'Garcia, C', 'Montserrat, E', 'Rozman, C']","['Terol MJ', 'Tassies D', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Martin-Ortega E', 'Blade J', 'Cervantes F', 'Garcia C', 'Montserrat E', 'Rozman C']","['Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, Hospital Clinic i Provincial, Barcelona.']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agranulocytosis/*complications/physiopathology', 'Candidiasis/*complications/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sepsis/*complications/drug therapy/physiopathology']",,1994/11/05 00:00,1994/11/05 00:01,['1994/11/05 00:00'],"['1994/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1994 Nov 5;103(15):579-82.,,,,Sepsis por Candida tropicalis en pacientes granulocitopenicos.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase I clinical trial, paclitaxel was administered as a 3-hour intravenous (IV) infusion, repeated every week for 6 weeks. The starting dose of paclitaxel was 10 mg/m2. Doses were escalated at 10-mg/m2 increments in successive cohorts of three new patients if tolerated. Unacceptable toxicity was defined as grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, excluding nausea and vomiting, and grade 4 hematologic toxicity according to Cancer and Leukemia Group B expanded common toxicity criteria. Radiation was administered to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (40 Gy) followed by a boost to the tumor (20 Gy). RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were entered onto this study through seven dose escalations (from 10 mg/m2/wk to 70 mg/m2/wk for 6 weeks). Severe esophagitis occurred at 70 mg/m2 (two patients with grade 4 disease and one patient with grade 2). One of six patients at 60 mg/m2 developed grade 3 esophagitis and three of seven patients had grade 2 esophagitis. One of 27 patients developed a hypersensitivity reaction. One of 27 patients developed grade 3 neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Esophagitis is the principle dose-limiting toxicity of weekly paclitaxel and thoracic radiation in the outpatient setting. A phase II trial using concurrent radiation and paclitaxel at the MTD of 60 mg/m2/wk is underway.","['Choy, H', 'Akerley, W', 'Safran, H', 'Clark, J', 'Rege, V', 'Papa, A', 'Glantz, M', 'Puthawala, Y', 'Soderberg, C', 'Leone, L']","['Choy H', 'Akerley W', 'Safran H', 'Clark J', 'Rege V', 'Papa A', 'Glantz M', 'Puthawala Y', 'Soderberg C', 'Leone L']","['Department of Radiation Therapy, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence 02903.']",['eng'],['CA13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/etiology', 'Esophagitis/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2682 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Dec;12(12):2682-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2682.,,,,,,,,,

PATIENT AND METHODS: Data were collected on 120 pediatric cancer patients from a large variety of diagnostic groups. Patients completed a comprehensive neuropsychologic test battery designed to assess most areas of cognitive functioning. In analyzing cancer treatment effects, the following variables were statistically controlled: (1) age, (2) socioeconomic status (SES), (3) age at diagnosis, (4) months since both onset and cessation of CNS treatments, (5) time missed from schooling, and (6) presence/type of CNS cancer. RESULTS: CRT, largely in combination with IT-MTX, was significantly associated with deficits in several, primarily nondominant, hemispheric neuropsychologic functions, even after control and other treatment variables were addressed. This relationship was somewhat, but not highly, dose-dependent at CRT doses greater than approximately 18 Gy, at least over the first several years posttreatment. While there was statistically significant evidence for cognitive impairment, absence from school during treatment and age at diagnosis were more predictive of reading and spelling academic achievement than having received CRT. IT-MTX and SYS-MTX alone were not associated with significant degrees of neuropsychologic involvement. CONCLUSION: CRT, especially when administered with IT-MTX, at currently used dosages was associated with significant neuropsychologic impairment in children. These impairments are most likely to be reflected in nonverbal intelligence, perceptual abilities, and susceptibility to distraction. IT-MTX and SYS-MTX did not result in a consistent pattern of cognitive deficit.","['Butler, R W', 'Hill, J M', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Meyers, P A', 'Finlay, J L']","['Butler RW', 'Hill JM', 'Steinherz PG', 'Meyers PA', 'Finlay JL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,,"['Absenteeism', 'Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/therapy', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Intelligence/drug effects', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Neuropsychological Tests']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2621 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Dec;12(12):2621-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2621.,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The lymphoblasts of 45 patients with a balanced translocation, t(1;19) or its derivative form, der(19)t(1;19), were analyzed by cytogenetic and immunologic methods for differences that might suggest distinct subtypes of ALL. This cohort was treated in four consecutive clinical trials with a median overall follow-up duration of 7 years. RESULTS: A pre-B immunophenotype was found in 10 cases with the balanced t(1;19) and 31 with the unbalanced der(19)t(1;19). The four remaining cases, each with a derivative t(1;19), were classified as early pre-B ALL. The characteristic surface antigen profile of the 41 pre-B cases was CD19+/CD10+/CD22+/CD34-/CD20+/-, whether the translocation was balanced or derivative. In contrast to the four early pre-B cases, which had hyperdiploid karyotypes (> 50 chromosomes), the pre-B cases were primarily pseudodiploid. Comparison of presenting clinical and laboratory features, as well as event-free survival, failed to disclose any differences that would warrant separation of pre-B cases with a balanced or derivative translocation. However, neither subgroup responded to therapy as well as patients with early pre-B ALL, each of whom remains in complete remission for > or = 3 years. CONCLUSION: The t(1;19) and the der(19)t(1;19) identify a relatively homogeneous group of patients with pre-B ALL, who can be expected to respond similarly to intensive chemotherapy. The exceptional cases have an early pre-B phenotype with hyperdiploid karyotypes and appear to have favorable prognosis.","['Pui, C H', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Hancock, M L', 'Rivera, G K', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Mahmoud, H H', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Crist, W M', 'Behm, F G']","['Pui CH', 'Raimondi SC', 'Hancock ML', 'Rivera GK', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Mahmoud HH', 'Sandlund JT', 'Crist WM', 'Behm FG']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['P01 CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2601 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Dec;12(12):2601-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2601.,,,,,,,,,

We compared outcome between 1,450 patients who had varying degrees of pleocytosis but no blasts in the CSF at diagnosis (blast-negative group) with 94 who had blasts detected in the CSF after cytocentrifugation but had a total CSF WBC count of < or = 5/microL (blast-positive group). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in overall CNSR or EFS rates were observed between the two groups and no differences were found when analyzed according to age or WBC count at diagnosis, sex, or type of CNS prophylaxis (intrathecal [IT] methotrexate [MTX] alone v IT MTX plus 18 Gy cranial irradiation [CXRT]). CONCLUSION: In intermediate-risk ALL, there was no significant difference in CNSR and systemic relapse rates after standard presymptomatic CNS therapy between patients with a CSF WBC count < or = 5/microL and those without identifiable blasts in the CSF. These findings suggest that certain approaches to therapy, such as that used in this study, may eliminate the need for any additional special treatment directed at this subset of patients with CSF blasts.","['Gilchrist, G S', 'Tubergen, D G', 'Sather, H N', 'Coccia, P F', ""O'Brien, R T"", 'Waskerwitz, M J', 'Hammond, G D']","['Gilchrist GS', 'Tubergen DG', 'Sather HN', 'Coccia PF', ""O'Brien RT"", 'Waskerwitz MJ', 'Hammond GD']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/complications/drug therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2594 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Dec;12(12):2594-600. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2594.,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-five patients with postthymic T-cell malignancies were given DCF intravenously at 4 mg/m2/wk for the first 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks until maximal response; the last 30 patients received weekly injections until maximal response. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 32% (complete responses [CRs] plus partial responses [PRs]), with marked variation according to diagnosis. The best responses occurred in patients with Sezary syndrome (62%) and T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) (45%), with CRs in three of 16 Sezary syndrome and five of 55 T-PLL patients. In contrast, no responses (NRs) were documented in 13 patients with other types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, including five mycosis fungoides. Two of five patients with large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia had a CR and two of four with Sezary cell leukaemia had a PR. A low response rate was observed in 27 patients with peripheral T-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (T-NHL) (19%) and in 25 with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (12%). The latter included two CRs and one PR. Toxicity was low and DCF was generally well tolerated. No significant differences were observed when results were analyzed according to previous treatment. Disease subtype was the most important factor to influence results.

In a large multicentric trial (LALA87), we compared allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with other postremission therapies (chemotherapy or autologous transplantation) using the result of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing as a random allocation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient eligibility requirements were as follows: (1) inclusion in LALA87 trial, (2) complete response to induction or salvage therapy, (3) age 15 to 40 years, and (4) at least one potential sibling donor. Patients with an HLA-identical sibling were assigned to the BMT group, while patients without a sibling donor constituted the control group. Allogeneic transplantation was scheduled for patients in the BMT group; in the control group, patients were randomly allocated to receive chemotherapy or autologous transplantation. RESULTS: Of 284 eligible points, 257 entered the study: 116 were allocated to the BMT group and 141 to the control group. The 5-year survival rates were not statistically significantly different between the two groups.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all 262 patients who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 1982 through 1991. Although patients received a variety of treatments before they were eligible for transplant, identical myeloablative therapy (cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/d for 2 days plus total-body irradiation twice daily for 3 days) was administered in each case. By collecting data on pretransplant and early posttransplant variables, we attempted to identify risk factors for the development of MDS. RESULTS: The crude overall incidence of posttransplant MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was 7.6%. The actuarial risk at 6 years was 18% +/- 9%. The median time of onset was 31 months (range, 10 to 101) after transplant or 69 months (range, 27 to 141) after initial treatment for lymphoma. Pretreatment variables predictive for the development of MDS (univariate analysis) included prolonged interval between initial treatment and the transplant procedure (P = .003), increased duration of exposure to chemotherapy (P = .019) or to alkylating agents (P = .045), and use of radiation therapy (P = .032) or pelvic radiation (P = .003) before transplant. CONCLUSION: MDS is a potential complication of autologous bone marrow transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; bone marrow stem-cell damage sustained before the transplant may be the most important risk factor.","['Stone, R M', 'Neuberg, D', 'Soiffer, R', 'Takvorian, T', 'Whelan, M', 'Rabinowe, S N', 'Aster, J C', 'Leavitt, P', 'Mauch, P', 'Freedman, A S']","['Stone RM', 'Neuberg D', 'Soiffer R', 'Takvorian T', 'Whelan M', 'Rabinowe SN', 'Aster JC', 'Leavitt P', 'Mauch P', 'Freedman AS', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2535 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Dec;12(12):2535-42. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2535.,,,,,,,,,

For those patients who went on to develop MDS/AML, controls were selected and a case-control-within-a-cohort study undertaken. RESULTS: Twelve patients developed MDS or AML a median of 44 months following ABMT/PSCT. The cumulative incidence (P = .42) and the conditional probability (P = .32) of MDS/AML were not statistically different between HD and NHL patients. Age greater than 40 years at the time of transplant (P = .05) and receipt of a total-body irradiation (TBI)-containing regimen (P = .06) were predictive for developing MDS/AML in patients with NHL.

D., Kolesnick, R. N., Fornari, F. A., Traylor, R. S., Gewirtz, D. A., and Grant, S. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 73-77). The present findings show that diglyceride opposes ceramide-related apoptosis in HL-60 and U937 cells. Acute (6-12-h) exposure to sphingomyelinase (100 milliunits/ml) or synthetic ceramide (10 microM) promoted apoptotic degradation of genomic DNA as indicated by (a) the appearance of both approximately 50-kilobase pair (kbp) DNA fragments and approximately 0.2-1.2-kbp DNA fragment ladders on agarose gels, (b) formation and release of small double-stranded DNA fragments, and (c) loss of integrity of bulk DNA. DNA damage was associated with reduced clonogenicity and expression of apoptotic morphology. In contrast, exposure to phospholipase C (0.001-100 milliunits/ml) or synthetic diglyceride (10 microM) failed to promote apoptosis and abolished the lethal actions of ceramide as defined by each of the indices outlined above. Ceramide-related apoptosis was also reduced by acute (6-h) exposure to tumor promoters such as phorbol dibutyrate and mezerein and the non-tumor-promoting agent bryostatin 1; conversely, chronic (24-h) pretreatment with these agents failed to modify ceramide-mediated cytotoxicity, but abolished the protective actions of diglyceride. These findings demonstrate that diglyceride and pharmacological protein kinase C activators reduce or abolish ceramide-mediated apoptosis in human leukemia cells and support the concept of a cytoprotective function for protein kinase C in the regulation of leukemic cell survival. In addition, the capacity of diglyceride to prevent very early genomic lesions (e.g. generation of 50-kbp DNA fragments) suggests that acute activation of protein kinase C arrests apoptosis at an initial stage.","['Jarvis, W D', 'Fornari, F A Jr', 'Browning, J L', 'Gewirtz, D A', 'Kolesnick, R N', 'Grant, S']","['Jarvis WD', 'Fornari FA Jr', 'Browning JL', 'Gewirtz DA', 'Kolesnick RN', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['CA-16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Diglycerides)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Diglycerides/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/pharmacology']",,1994/12/16 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/12/16 00:00'],"['1994/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)31750-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Dec 16;269(50):31685-92.,,,,,,,,,

The basal promoter strength of constructs that contained deletions in the U5 region of the LTR was analyzed by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays following transfection of HeLa cells or Jurkat T-cells in the presence or absence of viral transactivator tax protein. We consistently observed a 2- to 5-fold increase in basal promoter activity when sequences between +277 to +306 were deleted. In vivo competition experiments suggested that the U5 DNA fragment from +269 to +295 contains a functional repressive element (U5RE). Using gel mobility shift assays, we have purified a highly enriched fraction that could specifically bind U5RE. This DNA affinity column fraction contained three major detectable proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining: 110-, 80- and 70-kDa proteins. The 110-kDa protein appeared to be a novel DNA-binding protein whose characteristics are still obscure, while the 70- and 80-kDa proteins were shown to be related to the human autoantigen Ku, the Ku (p70/p80) complex, as demonstrated by amino acid sequencing and immunological analyses.

This led to the development of other types of non-organic cytostatic drugs. Cisplatin has developed into one of the most frequently used and most effective cytostatic drugs for the treatment of solid carcinomas. Numerous other metal compounds containing platinum, other platinum metals, and even non-platinum metals were then shown to be effective against tumours in man and experimental tumours in animals. These compounds comprise main-group metallic compounds of gallium, germanium, tin, and bismuth, early-transition metal complexes of titanium, vanadium, niobium, molybdenum, and rhenium, and late-transition metal complexes of ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, platinum, copper, and gold. Several platnium complexes and four non-platnium-metal antitumour agents have so far entered early clinical trials. Gallium trinitrate and spirogermanium have already passed phase II clinical studies and have shown limited cytostatic activity against certain human carcinomas and lymphomas.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia is associated with a chromosomal translocation which results in the fusion of genes encoding a putative transcription factor (PML) and the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha). It is suggested that the PML/RAR alpha fusion protein functions as an inhibitor of myeloid differentiation. The potential use of ribozymes as therapeutic agents has been investigated in the present study. Hammerhead ribozymes, which by hybridizing to both PML and RAR alpha sequences discriminate between the fusion transcript and the normal transcripts from the nonrearranged alleles, were designed and synthesized. Two hammerhead cleavage sites were targeted: site 1, an AUU located 4 nucleotides 3' to the fusion junction; and site 2, a UUC located 26 nucleotides 3' to the junction. Both sites are located in the RAR alpha portion of the fusion transcript. Using a full-length PML/RAR alpha RNA or an RNA corresponding to 788 nucleotides of the PML/RAR alpha mRNA and a full-length RAR alpha RNA or an RNA corresponding to 960 nucleotides of the RAR alpha mRNA as model substrates, the catalytic behavior of several ribozymes was studied. A modified hammerhead directed against site 2 displayed the highest degree of selectivity for PML/RAR alpha. It is hypothesized that ribozyme-mediated inactivation of PML/RAR alpha provides a new approach to study the role of PML/RAR alpha in the deregulated growth and RA response of acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Pace, U', 'Bockman, J M', 'MacKay, B J', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Dmitrovsky, E', 'Goldberg, A R']","['Pace U', 'Bockman JM', 'MacKay BJ', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Goldberg AR']","['Innovir Laboratories, Inc., New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],['R01 CA 62275-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'RNA, Catalytic/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",,1994/12/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/12/15 00:00'],"['1994/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Dec 15;54(24):6365-9.,,,,,,,,,

This was carried out using Chinese hamster ovary 5AHSmyc cells which contain the human c-myc proto-oncogene under the control of a heat shock promoter. Heat treatment induces c-Myc overexpression and thus apoptosis as determined by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. We transfected 5AHSmyc cells with mcl-1 and found that clones expressing the introduced Mcl-1 protein exhibited reduced DNA fragmentation. Mcl-1 was also capable of delaying the onset of cell death as judged by loss of membrane integrity, although it could not provide complete protection from c-Myc overexpression.

The purpose of this review is to consider, in the broad sense of the word, the present possibilities and limitations of enzyme cytochemistry and to emphasize how cytochemistry may contribute, on integration with the other methods of study, to the final classification and differential diagnosis of acute leukemia, a highly variable hematological disorder. In this review, the role of conventional enzyme cytochemistry, either dominant or subsidiary, in the discrimination of acute leukemia subtypes is discussed. The survey confirms the absolute necessity of immunologic marker analysis in the accurate diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, undifferentiated or minimally differentiated leukemia and mixed-lineage leukemia because in these cases, the cytochemical evaluation provides insufficiently relevant information regarding blast cell origin, specificity of leukemia subtypes and the discrete stages of leukemic cell maturation. On the other hand, cytochemical investigation is appreciated to be dominant over immunophenotyping in characterizing acute myeloid leukemia, because of the lack of specificity of the majority of immunological markers against myeloid antigens and, because of the availability of standardized and sufficiently specific cytochemical reactions. The cytogenetic, molecular biological and electron microscopic studies mentioned in this review supplement the important information for correct differential diagnosis of acute leukemia.

DESIGN: Observational study of mortality from leukaemia among the childhood population of England and Wales in relation to the unique population movements during the second world war. The 476 rural districts of England and Wales were ranked according to the ratio of government evacuees (two thirds of them children) to local children in September 1941. The districts were divided into three categories, each with similar numbers of children in 1947 but with different ratios of evacuees to local children (""low,"" ""intermediate,"" ""high""). Mortality from childhood leukaemia was examined in these three rural categories in 1945-9. Urban areas were also examined according to their exposure to evacuees. SETTING: Local authority areas of England and Wales. SUBJECTS: Children aged under 15. RESULTS: 47% excess of leukaemia at ages 0-14 years occurred in 1945-9 in the rural ""high"" category for evacuees relative to the ""low"" category, with a significant trend across the three categories. There were increases in both the 0-4 and 5-14 year age groups, but these were larger in the older age group. Rates 25% lower than average occurred in rural areas with few evacuees. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that wartime evacuation increased the incidence of childhood leukaemia in rural areas and that other forms of population mixing may have contributed to the increases in past decades. Overall, they add to the appreciable evidence for an infective basis in childhood leukaemia.","['Kinlen, L J', 'John, S M']","['Kinlen LJ', 'John SM']","['Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,['BMJ 1994 Nov 19;309(6965):1336'],"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*mortality', '*Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rural Health', 'Urban Health', 'Wales/epidemiology', '*Warfare']",,1994/11/05 00:00,1994/11/05 00:01,['1994/11/05 00:00'],"['1994/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.309.6963.1197 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1994 Nov 5;309(6963):1197-202. doi: 10.1136/bmj.309.6963.1197.,PMC2541692,,,,,,,,

These proteins are encoded by two [the 1.9- and the predominant 2.3-kilobase (kb) forms] of the five alternatively spliced max mRNA species. We now demonstrate that N,N'-hexamethylene bisacetamide-mediated differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells leads to a pattern of biphasic down-regulation of the 1.9- and the 2.3-kb myn (murine max) mRNAs that closely parallels that which occurs for myc mRNA. In contrast, the p22/Myn-L and p21/Myn-S protein isoforms down-regulate in monophasic fashion. Unlike the short-lived myc mRNA, the myn message is quite stable. However, its half-life of 3-6 h is still consistent with the biphasic down-regulation that accompanies differentiation. Furthermore, unlike myc, the overexpression of which prevents differentiation, elevated max levels merely delay differentiation. Coincident with this is a delay in the second decline of c-myc mRNA. In N,N'-hexamethylene bisacetamide-induced cells blocked from differentiating by overexpression of c-, N- or L-myc, myn mRNA expression is constitutive. These findings suggest that myn may also be involved in differentiation.","['Dunn, B K', 'Cogliati, T', 'Cultraro, C M', 'Bar-Ner, M', 'Segal, S']","['Dunn BK', 'Cogliati T', 'Cultraro CM', 'Bar-Ner M', 'Segal S']","['NCI-Navy Medical Oncology Branch, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20889.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', '*Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1994 Aug;5(8):847-54.,,"['c-myc', 'max', 'myn']",,,,,,,

Finnish Leukaemia Group.,725-9,"Osteolytic lesions and pathological fractures are the major problems in the clinical management of multiple myeloma. We previously reported the main results of a randomized, controlled multicentre trial in 350 Finnish patients with multiple myeloma. All patients received standard melphalan-prednisolone treatment and were randomized to receive either clodronate 2.4 g daily or a placebo for 24 months. The proportion of patients with progression of osteolytic bone lesions was twice as high in the placebo group as in the clodronate group (24.0% v 12.0%, P = 0.026). The purpose of the present study was to investigate factors associated with the progression of osteolytic lesions and to identify subgroups of patients who would benefit most from clodronate treatment. In univariate logistic regression analysis, including treatment (placebo, clodronate), sex, age, pain index, serum calcium and creatinine, myeloma stage, number of osteolytic lesions at baseline, and number of vertebral fractures at baseline as independent variables and the progression of osteolytic lesions as a dependent variable, only the treatment with a placebo was associated with the progression of osteolytic bone lesions. Separate analyses with respect to the progression of osteolytic bone lesions were carried out in the following subgroups: male v female, < or = 64 v > 64 years, stage I v stage II-III myeloma, no osteolytic lesions at baseline versus osteolytic lesions at baseline, no vertebral fractures at baseline versus vertebral fractures at baseline. and a 50% treatment response to cytotoxic drugs versus no treatment response to cytotoxic drugs. The treatment with clodronate delayed the progression of osteolytic lesions similarly in these subgroups, with the exception of a subgroup of patients who did not have a 50% treatment response to cytotoxic drugs. The treatment with clodronate did not significantly increase treatment costs. We conclude that the treatment effect of clodronate seems to be independent of sex and age of the patients, the stage of myeloma, and the severity of bone lesions at diagnosis, but not of treatment response to cytotoxic drugs.","['Laakso, M', 'Lahtinen, R', 'Virkkunen, P', 'Elomaa, I']","['Laakso M', 'Lahtinen R', 'Virkkunen P', 'Elomaa I']","['Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0813BZ6866 (Clodronic Acid)'],IM,,"['Aged', 'Bone and Bones/pathology', 'Clodronic Acid/*therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Osteolysis/etiology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*prevention & control', 'Risk Factors']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb06730.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Aug;87(4):725-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb06730.x.,,,,,,,,,

The paraproteins from 76/409 (19%) patients with MGUS reacted with at least one of 23 different anti-idiotypic antibodies used in this study. 18 MABs demonstrated reactivity with more than one patient's paraprotein. Moreover, 10 MABs reacted frequently (with 5-22 paraproteins). Over half (41/76) of the reactive patients' paraproteins reacted with more than one MAB from this panel. This frequency of anti-idiotypic reactivity was similar to that of previously studied patients with myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and follicular B-cell lymphomas. There was no correlation between specific anti-idiotypic reactivity and the propensity to develop serious disease (MM, macroglobulinaemia, amyloidosis, or other lymphoproliferative disorders) in patients with MGUS. These results suggest that MGUS is derived from cells producing antibodies that are similar to those of other B-cell malignancies and that the pattern of idiotype expression is irrelevant to malignant potential.","['Kampe, C E', 'Hart, S', 'Miller, R A', 'Lichtenstein, A', 'Kyle, R A', 'Berenson, J R']","['Kampe CE', 'Hart S', 'Miller RA', 'Lichtenstein A', 'Kyle RA', 'Berenson JR']","['Wadsworth Cancer Center, Department of Veterans Administration Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90073.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Paraproteins)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cross Reactions/immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Paraproteinemias/*immunology', 'Paraproteins/*immunology']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb06729.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Aug;87(4):719-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb06729.x.,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to elucidate the interpatient variability of CdA phosphorylation and its relation to response to CdA treatment. In extracts of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with B-CLL (n = 39), CdA phosphorylation was significantly higher than in HCL (n = 19) when calculated per protein (391 +/- 155 pmol CdA phosphorylated/mg protein/min versus 288 +/- 166 pmol/mg/min, P < 0.001), but was the same when calculated per cell (12 +/- 5.9 pmol/10(6) cells/min versus 14 +/- 5.9 pmol/10(6) cells/min) due to a larger cell volume in HCL. In T-CLL (n = 6), CdA phosphorylation was significantly lower than in B-CLL, both when calculated per protein (128 +/- 68 pmol/mg/min, P < 0.001) or per cell (5.7 +/- 2.7 pmol/10(6) cells/min, P < 0.05). This low CdA phosphorylation in T-CLL was unexpected because normal B- and T-lymphocytes contain equal amounts of CdA phosphorylation. With B-CLL, 21 patients who responded (complete and partial response) to CdA treatment showed a significantly higher CdA phosphorylation than 13 patients not responding to CdA treatment (456 +/- 170 pmol/mg/min versus 309 +/- 97 pmol/mg/min, P < 0.01).

In a recent study we showed that monocytes/macrophages induce HC proliferation in vitro. The purpose of the present paper is to examine the specificity of this accessory cell effect and to establish the mechanism(s) involved. We demonstrate that the effect is not confined to monocytes/macrophages but is also potentially seen with a range of other cell types. However, at low accessory cell:HC ratios (< 1:20) only human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and macrophages induce HC proliferation. We suggest that these observations are of pathophysiological significance in relation to the close association frequently observed between HCs and endothelial cells/macrophages in the liver and spleen of patients with hairy-cell leukaemia (HCL). Regarding the mechanisms of the accessory cell effect, we show that both soluble factors and cell contact are important. A blocking anti-TNF alpha antibody abrogated the HC proliferation induced by HUVEC supernatant, indicating the involvement of this cytokine. Interaction of HCs with HUVEC via CD11b and 11c leucocyte integrins was shown to be important in the contact effect. Our demonstration of the involvement of both cytokines and cell contact in HC proliferation is in accord with what is already known about the control of B-cell growth and differentiation.

This article describes differences between CTCL and ATL in terms of clinical and immunopathologic cell surface features. In patients with ATL, the predominant physical findings were lymph node, bone marrow and skin involvement, hepatosplenomegaly, leukemic manifestations, and an aggressive course. In patients with CTCL, in contrast, only skin lesions predominated at the onset of the disease and a relatively good prognosis was shown. The predominant phenotype of the neoplastic cells in the skin of patients with CTCL was CD3+, CD4+, CD29+, CD45RO+, HLA-DR+, HLA-DQ+, CD7-, L-selectin-, and CD45RA-. Some phenotypic discrepancy was found between the neoplastic cells in the peripheral blood, lymph nodes and skin of patients with ATL with respect to CD45RA and CD45RO, and CD7, CD29, CD25, and HLA-DR. That is, the predominant neoplastic cell phenotype was helper T-cell, which was CD3+, CD4+, L-selectin+, CD25+, CD45RA+, HLA-DR+, CD29-, and CD45RO- in peripheral blood, and CD3+, CD4+, L-selectin+, CD29+, CD45RO+, HLA-DR+, and CD45RA- in the skin and lymph nodes.

It also causes growth inhibition of several cell lines and stimulated lymphocytes. These effects were also present using transferrin-free culture conditions. In this paper, we dissect cell membrane and intracellular events after binding of J64 and other transferrin receptor antibodies. Incubation of HUT78 and several other cell lines with J64 resulted in an increased number of receptor molecules expressed on the cell surface in contrast to a downmodulation seen with other monoclonal antibodies to the transferrin receptor. This upregulation after treatment with J64 was not due to an increased concentration of transferrin receptor mRNA in these cells or a higher protein synthesis rate. We therefore suggest that J64 causes a redistribution of transferrin receptor molecules from intracellular pools to the cell surface. Additional experiments investigating signal transduction mechanisms revealed no influence of J64 on intracellular Ca2+ concentrations or translocation of protein kinase C. However, an increase of transferrin receptor phosphorylation was seen in HL60 cells after treatment with phorbolester or J64. This phosphorylation of the transferrin receptor might be a signal transduction pathway involved in activation and growth control.","['Keyna, U', 'Platzer, E', 'Woith, W', 'Nusslein, I', 'Kalden, J R', 'Manger, B']","['Keyna U', 'Platzer E', 'Woith W', 'Nusslein I', 'Kalden JR', 'Manger B']","['Department of Medicine III, Medical School Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cross Reactions', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*immunology/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",,1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb01309.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1994 Mar;52(3):169-75. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb01309.x.,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We developed an ex vivo model of bone resorption using juxtaarticular samples of bone obtained during joint surgery. We studied the histomorphometric parameters of bone resorption and the regulation of the production of IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and the collagen cross-link pyridinoline, which is released during bone resorption in vivo. RESULTS: This was a sensitive and dynamic model of bone resorption. The bone samples produced high levels of pyridinoline and as much cytokine as synovium pieces obtained from the same joint. IL-4 induced a 70% reduction of IL-6 and LIF production by bone pieces and reduced pyridinoline levels. Histomorphometric studies performed on bone samples indicated a 35% increase in the mean total bone area after 7 days of treatment with IL-4. More importantly, with IL-4, osteoclasts were not detectable in the bone sections. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect of IL-4 on bone resorption extends our knowledge of its antiinflammatory properties and suggests that the inflammatory cytokine imbalance in rheumatoid synovium also contributes to defects in bone resorption in RA.","['Miossec, P', 'Chomarat, P', 'Dechanet, J', 'Moreau, J F', 'Roux, J P', 'Delmas, P', 'Banchereau, J']","['Miossec P', 'Chomarat P', 'Dechanet J', 'Moreau JF', 'Roux JP', 'Delmas P', 'Banchereau J']","['Department of Immunology, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Bone Resorption/*prevention & control', 'Bone and Bones/metabolism', 'Collagen/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/metabolism', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Joints/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoclasts/*drug effects']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.1780371202 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1994 Dec;37(12):1715-22. doi: 10.1002/art.1780371202.,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, with 10 micrograms/mL etoposide or 2 microM 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine induced NF-kappa B activation within 1 hr and subsequently caused apoptosis within 3-4 hr. The simultaneous addition of 50-500 microM PDTC with these agents blocked NF-kappa B activation and completely abrogated both morphologically apoptotic changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation for up to 6 hr. However, PDTC failed to inhibit the endonuclease activity contained in the whole cell lysates. The inhibitory effect of PDTC was also observed in etoposide- and dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in human thymocytes at a concentration of 1-10 microM. Since PDTC has both antioxidant and metal-ion chelating activities, we tested the effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) (antioxidant) or o-phenanthroline (OP) (metal-ion chelator) on the induction of apoptosis. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells or thymocytes with 100-500 microM OP for 2 hr, but not 10-60 mM NAC, suppressed subsequent occurrence of apoptosis induced by etoposide.

They also stimulated photolabeling of the alpha-subunits of the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins), Gi2 and Gi3 with similar effectiveness. Chloride salts of monovalent cations differentially enhanced and inhibited chemoattractant-induced GTP hydrolyses. C5a was less effective than fMLP in enhancing cholera toxin-catalysed ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha 2 and Gi alpha 3, and LTB4 was ineffective. fMLP was more effective than C5a and LTB4 in stimulating Ca2+ influx in HL-60 cells. C5a- and LTB4-induced rises in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were PTX-sensitive, whereas the effect of fMLP was partially PTX-insensitive. LTB4-induced rises in [Ca2+]i were more sensitive towards homologous desensitization than those induced by C5a, and the effect of fMLP was resistant in this regard. C5a was considerably less effective than fMLP in activating superoxide anion formation and azurophilic granule release, and LTB4 was ineffective. Our data suggest that fMLP, C5a and LTB4 effectively activate the G-proteins, Gi2 and Gi3, in HL-60 cells and that fMLP may additionally activate PTX-insensitive G-proteins. fMLP, C5a and LTB4 are full, partial and incomplete secretagogues, respectively, and these differences may be due to differences in homologous receptor desensitization and qualitative Gi-protein activation.","['Klinker, J F', 'Schwaner, I', 'Offermanns, S', 'Hageluken, A', 'Seifert, R']","['Klinker JF', 'Schwaner I', 'Offermanns S', 'Hageluken A', 'Seifert R']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Bucladesine/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Complement C5a/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/metabolism"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukotriene B4/*pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/16 00:00,1994/11/16 00:01,['1994/11/16 00:00'],"['1994/11/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/16 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)90583-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)90583-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1994 Nov 16;48(10):1857-64. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)90583-5.,,,,,,,,,

Since the metabolic system changes rhythmically in time it follows that an organism such as man is biochemically and physiologically a different entity at different circadian stages; therefore it reacts differently to an identical stimulus given at different times. Different stimuli such as anticancer agents are examples considered clearly timed treatment has been shown to significantly improve therapeutic efficacy, data will be presented using the L1210 mouse leukemic model. Moreover data is presented showing that to ignore such rhythmic fluctuation when designing experiments that such can bring about experimental error and false interpretation.

In 8 patients (24%), hepatosplenic abscesses (HSA) developed. To identify the risk factors for the development of HSA, the authors compared various characteristics of febrile episodes in those with and without HSA. The risk factors included relapsed status of leukemia (P = 0.04) and Candida colonization of surveillance cultures from the throat (P = 0.03) and stool (P = 0.03). However, the duration of neutropenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, types of chemotherapy, and leukemia subtypes were not correlated with the development of HSA. Based on these results, the authors identified the high risk group for the development for HSA as patients with relapsed leukemia with fungal colonization of gastrointestinal tract during neutropenia despite empiric antifungal treatment with azoles.","['Chubachi, A', 'Miura, I', 'Ohshima, A', 'Nishinari, T', 'Nimura, T', 'Niitsu, H', 'Miura, A B']","['Chubachi A', 'Miura I', 'Ohshima A', 'Nishinari T', 'Nimura T', 'Niitsu H', 'Miura AB']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Akita University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,"['7NNO0D7S5M (Miconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,,"['Abscess/*etiology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Candidiasis/complications/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Fever/drug therapy', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Liver Abscess/*etiology', 'Male', 'Miconazole/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenic Diseases/*etiology']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9629(15)35165-X [pii]', '10.1097/00000441-199412000-00001 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 1994 Dec;308(6):309-12. doi: 10.1097/00000441-199412000-00001.,,,,,,,,,

The HCL-O cells expressed antigens similar and dissimilar to those expressed with the original hairy cells. The HCL-O cells were more mature than the original cells in their degree of B-cell differentiation, as indicated by a decrease of CD19 and surface immunoglobulin (sIg) expression together with the appearance of CD38 and cytoplasmic Ig (cIg). In addition, the cells expressed CD11c recognized by Leu-M5, a monoclonal antibody usually positive for HCL. Their karyotype and Ig gene rearrangement pattern were identical to those of the original cells. The EBV genome was detected in the HCL-O cells but not in the original cells. The HCL-O cells spontaneously produced a large quantity of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the conditioned medium, whereas IL-6 serum level was not so high. These findings indicate that the HCL-O cell line is derived from the leukaemic hairy cells and possibly, in vitro EBV infection took place easily in the original hairy cells through their CD21, resulting in subsequent immortalization. IL-6 production by HCL-O cells may be induced or enhanced by EBV, and the secreted IL-6 might play a role in their own growth or differentiation.","['Tokioka, T', 'Shimamoto, Y', 'Nagumo, F', 'Tadano, J', 'Yamaguchi, M']","['Tokioka T', 'Shimamoto Y', 'Nagumo F', 'Tadano J', 'Yamaguchi M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)']",IM,,"['*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cytological Techniques', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Japan', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/genetics', 'Leukocytosis/blood/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Complement 3d/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000204129 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1994;92(1):8-13. doi: 10.1159/000204129.,,,,,,,,,

Results of treatment in Sicily 1987-1992].,1293-8,"OBJECTIVES: For several years, children in Sicily with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia have been treated locally at the University of Catania. We compared the results of locally treated children with the results obtained at other centres. METHODS: The diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was made in 78 children in the haematology and oncology division of the University of Catania, Sicily, From January 1987 to December 1992. Patients diagnosed before December 1990 were treated with the protocol ALL 87 including prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicine, L-asparaginase and intrathecal methotrexate. Total duration of treatment was 25-26 months. For patients diagnosed after December 1990, the protocol 90-91 used the same drugs for induction and three intrathecal drugs (methotrexate, cytarabine and prednisone) as well as cyclophosphamide to prolong induction in intermediary risk patients. Only high risk patients received cerebral irradiation. Total duration of treatment was 2 years. Full follow-up data were available for 76 patients. RESULTS: Survival rate without relapse was 66% and the 5-year survival rate was 82.7%. These results were comparable with those published by other international groups. In addition, particular attention was given to psychological support to decrease the deleterious effects of both the disease and the treatment protocols. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that ALL children can be cared for locally in Sicily without risking poorer outcome. It would be preferable to treat these children as near as possible to their area of residence in order to diminish the psychological trauma resulting from long-term hospitalization far from their family.","['Di Cataldo, A', 'Dibenedetto, S P', 'Ragusa, R', 'Miraglia, V', ""D'Amico, S"", 'Lo Nigro, L', 'Schiliro, G']","['Di Cataldo A', 'Dibenedetto SP', 'Ragusa R', 'Miraglia V', ""D'Amico S"", 'Lo Nigro L', 'Schiliro G']","[""Division d'Hematologie et Oncologie pediatrique, Universite de Catane, Italie.""]",['fre'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,1994/09/24 00:00,1994/09/24 00:01,['1994/09/24 00:00'],"['1994/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 1994 Sep 24;23(28):1293-8.,,,,Leucemie aigue lymphoblastique de l'enfant.

In these systems the presence of elements decreasing mRNA expression have been demonstrated. The regulatory proteins (Rev, Rex or iron response element binding protein IRE-BP) antagonize the effects of the downregulatory elements by interacting directly with specific mRNA sites (Rev responsive element, RRE, Rex responsive element, RXRE, or iron responsive elements, IREs) resulting in stabilization and efficient expression of the corresponding mRNAs. To investigate whether this strategy involves common pathways of mRNA utilization, we have studied expression from hybrid mRNAs that contained these previously identified HIV-1 or TfR instability determinants and the binding sites of the regulatory proteins Rev, Rex and/or IRE-BP. Our results demonstrate that only low levels of these hybrid mRNAs accumulate in the absence of the positive regulatory factors Rev, Rex or IRE-BP. The presence of these factors counteracts the effect of heterologous downregulatory elements resulting in increased accumulation of the hybrid mRNAs. However, while Rev or Rex regulation also resulted in efficient protein expression, the IRE-BP only affected mRNA levels without significantly affecting protein expression, suggesting that the pathways of mRNA stabilization/expression are different in these systems.","['Zolotukhin, A S', 'Harford, J B', 'Felber, B K']","['Zolotukhin AS', 'Harford JB', 'Felber BK']","['Human Retrovirus Pathogenesis Group, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, MD 21702-1201.']",['eng'],['N0-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,,"['Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'Gene Products, rev/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, rex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tat/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,1994/11/11 00:00,1994/11/11 00:01,['1994/11/11 00:00'],"['1994/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/22.22.4725 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1994 Nov 11;22(22):4725-32. doi: 10.1093/nar/22.22.4725.,PMC308524,,,,,,,,

To study the role of Pr60gag or some other sequences of the viral genome in the pathogenicity of the virus, we have generated mutants of the defective viral genome. These mutant defective viruses, prepared as helper-free stocks, were inoculated into susceptible C57BL/6 mice. Mutant Du5H-A virus, which had a stop codon within gag MA(p15), did not induce target cell proliferation or MAIDS. Mutants Du5H-B and -C encoded truncated Pr60gag proteins containing, respectively, MA(p15)-p12 or MA(p15)-p12 and part of CA(p30). These mutants showed a very limited capacity to induce early cell expansion and were poorly pathogenic. Only recombinant (revertant) viruses were recovered from organs of diseased mice inoculated with these two mutants. Mutant Du5H-D was generated by deleting 1.4 kbp of the 3'-end sequences, outside the gag coding region. The levels of RNA and proteins made by this mutant were low. This mutant also reverting frequently but was nevertheless able to induce MAIDS at a low efficiency without reverting. Our results indicate that the Pr60gag protein is necessary and sufficient to induce MAIDS. These data also suggest that the Pr60gag protein needs to be relatively intact to be fully pathogenic. In addition, our study shows a very high reversion rate of some mutants and emphasizes the need to check for the presence of revertant (recombinant) viruses in diseased organs when working with mutants of the MAIDS-defective virus.","['Huang, M', 'Hanna, Z', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Huang M', 'Hanna Z', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics', '*Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/metabolism/*virology', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Viral', 'Recombination, Genetic']",,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.1.60-68.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Jan;69(1):60-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.1.60-68.1995.,PMC188548,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-II infectious molecular clone pH6neo has several ORFs in the UT region (nucleotides 6641 to 7213) and a large ORF which overlaps the third exon of tax/rex. To investigate the importance of these ORF-containing sequences on viral replication and transformation in cell culture, proviral clones containing deletions in UT (pH6neo delta UT) or a stop codon insertion mutation (pH6neoST) were constructed. Lymphoid cells were transfected with mutant proviral constructs, and stable cell clones, designated 729pH6neo delta UT and 729pH6neoST, were characterized.

Linear and supercoiled closed-circle viral double-stranded DNAs were detected in both the central nervous system and non-central nervous system tissues. An elevated level of a novel minus-sense single-stranded form of viral DNA, which had a very high mobility in agarose gels, was correlated with the onset of symptoms of paralysis. As the severity of paralysis progressed, the level of this single-stranded form increased rapidly, with the highest level in the spinal cords of moribund mice.

Our results provide an explanation for this genetic linkage and directly prove that ecotropic MuLV infection of spinal cord cells is responsible for rendering anterior horn neurons susceptible to cytocidal LDV infection, which is the cause of the paralytic disease. Northern (RNA) blot hybridization of total tissue RNA and in situ hybridization of tissue sections demonstrated that only mice harboring central nervous system (CNS) cells that expressed ecotropic MuLV were susceptible to ADPM. Our evidence indicates that the ecotropic MuLV RNA is transcribed in CNS cells from ecotropic MuLV proviruses that have been acquired by infection with exogenous ecotropic MuLV, probably during embryogenesis, the time when germ line proviruses in AKR and C58 mice first become activated. In young mice, MuLV RNA-containing cells were found exclusively in white-matter tracts and therefore were glial cells. An increase in the ADPM susceptibility of the mice with advancing age correlated with the presence of an increased number of ecotropic MuLV RNA-containing cells in the spinal cords which, in turn, correlated with an increase in the number of unmethylated proviruses in the DNA extracted from spinal cords. Studies with AKXD recombinant inbred strains showed that possession of a single replication-competent ecotropic MuLV provirus (emv-11) by Fv-1n/n mice was sufficient to result in ecotropic MuLV infection of CNS cells and ADPM susceptibility.

Cytochemical characterization of blood and bone marrow neoplastic cells was consistent with a myelomonocytic origin. Neoplastic blast cells in peripheral blood were labeled by monoclonal antibodies specific for cell surface molecules of horse granulocytes, but they were not labeled by antibodies to T- or B-lymphocytes or macrophages. Treatment was attempted but was unsuccessful. At necropsy, intravascular leukostasis was present in all tissues examined. Fungal hyphae were also found in lung interstitium and colonic submucosa, suggesting the presence of a systemic mycosis.

Infusions of bromo- and/or iododeoxyuridine (BrdU/IudR) were given to 10 patients, five with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and five with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and S-phase cells were measured in PEBs using a monoclonal anti-IudR/BrdU antibody. Apoptosis was measured by in situ end-labeling (ISEL) of DNA. The results demonstrate that both AML and MDS are highly proliferative disorders but that there is almost no apoptosis in the former, whereas extensive apoptosis was observed in the latter. Double labeling revealed that large numbers of S-phase cells in MDS were simultaneously undergoing apoptosis. We conclude that the high cell death in MDS cancels the high cell birth, resulting in a functionally aplastic marrow and thus accounting for the observed ineffective hematopoiesis. On the other hand, AML is rapidly fatal, probably owing to high cell birth with no or minimal cell death. Therapeutic strategies to prevent intramedullary programmed cell death of hematopoietic precursors should be evaluated in MDS, and efficacy of chemotherapy in AML can be assessed by measuring the induction of apoptosis in post-treatment biopsy specimens.","['Mundle, S', 'Iftikhar, A', 'Shetty, V', 'Dameron, S', 'Wright-Quinones, V', 'Marcus, B', 'Loew, J', 'Gregory, S', 'Raza, A']","['Mundle S', 'Iftikhar A', 'Shetty V', 'Dameron S', 'Wright-Quinones V', 'Marcus B', 'Loew J', 'Gregory S', 'Raza A']","['Rush Cancer Institute, Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA 60085-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 60086-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', '*Cell Division', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Idoxuridine', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'S Phase']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/42.12.7983354 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1994 Dec;42(12):1533-7. doi: 10.1177/42.12.7983354.,,,,,,,,,

Induction of macrophage-like differentiation by TPA or granulocytic differentiation by retinoic acid or DMSO was accompanied by a block in G1 and resulted in distinct patterns of gene expression that were lineage- and inducer-specific. These included: (i) a dramatic decrease in the expression of cyclin A, cyclin B and cdk2, and surprisingly an up-regulation of cyclin D1 in TPA-induced macrophage-like cells; (ii) a down-regulation of cyclin E in retinoic acid-induced granulocytic cells; and (iii) a decreased abundance of cyclin D1 and D2, but high levels of cyclin A, B and E RNA in DMSO-induced granulocytic cells.

Properties and kinetics of the interaction of vinblastine with P-glycoprotein and evidence for its active mediated transport.,31059-66,"Active [3H]vinblastine (VBL) transport (efflux) was documented for inside-out plasma membrane vesicles from murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL/VCR-6) resistant to vinca alkaloids and overexpressing MDR 3 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 80-fold. Uptake of [3H]VBL at 37 degrees C by these inside-out vesicles, but not rightside-out vesicles or inside-out vesicles from wild-type cells, was obtained in the form of a rapid, initial phase (0-1 min) and a slower, later phase (> 1 min). The rapidity of each phase correlated with relative P-gp content among different MEL/VCR cell lines. The initial MDR-specific phase was temperature- and pH-dependent (optimum at pH 7), osmotically insensitive, and did not require ATP. The second MDR-specific phase was temperature-dependent, osmotically sensitive, and strictly dependent upon the presence of ATP (Km = 0.37 +/- 0.04 mM). Although other triphosphate nucleotides were partially effective in replacing ATP, the nonhydrolyzable analogue ATP gamma S (adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate)) was ineffective. This time course appears to represent tandem binding of [3H]VBL by P-gp and its mediated transport, with the latter process representing the rate-limiting step. In support of this conclusion, both binding and transport were inhibited by verapamil, quinidine, and reserpine, all known to be inhibitors of photoaffinity labeling of P-gp, but only transport was inhibited by C219 anti-P-gp antibody or orthovanadate. Although the rate of transport of [3H]VBL was 7-7.5-fold lower than the rate of binding (Vmax = 104 +/- 15 pmol/min/mg protein, Kon = 1.5 - 2 x 10(5) mol-1 s-1) to P-gp, each phase exhibited saturation kinetics and values for apparent Km and KD for each process were approximately the same (215 +/- 35 and 195 +/- 30 nM). Intravesicular accumulation of [3H]VBL was almost completely eliminated by high concentrations of nonradioactive VBL, suggesting that simple diffusion does not contribute appreciably to total accumulation of [3H]VBL in this vesicle system. This could be at least partially explained by the fact that these inside-out vesicles under the conditions employed did not maintain a P-gp mediated pH gradient. However, ATP-dependent, intravesicular accumulation of osmotically sensitive [3H]VBL occurred against a substantial permeant concentration gradient in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner consistent with an active, saturable process.","['Schlemmer, S R', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Schlemmer SR', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Program of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56517/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Protons)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,['J Biol Chem 1995 Feb 17;270(7):3462'],"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Osmosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Protons', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*metabolism']",,1994/12/09 00:00,1994/12/09 00:01,['1994/12/09 00:00'],"['1994/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)47390-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Dec 9;269(49):31059-66.,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the potential role of the Cdc2 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of these two sites by expressing a ""Cdc2 kinase target site-deficient"" mutant of Op18 (Op18-S25,38A), and analyzed the phenotype on the level of cell cycle regulation. The result shows that induced expression of Op18-S25,38A results in rapid accumulation of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The block in G2 seems transient, since prolonged incubation was found to result in a large fraction of the transfected cells entering S phase in the absence of mitosis, i.e. endoreduplication. In addition, a fraction (30%) of the transfected cells was blocked in mitosis. Whereas the morphology of the G2 arrested cells appeared normal, expression of Op18-S25,38A caused a serious defect during mitotic chromosome segregation.

Exposure of PBL to DC of 1 mA for more than 10 min resulted in inhibition of IL-2 production which correlated with decreased proliferation capacity of the treated cells. DC had similar enhancing and inhibitory effects on IL-2 production by the mitogen-stimulated human leukemia T cell line MOLT-13. However, DC itself did not stimulate IL-2 production in PBL or in MOLT-13 cells. In two additional T cell lines tested, MOLT-16 and H-9, DC did not enhance mitogen-stimulated IL-2 production, but suppressed it when applied at 1 mA for more than 10 min. Both the mitogen-stimulated and the interleukin-1 (IL-1)-enhanced IL-2 production were completely inhibited by 1 mA of DC applied for 20 min. The observed effects of DC were due to a direct action of DC on the cells and not to possible effects of the secondary by-products of electrolysis. These results show that pretreatment of cells with DC can enhance or suppress IL-2 production depending on the intensity of DC and the type of IL-2 producing cell clones.","['Holan, V', 'Machala, O', 'Dao, T', 'Minowada, J']","['Holan V', 'Machala O', 'Dao T', 'Minowada J']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic, Prague.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,,"['*Electricity', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(11)80608-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0171-2985(11)80608-X [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1994 Jun;190(4-5):368-75. doi: 10.1016/S0171-2985(11)80608-X.,,,,,,,,,

Findings in patients with hairy cell leukaemia before and after treatment.,129-35,"Bone marrow trephine biopsies from 20 patients with hairy cell leukaemia were reviewed at diagnosis and during therapy with alpha-interferon (IFN) and with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA). At time of diagnosis the trephines revealed classical features of hairy cell leukaemia and profound alterations of haematopoiesis. All three lines showed dysplastic features with architectural, qualitative and quantitative changes. Review of consecutive trephine biopsies in patients that received IFN showed that a complete remission with disappearance of the tumour was never achieved and that the dysplastic features persisted. An improvement of haematopoiesis was noted, but recovery, especially of the myelopoiesis, was never completely achieved. By contrast, patients treated with 2-CdA de novo and previously treated with IFN achieved a complete remission in all but three cases. The trephine biopsies showed an improvement of haematopoiesis with progressive disappearance of the dysplastic features and a good recovery of myelopoiesis. A residual lymphocytosis was present, but as it was also present in age-matched control cases it could not be considered as a residual tumour. The disappearance of the leukaemic infiltrate probably constitutes a prerequisite for the recovery and normalization of haematopoiesis, while the dysplastic changes present at diagnosis could be the result of cytokine production by the leukaemic cells.","['Pittaluga, S', 'Verhoef, G', 'Maes, A', 'Boogaerts, M A', 'De Wolf-Peeters, C']","['Pittaluga S', 'Verhoef G', 'Maes A', 'Boogaerts MA', 'De Wolf-Peeters C']","['Department of Pathology, KU Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)']",IM,,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1994.tb01568.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1994 Aug;25(2):129-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1994.tb01568.x.,,,,,,,,,

The antiprogestatin drug when used at 10 microM, a concentration close to plasma concentrations achievable in humans, was able to hugely increase the sensitivity of RHC1 cells to doxorubicin. RU 486 appeared to prevent the P-gp-mediated doxorubicin efflux out of RHC1 cells and was demonstrated to interfere directly with P-gp drug binding sites since it blocked P-gp labelling by the photoactivable P-gp ligand azidopine. These results thus demonstrate that RU 486 can downmodulate anticancer drug resistance through inhibition of P-gp function.","['Lecureur, V', 'Fardel, O', 'Guillouzo, A']","['Lecureur V', 'Fardel O', 'Guillouzo A']","[""Unite de Recherches Hepatoloques U 49 de l'INSERM, Hopital de Pontchaillou, Rennes, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mifepristone/*administration & dosage', 'Progesterone/administration & dosage', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Verapamil/administration & dosage']",,1994/11/28 00:00,1994/11/28 00:01,['1994/11/28 00:00'],"['1994/11/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/28 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(94)01186-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(94)01186-9 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1994 Nov 28;355(2):187-91. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(94)01186-9.,,,,,,,,,

In order to determine whether tubulin reorganization was dependent upon the stage of the cell cycle at which apoptosis was induced, the human leukemic T-cell line CCRF-CEM was treated with cytotoxic doses of drugs known to arrest cells at different stages of the cell cycle. Apoptosis was confirmed by the detection of characteristic single and multiple nucleosome-sized fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis of isolated DNA. Cells were treated with vincristine, methotrexate, and dexamethasone, which have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest at G2-M, S-phase, and G1, respectively. Treated and untreated cells were analyzed by immunocytochemistry for beta-tubulin or Ki-67 antigen (to confirm cell cycle phase) and scored for apoptotic morphology. Dual staining for cellular tubulin and DNA content, measured by flow cytometry, was used to confirm the stage at which the cycling cells arrested. Increased total cellular tubulin immunofluorescence was observed in treated compared to untreated cells. Our results indicate that CCRF-CEM cells undergo apoptosis (identified morphologically) at all stages of the cell cycle except mitosis. We conclude that the reorganization of cellular tubulin that we have observed in apoptotic cells is independent of the tubulin involvement in cell division and thus may be an integral part of the apoptotic process.","['Pittman, S M', 'Strickland, D', 'Ireland, C M']","['Pittman SM', 'Strickland D', 'Ireland CM']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Tubulin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Polymers/metabolism', 'Tubulin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(84)71342-5 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1994.1342 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1994 Dec;215(2):263-72. doi: 10.1006/excr.1994.1342.,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: A reduction in conception rate occurred after the accident, as well as possible increase in induced abortion rate during the fall after the accident. No changes in the rate of spontaneous abortions or congenital malformations occurred in pregnancies exposed at the time of the accident. There was a temporary increase in low birth weight which could well be random. Among infants conceived after the accident, a slight excess of Down syndrome infants was found in the most exposed areas but this observation is based on small numbers. No certain excess of childhood cancer was seen in the most exposed areas, but three infants, in utero at the time of the accident, developed leukemia.

Many of their side effects are familiar to oncologists. Conversely, the possibility of therapy-induced hyperlipidemia generally is not appreciated. The incidence of severe hyperlipidemia during therapy of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received prednisone and asparaginase was evaluated. METHODS: During therapy with prednisone and asparaginase, a 10-year-old girl with precursor B ALL was identified with a peak plasma triglyceride and cholesterol level of 20,600 mg/dl and 1640 mg/dl, respectively. The lipid profile of the 60 patients in the protocol with this patient, the lipid profile of 64 patients on the previous high-risk ALL therapy program, and the literature were reviewed. RESULTS: Five of 60 patients on the New York-II protocol experienced transient, marked (triglyceride level > or = 1000 mg/dl), benign hyperlipidemia. No such problem was observed in the 64 patients on the New York-I protocol. Five similar cases were found in the literature during therapy with steroids (2), asparaginase (2), or both (1). There were no characteristics that distinguished these 10 patients from the vast majority of patients on similar therapy without severe hyperlipidemia. Prolonged therapy with either agent seemed to increase the possibility of hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSION: Severe hyperlipidemia during induction therapy for ALL is random, transient, and benign. Given the serious nature of the underlying disorder and the value of asparaginase and prednisone in its treatment, antileukemic therapy should not be modified when severe hyperlipidemia is observed.","['Steinherz, P G']",['Steinherz PG'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipidemias/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/*adverse effects', 'Remission Induction']",,1994/12/15 00:00,1994/12/15 00:01,['1994/12/15 00:00'],"['1994/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19941215)74:12<3234::aid-cncr2820741224>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Dec 15;74(12):3234-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19941215)74:12<3234::aid-cncr2820741224>3.0.co;2-1.,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the effect of alpha-sialyl cholesterol (alpha-SC), a derivative of the sialic acid-containing natural gangliosides, and the cytostatic agents, cisplatin, taxol and vincristine on the laminin production in Schwann cell cultures isolated from rat sciatic nerves. Laminin, one of several extracellular matrix components produced by Schwann cells, is known to potentiate axonal outgrowth. Laminin content was increased by alpha-SC, starting at 7.0 micrograms/ml with a maximal effect at 22.4 micrograms/ml (30%, P < 0.001). The three cytostatic drugs, dose-dependently reduced laminin content in Schwann cell cultures: (1) cisplatin at a threshold dose of 2 micrograms/ml (-26.4%, P < 0.001); (2) taxol, starting at a dose of 1 ng/ml (-8.0%, P < 0.05); and (3) vincristine, starting at 0.5 ng/ml (-5.9%, P < 0.05). Cultured Schwann cells were incubated with cytostatic drugs in combination with increasing amounts of alpha-SC and it was found that, depending on the cytostatic drug concentration used, alpha-SC could reduce or completely prevent the cytostatic drug-induced reduction of laminin in Schwann cell cultures. Co-treatment with alpha-SC also reduced part of the morphological changes caused by the cytostatic drugs. alpha-SC did not counteract the anti-proliferative effect of the cytostatic drugs on K-562 human erythroleukemia cells. In conclusion, alpha-SC increased laminin content in Schwann cell cultures and protected Schwann cell cultures against the decrease of laminin by cytostatic drugs without interfering with the anti-proliferative potential, suggesting that alpha-SC may have clinical use in protecting cancer patients against the neurotoxic effects of cytostatic drugs.","['Konings, P N', 'Philipsen, R L', 'Veeneman, G H', 'Ruigt, G S']","['Konings PN', 'Philipsen RL', 'Veeneman GH', 'Ruigt GS']","['Department of Neuropharmacology, NV Organon, Oss, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '113108-90-0 (N-acetylneuraminyl cholesterol)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Laminin/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Rats', 'Schwann Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Sialic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-8993(94)91577-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-8993(94)91577-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 1994 Aug 15;654(1):118-28. doi: 10.1016/0006-8993(94)91577-6.,,,,,,,,,

The data suggest that XIST is not required for the maintenance of X-inactivation on these somatically rearranged X chromosomes.","['Rack, K A', 'Chelly, J', 'Gibbons, R J', 'Rider, S', 'Benjamin, D', 'Lafreniere, R G', 'Oscier, D', 'Hendriks, R W', 'Craig, I W', 'Willard, H F']","['Rack KA', 'Chelly J', 'Gibbons RJ', 'Rider S', 'Benjamin D', 'Lafreniere RG', 'Oscier D', 'Hendriks RW', 'Craig IW', 'Willard HF', 'et al.']","['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (XIST non-coding RNA)']",IM,,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', '*RNA, Untranslated', 'Transcription Factors/*deficiency/genetics', 'X Chromosome/*ultrastructure']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/hmg/3.7.1053 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 1994 Jul;3(7):1053-9. doi: 10.1093/hmg/3.7.1053.,,"['DYSD', 'KALIG1', 'XIST']",,,,,,,

A tumor develops, if the balance between cell division and cell death is disturbed. In recent years many genes involved either in blocking or inducing this process have been identified. Additionally, several cytokines which influence apoptosis have been found. Some of these cytokines could also play a role in the development of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Many anticancer drugs exert their action via apoptosis. A strategy to selectively induce apoptosis of tumor cells without altering healthy cells and thus reducing the side effects of therapeutic regimens is a major goal for future development of new therapeutic techniques. Blocking the factors which are responsible for resistance is another promising therapeutic approach and could further improve the clinical outcome and finally prolong the life of patients.","['Gruber, J', 'Greil, R']","['Gruber J', 'Greil R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2']",71,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000236785 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1994 Dec;105(4):368-73. doi: 10.1159/000236785.,,,,,,,,,

The HEV-content and the LMI were significantly higher in reactive lymph nodes than in the low grade B-cell lymphomas and leukaemias (p < 0.001). The number of HEVs among lymphoma/leukaemia cases was the highest in LL independently of the maturation.

Based on these findings, a more intense migration of lymphocytes from blood to peripheral lymph nodes may be supposed in LL than in B-CLL, thus explaining the nodal sites of involvement in LL and the peripheral blood in B-CLL.

A histological, cytological and chemosensitivity study.",485-93,"The cytotoxicity of an endogenous inhibitor of calcium-activated neutral proteinase (CANP-I) was evaluated using various mammalian tumor-derived cell lines and human cell cultures. The inhibitor was selectively cytotoxic to human tumor cells from lung, bladder, melanoma and chronic myeloid leukemia tissues, in a dose-dependent manner, and was also cytotoxic to Walker rat tumor cells. The inhibitor was not cytotoxic to normal human, urothelial, fallopian tube, liver and resting white blood cells. Cytological examination of the treated malignant cells revealed cells with vacuolated cytoplasm, pyknotic, hyperchromatic nuclei and membranous, granular haematoxylinophilic extracellular matrix. The use of the inhibitor on urothelial tumor tissues caused great exfoliation of necrotic cells while not affecting normal urothelial tissues. When the inhibitor was tested on mixed cell cultures, consisting of normal and malignant cell clones, a selective cytotoxicity to the malignant cells occurred allowing the normal cells to grow unaffected. Cytogenetic and cytological examination of the remaining cells, after the inhibitor treatment, showed normal diploid karyotype and morphology. The inhibitor was also tested in vivo on Wistar rats bearing Walker tumors. Treatment with 50 Units/100 g i.p. daily for 5 days caused 90% tumor regression and necrosis of metastatic foci in the liver and abdomen, without toxic side effects. The protease inhibitors trypsin-chymotrypsin, aprotinin, leupeptin and E64 were also tested in vitro and showed no anticancer activity.

A comparison in ovarian cancer.,85-95,"Compared with most solid tumours in humans, ovarian cancer may be considered a relatively chemosensitive disease. The platinum-based drug, cisplatin, has significantly enhanced long term survival (by more than 10%), though there remains scope for considerable improvement. Carboplatin is equiactive with, but substantially less toxic than, cisplatin (especially in terms of nephrotoxicity, effects on the gastrointestinal tract and neurotoxicity). Long term data are emerging from randomised trials that support the replacement of cisplatin by carboplatin in the first-line treatment of ovarian cancer. Iproplatin is also less toxic than cisplatin, but is more toxic and less active than carboplatin. A further advance in reducing patient morbidity associated with platinum-based chemotherapy may come from the first orally administrable platinum complex, JM216, which has recently been introduced into clinical trials. Current and future platinum drug discovery initiatives should focus on circumventing mechanisms of tumour resistance to cisplatin. Laboratory studies have identified 3 major mechanisms of resistance: reduced drug transport, enhanced intracellular detoxification (through glutathione and/or metallothioneins) and enhanced DNA removal (or tolerance) of platinum-DNA adducts (the long assumed critical lesions leading to cell kill). Platinum complexes based on the 1,2-diaminocyclohexane carrier ligand (such as oxaliplatin and tetraplatin) have recently entered clinical trials, having been shown to circumvent cisplatin resistance in murine leukaemia tumour models. Clinically, they have shown little evidence of activity in cisplatin-resistant disease and appear to cause severe neurotoxicity.","['Kelland, L R', 'McKeage, M J']","['Kelland LR', 'McKeage MJ']","['CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, England.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '5R9F9NE9Z2 (iproplatin)', '8D7B37T28G (satraplatin)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",68,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00002512-199405020-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs Aging. 1994 Aug;5(2):85-95. doi: 10.2165/00002512-199405020-00002.,,,,,,,,,

The cellular immune response, in particular cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, may be important for eliminating virally infected cells in HIV-1-infected individuals. Genetic immunization using retroviral vectors provides an effective means of introducing antigens into the antigen presentation pathways for T cell stimulation. A nonreplicating, amphotropic murine retroviral vector containing the HIV-1 IIIB env gene has been used to transduce primary rhesus monkey fibroblasts for the expression of HIV-1 antigenic determinants. Rhesus monkeys were immunized with four doses of either vector-transduced autologous fibroblasts (VTAF) expressing the HIV-1 IIIB ENV/REV proteins or nontransduced autologous fibroblasts (NTAF) administered at 2-week intervals. The animals were evaluated for both the induction of HIV-1-specific immune responses and potential toxicity associated with this ex vivo treatment. The VTAF-immunized monkeys generated CTL responses specific for HIV-1 ENV/REV expressing autologous target cells, whereas, NTAF-immunized monkeys showed negligible CTL activity. The cytotoxic activity was mediated by CD8+, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted CTL. In addition, antibody responses directed against the HIV-1 gp120 protein were also detected in the sera of VTAF-immunized monkeys. Clinical and histopathological evaluation of immunized monkeys showed no evidence of significant adverse events. Several animals that received either VTAF or NTAF had detectable anti-cytoplasmic antibodies, but were not positive for anti-nuclear antibodies or rheumatoid factor. Subsequent evaluation of renal, synovial, and hepatic tissue samples from these monkeys revealed no autoimmune disease-associated lesions. This study demonstrates the safety and ability of autologous retroviral vector-transduced cells expressing HIV-1 IIIB ENV/REV proteins to stimulate immune responses in a non-human primate model, and provides a basis for this form of genetic immunization in HIV-infected humans.","['Laube, L S', 'Burrascano, M', 'Dejesus, C E', 'Howard, B D', 'Johnson, M A', 'Lee, W T', 'Lynn, A E', 'Peters, G', 'Ronlov, G S', 'Townsend, K S']","['Laube LS', 'Burrascano M', 'Dejesus CE', 'Howard BD', 'Johnson MA', 'Lee WT', 'Lynn AE', 'Peters G', 'Ronlov GS', 'Townsend KS', 'et al.']","['Viagene, Inc., San Diego, CA 92121.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (AIDS Vaccines)', '0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",IM,,"['*AIDS Vaccines', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/analysis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Fibroblasts/*immunology', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Products, rev/genetics/*immunology', 'Genes, Synthetic', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV Antibodies/*biosynthesis', 'HIV-1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization/adverse effects/*methods', 'Liver Diseases/etiology', 'Macaca mulatta/immunology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Rheumatoid Factor/analysis', 'Safety', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1994.5.7-853 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1994 Jul;5(7):853-62. doi: 10.1089/hum.1994.5.7-853.,,"['env', 'gag', 'pol', 'rev']",,,,,,,

In addition to a control group, patients included different subtypes of chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) like chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), polycythaemia vera (P. vera), primary thrombocythaemia (PTH) and finally primary (idiopathic) osteomyelofibrosis (OMF). In comparison with the normal bone marrow and also with P. vera and PTH a significant increase in PCNA-labelling (late G1 and S phases) of megakaryocytes was recognizable in OMF, contrasting with a striking reduction of this marker in CML. Particularly in advanced stages of OMF, secondary folate deficiency leading to a megaloblastoid appearance of erythroid precursors is a frequent finding. In pernicious anaemia previous cytokinetic studies have demonstrated an arrest in the S phase (DNA synthesis) of the cell cycle due to vitamin B12/folate (haematinic) deficiency. A similar pathomechanism may also be effective in OMF. Consequently, a block in the S phase of the cell cycle is assumed which is in keeping with the increased numbers of PC10-positive megakaryocytes. Significant correlations were calculable between megakaryocyte sizes and PCNA-staining capacity in the normal bone marrow and CMPDs. According to morphometry small-sized (hypoploid) megakaryocytes showed a prevalence of PCNA labelling. This finding is confirmative with a hypothesis on the dynamics of endoreduplicative activity of megakaryocytes, i.e. the prolongation of G1/G2 phases in larger (polyploid) elements. On the other hand, some of the giant polyploid megakaryocytes may cease endoreduplication and enter into G0 phase, which could partially explain the predominance of PCNA-negative large-sized cells of this lineage.","['Thiele, J', 'Titius, B R', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Rechmeier, W', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Titius BR', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Rechmeier W', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Anal Cell Pathol,Analytical cellular pathology : the journal of the European Society for Analytical Cellular Pathology,8911016,['0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)'],IM,,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Replication/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*pathology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/*analysis']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anal Cell Pathol. 1994 Jul;7(1):63-75.,,,,,,,,,

We carried out a study to demonstrate the prognostic importance of the rapidity of cell proliferation in patients with ALL. To measure the rapidity of cell proliferation we used the parameter relative to the area of silver-stained nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) as evaluated by morphometric analysis on smeared marrow blast cells. The mean AgNOR area of leukaemic marrow cells was measured in 119 children. By using a cut-off value of 3 microns2, we identified a group of 91 children with low proliferating blast activity (mean AgNOR value 2.11 microns2) and a group of 28 children with high proliferating activity (mean AgNOR value 3.29 microns2). The group of patients with a mean AgNOR value > 3 microns2 was characterised by a higher number of deaths, more frequent relapse and shorter time interval to relapse than the group of patients with mean AgNOR value < 3 microns2 (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis performed to include T-cell immunophenotype, FAB morphology, leucocyte count and presence of mediastinal mass showed that the mean AgNOR value was the only independent predictor of unfavourable event-free survival probability (P > 0.01). Our results indicate that the rapidity of marrow blast cell proliferation is an important prognostic parameter in childhood ALL and should be routinely introduced in the group risk definition.","['Trere, D', 'Pession, A', 'Basso, G', 'Rondelli, R', 'Masera, G', 'Paolucci, G', 'Derenzini, M']","['Trere D', 'Pession A', 'Basso G', 'Rondelli R', 'Masera G', 'Paolucci G', 'Derenzini M']","['Centro di Patologia Cellulare, Dipartimento di Patologia Sperimentale, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/ultrastructure', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1994.473 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1994 Dec;70(6):1198-202. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1994.473.,PMC2033703,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that samples with > or = 80% leukaemic cells at the start of culture give similar results in the MTT assay and the differential staining cytotoxicity assay, in which a discrimination between malignant and non-malignant cells can be made. However, the percentage of leukaemic cells may change during culture, which might affect the results of the MTT assay. We studied 106 untreated childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples with > or = 80% leukaemic cells at the start of culture. This percentage decreased below 80% in 28%, and below 70% in 13%, of the samples after 4 days of culture. A decrease below 70% occurred more often in case of 80-89% leukaemic cells (9/29) than in case of > or = 90% leukaemic cells at the start of culture (5/77, P = 0.0009). Samples with < 70% leukaemic cells after culture were significantly more resistant to 6 out of 13 drugs, and showed a trend towards being more resistant to two more drugs, than samples with > or = 80% leukaemic cells. No such differences were seen between samples with 70-79% and samples with > or = 80% leukaemic cells after culture. We next studied in another 30 ALL samples whether contaminating mononuclear cells could be removed by using immunoamagnetic beads. Using a beads to target cell ratio of 10:1, the percentage of leukaemic cells increased from mean 72% (s.d. 9.3%) to mean 87% (s.d. 6.7%), with an absolute increase of 2-35%. The recovery of leukaemic cells was mean 82.1% (range 56-100%, s.d. 14.0%). The procedure itself did not influence the results of the MTT assay in three samples containing only leukaemic cells. We conclude that it is important to determine the percentage of leukaemic cells at the start and at the end of the MTT assay and similar drug resistance assays. Contaminating mononuclear cells can be successfully removed from ALL samples using immunomagnetic beads. This approach may increase the number of leukaemic samples which can be evaluated for cellular drug resistance with the MTT assay or a similar cell culture drug resistance assay.","['Kaspers, G J', 'Veerman, A J', 'Pieters, R', 'Broekema, G J', 'Huismans, D R', 'Kazemier, K M', 'Loonen, A H', 'Rottier, M A', 'van Zantwijk, C H', 'Hahlen, K']","['Kaspers GJ', 'Veerman AJ', 'Pieters R', 'Broekema GJ', 'Huismans DR', 'Kazemier KM', 'Loonen AH', 'Rottier MA', 'van Zantwijk CH', 'Hahlen K', 'et al.']","['Department of Paediatrics, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,,"['Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1994.446 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1994 Dec;70(6):1047-52. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1994.446.,PMC2033662,,,,,,,,

Recently, a new cytidine analogue, gemcitabine, has shown impressive activity as a single agent against several solid malignancies (ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer), demonstrating that in solid tumours deoxycytidine kinase can be an important target for the activation of antimetabolites. Studies on the regulation of deoxycytidine kinase have shown that the enzyme has a complicated regulation (feedback inhibition by the product and regulation by ribonucleotides).

In the line sensitive to phorbol-induced differentiation (S cells), immunoreactive topoisomerase II levels did not begin to fall until 12 hr following exposure of the cells to phorbol ester. Thereafter, levels declined over the next 36 hr. By contrast, phorbol treatment of the phorbol ester tolerant cell line (PET cells) produced a transient decrease in topoisomerase II only to be followed by a recovery to pretreatment levels. The patterns of the alterations in topoisomerase II mRNA levels mirrored those of the alterations in immunoreactive topoisomerase II. Unexpectedly, nuclear run-on studies revealed that transcriptional start sites were not reduced in either cell line following their exposure to phorbol esters. These data suggest that the down-regulation of topoisomerase II is a consequence rather than a cause of phorbol-induced differentiation in HL-60 cells.

Western blotting revealed that topoisomerase II beta was highly unstable during cell fractionation. However, preincubation of human CEM leukemia cells with 5-100 microM VM-26 for 30 min protected the beta isozyme from degradation by progressively increasing the amount of this isoform bound to DNA. The amount of topoisomerase II beta detected in nuclei of CEM cells incubated for 30 min with 25 microM VM-26 was 7-fold greater than in nuclei from untreated control cells. VM-26 also had a protective effect on topoisomerase II beta in HL-60 leukemia and WiDR colon carcinoma cells. In contrast, the intercalating agents mitoxantrone and m-AMSA did not protect topoisomerase II beta from degradation during cell fractionation. The stabilization of topoisomerase II beta by VM-26 allowed subsequent studies of the subcellular distribution of the topoisomerase II isozymes. Both isozymes were detected in the nonmatrix (high salt-soluble) fraction of nuclei from CEM cells, but only topoisomerase II alpha was present in the nuclear matrix. VM-26 stabilized binding of the alpha and beta topoisomerase II isoenzymes to nonmatrix DNA and topoisomerase II alpha to matrix DNA. The differences observed in the subnuclear distribution and DNA binding pattern of the topoisomerase II isozymes support the hypotheses that each isozyme has a distinct cellular function, and that both the alpha and beta isozymes are potential targets for VM-26 in intact cells. In addition, the results demonstrated that pretreatment of various cell lines with VM-26 is a useful way to stabilize topoisomerase II beta during cell fractionation.","['Danks, M K', 'Qiu, J', 'Catapano, C V', 'Schmidt, C A', 'Beck, W T', 'Fernandes, D J']","['Danks MK', 'Qiu J', 'Catapano CV', 'Schmidt CA', 'Beck WT', 'Fernandes DJ']","[""Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['CA 30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'DNA/*metabolism', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Matrix/enzymology', 'Subcellular Fractions/*metabolism', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)90465-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)90465-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1994 Nov 1;48(9):1785-95. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)90465-0.,,,,,,,,,

These results reveal that in the K562 cells (1), the last 43 amino acid residues at the C-terminus of APP are important in targeting APP through the 4 kDa A beta producing pathway and (2) processing of APP into 4 kDa A beta is independent of the known secretase pathway.","['LeBlanc, A C', 'Gambetti, P']","['LeBlanc AC', 'Gambetti P']","['Division of Neuropathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['AGO8992/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'NS31700/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)', '0 (Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",IM,,"['Alzheimer Disease/etiology/metabolism', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*biosynthesis', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(84)72615-5 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1994.2615 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1994 Nov 15;204(3):1371-80. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1994.2615.,,,,,,,,,

HL60 promyeloid cells contain high intracellular concentrations of inositol polyphosphates, notably inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP5) and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6). To determine their intracellular location(s), we studied the release of inositol (poly)phosphates, of ATP, and of cytosolic and granule-enclosed enzymes from cells permeabilized by four different methods. 2. When cells were treated with digitonin, all of the inositol phosphates were released in parallel with the cytosolic constituents. Most of the InsP5 and InsP6 was released before significant permeabilization of azurophil granules. 3. Similar results were obtained from cells preloaded with ethylene glycol and permeabilized by osmotic lysis. 4. Electroporation at approximately 500 V/cm caused rapid release of free inositol. Higher field strengths provoked release of most of the ATP, InsP5 and InsP6, but only slight release of the intracellular enzymes. Multiple discharges released approximately 80-90% of total InsP5 and InsP6. In the absence of bivalent-cation chelators, InsP5 and InsP6 were released less readily than ATP. 5. Treatment of cells with Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin caused quantitative release of inositol and ATP, without release of intracellular enzymes. However, inositol phosphates were released much less readily than inositol or ATP. Even after prolonged incubation with a high concentration of alpha-toxin, only approximately 50-70% of InsP2, InsP3 and InsP4 and < or = 20% of InsP5 and InsP6 were released, indicating that the high charge or large hydrated radius of InsP5 and InsP6 might limit their release through small toxin-induced pores. 6. These results indicate that most intracellular inositol metabolites are either in, or in rapid exchange with, the cytosolic compartment of HL60 cells. However, they leave open the possibility that a small proportion of cellular InsP5 and InsP6 (< or = 10-20%) might be in some intracellular bound form.","['Stuart, J A', 'Anderson, K L', 'French, P J', 'Kirk, C J', 'Michell, R H']","['Stuart JA', 'Anderson KL', 'French PJ', 'Kirk CJ', 'Michell RH']","['School of Biochemistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, U.K.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Ethylene Glycols)', '0 (Hemolysin Proteins)', '0 (staphylococcal alpha-toxin)', '7IGF0S7R8I (Phytic Acid)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.43 (Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate-1-3-phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'FC72KVT52F (Ethylene Glycol)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Bacterial Toxins/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytosol/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Digitonin/pharmacology', 'Electroporation', 'Ethylene Glycol', 'Ethylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'Hemolysin Proteins/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Phytic Acid/*metabolism', 'Staphylococcus aureus/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",,1994/10/15 00:00,1994/10/15 00:01,['1994/10/15 00:00'],"['1994/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3030517 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1994 Oct 15;303 ( Pt 2):517-25. doi: 10.1042/bj3030517.,PMC1137358,,,,,,,,

L1210 cells were exposed to AbeAdo for 12 days to induce cytostasis and then exposed to spermidine, spermine, 1-methylspermidine or 1,12-dimethylspermine in the continued presence of AbeAdo. AbeAdo-induced cytostasis was overcome by the natural polyamines, spermidine and spermine. The cytostasis was also reversed by 1-methylspermidine. 1,12-Dimethylspermine had no effect on the AbeAdo-induced cytostasis of chronically treated cells, although it was active in permitting growth of cells treated with the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine. The initial 12-day exposure to AbeAdo elevated intracellular putrescine levels, depleted intracellular spermidine and spermine, and resulted in the accumulation of unmodified eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A). Exposure of these cells to exogenous spermidine, which is the natural substrate for deoxyhypusine synthase, resulted in a decrease in the unmodified eIF-5A content. 1-Methylspermidine, which was found to be a substrate of deoxyhypusine synthase in vitro, also decreased the levels of unmodified eIF-5A in the AbeAdo-treated cells. Although spermine is not a substrate of deoxyhypusine synthase, spermine was converted into spermidine in the L1210 cells, and spermine addition to AbeAdo-treated cells resulted in the appearance of both intracellular spermine and spermidine and in the decrease in unmodified eIF-5A. Exogenous 1,12-dimethylspermine, which was not metabolized to spermine or to 1-methylspermidine and was not a substrate of deoxyhypusine synthase in vitro, did not decrease levels of unmodified eIF-5A. The finding that AbeAdo-induced cytostasis was only reversed by polyamines and polyamine analogues that result in the formation of hypusine or an analogue in eIF-5A is consistent with the hypothesis [Byers, Wiest, Wechter and Pegg (1993) Biochem. J. 290, 115-121] that AbeAdo-induced cytostasis is due to the depletion of the hypusine-containing form of eIF-5A, which is secondary to the depletion of spermidine by inhibition of S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase.","['Byers, T L', 'Lakanen, J R', 'Coward, J K', 'Pegg, A E']","['Byers TL', 'Lakanen JR', 'Coward JK', 'Pegg AE']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Physiology, M.S.

METHODS: The records were reviewed of all patients receiving primary treatment for Hodgkin's disease at the Oncology Service, Christchurch Hospital from 1969 to 1992. Second malignant neoplasms presenting at least six months after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease were noted and the cumulative risk estimated. RESULTS: Twenty-two second malignant neoplasms developed in 20 of the 209 patients. The risk was 5.6 +/- 3.8% (CI) at five years, 11.4 +/- 6.2% at ten years, and 21.7 +/- 11.2% at 15 years and continued to increase thereafter. Thirteen patients have died of their second malignancy, including two of a third malignancy, while four have been followed for less than one year. Three leukaemias (CML, 1; acute non lymphocytic leukaemia, 2), three lymphomas and 16 solid tumours developed. The risk was greater after six or more cycles of MOPP-like chemotherapy and after radiation doses exceeding 30 Gray. The risk was less after laparotomy and splenectomy (p = 0.0205).

They are also found in situations where other autoantibodies are common, sometimes after infections and possibly in individuals who have received multiple blood transfusions. AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of ANCA in a variety of haematological disorders, where these predisposing factors may be at work. METHODS: Sera from patients with myelodysplasia (n = 26), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n = 3), and myeloproliferative (n = 25) or lymphoproliferative syndromes (n = 16) were screened for ANCA using a crude neutrophil cytoplasmic extract ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent examination of normal peripheral blood neutrophils. Positive results were confirmed by ELISAs for anti-proteinase 3, anti-myeloperoxidase or anti-elastase antibodies. RESULTS: ANCA were demonstrated in two patients with myelodysplasia, both with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and greater than 5% blasts in the bone marrow. Both of these individuals were infected at the time that ANCA were demonstrated and other autoantibodies were present. One of these individuals had never had evidence of any vasculitis; the other probably developed myelodysplasia after treatment with cyclophosphamide for Wegener's granulomatosis. ANCA were demonstrated in one individual with AML secondary to myelodysplasia. ANCA were also found in a patient with lymphoma in whom autoantibodies against red cells and platelets were already noted. ANCA were demonstrated in one further individual with lymphomatoid granulomatosis, a condition that resembles Wegener's granulomatosis clinically and histologically, but which is treated as a lymphoma. No ANCA were present in any of the patients with myeloproliferative syndromes. DISCUSSION: ANCA probably occur secondary to immune dysregulation in myelodysplasia and the lymphoproliferative conditions and they are not necessarily associated with the presence of a vasculitis.","['Savige, J A', 'Chang, L', 'Smith, C L', 'Duggan, J C']","['Savige JA', 'Chang L', 'Smith CL', 'Duggan JC']","['Department of Medicine, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,"['0 (Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic', 'Autoantibodies/*analysis', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*immunology']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1994.tb02173.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1994 Jun;24(3):282-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1994.tb02173.x.,,,,,,,,,

These features are consistent with natural killer cell leukemia, a recently proposed clinicopathologic entity. Autopsy findings were characterized by an extremely dense infiltration of leukemic cells in most organs, along with destruction of the normal architecture, corresponding to an aggressive clinical course.

In the present study, the in vitro effects of ubenimex on the cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and spleen cells of cancer patients and the mechanism of killer cell activation were investigated. Cytotoxic activity against K562, KATO-III and autologous tumor cells was augmented by in vitro sensitization with ubenimex (p < 0.05). The optimal concentration of ubenimex for induction of cytotoxic activity was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to serum levels after clinical oral administration. The major population of killer cells activated by ubenimex recognizing K562 was CD16+, and those recognizing KATO-III were mainly CDA+ or CD8(5) cels and CD16+ NK cells, while CDA5 or CD8+T cells comprised the majority of killer cells which showed autologous tumor-killing activity. Augmentation of the cytotoxic activity of mononuclear cells by ubenimex was blocked by both anti-IL-1 beta Ab and anti-IL-2 AB. However, the expression of IL-2 receptor (p55, p75) on effector cells was not altered. Ubenimex augmented not only NK activity but also autologous tumor killing activity of PBL and spleen cells via macrophage activation.

HEP displayed elevated levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) with time in 2-4 day-old culture, thus developing in the same time a MDR phenotype. No functional P-gp activity could be detected in HEP at day 1 after cell seeding. Given the sensitivity of FT-IR/S and using computational treatment of FT-IR data, we found that spectra of MDR-K562 and HEP from day 2 to day 4 displayed close protein conformational changes involving beta-sheets.

Following exposure to HT, typical apoptotic cell death was observed from 1.5 to 4 h and it increased in both dose-and time-dependent fashion. This process was prevented by an intracellular calcium ion chelator. In addition, at 0.04 microM of HT the nonapoptotic cells delayed the progression of cell cycle through S and G2 phase and finally arrested in G1 phase.

Typhlitis in the absence of chemotherapy is rare. We report a fatal case of typhlitis in an untreated leukemic patient. RESULTS: This case emphasizes the multifactorial pathogenesis of typhlitis, which may occur in the absence of chemotherapy.

Bone marrow-derived cells, as well as mesenchymal and epithelial cells, were recently shown to support HBV replication. We hypothesize that the mechanism that links HBV infection and liver tumors might also promote tumor development in tissues permissive for HBV replication. Between 1980 and 1993 we retrospectively identified 22 patients who were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers and had extra-hepatic malignancies. These patients had 25 tumors, of which 22 were bone marrow derived. HBsAg was detected by immunohistochemistry in bone marrow cells of leukemia patient and of 3 of 10 lymphoma patients. In addition, in 4 of 10 patients with lymphoma, including 2 patients in which HBsAg stained bone marrow cells, HBsAg was also detected in the endothelial cells of blood vessels of the tumor tissue. These results suggest that the identification of an HBV gene product in endothelial cells might point to a role of HBV infection in the development of certain hematopoietic tumors, possibly through activation of cytokines or growth factors, which may eventually lead to bone marrow cell proliferation.","['Galun, E', 'Ilan, Y', 'Livni, N', 'Ketzinel, M', 'Nahor, O', 'Pizov, G', 'Nagler, A', 'Eid, A', 'Rivkind, A', 'Laster, M']","['Galun E', 'Ilan Y', 'Livni N', 'Ketzinel M', 'Nahor O', 'Pizov G', 'Nagler A', 'Eid A', 'Rivkind A', 'Laster M', 'et al.']","['Liver Unit, Hadassah University Hospital, Ein-Kerem, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/virology', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Genes, Viral', 'Hepatitis B/*complications/diagnosis', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/analysis', 'Hepatitis Viruses/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/*virology', 'Lymphoma/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Virus Replication']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1994 Nov;145(5):1001-7.,PMC1887425,,['Am J Pathol. 1995 Jul;147(1):223.

STUDY DESIGN: A comparative clinical study of amniotic fluid leukemia inhibitory factor concentrations was performed. RESULTS: Leukemia inhibitory factor was undetectable (< 1 ng/ml) by radioreceptor assay during normal pregnancy at midtrimester and at term. Among women in labor those with intraamniotic infection had higher leukemia factor concentrations than those without infection before term (p < 0.001) and at term (p < 0.005). The leukemia inhibitory factor concentrations correlated with the amniotic fluid white blood cell counts (r = 0.47) (p < 0.001). In cultured human gestational tissue explants, leukemia inhibitory factor release was significantly enhanced by endotoxin, interleukin-1 alpha, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha however, leukemia inhibitory factor did not enhance the release of prostaglandin E2 by these tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Amniotic fluid leukemia inhibitory factor concentrations were elevated during intraamniotic infection and gestational tissues released leukemia inhibitory factor in response to bacterial products and inflammatory mediators.","['Waring, P M', 'Romero, R', 'Laham, N', 'Gomez, R', 'Rice, G E']","['Waring PM', 'Romero R', 'Laham N', 'Gomez R', 'Rice GE']","['Cancer Research Unit, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Obstet Gynecol,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,0370476,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,,"['*Amnion', 'Amniotic Fluid/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Infections/*metabolism', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Pregnancy', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9378(94)90157-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9378(94)90157-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1994 Nov;171(5):1335-41. doi: 10.1016/0002-9378(94)90157-0.,,,,,,,,,

Exposures were assessed through a job-exposure matrix based on about 1,000 person-weeks of measurements from exposure meters worn by workers. Exposures were considerably higher in Quebec than in France. No association was found between PEMFs and cancers previously suspected of association with magnetic fields (leukemia, other hematopoietic cancers, brain cancer, or melanoma). However, there was a clear association between cumulative exposure to PEMFs and lung cancer, with odds ratios rising to 3.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60-6.04) in the highest exposure group (84 cases). This association with largely confined to Quebec, where there was a monotonic exposure-response relation with an odds ratio of 6.67 (95% CI 2.68-16.57) in the highest exposure group (32 cases). The association is substantial and was not explained by smoking or other occupational exposures. However, several factors limit the strength of the evidence for a causal relation: lack of precision in what the meters measured; little previous evidence for this association; and no elevated risk for lung cancer in the utility workers overall in comparison with the general population.","['Armstrong, B', 'Theriault, G', 'Guenel, P', 'Deadman, J', 'Goldberg, M', 'Heroux, P']","['Armstrong B', 'Theriault G', 'Guenel P', 'Deadman J', 'Goldberg M', 'Heroux P']","['Department of Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,,"['Case-Control Studies', '*Electricity', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Odds Ratio', 'Quebec/epidemiology']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a117329 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1994 Nov 1;140(9):805-20. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a117329.,,,['Am J Epidemiol. 1996 Apr 15;143(8):841.

In the present study, FLC infection resulted in increased induction by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) but not IL-6. TNF alpha levels were significantly elevated beginning 11 days post infection and increasing levels were measured through day 21. The highest TNF alpha levels in FCL-infected mice were as much as 100-fold higher than in LPS treated non-infected mice. Peak plasma levels of TNF alpha were seen between 1 and 2 hr after LPS induction, as compared to a peak at 1 hr in controls. The ability of LPS to stimulate TNF alpha was concentration dependent over a range of 0.005 to 50 micrograms per mouse. Using anti-TNF alpha antiserum, cytotoxic activity of plasma was shown to be due specifically to TNF alpha. These data suggest that induction of TNF alpha and IL-6 is regulated by different mechanisms in FLC-infected mice.","['Soldaini, E', 'Baldinotti, F', 'Matteucci, D', 'Specter, S', 'Bendinelli, M']","['Soldaini E', 'Baldinotti F', 'Matteucci D', 'Specter S', 'Bendinelli M']","['Department of Biomedicine, University of Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Female', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 1994 Jan-Mar;8(1):25-31.,,,,,,,,,

The focus of the study was evaluation of the connection between the possible pathologies of these two phenomena. The size of the testicles was measured in millilitres and compared with reference values. The psychosexual development was evaluated using three approaches: the interviewer's evaluation, the patient's subjective assessment and information gained by specific questions. On the basis of the developmental theory of adolescence described by Blos, the appropriate development in each criterion was defined. Our results indicated that both psychosexual and somatic development were impaired. A significant relationship existed between testicular size and three criteria assessed by the patients: the patients who felt that their pubertal development was different from that of their peers, those who felt that their developmental failures were related to their personal medical histories, and those who did not feel that they had the ability to have sexual intercourse and/or children. The last group had significantly smaller testicles than the others. We speculate that the perception of the small size of testicles may trigger the psychological experiences of failed development, leading to narcissistic problems in adolescent development. In order to prevent these harmful consequences it will be necessary for different specialists to work together with the families and patients.","['Ropponen, P', 'Aalberg, V', 'Rautonen, J', 'Siimes, M A']","['Ropponen P', 'Aalberg V', 'Rautonen J', 'Siimes MA']","['Nyyrikinkatu 9A, Joensuu, Finland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Paedopsychiatr,Acta paedopsychiatrica,0400661,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Image', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Psychology, Adolescent', '*Psychosexual Development', 'Quality of Life', 'Self Concept', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Testis/*growth & development/physiology']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Paedopsychiatr. 1994;56(4):273-7.,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that tumors induced by 10A1 expressed multipotent stem cell markers as well as some lineage-restricted precursor markers. To further study the tumor phenotype, we analyzed total RNAs from 10A1-induced tumors by Northern blotting for c-kit, erythropoietin receptor, and T-cell gamma receptor mRNAs. Most of the tumors contained these mRNAs, which are characteristic of early hematopoietic cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that 10A1-induced tumor cells are early multipotent hematopoietic stem cells. Southern blot analysis revealed that 14 of 14 10A1-induced tumor cell DNAs examined contained MuLV integrations into the fli-1 gene.

The infectivity and hematological alterations associated with two molecularly cloned isolates of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV-pPPR and FIV-pF34) and an uncloned isolate (FIV-PPR) were assessed by inoculation of cats. Inoculated cats were tested for viral antibody, viremia, and clinical pathological disease. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from inoculated cats were assayed for virus infection by virus isolation, amplification of proviral DNA (by polymerase chain reaction), and in situ hybridization for viral RNA. Over 50% of the cats inoculated with cloned virus FIV-pF34 failed to seroconvert even when coinfected with feline leukemia virus; these cats were consistently virus positive only by amplification of proviral DNA. All cats inoculated with cloned virus FIV-pPPR seroconverted and were found virus positive by at least two of three virus detection assays. Both cloned viruses were less capable of suppressing CD4:CD8 ratios when compared to the biological isolates from which they were cloned. Isolates which replicate efficiently in feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), i.e., FIV-pPPR or biological FIV-PPR, caused greater virus load and lower CD4:CD8 ratios when compared to cloned FIV-pF34, which replicates efficiently in feline adherent cell lines and macrophages but poorly in primary feline PBMC.

These tumors invariably express fused gag-myb mRNA as a consequence of virus integration and activation of the c-myb locus. In the present study it was determined that while BALB/c and DBA/2N mice are highly susceptible, C57BL/6, C3H/He, STS/A, NFS, NIH/Swiss, SJL/J, and NZB mice are strongly resistant to tumor induction. Although C57BL/6 mice were resistant because they were unable to support early virus replication in hematopoietic tissue, NFS and C3H/He mice supported replication and were shown, using RT-PCR, to have cells in the bone marrow and spleen that expressed the aberrant, leukemia-related gag-myb mRNA. This provided evidence that early stages of leukemia were permitted to develop in these mice, but preneoplastic cells were unable to progress to the acute phase. Experiments in which MML was induced by M-MuLV plus pristane treatment in immunodeficient C3H/He nu/nu and sublethally irradiated C3H/He mice suggested that the immune response may play a role in eliminating preleukemic cells in immunocompetent C3H/He. Tumors from these mice had rearrangements at the c-myb locus and expressed gag-myb RNA. It was concluded that, at least in the case of C3H/He mice, resistance is not due to an inability of virus to activate c-myb or to a lack of other tumor promoting events. Rather, leukemia development appears to be restricted by an immune response, presumably T-cell mediated. Evidence is provided that non-H-2 MHC genes are required for resistance in both C57BL/6 and C3H/He mice and that resistance is dominant. This provides an animal model for the study of tumor progression as it relates to the immune response.","['Nazarov, V', 'Hilbert, D', 'Wolff, L']","['Nazarov V', 'Hilbert D', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Terpenes)', '26HZV48DT1 (pristane)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinogens', 'Disease Susceptibility/immunology', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/immunology/*physiopathology/virology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Species Specificity', 'Terpenes', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Virus Replication', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(84)71668-0 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1994.1668 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1994 Dec;205(2):479-85. doi: 10.1006/viro.1994.1668.,,['c-myb'],,,,,,,

BLC3 showed a characteristic profile, being MHC class I and MHC class II positive, but without T cell associated markers. Although the rearranged configuration in the Ig loci was not clearly found in Southern blot analysis using sheep Ig probes, steady-state levels of c-myb transcripts were detected in tumor cell line BLC3 by Northern blot hybridization.

To clarify the mechanism, PAI-2 gene expression induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, and Bt2cAMP was investigated by Northern blot hybridization using a PAI-2 cDNA probe cloned from a human placental library. The level of PAI-2 mRNA was markedly increased in response to PMA and reached a maximum 5-9 h after stimulation. Nuclear run-on assay revealed an increase in PAI-2 gene transcription in PMA-treated cells. The induction was inhibited by inhibiting de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX). cAMP also increased PAI-2 mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner. The increase began within 2 hours and, contrary to the case of PMA, the mRNA levels were maintained. Moreover, cAMP-induced increase in PAI-2 mRNA was not inhibited by CHX, rather enhanced. PMA and cAMP synergistically induced PAI-2 gene expression, which was completely inhibited by CHX. The cells pretreated with PMA for 24 h did not any more respond to stimulation with PMA but responded to cAMP and PAI-2 mRNA level was increased. The apparent half-life of constitutive level PAI-2 mRNA in PL-21 cells, determined by actinomycin-D-decay experiments, was approximately 2 h.

This infection is associated with significant mortality. We have reviewed 208 cases in the literature since 1970, 139 of which were presented in sufficient detail to assess prognostic factors, and added data from six of our patients. The histories of these 145 patients were analyzed for the following variables: 1) underlying conditions associated with mucormycotic infections; 2) incidence of ocular and orbital signs and symptoms; 3) incidence of nonocular signs and symptoms; 4) interval from symptom onset to treatment; and 5) the pattern of sinus involvement seen on imaging studies and noted at the time of surgery. Factors related to a lower survival rate include: 1) delayed diagnosis and treatment; 2) hemiparesis or hemiplegia; 3) bilateral sinus involvement; 4) leukemia; 5) renal disease; and 6) treatment with deferoxamine. The association of facial necrosis with a poor prognosis fell just short of statistical significance, but appears clinically important.

Those studies show that the human thrombin receptor has a structure similar to other G protein-coupled receptors, but is activated by a novel mechanism in which thrombin cleaves its receptor, creating a new N-terminus that can serve as a tethered ligand. Shortly after activation, thrombin receptors become temporarily resistant to re-activation. Present evidence suggests that this loss of function is due to a combination of receptor desensitization, phosphorylation and internalization, and that recovery may involve dephosphorylation, as well as receptor recycling and the expression of newly-synthesized receptors. Together these processes provide a potent mechanism for limiting the duration of thrombin-initiated events in platelets and other thrombin-responsive vascular cells.","['Brass, L F', 'Ahuja, M', 'Belmonte, E', 'Blanchard, N', 'Pizarro, S', 'Tarver, A', 'Hoxie, J A']","['Brass LF', 'Ahuja M', 'Belmonte E', 'Blanchard N', 'Pizarro S', 'Tarver A', 'Hoxie JA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['HL40387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL49987/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Endocytosis', 'Fibroblasts', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Thrombin/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",45,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1994 Jul;31(3):251-60.,,,,,,,,,

Vinorelbine (Navelbine; Burroughs Wellcome, Co, Research Triangle Park, NC; Pierre Fabre Medicament, Paris, France), a semisynthetic vinca alkaloid, has also demonstrated single-agent activity in this disease. Therefore, a phase I-II study was designed to investigate the addition of vinorelbine in escalating doses to the PFL combination. The objectives of this study were to establish the maximum tolerated dose of vinorelbine in combination with PFL, and to define the overall response rate in a cohort of patients treated with the maximum tolerated dose. The regimen consisted of vinorelbine in escalating doses starting at 20 mg/m2/d intravenously on days 1 and 5, followed by leucovorin 100 mg orally every 4 hours on days 1 to 5,5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/d intravenous continuous infusion days 2 to 5 (96 hours), and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously 12 to 24 hours after administration of the first dose of vinorelbine. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed in the first five patients treated with the initial vinorelbine dose. Increasing the dose of vinorelbine to 25 mg/m2 in a second cohort of two patients, however, resulted in grade 4 granulocytopenia in both, and grade 4 diarrhea in one. It was concluded that this dose level was not feasible. During a preliminary analysis, one complete response and three partial responses were observed in 16 patients evaluated; one of these patients had a pathologic complete remission.

Members of the neurotrophin family are currently the best candidates for such neurotrophic factors, but inactivation of their receptor genes leads to only partial loss of motoneurons, which suggests that other factors are involved. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), originally identified as a trophic factor specific for dopaminergic neurons, was found to be 75-fold more potent than the neurotrophins in supporting the survival of purified embryonic rat motoneurons in culture. GDNF messenger RNA was found in the immediate vicinity of motoneurons during the period of cell death in development. In vivo, GDNF rescues and prevents the atrophy of facial motoneurons that have been deprived of target-derived survival factors by axotomy. GDNF may therefore be a physiological trophic factor for spinal motoneurons. Its potency and specificity in vitro and in vivo also make it a good candidate for treatment of motoneuron disease.","['Henderson, C E', 'Phillips, H S', 'Pollock, R A', 'Davies, A M', 'Lemeulle, C', 'Armanini, M', 'Simmons, L', 'Moffet, B', 'Vandlen, R A', 'Simpson LC corrected to Simmons, L', 'Koliatsos, V E', 'Rosenthal, A']","['Henderson CE', 'Phillips HS', 'Pollock RA', 'Davies AM', 'Lemeulle C', 'Armanini M', 'Simmons L', 'Moffet B', 'Vandlen RA', 'Simpson LC corrected to Simmons L', 'Koliatsos VE', 'Rosenthal A', 'et al.']","['INSERM U.382, IBDM, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],['NS 10580/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Gdnf protein, rat)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,['Science 1995 Feb 10;267(5199):777'],"['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Face/innervation', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Motor Neurons/*cytology/drug effects', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/*metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factors/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Neurons, Afferent/cytology/drug effects', 'Peripheral Nerves/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Schwann Cells/metabolism']",,1994/11/11 00:00,1994/11/11 00:01,['1994/11/11 00:00'],"['1994/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.7973664 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1994 Nov 11;266(5187):1062-4. doi: 10.1126/science.7973664.,,,['Science. 1994 Nov 11;266(5187):970-2.

The experimental design entailed randomization of 240 patients equally to one of two treatments: radiotherapy alone or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The original design was a fixed sample size design with the intent to analyse the results after 190 deaths. Shortly after the trial began, it was decided to apply group sequential concepts by using a truncated O'Brien-Fleming stopping rule, implemented via a Lan-DeMets alpha-spending function. A study monitoring committee was established to review the analyses as they were produced. The study was stopped at the fifth interim analysis in May 1987 after 155 eligible patients had been entered. This paper reviews the statistical and other considerations leading to this decision and presents later follow-up information on these patients. Some Bayesian alternatives to the standard frequentist approaches are also explored and it is demonstrated how these alternatives provide a natural way to address many of the issues raised in monitoring clinical trials.","['George, S L', 'Li, C', 'Berry, D A', 'Green, M R']","['George SL', 'Li C', 'Berry DA', 'Green MR']","['Division of Biometry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.']",['eng'],['CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",,1994/07/15 00:00,1994/07/15 00:01,['1994/07/15 00:00'],"['1994/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.4780131305 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 1994 Jul 15-30;13(13-14):1313-27. doi: 10.1002/sim.4780131305.,,,,,,,,,

There is a potential for worsening of this occlusive microvascular retinopathy by radiation damage to the retinal vasculature (radiation retinopathy) and by the toxic effects of chemotherapy. METHODS: An 18-year-old woman with T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia received low-dose irradiation to the brain and subsequent chemotherapy, which included cytosine arabinoside. RESULTS: During the chemotherapy, she developed severe bilateral occlusive microvascular retinopathy that progressed despite extensive panretinal photocoagulation to bilateral optic disc and retinal neovascularization and eventual traction retinal detachment involving the macula. CONCLUSION: The toxic effect of a chemotherapeutic agent such as cytosine arabinoside when combined with radiation retinopathy may be additive, leading to a much more severe ischemic retinal vasculopathy than one would encounter with acute lymphocytic leukemia alone. This must be kept in mind when planning combined radiation and chemotherapy for T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia.","['Wiznia, R A', 'Rose, A', 'Levy, A L']","['Wiznia RA', 'Rose A', 'Levy AL']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Retina,"Retina (Philadelphia, Pa.)",8309919,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/complications/*therapy', 'Optic Disk/*blood supply/pathology/radiation effects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Retinal Artery Occlusion/etiology/pathology', 'Retinal Detachment/etiology/pathology', 'Retinal Diseases/*etiology', 'Retinal Neovascularization/*etiology/pathology', 'Retinal Vein Occlusion/etiology/pathology']",,1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006982-199414030-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Retina. 1994;14(3):253-5. doi: 10.1097/00006982-199414030-00011.,,,,,,,,,

The doubling time or mitotic delay under these conditions has been shown to depend on the dose rate in HeLa, V79 and P388F cells (Mitchell et al., Radiat. Res. 79, 520-536, 1979; Fox and Gilbert, Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 11, 339-347, 1966). Reanalysis of the data for these particular cell lines shows that there is a threshold dose rate for mitotic delay, and that above the threshold there is a linear relationship between the length of mitotic delay and the logarithm of the dose rate which is referred to as the dose-rate response. We have observed the same relationships for L5178Y (LY)-R and LY-S cells exposed to low-dose-rate radiation. The threshold dose rates for LY-R, LY-S and P388F cells are similar (0.01-0.02 Gy/h) and are much lower than for V79 and HeLa cells. The slope of the dose-rate response curve is the greatest for HeLa cells, followed in order by LY-S, V79 and P388F cells, and finally by LY-R cells.

A prototype version of a highly sensitive fluorescence imaging device consisting of a modified xenon lamp, an image-intensified camera and a digital image-processing system has been developed. 5,6-Carboxyfluorescein was used because its fluorescence emission increases as a function of pH in the physiological (6.0-7.4) pH range. The ratio of fluorescence intensities obtained with the imaging system has been calibrated using aqueous 5,6-CF standards at various pH values. Because the pH of interstitial fluid of malignant tumors tends to be lower than that of normal tissue and can be depressed by glucose administration, experiments were performed on 10 CDF mice bearing lymphoid leukemia P388 grafted subcutaneously. The range of linearity of the calibration curve was obtained between 5.3 and 6.7 with a measured pKa value of 5.93. Consequently the maximum sensitivity was observed in this range. The calculated pH from ratio images was 6.21 +/- 0.12 in tumorous tissue. This value was equivalent to those obtained at the same time using microelectrodes (6.2 +/- 0.3). These experiments showed that a dose of 5 mg/kg 5,6-CF and an excitation power density of 2.5 mW/cm2 are sufficient to give a fluorescent pH image of tumors. The limitation of 5,6-CF for the in vivo mapping of tissue results from its low pKa and consequent range of sensitivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Mordon, S', 'Devoisselle, J M', 'Maunoury, V']","['Mordon S', 'Devoisselle JM', 'Maunoury V']","['INSERM (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) U279, Lille.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '3301-79-9 (6-carboxyfluorescein)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Dyes', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/instrumentation/methods']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1994.tb05104.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1994 Sep;60(3):274-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1994.tb05104.x.,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that the transcriptional regulation through the PEBP2 site is critically important for growth and differentiation of t(8;21) leukemic cells and that the product of the chimeric gene is responsible for the maintenance of the leukemic phenotype.","['Sakakura, C', 'Yamaguchi-Iwai, Y', 'Satake, M', 'Bae, S C', 'Takahashi, A', 'Ogawa, E', 'Hagiwara, A', 'Takahashi, T', 'Murakami, A', 'Makino, K']","['Sakakura C', 'Yamaguchi-Iwai Y', 'Satake M', 'Bae SC', 'Takahashi A', 'Ogawa E', 'Hagiwara A', 'Takahashi T', 'Murakami A', 'Makino K', 'et al.']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,1994/11/22 00:00,1994/11/22 00:01,['1994/11/22 00:00'],"['1994/11/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.24.11723 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Nov 22;91(24):11723-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.24.11723.,PMC45304,"['AML1', 'ETO', 'MTG8', 'PEBP2']",,,,,,,

Although the introduction of specific antiviral genes into T leukemia cells can provide relative resistance to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication, the testing of such genes against primary viral isolates in human CD4+ lymphocytes has been limited, and safety questions remain regarding gene delivery into cells from HIV-infected patients. In this report, we evaluate the efficacy of a transdominant mutant protein, Rev M10, against cloned and primary HIV isolates in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and describe different methods of gene transfer into peripheral blood lymphocytes from HIV-infected individuals. We show that gold microparticles can mediate stable Rev M10 gene transfer into these cells. Introduction of Rev M10 by these techniques conferred resistance to HIV infection in vitro to cloned and clinical isolates. Nonviral delivery of HIV protective genes will facilitate the development of gene therapy for AIDS and the analysis of viral and cellular gene expression in human T lymphocytes.","['Woffendin, C', 'Yang, Z Y', 'Udaykumar', 'Xu, L', 'Yang, N S', 'Sheehy, M J', 'Nabel, G J']","['Woffendin C', 'Yang ZY', 'Udaykumar', 'Xu L', 'Yang NS', 'Sheehy MJ', 'Nabel GJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor.']",['eng'],['AI33355/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Gene Products, rev/*administration & dosage', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genes, Suppressor', '*Genes, rev', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Gold', 'HIV Infections/*prevention & control', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,1994/11/22 00:00,1994/11/22 00:01,['1994/11/22 00:00'],"['1994/11/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.24.11581 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Nov 22;91(24):11581-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.24.11581.,PMC45275,['rev'],,,,,,,

The X region contains two genes, tax and rex, whose protein products are involved in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of viral expression. In addition to these activators, the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) contain alternative open reading frames (R3 and G4 for BLV; p30, p13, and p12 for HTLV). As a virus/animal model for HTLV-induced leukemogenesis, BLV provirus can be injected intradermally into sheep, where it induced B-lymphocyte transformation. Deletion of the R3 and G4 sequences from an infectious and tumorigenic BLV provirus greatly impaired the in vivo propagation of the viruses as demonstrated by DNA polymerase chain reaction, RNA blots, structural-protein ELISA, and immunofluorescence analysis. Our results show that the alternative open reading frames are required for maintaining high virus loads during the course of persistent infection in vivo. Thus, R3 and G4 are candidates for antiviral drug development. Furthermore, viruses with a deletion in these sequences should be tested as live attenuated vaccines.","['Willems, L', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Dequiedt, F', 'Portetelle, D', 'Mammerickx, M', 'Burny, A', 'Kettmann, R']","['Willems L', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Dequiedt F', 'Portetelle D', 'Mammerickx M', 'Burny A', 'Kettmann R']","['National Institute of Veterinary Research, Uccle, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Viral/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*physiology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sheep', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus Replication']",,1994/11/22 00:00,1994/11/22 00:01,['1994/11/22 00:00'],"['1994/11/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.91.24.11532 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Nov 22;91(24):11532-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.24.11532.,PMC45265,,,,,,,,

Cytokines provide a means of communication between the immune system and its non-immune neighbours. Several clinical entities have been recognized as targets for clinical applications including interaction with malignant cell growth, host defence against infectious agents, negative regulation of autoagressive disorders and regulation of tissue and cell regeneration. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) can effectively regulate malignant growth in hairy-cell leukaemia, the first example of a biological treatment modality which tames a malignant disease and noramlizes life expectancy, although cure is not achieved. INF-alpha can also control myeloid hyperplasia in approximately two-thirds of the patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia. In 30% of the patients, treatment is accompanied by partial or complete restoration of normal haematopoiesis. Such cytogentic responses have not been observed with conventional chemotherapy. INF-alpha is also effective in infectious viral hepatitis B, C and D. A long-term beneficial response is observed in 25-40% of the patients. Promising results have also been seen with INF-gamma and interleukin-2 for the treatment of chronic leishmania infection and lepromatous leprosy. Activation of monocytes or macrophages induces these cells to intracellularly destruct leishmania parasites. Growth factors have been identified which influence erythrocyte, granulocyte and macrophage production. Their clinical use has been studied in patients with bone marrow failure, chronic renal failure, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. Additional work is needed to appreciate the immunnodulation effect of cytokines and their role in wound healing and tissue regulation.","['Peschel, C', 'Huber, C', 'Aulitzky, W E']","['Peschel C', 'Huber C', 'Aulitzky WE']","['IIIrd Department of Internal Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz School of Medicine, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,,"['Autoimmune Diseases/*therapy', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Virus Diseases/*therapy', 'Wound Healing/drug effects']",50,1994/06/18 00:00,1994/06/18 00:01,['1994/06/18 00:00'],"['1994/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 1994 Jun 18;23(23):1083-91.,,,,,,,,,

Technical performances as reproducibility, linearity, carryover were quite well acceptable. On normal samples, neutrophils (NE), lymphocytes (LY) and eosinophils (EO) were found to correlate with optical method with coefficient (R) values higher than 0.9. Weaker R coefficients were found for monocytes (MO) and basophils (BA), however it didn't involve clinical consequences. Significant threshold for immature granulocytes (IG) and variant lymphocytes (VL) flags were built. By using those, a false positive rate of 7% was shown. In hematological diseases, no false negative was detected because all samples were flagged. However, no acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was studied, so the detection of lymphoblast, as known as a real difficulty for analyser, was not yet evaluated. Blasts in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and hairy cells were both noticed by CD. Moreover, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), three groups were described, according to the flags released.

Data were collected over a period of 11 years for 105 patients with acute leukaemia (60 lymphoid cases and 45 myeloid cases). Multivariate analysis by the Cox model was used to determine prognostic factors for survival and disease free survival (DFS). Overall survival for the entire population was 35% after 8 years while DFS was 33% after 3 years. The major prognostic criteria were granulocyte recovery time (p < 0.001 at 5 weeks) and platelet recovery time (p < 0.02 at 6 weeks). Patients conditioned by an association of polychemotherapy and total body irradiation (TBI) showed a better survival rate than those conditioned by polychemotherapy alone (p < 0.01), with an overall survival of 48% after 3 years for the former group as compared to 19% for the latter. Other parameters influencing survival were the number of graft CFU-GM, sex and age. A knowledge of these factors could provide a means of predicting the long term evolution of leukaemia following autologous bone marrow transplantation.

The TLS/FUS gene is involved both in human myxoid liposarcomas which carry a characteristic chromosomal translocation, t(12;16)(q13;p11) and in human myeloid leukemias with recurrent chromosomal translocation, t(16;21)(p11:q22). The TLS/FUS gene is fused to a transcriptional repressor, CHOP (in human myxoid liposarcomas) or transcriptional activator, erg (in human myeloid leukemias). To understand better the functional role of TLS/FUS-erg in human myeloid leukemias, we have cloned the TLS/FUS and TLS/FUS-erg cDNAs and studied the functional properties of their gene products. TLS/FUS protein binds to RNA in vitro and shows preferential binding to poly G. Both the amino- and the carboxy- terminal regions of TLS/FUS containing the conserved RNA binding motifs are needed for poly G specific RNA binding activity. The TLS/FUS fusion domain (TFD) appears to regulate the DNA binding activity of TLS/FUS-erg chimeric protein which shows weaker transcriptional activation properties compared to normal erg proteins. Mutational analysis of the TLS/FUS-erg chimeric protein reveals TFD to function as a transcriptional activation domain thus replacing the amino terminal transcriptional activation domain of the erg protein. Therefore alterations in both DNA binding and transcriptional activation properties of aberrant erg proteins may be responsible for the genesis of t(16;21) chromosomal translocation-bearing human myeloid leukemias.","['Prasad, D D', 'Ouchida, M', 'Lee, L', 'Rao, V N', 'Reddy, E S']","['Prasad DD', 'Ouchida M', 'Lee L', 'Rao VN', 'Reddy ES']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Jefferson Cancer Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19107-5541.']",['eng'],"['CA 51083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 57157/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 58642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)']",IM,,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1994 Dec;9(12):3717-29.,,"['FUS', 'TLS']",,,,,,,

We have shown previously that the human lck type I promoter, which is preferentially expressed in immature thymocytes, requires a binding site (-97 to -90) for the Ets family of transcription factors for its activity in Jurkat T leukemia cells. Three putative Myb binding sites (-86 to -82, -77 to -72 and -59 to -54) were analysed for their ability to activate the lck type I promoter. In vitro assays demonstrated specific binding of purified, bacterially expressed c-Myb DNA binding domain to the Myb (-59 to -54) site. Transient transfection assays using the site-directed mutants of the lck type I promoter in Jurkat cells revealed that mutation of the Myb (-59 to -54) site abolished transcriptional activity. In transiently transfected HeLa cells, the lck type I promoter was activated by co-transfection with a vector that expresses c-Myb. This c-Myb dependent activation required the presence of intact Myb and Ets binding sites, indicating that the expressed c-Myb functions with endogenous Ets related transcription factors to activate the lck type I promoter. This effect was further enhanced by co-transfection with vectors that express either Ets1 or Ets2.

Recently this translocation has been shown to implicate the MTCP-1/c6.1B gene on chromosome Xq28, leading to aberrant or overexpressed MTCP-1 transcripts. The potential coding role of this gene was made uncertain by the lack of a long open reading frame in its major transcripts. However, a short 204 bases open reading frame is potentially coding for a 68 amino-acid protein. Here, we show that this open reading frame sequence and the deduced product are well conserved in mouse. A 8 kD protein (p8), which corresponds to the predicted molecular weight was revealed in transient transfectants and in cell lines by Western blotting, using a rabbit antiserum. This product was absent in lymphoblastoid cell lines with deletions of the MTCP-1/c6.1B locus. A dramatic overexpression of p8 was found in leukemic cells from a patient with a t(X;14). This small protein was localized in the cytoplasm by immunofluorescence. In conclusion, MTCP-1 encodes for a cytoplasmic 8 kD product.

Either the homeodomain or Pbx1 amino acids flanking this region could mediate transformation when fused to E2a. However, the homeodomain was not essential for transformation, since a mutant E2a-Pbx1 protein (E2a-Pbx delta HD) lacking the homeodomain efficiently transformed fibroblasts and induced malignant lymphomas in transgenic mice. Thus, transformation mediated by the chimeric oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1 is absolutely dependent on motifs acquired from E2a but the Pbx1 homeodomain is optional. The latter finding suggests that E2a-Pbx1 may interact with cellular proteins that assist or mediate alterations in gene expression responsible for oncogenesis even in the absence of homeodomain-DNA interactions.","['Monica, K', 'LeBrun, D P', 'Dedera, D A', 'Brown, R', 'Cleary, M L']","['Monica K', 'LeBrun DP', 'Dedera DA', 'Brown R', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305.']",['eng'],['CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adenovirus E2 Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adenovirus E2 Proteins/*physiology', 'Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.12.8304-8314.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Dec;14(12):8304-14. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.12.8304-8314.1994.,PMC359369,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms that mediate electrical activity-dependent gene regulation are not understood, but these mechanisms are likely to be responsible, at least in part, for the changes in muscle structure and function that accompany a decrease in myofiber electrical activity. To understand how muscle activity regulates muscle structure and function, we used a subtractive-hybridization and cloning strategy to identify and isolate genes that are expressed preferentially in innervated or denervated muscle. One of the genes which we found to be regulated by electrical activity is the recently discovered acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1) gene. Disruption and translocation of the human AML1 gene are responsible for a form of acute myeloid leukemia. AML1 is a DNA-binding protein, but its normal function is not known and its expression and regulation in skeletal muscle were not previously appreciated. Because of its potential role as a transcriptional mediator of electrical activity, we characterized expression of the AML1 gene in innervated, denervated, and developing skeletal muscle. We show that AML1 is expressed at low levels in innervated skeletal muscle and at 50- to 100-fold-higher levels in denervated muscle. Four AML1 transcripts are expressed in denervated muscle, and the abundance of each transcript increases after denervation. We transfected C2 muscle cells with an expression vector encoding AML1, tagged with an epitope from hemagglutinin, and we show that AML1 is a nuclear protein in muscle. AML1 dimerizes with core-binding factor beta (CBF beta), and we show that CGF beta is expressed at high levels in both innervated and denervated skeletal muscle. PEBP2 alpha, which is structurally related to AML1 and which also dimerizes with CBF beta, is expressed at low levels in skeletal muscle and is up-regulated only weakly by denervation. These results are consistent with the idea that AML1 may have a role in regulating gene expression in skeletal muscle.","['Zhu, X', 'Yeadon, J E', 'Burden, S J']","['Zhu X', 'Yeadon JE', 'Burden SJ']","['Biology Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139.']",['eng'],['NS27963/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Nicotinic)', '0 (Runx1 protein, rat)', '0 (Runx2 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,['Mol Cell Biol 1995 Feb;15(2):1136'],"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscle Denervation', 'Muscle Proteins/metabolism', 'Muscles/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Nicotinic/genetics', 'Synapses/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.14.12.8051-8057.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1994 Dec;14(12):8051-7. doi: 10.1128/mcb.14.12.8051-8057.1994.,PMC359343,"['AML1', 'CBF&bgr;', 'PEBP2&agr;']",,,['GENBANK/L35271'],,,,

VP-16 exerts its DNA-damaging and cytotoxic effects subsequent to interference with DNA topoisomerase II activity. VP-16 also stimulates c-jun and c-fos mRNA expression in some cell lines, including human leukemia K562 and HL-60 cells. To compare the temporal relationship between drug-induced c-jun expression and apoptosis, we examined cell morphology, cell viability, DNA integrity, and c-jun induction during VP-16 treatment of K562 and HL-60 cells. VP-16 (10 microM)-induced internucleosomal DNA damage and nuclear fragmentation were readily apparent within 6 hr in HL-60 cells but were absent in K562 cells treated for up to 24 hr. Some internucleosomal DNA damage was observed in K562 cells but only after treatment with 100 microM VP-16 for 24 hr. In contrast, VP-16-induced DNA single-strand breaks, VP-16-induced topoisomerase II/DNA covalent complex formation, and VP-16-mediated growth inhibition were similar in K562 and HL-60 cells. Also, the time course of VP-16-induced c-jun mRNA expression was comparable for both K562 and HL-60 cell lines. Western blot analysis of whole-cell lysates showed that Bcl-2 protein levels were 13-fold greater in HL-60 cells than in K562 cells. Thus, the resistance of VP-16-treated K562 cells to apoptosis was not attributable to protection by Bcl-2. Furthermore, the relatively high levels of Bcl-2 in HL-60 cells were not sufficient to protect these cells against apoptosis. Together, our results indicate that the temporal coupling of VP-16-induced DNA damage, c-jun expression, and apoptosis is cell type specific and suggest that different signaling pathways for apoptosis are operating in these two human leukemia cell lines.","['Ritke, M K', 'Rusnak, J M', 'Lazo, J S', 'Allan, W P', 'Dive, C', 'Heer, S', 'Yalowich, J C']","['Ritke MK', 'Rusnak JM', 'Lazo JS', 'Allan WP', 'Dive C', 'Heer S', 'Yalowich JC']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania 15261.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, fos', '*Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1994 Oct;46(4):605-11.,,"['c-fos', 'c-jun']",,,,,,,

So far, in adult patients suffering from acute leukemia assessment of quality of life has not been considered possibly due to poor prognosis and the acute course of the disease.

Therefore, the assessment of quality of life of patients undergoing treatment is of growing interest.

To confirm the hypothesis that the distribution of a trace- and high-dose labeled antibodies are similar, both trace (7-11 mCi, 259-407 MBq) and high-dose (100-800 mCi, 3700-29600 MBq) I-131 radiolabeled antibody infusion were imaged in 12 patients who were treated for leukemia or lymphoma.

Highly specific and sensitive for peroxides (detection limits < 0.5 pmol for cholesterol hydroperoxides and < 50 pmol for phospholipid hydroperoxides), this approach allows different classes of LOOH to be separated and determined in minimally damaged cells. L1210 cells in serum-containing growth medium were irradiated in the presence of merocyanine 540 (MC540), a lipophilic photosensitizing dye. Lipid extracts from cells exposed to a light fluence of 0.11 J/cm2 (which reduced clonally assessed survival by 30%) showed 12-15 well-defined peaks in HPLC-EC. None of these peaks was observed when cells were irradiated without MC540 or when dye/light-treated samples were reduced with triphenylphosphine prior to analysis. Three peaks of relatively low retention time (< 12 min) were assigned to the following species by virtue of comigration with authentic standards: 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-6-ene-5-hydroperoxide (5 alpha-OOH), 3 beta-hydroxycholest-4-ene-6 beta-hydroperoxide (6 beta-OOH), and 3 beta-hydroxycholest-5-ene-7 alpha/7 beta-hydroperoxide (7 alpha/7 beta-OOH). Formation of 5 alpha-OOH and 6 beta-OOH (single oxygen adducts) was confirmed by subjecting [14C]cholesterol-labeled cells to relatively high levels of photooxidation and analyzing extracted lipids by HPLC with radiochemical detection. Material represented in a major peak at 18-22 min on HPLC-EC was isolated in relatively large amounts by semipreparative HPLC and shown to contain phospholipid hydroperoxides (predominantly phosphatidylcholine species, PCOOH) according to the following criteria: (i) decay of 18-22 min peak during Ca2+/phospholipase A2 treatment, with reciprocal appearance of fatty acid hydroperoxides; (ii) reduction of peroxide during treatment with reduced glutathione and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, but not glutathione peroxidase; and (iii) comigration with PCOOH standards in thin-layer chromatography. HPLC-EC analysis revealed quantifiable amounts of PCOOH and ChOOH at a light fluence that clonally inactivated < 10% of the cells, which allows for the possibility that photoperoxidative damage plays a causal role in cell killing.","['Bachowski, G J', 'Korytowski, W', 'Girotti, A W']","['Bachowski GJ', 'Korytowski W', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],['P01-CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', '7J48214Z9H (cholesterol hydroperoxide)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cholesterol/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/analysis', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Lipid Peroxides/*biosynthesis/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylcholines/analysis', 'Phospholipases A/pharmacology', 'Photochemistry', 'Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02578241 [doi]'],ppublish,Lipids. 1994 Jul;29(7):449-59. doi: 10.1007/BF02578241.,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective blind study on a series of stored bone marrow specimens from normal subjects and patients with APL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Conventional cytogenetic and FISH analyses were done on interphase and metaphase cells in specimens from 31 normal subjects and 19 patients with untreated or treated APL. RESULTS: From 25 of the normal specimens, we calculated a normal cutoff of 10% for interphase cells and 0% for metaphase cells. With use of these criteria, the other six specimens from normal subjects showed normal findings, and each of the seven specimens from patients with untreated APL was abnormal by FISH analysis. The specimens from four patients in clinical relapse or with residual APL were abnormal. Of the eight specimens from patients in clinical remission, three were abnormal; two of these patients had a relapse within 8 months, and the other patient had received 1 month of chemotherapy and was entering remission. Of the other five patients in remission, four had normal FISH results and have now been in remission for 2.5 to 10 years. The other patient in remission with normal FISH results had a relapse within 6 months. PML/RARA fusion was detectable in three patients with hypogranular APL and in three with a cytogenetic variant of the t(15;17). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that FISH with PML and RARA probes can be used to diagnose APL and may be useful for monitoring treated patients.","['Schad, C R', 'Hanson, C A', 'Paietta, E', 'Casper, J', 'Jalal, S M', 'Dewald, G W']","['Schad CR', 'Hanson CA', 'Paietta E', 'Casper J', 'Jalal SM', 'Dewald GW']","['Division of Laboratory Genetics, Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN 55905.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'Genes', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Metaphase/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retrospective Studies']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-6196(12)61371-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-6196(12)61371-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 1994 Nov;69(11):1047-53. doi: 10.1016/s0025-6196(12)61371-8.,,,,,,,,,

This dose response relationship was more pronounced in HL60 and AML cell cultures, indicating greater sensitivity of AML progenitor cells compared with normal BM progenitors. Short-term exposure (18 h) to a range of concentrations of simvastatin showed the same differential response between leukaemic and normal BM cells in terms of clonogenicity. At a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml progenitor cell survival remained above 65% for normal BM while at this concentration leukaemia progenitor cell survival fell below 25% of the untreated values.

Approximately 40% of AML blasts with autonomous growth have been reported to exhibit abnormalities of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein expression. As the Rb protein is a known transcriptional repressor of the IL-6 promoter, we have investigated the relationship between absence of Rb protein and cytokine gene expression in AML. Blasts from 28 patients were studied, 19 were Rb protein positive by Western blot and by flow cytometry for nuclear Rb protein; blasts from nine patients were Rb-negative. Of the 28 specimens tested by RT-PCR, 24 were positive for GM-CSF mRNA, 21 for IL-1 beta mRNA, and 14 for IL-6 mRNA. Only the expression of IL-6 was found to be significantly associated with loss of Rb protein expression (p < 0.02). The relationship between Rb protein and IL-6 expression was further studied by suppressing Rb protein expression with antisense oligonucleotides. In three out of seven blasts so treated, IL-6 mRNA was induced following antisense treatment whereas control sense oligonucleotides had no effect. Blasts from four patients which secreted high levels of IL-6 exhibited in vitro autonomous growth which could be partially suppressed by anti-IL-6. These results suggest that deletion of Rb protein expression is a mechanism that can dysregulate IL-6 expression in leukemic blasts and thus potentiate the autonomous growth of these cells.","['Zhu, Y M', 'Bradbury, D A', 'Keith, F J', 'Russell, N']","['Zhu YM', 'Bradbury DA', 'Keith FJ', 'Russell N']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*physiology']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Nov;8(11):1982-8.,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, DMSO pretreatment potentiated the cells' capacity to produce cytokines, especially TNF, upon LPS stimulation. This endogenously present TNF was metabolized by the cells. These observations suggested that the LPS-induced cytostasis/cytotoxicity was mediated through TNF. Indeed, medium conditioned by LPS-stimulated U937-DMSO cells was found to exert a cytotoxic effect on U937-DMSO cells that was completely neutralized by anti-human TNF antiserum. Such TNF-like activities were not only present in the supernatant but also at the level of the cell membrane of LPS-stimulated U937-DMSO cells. Apart from TNF, other exogenously applied recombinant cytokines (IL1, IL6, IFN gamma, GM-CSF) were not cytotoxic to U937-DMSO cells.

In this score, one point is allocated to each of the following four parameters: bone marrow blasts > or = 5%, LDH > 200 U/l, hemoglobulin concentration < or = 9 g/dl, and platelet count < or = 100 x 10(9)/l. In a published series of 235 untreated patients with primary MDS, three prognostic groups (group A, score 0; group B, score 1 or 2; group C, score 3 or 4) were identified which differed significantly in both survival and rates of leukemic transformation. The present study was undertaken to reexamine the usefulness of our scoring system by applying it to an independent population of 263 newly diagnosed MDS patients. Morphological subtypes were RA in 53 (20%), RARS in 32 (12%), pure sideroblastic anemia (PSA) in 41 (16%), RAEB in 60 (23%), RAEB/T in 34 (13%), and CMML in 43 cases (16%). The predictive value of the Dusseldorf score could be assessed in 244 of 263 patients (initial LDH levels or platelet counts lacking in 19 cases). Forty-two patients were assigned to group A (low risk), 132 to group B (intermediate risk), and 70 to group C (high risk). Two-year cumulative survival was 86% in group A, 57% in group B and 14% in group C. Five-year cumulative survival was 53, 26 and 0%, respectively (p < 0.00005). Cumulative risk of AML 2 years after diagnosis was 3% in group A, 12% in group B, and 41% in group C (p < 0.05). Additional validation of the score was provided by extended follow-up of the initial patient population on which the scoring system was based. Survival curves in this patient population developed as predicted by the score. An important advantage of the Dusseldorf score is its ability to identify high-risk patients among the RA and RARS subgroups, even though by definition medullary blasts are less than 5%. The inclusion of LDH levels as a prognostic parameter also qualifies the Dusseldorf score for a correct assessment of CMML patients. In the new study population, LDH was confirmed as an important prognostic factor. After 2 years, actuarial survival for patients with LDH levels < or = 200 U/l was 61%, compared with 34% for patients with LDH > 200 U/l.

The expression of these molecules was also studied in nine of these patients following the APL cells' culture with and without all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The fresh APL promyelocytes expressed CD45RA and CD15s on their surface, while CD11a, CD11b, CD15, and CD45R0 were constantly absent. In vitro treatment with ATRA consistently increased the expression of CD15, CD11b, and CD45R0 on leukemic promyelocytes; these changes were paralleled by a decrease of CD45RA display. The expression of sialylated antigen CD15s was fully independent from CD15 suggesting a differential enzymatic regulation within this selectin ligand system. ATRA was, however, incapable of promoting the up-regulation of CD11a in APL. As a result, asynchronous phenotype (CD11a-, CD11b+, CD15+, CD15s+/-, CD45RA-, CD45R0+) was generated that is normally undetectable on maturing myeloid cells. In order to provide a further control a case of acute agranulocytosis was also investigated, in which > 75% bone marrow cells were arrested at the promyelocyte stage; these bone marrow cells showed a surface phenotype identical to non-leukemic promyelocytes (CD11a+, CD11b+, CD15+, CD45R0+, CD45RA-) with a spontaneous ability to differentiate in vivo towards the more mature stages of myeloid differentiation. We therefore suggest that in fresh and ATRA-induced APL cells distinct, regular phenotypic changes are identifiable that are probably associated with t(15;17) and not seen in normal and activated bone marrow.","['Di Noto, R', 'Schiavone, E M', 'Ferrara, F', 'Manzo, C', 'Lo Pardo, C', 'Del Vecchio, L']","['Di Noto R', 'Schiavone EM', 'Ferrara F', 'Manzo C', 'Lo Pardo C', 'Del Vecchio L']","['Divisione di Oncologia Spermentale C, Immunologia, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD66 antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Nov;8(11):1900-5.,,,,,,,,,

B-cell gating in CD37/kappa/lambda clonality test.,1864-70,"Normal and malignant B-lymphoid cells were studied for CD37 antigen expression with three-color immunofluorescence (IF) in combination with kappa/lambda light chain staining, and by quantitative immunofluorescence utilizing the QIFI test. Peripheral B cells brightly expressed CD37 antigen (median 80-114 x 10(3) molecules/cell). Moderate to high levels (> 20 x 10(3)/cell) of CD37 expression were detected in 364 in 366 cases of peripheral B-cell disorders including all cases of B-ALL, B-cell lymphomas and B-CLL as well as eight of ten cases of PLL. By contrast, slg- B-cell precursors and other cell types in normal bone marrow (BM) were CD37-/CD37dull (< 10 x 10(3) molecules/cell). The negativity for CD37 or only CD37dull expression was confirmed in 180 of 182 cases of precursor B-ALL and 196 cases of non-B malignancies. Among the CD37 cluster, the RFB7 antibody of IgM class showed the weakest binding to non-B cells. In 64 normal samples of blood and BM the CD37+ gated cells showed normal kappa/lambda ratios as expected, while in 100 cases of B malignancy striking changes such as kappa/lambda monoclonality (79%) and aberrant slg- or sigdull expression (21%) were seen among the gated CD37+ B cells. The CD37/kappa/lambda test identified as few as 0.5% kappa+ or lambda- monoclonal B cells admixed to normal BM: circulating B-lymphoma cells were seen in nine patients with morphologically normal blood count. The discrimination of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test for kappa/lambda excess was also improved by CD37+ B gating. Thus CD37+ B-cell gating and kappa/lambda analysis is a simple and sensitive routine test, e.g. when combined with autogating on a Cytoron-Absolute cytometer, for identifying malignant B cells in minimally involved BM and blood.","['Peters, R E', 'Janossy, G', 'Ivory, K', 'al-Ismail, S', 'Mercolino, T']","['Peters RE', 'Janossy G', 'Ivory K', 'al-Ismail S', 'Mercolino T']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD37 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Tetraspanins)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*analysis', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/*analysis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Tetraspanins']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Nov;8(11):1864-70.,,,,,,,,,

However, these clinical subtypes of ATL do not always correlate with prognosis. We propose a new criterion for classification of clinical stages of ATL, based on the expression of Ki-67 antigen in peripheral blood T lymphocytes. We analyzed Ki-67 antigen expression in 45 ATL patients, classified as 18 acute, 17 chronic, and ten smoldering type. We found that in 23 patients with more than 18% Ki-67 antigen-positive T cells, the disease progressed very aggressively, and all patients died within 1 year (mean survival, 105 days). This group included 15 of 16 patients classified as 'acute', seven of 15 patients classified as 'chronic', and one of nine patients classified as 'smoldering' type. In contrast, 15 out of 17 patients with less than 18% Ki-67 antigen-positive T cells were still alive at the end of the study, with a mean survival of 750 days. Only two patients died in this group, and after a very long survival (599 and 978 days, respectively). We therefore propose the following new classification for ATL: (i) Aggressive ATL; percentage of Ki-67 antigen-positive cells more than 18% in peripheral blood T lymphocytes, (ii) Stable ATL; percentage less than 18%. This classification strongly correlates with the prognosis of patients with ATL.","['Shirono, K', 'Hattori, T', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Shirono K', 'Hattori T', 'Takatsuki K']","['Division of Clinical Hematology and Immunology, Kumamoto City Hopital, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*classification/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proviruses', 'Survival Analysis']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Nov;8(11):1834-7.,,,,,,,,,

The family of compounds known as the retinoids have shown particular promise in this area. Current interest is directed towards established retinoids such as ATRA and 13-CRA. Newer synthetic retinoids such as fenretinide, the arotinoid Ro 40-8757, and 9-cis retinoic acid have been entering clinical trials. Ro 40-8757 is a particularly interesting new arotinoid with properties quite distinct from the other retinoids. It has different binding proteins and appears to regulate different genes than the classical retinoids such as ATRA or 13-CRA. Furthermore, it appears active against a different spectrum of malignancies. It also appears to have a relatively favourable side-effect profile. In addition to its anti-proliferative effects, this arotinoid may play a role in protection of bone marrow function after use of cytotoxic drugs. Development of Ro 40-8757 was halted before the compound had entered phase II testing due to lack of resources. Future developmental programmes for retinoids should move rapidly to explore the potential of interesting combinations identified in preclinical models. Retinoids should be considered primarily as drugs which modulate and enhance the effects of other active anticancer agents. Their development should not be prevented because they are unlikely to be active as single agents against common solid tumours.","['Arnold, A', 'Kowaleski, B', 'Tozer, R', 'Hirte, H']","['Arnold A', 'Kowaleski B', 'Tozer R', 'Hirte H']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Retinoids)', '8K3CVY8F8V (mofarotene)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/administration & dosage', 'Drug Combinations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Morpholines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Rats', 'Retinoids/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Nov;8(11):1817-24.,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis for children with advanced stage neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, has remained poor despite significant increases in the intensity of multi-modality therapy. Observations that neuroblastoma has the potential in vivo to differentiate into the more mature neuronal phenotype of a ganglioneuroma or to spontaneously regress, combined with the ability of ATRA to induce differentiation of neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro, suggests that neuroblastoma may be a prime candidate for a retinoid-based approach to differentiation therapy. We previously performed a standard pediatric phase I trial of ATRA and defined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in children to be 60 mg/m2/day, significantly lower than the MTD in adult patients. Pharmacokinetic results revealed that the plasma half-life of ATRA was short (45 min) relative to 13-cis-RA (12-24 h), and that plasma drug exposure decreased significantly by day 28 of daily drug administration. Preclinical studies using an i.v. formulation of ATRA in a Rhesus monkey pharmacokinetic model then demonstrated that ATRA is eliminated by a capacity-limited (saturable) process. This elimination process was rapidly induced within the first week of daily i.v. ATRA administration, and suggested that an intermittent schedule of drug administration might allow for down-regulation of the elimination process. These pre-clinical studies formed the basis for investigating whether an intermittent schedule of ATRA administration would allow for repeated periods of relatively higher plasma drug concentrations. Preliminary results of two clinical trials using intermittent schedules of administration suggest that this approach may result in significantly higher plasma drug exposure over time. Plans to study the role of intermittent schedules of ATRA administration in pediatric phase II trials in patients with neuroblastoma are underway.","['Adamson, P C']",['Adamson PC'],"['Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",28,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Nov;8(11):1813-6.,,,,,,,,,

RA is much more rapidly cleared from plasma following oral administration; their respective half-lives are < 1 h and 13 h. There is extensive accumulation of the 4-oxo-cRA in plasma following repeated doses of cRA, while 4-oxo-RA is only a minor metabolite in plasma following RA administration. The extent of isomerization in vivo differs for the two retinoids. In contrast to cRA, where up to a 1:3 ratio of RA to cRA is observed in patient plasma following drug administration, cRA concentrations in excess of 10 ng/ml are rarely observed in plasma of patients receiving exogenous RA. RA administration produces autoinduction of its own oxidative catabolism; this effect does not occur with cRA. These pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in leukemia and solid tumor patients. Detailed analysis of the results of the population studied suggest that both constitutive and RA-induced hypercatabolism of RA occurs. Both of these hypercatabolic states can be modulated by concurrent administration of ketoconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 and lipoxygenase-mediated oxidations.","['Muindi, J R', 'Young, C W', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Muindi JR', 'Young CW', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",IM,,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ketoconazole/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",27,1994/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Nov;8(11):1807-12.,,,,,,,,,

All nuclear receptors have several well-characterized structural domains, including a conserved DNA-binding domain, and a ligand binding domain at the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. The RAR and RXR classes of nuclear retinoic acid receptors are each composed of alpha, beta and gamma subtypes with more than one isoform for each receptor subtype. Data from many investigators suggest there are RAR- and RXR-dependent gene pathways, and that the individual receptor subtypes may control distinct gene expression patterns. In addition, RXR has been found to heterodimerize with other nuclear receptors to form active transcriptional complexes, which influence the activity of a variety of gene pathways important in growth and differentiation. As a result, retinoids have been useful clinical agents in Dermatology and Oncology. However, upon prolonged exposure to retinoic acid, resistance to retinoids has often been encountered both in the clinical setting and in long-term cell culture (HL60R and RAC65 cells). In the latter case, retinoid resistance has been associated with a mutation in the RAR gene which transcribes a RAR receptor truncated at the C-terminal end. These mutated RAR receptors exhibit a reduced affinity for retinoic acid while retaining the ability to bind to a retinoic acid response element on DNA. As a result, these mutant receptors exhibit dominant-negative activity by binding to the DNA without activating transcription and by competing with other receptors for sites on the response element. In fact, dominant-negative activity may be very important in the development of many neoplastic diseases, including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), where a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation fuses the PML gene to the RAR gene, to produce a PML-RAR fusion protein in large excess in the cell. However, retinoid resistance in the patient is most probably the result of pharmacokinetic problems, whereby, with continuous retinoid treatment, the plasma levels of retinoic acid gradually decrease to below that required to maintain differentiation of leukemic cells in vivo. A major challenge for drug discovery is to design a drug which circumvents these pharmacokinetic problems either by designing novel drug delivery systems or by employing retinoids which do not bind to CRABP, such as 9-c-RA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Pemrick, S M', 'Lucas, D A', 'Grippo, J F']","['Pemrick SM', 'Lucas DA', 'Grippo JF']","['Department of Toxicology and Pathology, Hoffman-La Roche, Nutley, NJ 07110.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins', '*Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', '*Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcription Factors']",114,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Nov;8(11):1797-806.,,"['Hoxa-1', 'RAR', 'RXR']",,,,,,,

In this study, the transformed FDC-P2 cells were demonstrated to be tumorigenic in syngeneic DBA/2 mice. The intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the transformed tumor cells into DBA/2 mice induced infiltrations of abdominal organs, and then all of the mice died within time periods proportional to the cell numbers of inoculation. In mice that received an i.p. inoculation with greater than 1 x 10(5) cells, in vivo administration of herbimycin A by i.p. injection inhibited tumor formation and significantly prolonged survival time, and further, in mice inoculated with 1 x 10(4) cells, herbimycin A completely suppressed the in vivo growth of transformant FDC-P2 cells and brought about a complete remission.

The secretion of autocrine growth factor, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 1 (IL-1), has been implicated as one possible mechanism in leukemogenesis. In many cases, however, leukemia cells do not appear to produce autocrine growth stimulators. J6-1 is an established human myeloid leukemia cell line that exhibits both density-dependent and cluster-forming growth characteristics. The effect of direct cell-cell contact on J6-1 cell proliferation was investigated. We have isolated from J6-1 cells a membrane-bound factor (designated as MAF-J6-1) that promoted the colony formation by both J6-1 cells and mouse bone marrow CFU-GM. The growth-promoting activity of MAF-J6-1 can be neutralized by either anti-macrophage-CSF (M-CSF or CSF-1) or anti-MAF-J6-1 monoclonal antibodies (MAb), suggesting that MAF-J6-1 is related to M-CSF. Using an immunoblot analysis with anti-MAF-J6-1 MAb, the MW of this membrane-associated factor was estimated to be 80 kDa. Both antibodies also induced a modest growth inhibition on J6-1 cells in vitro. Similarly, addition of exogenous recombinant human M-CSF augmented the colony formation by J6-1 cells, an effect also neutralized by both antibodies. Using an in situ hybridization technique, J6-1 cells were found to express a high level of c-fms proto-oncogene, which encodes the receptor for the M-CSF. Taken together, our results suggest that the membrane-bound MAF-J6-1 promote J6-1 cell proliferation and cluster formation through a 'juxtacrine' mechanism.","['Wu, K F', 'Rao, Q', 'Zheng, G G', 'Geng, Y Q', 'Li, M', 'Kong, J', 'Song, Y H', 'Ying, H G', 'Chen, B D']","['Wu KF', 'Rao Q', 'Zheng GG', 'Geng YQ', 'Li M', 'Kong J', 'Song YH', 'Ying HG', 'Chen BD']","['Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin.']",['eng'],['AI23499/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Cell Communication', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, fms', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)90165-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)90165-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Nov;18(11):843-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90165-1.,,,,,,,,,

The cells were cultured with different doses of six GAGs: hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparin and heparan sulfate. It was found that, in serum-free agar system, no GAG was able to stimulate (HEL) cell growth. In contrast, when serum-containing culture systems were used, all six GAGs promoted colony formation of HL60 and U937 cells.

In an attempt to better understand BCNU resistance in the in vivo situation, we compared the principal drug-metabolizing enzyme systems in two L1210 leukemia lines, one sensitive and one resistant to BCNU (L1210/BCNU), passaged in vivo in mice. The following enzymes were assayed by immunoblotting: cytochromes P-450 (1A1/1A2, 2B1/2B2, 2C8-10, 2E1, 3A), epoxide hydrolase (EH) and glutathione S-transferase (GST-alpha, -mu and -pi). The following enzymes and cofactors were assayed fluorometrically or spectrophotometrically: 1-chloro-2-4 dinitrobenzene-GST (CDNB-GST), total glutathione (GSH), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, beta-glucuronidase, sulfatase and sulfotransferase. Results showed that cytochrome P-450 1A1/1A2 was the only isoenzyme detected in both L1210 and L1210/BCNU. CDNB-GST activity was significantly higher in L1210/BCNU compared with L1210. The isoenzyme GST-alpha was more abundant in L1210/BCNU compared with L1210, whereas GST-pi was expressed less in the BCNU-resistant leukemia line. GST-mu was not detected in either L1210 leukemia lines. GSH levels were similar in the two L1210 lines. No significant difference was observed between the two leukemia lines for the conjugative enzymes UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and sulfotransferase, whereas their corresponding hydrolytic enzymes beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase were about two-fold lower in the BCNU-resistant leukemia line. Epoxide hydrolase was 1.3-fold higher in L1210/BCNU compared with L1210 and this level was about three-fold higher than in mouse liver. In conclusion, these studies showed the presence of cytochrome P-450 1A1/1A2 in the two L1210 leukemia lines studied, and indicated noteworthy differences between the two leukemia lines for many enzyme systems such as GST, beta-glucuronidase, sulfatase and epoxide hydrolase.

The purpose of this study was to begin to address whether TG would be more efficacious than MP in the treatment of childhood ALL. Preclinical cytotoxicity studies were performed using human leukemic cell lines and leukemic cells from patients with ALL. First, the concentration-survival curves for MP and TG in three human leukemic cell lines (MOLT-4, CCRF-CEM and Wilson) were determined. The second group of experiments determined the concentration-time dependence for cytotoxicity of MP and TG. The final group of experiments compared the in vitro cytotoxicity of MP to TG in leukemic cells from patients with ALL. The thiopurines displayed classical anti-metabolite cytotoxicity profiles, exhibiting a cytotoxicity threshold concentration and demonstrating an increase in cell kill with prolongation of exposure to the drug. For MP, the cytotoxicity threshold was approximately 1 microM, with maximum cytotoxicity occurring with 10 microM concentrations. For TG, the threshold was only 0.05 microM with maximum cytotoxicity occurring at 0.5 microM. Exposure to MP for more than 8 h was necessary to produce cytotoxicity, whereas exposures as short as 4 h were required for TG. Leukemic cells from children with ALL were also more sensitive to TG than to MP. The median IC50 for TG (20 microM) was significantly lower than that for MP (> or = 206 microM). The data presented here provide a strong rationale for evaluating TG in place of MP in the treatment of childhood ALL. The more direct intracellular activation pathway, higher potency, and shorter duration of drug exposure necessary for cytotoxicity all suggest that TG may have an advantage over MP.","['Adamson, P C', 'Poplack, D G', 'Balis, F M']","['Adamson PC', 'Poplack DG', 'Balis FM']","['Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)90159-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)90159-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Nov;18(11):805-10. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90159-7.,,,['Leuk Res. 1994 Nov;18(11):811-4.

We hypothesized that it is not the FAB classification per se, but the biological behaviour of the blasts as shown by their rate of accumulation that influences the response. We have, therefore, included AML with trilineage dysplasia (AML/TLD) as it represents one extreme of the evolution of MDS to AML. We have analysed the results of intensive chemotherapy in 22 patients (median age 60 years; range 26-77 years) with MDS (14) and AML/TLD (8). Response to treatment was analysed by age, interval from diagnosis to treatment, the number of cytopenias, bone marrow blasts and karyotype. Patients were also divided according to the rate of disease progression, shown by the time from diagnosis to treatment (group A = < 3 months; group B = > 3 months). The overall response rate was 87%; 13 (60%) complete responses (CR) and 6 (27%) partial responses. The rate of disease progression was identified as the most significant predictive factor of achieving CR (p = 0.003) (group A 10/12; group B 3/10). Patients presenting with more than 20% blasts also had a better response (p = 0.031). The combined response rates, however, did not differ significantly between the two groups (group A 92%; group B 80%) as 50% of group B achieved a PR. The failure to normalize blood counts was not related to the number of cytopenias before starting treatment. In all cases, PR was associated with persistence of dysplastic morphology and cytogenetic abnormalities. CR was associated with complete morphological and cytogenetic response except in two patients in group B. Dysplastic morphology re-emerged in patients who achieved CR and of these, all but one acquired a new cytogenetic abnormality. Patients in group B who achieved CR all needed two courses compared with a mean of 1.1 for the other group. The median survival from treatment for both groups was 10 months, however, no patient in group B survived more than 20 months. In comparison 33% in group A were alive at 5 years. The rate of accumulation of blasts predicts the response to chemotherapy and the quality of remissions achieved. Patients with rapidly increasing blasts can achieve complete morphological and cytogenetic remissions, although they eventually have a dysplastic relapse. In contrast, intensive chemotherapy for patients with a slow accumulation of blasts may reduce the blast population but with much less benefit on haemopoiesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hirst, W J', 'Mufti, G J']","['Hirst WJ', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)90158-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)90158-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Nov;18(11):797-804. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90158-9.,,,,,,,,,

Its ability to reduce reperfusion injury was assessed in vivo in a canine lung transplantation model. In 19 dogs, left lung allotransplantation was performed after 100 minutes of warm ischemia. The function of the transplanted lung was assessed after clamping of the contralateral pulmonary artery. In the human thioredoxin group (n = 6), human thioredoxin 30 mg/kg was given to the recipients during reperfusion. In the N-acetylcysteine group (n = 5), N-acetylcysteine 150 mg/kg, known as a radical scavenger, was given in the same manner. In both groups, arterial oxygen tension was significantly higher than in the control group (n = 8). In the human thioredoxin group, peak inspiratory pressure was significantly lower than in the control group. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations showed an almost normal appearance of the lung tissues in the human thioredoxin and N-acetylcysteine groups, in contrast to the abnormal findings in the control group. Thus it would appear that human thioredoxin has a protective effect on transplanted lungs, as does N-acetylcysteine, and that its action may be a radical scavenger effect.","['Yagi, K', 'Liu, C', 'Bando, T', 'Yokomise, H', 'Inui, K', 'Hitomi, S', 'Wada, H']","['Yagi K', 'Liu C', 'Bando T', 'Yokomise H', 'Inui K', 'Hitomi S', 'Wada H']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Chest Disease Research Institute, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Cytokines', 'Dogs', 'Hemodynamics', '*Lung Transplantation/methods/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Reperfusion Injury/physiopathology/*prevention & control']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-5223(94)70191-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1994 Nov;108(5):913-21.,,,,,,,,,

A sensitive, nonradioactive method, less costly and time-consuming than the present molecular biologic techniques, is desirable for direct measurement of P-glycoprotein in tumor cells versus normal cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have devised an immunoalkaline phosphatase method using four antibody layers to amplify the primary signal considerably and refined staining conditions to optimize the 'signal-to-noise' ratio. Immunoalkaline phosphatase is preferred to immunoperoxidase for testing leukemic and tumor cells in bone marrow, because it avoids myeloperoxidase staining in myeloblasts and myeloid progenitors that interferes with P-glycoprotein interpretation. RESULTS: Multilayer immunoalkaline phosphatase detected low levels of P-glycoprotein overexpression, that could not be identified by conventional immunoperoxidase or immunoblot, in a low-resistance (8-fold) cell line with a barely detectable transcript. Our technique also detected increased P-glycoprotein in malignant cells in bone marrow of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (10/11), acute myelogenous leukemia (2/2), lymphoma (1/1), neuroblastoma (7/7), and rhabdomyosarcoma (2/2). Increased P-glycoprotein was not identified at diagnosis in 6 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and two with stage IV and three with stage IVS neuroblastoma that remained relapse-free in the long-term, but was detected in 4 patients with stage IV neuroblastoma and three with rhabdomyosarcoma who ultimately relapsed. CONCLUSIONS: Our new technique is more sensitive than conventional immunoperoxidase and immunoblot for assaying P-glycoprotein in low-resistance cell lines. It may be potentially applicable for detecting low levels of P-glycoprotein overexpression in leukemic and tumor cells in bone marrow. Early identification of low levels of multidrug resistance may be clinically relevant by allowing poor-prognostic patients to receive alternative therapy.","['Haddad, G', 'Thorner, P S', 'Bradley, G', 'Dalton, W S', 'Ling, V', 'Chan, H S']","['Haddad G', 'Thorner PS', 'Bradley G', 'Dalton WS', 'Ling V', 'Chan HS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children.']",['eng'],"['CA-37130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43043/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis/metabolism', '*Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*chemistry/metabolism/*pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1994 Oct;71(4):595-603.,,,,,,,,,

In the average, elevated thrombin generation was found simultaneously to an increase in fibrinogen, cross-linked fibrin degradation products and platelet counts between protocol days 28 to 35. This period thus seems to harbour an increased potential of hypercoagulability which could explain the accumulation of thrombotic complications described by Sutor et al. Moreover, day to day investigations just before and one day after L-asparaginase administration did not show any relevant change in the above named parameters, thus rather indicating a cumulative than a single dose effect of Erwinia L-asparaginase therapy on the coagulation system.

None of them was connected with a lethal outcome. There was no observation of a hemorrhagic infarction. The overall thromboses frequency was 2.1%. In 1.4% patients ""symptomatic"" thrombosis developed close to a continuous venous catheter, which can be considered as a thrombogene risk factor. About 0.6% (2/286) of the patients developed the thrombotic events without another risk factor. They can be regarded as ""idiopathic"". 1/2 idiopathic thromboses led to a life threatening situation. There are two important factors that can enhance thromboses: 1) the therapy period, especially induction therapy and application of asparaginase and 2) a continuous venous catheter.

The increase of enzymes activity correlated with the intensity and kind of hepatocellular damage. Partly the extreme increase of lesion parameters is not the expression of an irreversible cytonecrosis. Beside the ALAT also the GGPT is a sensitive predictor of hepatocellular lesion. The high enzyme activity before the MTX application is a indicator of a preexistent cell damage of the liver.

Treatment for pts with complete resection can be reduced from 3 to 2 therapy courses; 2. Results for pts of stage III with large abdominal tumors can be improved by high dose (HD) chemotherapy; 3. Survival for pts with incomplete initial response can be improved by therapy intensification; 4. Intraventricularly applied CNS chemotherapy can improve the outcome for CNS positive pts. Therapy is stratified into 3 branches. Branch 1: completely resected; branch 2: not resected, extra-abdominal localization only or abdominal localization and LDH < 500 U/l; branch 3: abdominal localization and LDH > or = 500 U/l, and all pts with BM or/and CNS involvement or multifocal bone disease. A 5-day prephase is followed by 2 (R1), 4 (R2), 6 (R3) therapy courses composed of dexamethasone (DEXA), methotrexate (MTX) 5 g/m2/24 h (in branch R1, 500 mg/m2), MTX/Cytarabine (ARA-C)/prednisolone (PRED) i.th., vincristine (not in branch R1), ifosfamide alternating with cyclophosphamide, ARA-C/etoposide (VP16) alternating with doxorubicin. CNS pos. pts receive MTX/ARA-C/PRED applied intraventricularly. Pts with incomplete response after 2 courses receive an intensification (DEXA, Vindesine, HD-ARA-C, VP16, and MTX/ARA-C/PRED i.th.). Pts with viable tumor after the intensified course receive mega-dose chemotherapy with autologous BM rescue (aBMT). From 4/1990 to 12/1992, 228 pts were registered; 212 pts are evaluable for response. The probability of event free survival (pEFS) at 3 years is 89 +/- 2% for the whole group, 97 +/- 3% for pts of branch R1 (n = 32), 99 +/- 1% for patients of branch R2 (n = 87), and 77 +/- 4% for patients of branch R3 (n = 94) (median observation time 21 months). 7 pts of branch R3 died early due to infections. 15 pts failed therapy (one pt each in branch R1, and R2, 13 pts in branch R3). pEFS for pts with stage III abdominal disease and LDH > or = 500 U/l is 80 +/- 6 as compared to 53 +/- 8% in the preceding studies (p < .02). Of 13 evaluable pts with CNS disease 3 died early of infection, however none suffered from relapse. Only 1 of 22 pts of branch R2 who had residual tumors after 2 therapy courses suffered from progress in contrast to 9 of 33 such pts of branch R3. Only 2 pts had viable tumor after the intensification course CC.

BIF study group].,222-33,"One of the goals of the study NHL-BFM 90 was to investigate the distribution and prognosis of the different subtypes of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) in children and adolescents according to histological, cytomorphological and immunological characteristics. From 4/1990 to 12/1992, 346 patients (pts) (84 females, 262 males) were enrolled (median age: 9.1 years; range: 0.8-17.9 years). Histology was available from 290 pts (84%), cytomorphology from 155 (44%), and immunophenotyping from 245 (70%). Cases with L1 oder L2 cytomorphology according to the French-American-British Classification were classified as lymphoblastic lymphoma and those with L3 cytomorphology as Burkitt-Type lymphoma or acute B-cell leukemia (B-ALL) if a histological classification was not available. By means of the combined analysis of all three diagnostic criterias the classification of the NHL according to the updated Kiel-classification was possible in 312 cases: 49% were classified as Burkitt-type-lymphoma (incl. B-ALL), 22% als lymphoblastic lymphoma, 10% as large cell anaplastic lymphoma (LCAL), 6% as centroblastic lymphoma, only few cases were classified as NHL of other subtypes, 3 pts (1%) suffered from low grade malignant lymphomas, and in 34 pts (10%) the NHL was not further classified. Patients were stratified according to NHL-subentities in 3 branches (Non-B-NHL, B-NHL, LCAL) of different treatment modalities. The estimated probability of a 3-year event free survival (pEFS) was 88 +/- 2% for the whole group (follow up 7 to 40 months, median 23 months) while pEFS of different subtypes was: lymphoblastic lymphoma: 91 +/- 4%; Burkitt-type-lymphoma/B-ALL: 90 +/- 2%; centroblastic lymphoma: 94 +/- 6%, LCAL: 88 +/- 6%. We conclude that the stratification of treatment modalities in study NHL-BFM 90 according to biological entities provided patients of different NHL-subtypes an equal chance to survive event free. The efficacy of the treatment strategy for rare subtypes, however, is not evaluable yet.","['Reiter, A', 'Tiemann, M', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Wacker, H H', 'Yakisan, E', 'Schrappe, M', 'Henzler, D', 'Sykora, K W', 'Brandt, A', 'Odenwald, E']","['Reiter A', 'Tiemann M', 'Ludwig WD', 'Wacker HH', 'Yakisan E', 'Schrappe M', 'Henzler D', 'Sykora KW', 'Brandt A', 'Odenwald E', 'et al.']","['Abt.

We evaluated several methods for mRNA estimation to standardize simple and reliable techniques for identifying MDR1 positive leukemia among untreated AMLs in large scale studies. Northern blot detection of MDR1 mRNA suffered from low signal-to-noise ratio under the conventional conditions, that was improved mainly by removing unincorporated radioactivity. The amount of MDR1 transcripts on positive cells was estimated less than 10% of that of constitutive mRNA species. A modified method seemed useful in estimating the total amount of the MDR1 mRNA in a whole leukemic cell population, and suitable to study stock samples or for large prospective clinical trials. RT-PCR was more sensitive in detecting MDR1 mRNA than Northern blot analysis, and the very feature made it virtually impossible to exclude contamination with normal hematopoietic cells. This procedure showed that FAB M3 leukemias were essentially MDR1 negative, and there existed frequently myelodysplastic syndrome subpopulation which had excessive MDR1 transcripts. In situ hybridization of the mRNA with a FITC-labeled phosphorothioate oligonucleotide probe was visualized using flowcytometry or con-focus lightmicroscopy, enabled us to recognize the difference between multidrug resistant K562/ADM and its wild type.","['Sato, H', 'Oonishi, T', 'Wada, C']","['Sato H', 'Oonishi T', 'Wada C']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Kitasato Arch Exp Med,The Kitasato archives of experimental medicine,0376613,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis']",,1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Kitasato Arch Exp Med. 1993 Apr;65 Suppl:25-36.,,,,,,,,,

To prove a role for IL-1, a variety of modalities have been used to block the production and/or activity of IL-1. These include agents which inhibit or reduce 1) IL-1 transcription and/or synthesis, 2) the processing of pro-IL-1 beta into its mature forms, 3) the secretion of IL-1 beta, 4) the activity of IL-1 using neutralizing anti-IL-1 antibodies or 5) soluble (extracellular) IL-1 receptors, 6) the ability of IL-1 to bind to its receptors using receptor blockade, 7) the availability of surface receptors using agents which down-regulate receptor expression or (8) agents which affect IL-1-mediated signal transduction. Some of these modalities have already entered clinical trials. Clearly, the therapeutic advantage of reducing the activity of IL-1 resides in preventing its deleterious biological effects without interfering with host defense and homeostasis. For example, blocking IL-1-induced prostaglandins is one target in treating inflammatory diseases. Drugs inhibiting cyclooxygenase have well-known toxicities because they block the normal physiologic synthesis of prostaglandins in many tissues such as platelets and gastric lining cells. Blocking IL-1, in contrast, reduces only that portion of prostaglandin synthesis due to elevated IL-1, sparing the synthesis of prostaglandins necessary for physiologic homeostasis. A similar case can be made for endogenous nitric oxide. Thus, there is a unique pharmacological advantage to blocking IL-1 in disease.","['Dinarello, C A']",['Dinarello CA'],"['Department of Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine, New England Medical Center Hospital, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],['AI 15614/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Japan,Keio J Med,The Keio journal of medicine,0376354,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)']",IM,,"['Interleukin-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/*etiology']",47,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2302/kjm.43.131 [doi]'],ppublish,Keio J Med. 1994 Sep;43(3):131-6. doi: 10.2302/kjm.43.131.,,,,,,,,,

Hypercalcemia may occasionally lead to death. Unfortunately, many physicians caring for patients with malignant diseases are not aware of this danger. Hypercalcemia is seen in about 15% of patients with solid tumors. This condition is more frequent in some malignant proliferative hematological diseases. In patients with multiple myeloma, the incidence of hypercalcemia is about 20%. The rate of complication by hypercalcemia is as high as 80% in patients with adult T cell leukemia. The symptoms of hypercalcemia include anorexia, easy fatigability, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms are often mistaken for adverse effects of anticancer drugs or as signs of aggravation of malignant disease. If abnormal thirst and polydipsia are noted in patients with malignant disease, a diagnosis of MAHC should always be considered because these two symptoms are highly characteristic of hypercalcemia. Caution should be exercised when CNS symptoms such as unstable emotions or somnolence are noted. These symptoms in patients with MAHC may lead to death, if untreated. The corrected serum calcium level should always be monitored in patients with malignant disease, so that a possible diagnosis of MAHC may not be overlooked when these symptoms appear. MAHC is caused by the bone resorption stimulating factor (BRSF), which is produced and secreted by the tumor cells. BRSF may act systemically to cause increased bone resorption, resulting in hypercalcemia. MAHC occurring in this manner is called the 'humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM)'. BRSF produced by multiple myeloma or bone metastasis enhances bone resorption through local osteolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Eto, S']",['Eto S'],"['1st Depatment of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushi.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

A treatment with high dose Ara-C appeared to be effective for the pain in the legs. The foot drop, however, persisted and peripheral neuropathy progressed even after high dose Ara-C therapy. Peripheral nerve involvement in acute leukemia appears to be rare, and even more so in case of hematologic remission.

We calculated fractional shortening (FS), end-systolic stress-volume index (ESS/ESVI), left ventricular diastolic filing velocity ratio (A/E) and normalized peak rate of diastolic increase in left ventricular internal dimension (dLVDt/dt/LVDt). Before the exercise, we found that dLVDt/dt/LVDt was decreased in the high-dose anthracycline group (anthracycline cumulative dose of 480-570 mg/m2), even though other cardiac function parameters were not different from those in the control. In BEx, the percent change in ESS/ESVI decreased in an anthracycline cumulative dose-dependent fashion. In HGx, ESS/ESVI showed a decreased response only in the high-dose anthracycline group. Therefore, we conclude that: 1) the diastolic function parameter dLVDt/dt/LVDt might show abnormalities prior to other systolic function parameters, 2) the percent change in ESS/ESVI in BEx is the most sensitive parameter studied, and could detect cardiac function abnormalities even in the small-dose anthracycline group (anthracycline cumulative dose of 175 mg/m2), and 3) BEx is more suitable for the early detection of anthracycline cardiotoxicity than HGx.","['Fukazawa, R', 'Ogawa, S', 'Hirayama, T']","['Fukazawa R', 'Ogawa S', 'Hirayama T']","['Nippon Medical School, Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn Circ J,Japanese circulation journal,7806868,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Child', '*Echocardiography', '*Echocardiography, Doppler', '*Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Ventricular Function/drug effects']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1253/jcj.58.625 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn Circ J. 1994 Aug;58(8):625-34. doi: 10.1253/jcj.58.625.,,,,,,,,,

These were examined for virus-induced rearrangements of the c-myc, flvi-2 (bmi-1), fit-1, and pim-1 loci, for T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements, and for the presence of env recombinant FeLV (FeLV-B). The myc locus was most frequently affected in naturally occurring lymphomas (32%; n = 38) either by transduction (21%) or by proviral insertion (11%). Proviral insertions were also common at flvi-2 (24%). The two other loci were occupied in a smaller number of the naturally occurring tumors (fit-1, 8%; pim-1, 5%). Examination of the entire set of tumors showed that significant numbers were affected at two (19%) or three (5%) of the loci. Occupation of the fit-1 locus was observed most frequently in tumors induced by FeLV-myc strains, while flvi-2 insertions occurred with similar frequency in the presence or absence of obvious c-myc activation. These results suggest a hierarchy of mutational events in the genesis of feline T-cell lymphomas by FeLV and implicate insertion at fit-1 as a late progression step. The strongest links observed were with T-cell development, as monitored by rearrangement status of the TCR beta-chain gene, which was positively associated with activation of myc (P < 0.001), and with proviral insertion at flvi-2 (P = 0.02). This analysis also revealed a genetically distinct subset of thymic lymphomas with unrearranged TCR beta-chain genes in which the known target loci were involved very infrequently. The presence of env recombinant FeLV (FeLV-B) showed a negative correlation with proviral insertion at fit-1, possibly due to the rapid onset of these tumors. These results shed further light on the multistep process of FeLV leukemogenesis and the relationships between lymphoid cell maturation and susceptibility to FeLV transformation.","['Tsatsanis, C', 'Fulton, R', 'Nishigaki, K', 'Tsujimoto, H', 'Levy, L', 'Terry, A', 'Spandidos, D', 'Onions, D', 'Neil, J C']","['Tsatsanis C', 'Fulton R', 'Nishigaki K', 'Tsujimoto H', 'Levy L', 'Terry A', 'Spandidos D', 'Onions D', 'Neil JC']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow, Bearsden, Scotland.']",['eng'],['CA-48801/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Exons', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, myc', 'Genome, Viral', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Proviruses', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.12.8296-8303.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Dec;68(12):8296-303. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.12.8296-8303.1994.,PMC237298,"['c-myc', 'env', 'fit-1', 'flvi-2', 'pim-1']",,,,,,,

Treatment of cells with classical NF-kappa B inducers such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, phorbol myristate acetate, and lipopolysaccharide results in MAD3 degradation followed by nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B. On the other hand, the mechanisms involved in the dissociation of the cytoplasmic p105/p100-containing complexes are largely unknown. The Tax protein encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 is a potent activator of viral and cellular gene transcription. It does not bind DNA directly but seems to activate transcription indirectly either by enhancing the activities of the transcription factors that recognize responsive elements located in the promoters of the Tax-responsive genes or by forming ternary complexes with these factors and DNA. It has been previously shown that Tax is able to induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B. We demonstrate here that Tax can induce translocation of members of the NF-kappa B family retained in the cytoplasm through their interaction with either p105 or p100. On the other hand, Tax induces no apparent degradation of MAD3, although experiments using cycloheximide indicate that it decreases the half-life of MAD3. However, this activity is shared by a mutant of Tax which is unable to activate NF-kappa B. These results suggest that Tax activates NF-kappa B essentially through the p105/p100 retention pathway.","['Munoz, E', 'Courtois, G', 'Veschambre, P', 'Jalinot, P', 'Israel, A']","['Munoz E', 'Courtois G', 'Veschambre P', 'Jalinot P', 'Israel A']","[""Unite de Biologie Moleculaire de l'Expression Genique, Institut Pasteur, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Products, tax/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Kidney', 'Mice', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.12.8035-8044.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Dec;68(12):8035-44. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.12.8035-8044.1994.,PMC237267,,,,,,,,

In contrast, those produced from mink Mv-1-Lu and human HOS or TE671 cells are at least partially resistant, with the exception of murine leukemia viruses. In particular, the feline endogenous virus RD114 is completely resistant to a panel of eight human sera when produced from Mv-1-Lu or HOS cells. This differential resistance is controlled by the viral envelope proteins. Virus inactivation can be correlated with the ability of the producer cells to be lysed by human serum.

The same probe detects two tumor-specific mRNA transcripts 2.5 and 10 kb long, both of which are expressed only in tumors carrying a provirus in the Mlvi-4 locus. Sequence analysis of two cDNA clones (LE3a and B1.1) of the 2.5-kb tumor-specific mRNA, obtained from two independent tumors (6889 and B1), revealed that they are both derived from hybrid env/Mlvi-4 mRNA transcripts. The splicing of env to Mlvi-4 sequences linked a cryptic splice donor site at nucleotide position 6397 of the viral genome with a splice acceptor site in the region immediately 3' of the integrated provirus. The mRNA that gives rise to cDNA clone B1.1 terminates 1,005 bases 3' of the splice acceptor site without additional splicing. The mRNA that gives rise to cDNA clone LE3a terminates in the same site but undergoes differential splicing of an 81-base-long intron. The resulting mRNAs contain 247-amino-acid (clone B1.1) or 226-amino-acid (clone LE3a) open reading frames sharing 221 N-terminal amino acids, of which 207 are derived from the viral env gene and 14 are derived from Mlvi-4. RNase protection assays using 6889 tumor cell RNA and a probe derived from the cDNA clone LE3a detected both mRNA transcripts. More abundant of the two, however, was the one encoding the putative 247-amino-acid protein. Transient transfections of a construct expressing the RNA transcript defined by clone B1.1 into D17 cells led to the expression of an Env/Mlvi-4 fusion protein with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa. Given that cells with provirus insertions in the Mlvi-4 locus are selected and that retroviral env gene products may have profound effects in the biology of hematopoietic cells, we suggest that the detected fusion proteins may contribute to the growth of T-cell lymphomas.","['Patriotis, C', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Patriotis C', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']",['eng'],"['CA06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51893/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56110/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '160405-94-7 (Env-Mlvi-4 protein, Moloney murine leukemia virus)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, env/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genes, env', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', '*Viral Proteins', '*Virus Activation']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.12.7927-7932.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Dec;68(12):7927-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.12.7927-7932.1994.,PMC237255,,,,"['GENBANK/S74212', 'GENBANK/S74213']",,,,

In this study, we designed an assay that requires two separate oligonucleotides to be brought together via interactions between integrase promoters to form a ""crossbones"" substrate that mimics the integration intermediate. The crossbones substrate contains two viral DNA ends, each joined to one strand of target DNA and separated by a defined length of target DNA. We showed that purified integrases of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) could mediate a concerted strand cleavage-ligation between the two half-substrates at one or both viral DNA joining sites (trans disintegration). Another major product, termed fold-back, resulted from an intramolecular attack on the phosphodiester bond at the viral-target DNA junction by the 3'-OH group of the same DNA molecule (cis disintegration). The activity of integrase on the crossbones substrate depended on the presence of viral DNA sequences. For trans disintegration, the optimal length of target DNA between the viral DNA joining sites of the crossbones substrate corresponded to the spacing between the staggered joints formed on two opposite strands of target DNA during retroviral DNA integration in vivo. The activity of integrases on crossbones did not require complementary base pairing between the two half-substrates, indicating that the half-substrates were juxtaposed solely through protein-DNA interactions. The crossbones assay, therefore, measures the ability of integrase to juxtapose two viral DNA ends, an activity which heretofore has been difficult to detect by using purified integrase in conventional assays. Certain mutant integrases that were otherwise inactive with the crossbones substrate could complement one another, indicating that no single protomer in the integrase multimer requires a complete set of functional domains either for catalytic activity or for juxtaposition of the two viral DNA ends by the active multimer.","['Chow, S A', 'Brown, P O']","['Chow SA', 'Brown PO']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305-5428.']",['eng'],['AI27205/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'DNA Polymerase I/metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli', 'HIV-1/*enzymology/genetics', 'Integrases', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology/genetics', 'Models, Structural', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Integration']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.12.7869-7878.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Dec;68(12):7869-78. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.12.7869-7878.1994.,PMC237249,,,,,,,,

Besides donor cleavage and integration, IN can also perform ""intermolecular disintegration,"" which has been described as the reversal of the integration reaction. We found that this reaction is independent of viral DNA sequences.

In this report, we present evidence that the vast majority (> 90%) of the IL-2-independent lines established from polytropic or xenotropic virus-infected 4437A cells carry provirus insertions in the 3' untranslated region of the IL-9 receptor gene (Gfi-2 [for growth factor independence-2]/IL-9R). Prior to superinfection, the cells express neither IL-9 nor IL-9R. Following superinfection and provirus insertion in the Gfi-2/IL-9R locus, the cells express high levels of mRNA transcripts with a truncated 3' untranslated region which are predicted to encode the normal IL-9R protein product. The same IL-2-independent cells also express IL-9 which is induced by an insertional mutagenesis-independent mechanism. The establishment of an IL-9-dependent autocrine loop was sufficient to render the cells IL-2 independent, as suggested by the finding that 4437A cells, expressing a stably transfected Gfi-2/IL-9R construct, do not require IL-2 when maintained in IL-9-containing media. Additional experiments designed on the basis of these results showed that IL-9 gene expression is induced rapidly following the infection of 4437A cells by polytropic or xenotropic viruses and occurs in the absence of selection for IL-2-independent growth. Taken together, these data suggest that infection of 4437A cells by mink cell focus-forming or xenotropic viruses induces the expression of IL-9, which in turn rapidly selects the cells expressing the IL-9 receptor through an insertional mutagenesis-dependent mechanism. Given that both the polytropic and xenotropic viruses can induce the IL-9-dependent autocrine loop, the reduced ability of the xenotropic viruses to rapidly induce IL-2 independence in culture and tumors in animals is likely to be the result of their lower growth rates.","['Flubacher, M M', 'Bear, S E', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Flubacher MM', 'Bear SE', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']",['eng'],"['CA06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA56110/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*pharmacology/*physiology', 'Liver/immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Proviruses/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.68.12.7709-7716.1994 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Dec;68(12):7709-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.12.7709-7716.1994.,PMC237232,,,,"['GENBANK/L36459', 'GENBANK/L36460', 'GENBANK/L36597', 'GENBANK/L36598', 'GENBANK/L36599', 'GENBANK/L36600']",,,,

Furthermore, we have cloned and functionally characterized a unique form of the amphotropic receptor homolog expressed in E36 hamster cells.

At pH 1.2, 1 undergoes a rapid breakdown (t1/2 = 1.4 days) of the two P-N bonds, giving compounds 2 [HN(CH2CH2Cl)2] and 3 [H2N(CH2)3OP(O)(OH)2] as hydrochlorides. No intermediates were detected. At pH's between 5.4 and 8.6, hydrolysis of 1 during 17 days leads to the sole and previously unknown nine-membered ring compound 13. 13 results from the intramolecular alkylation of 1 giving the bicyclic compound 7 followed by the exothermal hydrolytic breakdown of the P-N bond of its six-membered ring. At pH 2.2 and 3.4, the two hydrolytic pathways coexist since, beside compounds 2 and 3, the hydrochloride of compound 9 [Cl(CH2)2NH(CH2)2NH(CH2)3OP(O)(OH)2] is formed, resulting from the acid-catalyzed breakdown of the P-N bond in the nine-membered ring compound 13. At pH 2.2, the presence of chloride ion affected neither the stability of 1 nor the contribution of the two competing hydrolytic pathways. At pH's ranging from 3.4 to 8.6, there is little degradation of 1 since more than 95% of initial 1 was still present after 7 days at 20 degrees C. Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C) after 6 days, 45% of 1 is hydrolyzed (t1/2 = 6.6 days), leading essentially (30% of initial 1) to the nine-membered ring compound 13. The rate of hydrolysis of 13 and the nature of its hydrolysis products were found to depend on pH over the range 0-8.6. After a single ip injection to mice, compounds 3, 9, and 13 were less toxic than 1.

The compound was designed to enter cells by passive diffusion and to revert to FdUMP after removal of the PIV groups by hydrolytic enzymes. The most convenient preparation of PIV2FdUMP was by condensation of 2'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (FUdR) with PIV2 phosphate in the presence of triphenylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate (the Mitsunobo reagent). PIV2FdUMP was stable in the pH range 1.0-4.0 (t1/2 > 100 h). It was also fairly stable at pH 7.4 (t1/2 = 40.2 h). In 0.05 M NaOH solution, however, it was rapidly degraded (t1/2 < 2 min). In the presence of hog liver carboxylate esterases, PIV2FdUMP was converted quantitatively to the mono-[(pivaloyloxy)methyl] [PIV1] analogue PIV1FdUMP. After a 24 h incubation, only trace amounts of FdUMP (1-3%) were observed, indicating that PIV1FdUMP is a poor substrate for carboxylate esterases. In mouse plasma, PIV2FdUMP was rapidly metabolized, first to PIV1FdUMP and then to FdUMP. With continued incubation, FUdR was formed, presumably due to further catabolism of FdUMP by plasma phosphatases or 5'-nucleotidases. Since PIV1FdUMP is a poor substrate for carboxylate esterase, the cleavage of the second PIV group is most likely mediated by plasma phosphodiesterases. The rate of degradation of PIV2FdUMP in the presence of acid and alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, or spleen phosphodiesterase was the same as that in buffer controls, indicating that the compound is not a substrate for these nucleotide catabolizing enzymes. The concentration of PIV2FdUMP and its 3'-O-acetyl ester (PIV2 3'-O-Ac-FdUMP) required to inhibit the growth of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in vitro to less than 50 cells per colony was 5 x 10(-6) M, the same as that required for 5-fluorouracil (FU). Both nucleotide prodrugs showed the same growth-inhibitory potency against a mutant CHO cell line that was 20-fold resistant to FU (CHO/FU). Administered intraperitoneally at optimal dosage for 5 consecutive days, PIV2FdUMP and PIV2 3'-O-Ac-FdUMP were as effective as FU at prolonging the life spans of mice bearing intraperitoneally implanted P388 leukemia. Both prodrugs retained full therapeutic activity against a P388 subline resistant to FU. Collectively, these data indicate that PIV2FdUMP and PIV2 3'-O-Ac-FdUMP are effective membrane-permeable prodrugs of FdUMP.","['Farquhar, D', 'Khan, S', 'Srivastva, D N', 'Saunders, P P']","['Farquhar D', 'Khan S', 'Srivastva DN', 'Saunders PP']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.

METHODS: Retrospective study including 9 patients with aspergillus discitis, in which 7 were immunosuppressed; 3 were heart transplant patients, 2 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 hairy cell leukemia and one was receiving prednisone for bronchial asthma. Four patients had isolated spinal aspergillosis infection. In 4 cases, disc space infection occurred after pulmonary aspergillosis. In the last case the spondylodiscitis occurred after aspergillus endocarditis and mycotic limb embolism. In all cases a percutaneous needle biopsy of the intervertebral disc was performed; the subsequent culture produced Aspergillus fumigatus in 8 cases and Aspergillus flavus in 1. Itraconazole was given to all patients (mean dose: 350 mg/day); it was given alone in 2 cases, in addition to 5 flucytosine and amphotericin B in 6 cases, and in addition to amphotericin B in the last case. RESULTS: Improvement was obtained in the 9 cases, with full recovery in the absence of any surgical debridement after a mean treatment duration of 5.5 months and a mean followup delay of 16 months. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of aspergillus spondylodiscitis in immunocompromised hosts is important. Itraconazole alone or in combination is an effective therapy.

Growth inhibition and control of infection were found to be associated with high intracellular levels of inducible p72 heat shock protein (HSP70). Pluripotent K562 cells produced higher HSP70 base-line levels than promyelocytic HL60 or monoblastoid U937 cells. Treatment with PGA1 and especially with PGJ2 enhanced the synthesis of HSP70 in all these cells. Notably, HSP70 accumulated in virus-exposed U937 cells (but not in K562 or HL60 cells). Because in lethally irradiated virus-donor cells HSP70 production was barely detectable, expression of this protein in cocultured U937 cells can be prevalently attributed to virus-recipient cells. Treatment with PGA1 and even more with PGJ2 remarkably enhanced the synthesis of HSP70 in virus-exposed U937 cells, thus resulting in persistently high levels of HSP70 protein in the cells. As shown previously, in U937 cells treatment with PGs was associated with reduced percentages of virus p19gag positive cells and enhanced specific lysis of virus-donor cells at early time points after cell-to-cell transmission. Because the HSP70 protein family is involved in the control of cell proliferation as well as in antigen processing function during the immune response to pathogens, it is possible that persistent high expression levels of HSP70 in PG-treated cells play a critical role in regulating both cell cycling and antiviral cellular responses.","['Lacal, P M', 'Amici, C', 'Bonmassar, E', ""D'Onofrio, C""]","['Lacal PM', 'Amici C', 'Bonmassar E', ""D'Onofrio C""]","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Prostaglandins A)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'VYR271N44P (prostaglandin A1)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins A/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1994 Nov;271(2):1096-102.,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to HTLV-I delayed the growth rate of recipient cells, especially in U937 cells. This effect was related to the phase of cell cycle when cells were exposed to HTLV-I. Treatment of control and virus-exposed cells with these PGs, both inducing growth arrest prevalently at the G1/S interphase of the cell cycle, inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent way. The antiproliferative effect of both PGs increased progressively from pluripotent K562 to promyelocytic HL60 and monoblastoid U937 cells, suggesting that differentiated cells were more susceptible to PG-mediated inhibition of growth than pluripotent cells. PG treatment influenced the permissivity of recipient cells to HTLV-I, with different effects on less differentiated myeloid cells in comparison with more differentiated monoblastoid cells. In fact, the percentage of cells positive for the p19gag protein was increased among PG-treated K562 or HL60 cells, although it was reduced in PG-treated U937 cells. To this respect, PGA1 was more effective on asynchronous and PGJ2 on synchronous U937 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lacal, P M', 'Puglianiello, A', 'Bonmassar, E', ""D'Onofrio, C""]","['Lacal PM', 'Puglianiello A', 'Bonmassar E', ""D'Onofrio C""]","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Prostaglandins A)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'VYR271N44P (prostaglandin A1)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins A/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1994 Nov;271(2):1086-95.,,,,,,,,,

The full length TXR complementary DNA (cDNA) was cloned from a platelet-like cell line. It was expressed and its pharmacology was characterized. Northern analysis of TXR transcripts in multiple tissues showed strong hybridization to K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia messenger RNA. Therefore, a K562 cDNA library was screened and a full-length TXR cDNA (K562TXR) was isolated. K562TXR encodes a protein identical to the previously characterized placenta TXR cDNA, except for a single amino acid substitution (Glu21-->Lys).

The efficacy of differentiation therapy could be improved and extended to other forms of leukemia by associating retinoids with other differentiating agents. Here we have compared the effects of different combinations of retinoids with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) analogs on myelomonocytic cell lines HL-60, U937 and THP-1. All-trans RA, its natural isomer 9-cis RA and the arotinoid TTNPB, which differ by their respective specificities for the RA receptor families (retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor), were found to cooperate with VD3 in inhibiting cell growth of the leukemic cell lines. Although the three cell lines displayed different susceptibilities to retinoids, each molecule was able to cooperate with VD3 in inducing U937 cell differentiation. Because the effects of VD3 on calcium metabolism limit its therapeutic use, we studied the effects of two synthetic analogs, MC903 and KH1060. Both agents cooperate with RA, acting more efficiently than the natural molecule in inhibiting cell growth and inducing some parameters of U937 cell differentiation. These results extend our previous data demonstrating that RA and VD3 exert synergistic effects on the differentiation of the myelomonocytic cell line U937. They demonstrate that combinations of agents able to inhibit leukemia cell growth with limited side effects may be found among a wide array of retinoids and vitamin D3 analogs.","['Defacque, H', 'Dornand, J', 'Commes, T', 'Cabane, S', 'Sevilla, C', 'Marti, J']","['Defacque H', 'Dornand J', 'Commes T', 'Cabane S', 'Sevilla C', 'Marti J']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U65, Universite Montpellier II, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '131875-08-6 (KH 1060)', '143NQ3779B (calcipotriene)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,,"['Calcitriol/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1994 Oct;271(1):193-9.,,,,,,,,,

Recommendations for the use of hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors: evidence-based, clinical practice guidelines.",2471-508,"PURPOSE: Standard practice in protecting against chemotherapy-associated infection has been chemotherapy dose modification or dose delay, administration of progenitor-cell support, or selective use of prophylactic antibiotics. Therapy of chemotherapy-associated neutropenic fever or infection has customarily involved treatment with intravenous antibiotics, usually accompanied by hospitalization. The hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) have been introduced into clinical practice as additional supportive measures that can reduce the likelihood of neutropenic complications due to chemotherapy. Clinical benefit has been shown, but the high cost of CSFs has led to concern about their appropriate use. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) wishes to establish evidence-based, clinical practice guidelines for the use of CSFs in patients who are not enrolled on clinical trials. METHODS: An expert multidisciplinary panel reviewed the clinical data documenting the activity of CSFs. For each common clinical situation, the Panel formulated a guideline to encourage reasonable use of CSFs to preserve effectiveness but discourage excess use when little marginal benefit is anticipated. Consensus was reached after critically appraising the available evidence. Guidelines were validated by comparing them with recommendations for CSF use developed in other countries and by several academic institutions. Outcomes considered in evaluating CSF benefit included duration of neutropenia, incidence of febrile neutropenia, incidence and duration of antibiotic use, frequency and duration of hospitalization, infectious mortality, chemotherapy dose-intensity, chemotherapy efficacy, quality of life, CSF toxicity, and economic impact. To the extent that these data were available, the Panel placed greatest value on survival benefit, reduction in rates of febrile neutropenia, decreased hospitalization, and reduced costs. Lesser value was placed on alterations in absolute neutrophil counts (ANC). CONCLUSIONS: CSFs are recommended in some situations, eg, to reduce the likelihood of febrile neutropenia when the expected incidence is > or = 40%; after documented febrile neutropenia in a prior chemotherapy cycle to avoid infectious complications and maintain dose-intensity in subsequent treatment cycles when chemotherapy dose-reduction is not appropriate; and after high-dose chemotherapy with autologous progenitor-cell transplantation. CSFs are also effective in the mobilization of peripheral-blood progenitor cells. Therapeutic initiation of CSFs in addition to antibiotics at the onset of febrile neutropenia should be reserved for patients at high risk for septic complications. CSF use in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes may be reasonable if they are experiencing neutropenic infections. Administration of CSFs after initial chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia does not appear to be detrimental, but clinical benefit has been variable and caution is advised. Available data support use of CSFs in pediatric cancer patients similar to that recommended for adult patients. Outside of clinical trials, CSFs should not be used concurrently with chemotherapy and radiation, or to support increasing chemotherapy dose-intensity. Further research is warranted as a means to improve the cost-effective administration of the CSFs and identify clinical predictors of infectious complications that may direct their use.",,,,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Guideline', 'Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', '*Medical Oncology', 'Neoplasms/therapy', '*Societies, Medical', 'United States']",256,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.11.2471 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Nov;12(11):2471-508. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.11.2471.,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 591 assessable children with AML entered Childrens Cancer Group (CCG) trial 213 between January 1986 and February 1989. The status of patients as of September 1, 1992 forms the basis of this report. The results were compared with previous AML studies. RESULTS: The projected survival rate of all patients at 5 years is 39% (event-free survival [EFS] rate, 31%), which is superior to that of the prior CCG study (P = .01). The induction rate was 79% for 7 + 3 and 76% for the five-drug regimen (not significant). Comparisons of BMT to chemotherapy favored BMT, but these differences do not always reach statistical significance (eg, 5-year disease-free survival [DFS] rate, 46% v 38% [P = .06] with donor available and 54% v 37% [P = .002] if treated according to protocol intent). No benefit for maintenance therapy was found and, in some comparisons, it was inferior to discontinuation of therapy (5-year survival rate, 46% v 68%, P < .01). CONCLUSION: The 5-year EFS rate of patients with AML is 31% and has improved. The five-drug induction regimen is no better than standard induction, BMT appears superior to chemotherapy, and maintenance therapy was not beneficial.","['Wells, R J', 'Woods, W G', 'Buckley, J D', 'Odom, L F', 'Benjamin, D', 'Bernstein, I', 'Betcher, D', 'Feig, S', 'Kim, T', 'Ruymann, F']","['Wells RJ', 'Woods WG', 'Buckley JD', 'Odom LF', 'Benjamin D', 'Bernstein I', 'Betcher D', 'Feig S', 'Kim T', 'Ruymann F', 'et al.']","[""Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.11.2367 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Nov;12(11):2367-77. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.11.2367.,,,,,,,,,

Since there was no evidence of extensive direct viral infection of the neocortical neurons or glia at the ultrastructural level, we hypothesize that neocortical damage may be an indirect effect of subcortical retroviral infection.","['Nagra, R M', 'Masliah, E', 'Burrola, P G', 'Wiley, C A']","['Nagra RM', 'Masliah E', 'Burrola PG', 'Wiley CA']","['Brain Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],"['AG-08201/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-25178/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-27417/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2985192R,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cerebral Cortex/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Dendrites/ultrastructure', 'Encephalitis/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Retroviridae', 'Retroviridae Infections/*pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005072-199411000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 1994 Nov;53(6):572-81. doi: 10.1097/00005072-199411000-00004.,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of transcription by methylation of all CpG methylation sites using SssI methylase was much more pronounced (50- to 80-fold). As partial methylation of the LTR showed, methylation of the promoter region was responsible for most of the effect. Whereas cellular stimulation by a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and Tax was able to reverse the HpaII methylation effect, the inhibition by SssI methylation was not suppressible under these conditions.

Therefore, specific inhibitors of IL-6 may have clinical applications. We previously succeeded in developing receptor antagonists of IL-6 that antagonized wild-type IL-6 activity on the human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cell line CESS and the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. However, these proteins still had agonistic activity on the human myeloma cell line XG-1. We here report the construction of a novel mutant protein of IL-6 in which two different mutations are combined that individually disrupt the association of the IL-6/IL-6 receptor (R) alpha complex with the signaltransducing ""beta"" chain, gp130, but leave the binding of IL-6 to IL-6R alpha intact. The resulting mutant protein (with substitutions of residues Gln160 to Glu, Thr163 to Pro, and replacement of human residues Lys42-Ala57 with the corresponding residues of mouse IL-6) was inactive on XG-1 cells and weakly antagonized wild-type IL-6 activity on these cells. By introducing two additional substitutions (Phe171Leu, Ser177Arg), the affinity of the mutant protein for IL-6R alpha was increased fivefold, rendering it capable of completely inhibiting wild-type IL-6 activity on XG-1 cells. Moreover, this mutant also antagonized the activity of IL-6, but not that of leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, or GM-CSF on the human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1, demonstrating its specificity for IL-6. These data demonstrate the feasibility of developing specific IL-6R antagonists. The availability of such antagonists may offer an approach to specifically inhibit IL-6 activity in vivo.","['de Hon, F D', 'Ehlers, M', 'Rose-John, S', 'Ebeling, S B', 'Bos, H K', 'Aarden, L A', 'Brakenhoff, J P']","['de Hon FD', 'Ehlers M', 'Rose-John S', 'Ebeling SB', 'Bos HK', 'Aarden LA', 'Brakenhoff JP']","['Department of Autoimmune Diseases, Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA Primers', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/pathology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.180.6.2395 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Dec 1;180(6):2395-400. doi: 10.1084/jem.180.6.2395.,PMC2191796,,,,,,,,

Herein we report the effect of IL-10 pretreatment on antigen presentation to tumor- and allo-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Prior incubation of human melanoma cells with recombinant IL-10 (rIL-10) for 48-72 h resulted in a dose-dependent, up to 100% inhibition, of autologous CTL-mediated, HLA-A2.1-restricted, tumor-specific lysis. Allo-specific CTL cytotoxicity against Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) was also inhibited, demonstrating a protective effect also on lymphoid cells. In contrast, IL-10 pretreatment of allogeneic LCL or K562 targets had either no effect or slightly enhanced cytotoxic activity mediated by freshly isolated or IL-2-activated natural killer cells. Flow cytometric analysis with monoclonal antibodies against HLA-A2, or nonpolymorphic determinants of MHC class I proteins, revealed a 20-50% reduction in cell-surface expression, whereas intercellular adhesion molecules 1, and 2, and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 levels were not affected. In addition, relative to untreated target cells, IL-10 pretreated tumor cells were unaltered in their capacity to affect CTL-mediated lysis by cold target inhibition, demonstrating that the effect of IL-10 is unrelated to the initial binding of CTL to their targets. These results are compatible with an effect of IL-10 on the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway, and suggest a novel mechanism of immune tolerance, based on escape from CTL-mediated tumor and allo-transplant rejection.","['Matsuda, M', 'Salazar, F', 'Petersson, M', 'Masucci, G', 'Hansson, J', 'Pisa, P', 'Zhang, Q J', 'Masucci, M G', 'Kiessling, R']","['Matsuda M', 'Salazar F', 'Petersson M', 'Masucci G', 'Hansson J', 'Pisa P', 'Zhang QJ', 'Masucci MG', 'Kiessling R']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (ICAM2 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, CD', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-10/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Melanoma/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.180.6.2371 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Dec 1;180(6):2371-6. doi: 10.1084/jem.180.6.2371.,PMC2191780,,,,,,,,

However, pristane also induces plasmacytomas and an erosive arthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis in BALB/c mice, probably as a consequence of enhanced interleukin 6 production. We report here that the production of autoantibodies characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a further consequence of injecting pristane in BALB/c mice. Anti-Su antibodies appeared as early as 1-2 mo after a single injection of 0.5 ml pristane, followed by anti-U1RNP and anti-Sm antibodies after 2-4 mo. Within 6 mo of pristane injection, 9 of 11 BALB/c mice had developed anti-Su, anti-U1RNP, anti-U2RNP, anti-Sm, and possibly anti-U5RNP antibodies. Autoantibodies were not produced by 20 BALB/c mice of the same age and sex that were not injected with pristane. Thus, autoantibodies characteristic of lupus were induced in mice that are not usually considered to be genetically susceptible to the disease. The induction of autoantibodies associated with SLE by pristane may be relevant to understanding the role of abnormal cytokine production in autoantibody production and the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. Furthermore, the induction of high titer autoantibodies by pristane dictates caution in the use of ascitic fluid as a source of monoclonal antibodies, since the polyclonal antibodies induced by pristane may copurify with the monoclonal antibody secreted by an injected hybridoma.","['Satoh, M', 'Reeves, W H']","['Satoh M', 'Reeves WH']","['Department of Medicine and Microbiology/Immunology, Thurston Arthritis Research Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['P50-ARA42573/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P60-AR30701/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AR40391/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U1 Small Nuclear)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U5 Small Nuclear)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '0 (Terpenes)', '26HZV48DT1 (pristane)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Formation/drug effects', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Autoantibodies/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*immunology', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U1 Small Nuclear/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U5 Small Nuclear/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.180.6.2341 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Dec 1;180(6):2341-6. doi: 10.1084/jem.180.6.2341.,PMC2191761,,,,,,,,

Dissection of the human and mouse c-fms proximal promoters revealed opposing roles for nuclear protooncogenes in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. On the one hand, c-ets-1, c-ets-2, and the macrophage-specific factor PU.1, but not the ets-factor PEA3, trans-activated the c-fms proximal promoter. On the other hand c-myb repressed proximal promoter activity in macrophages and blocked the action of c-ets-1 and c-ets-2. Basal c-fms promoter activity was almost undetectable in the M1 leukaemia line, which expressed high levels of c-myb, but was activated as cells differentiated in response to leukemia inhibitory factor and expressed c-fms mRNA. The repressor function of c-myb depended on the COOH-terminal domain of the protein.

Initial studies revealed that two inhibitors of serine proteases, N-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone and carbobenzoxy-Ala-Ala-borophe (DK120), suppressed tumor necrosis factor or ultraviolet (UV) light-induced DNA fragmentation in the U937 histiocytic lymphoma as well as UV light-induced DNA fragmentation in the BT-20 breast carcinoma, HL-60 myelocytic leukemia, and 3T3 fibroblasts. The protease was purified by affinity chromatography with DK120 as ligand and showed high activity on a synthetic substrate preferred by elastase-like enzymes (Ala-Ala-Pro-Val p-nitroanilide), but was inactive on the trypsin substrate, N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester, or the chymotrypsin substrate, Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-nitroanilide. The activity of the DK120-binding protease purified from U937 cells undergoing apoptosis was increased approximately 10-fold over that recovered from normal cells. Further purification to homogeneity by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography revealed a single band of 24 kD on a silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate gel. In addition to protease activity, the purified enzyme induced DNA fragmentation into multiples of 180 basepairs in isolated U937 nuclei. These findings suggest the 24-kD protease is a novel enzyme that activates DNA fragmentation in U937 cells undergoing apoptosis.","['Wright, S C', 'Wei, Q S', 'Zhong, J', 'Zheng, H', 'Kinder, D H', 'Larrick, J W']","['Wright SC', 'Wei QS', 'Zhong J', 'Zheng H', 'Kinder DH', 'Larrick JW']","['Palo Alto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Mountain View, California 94043.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.180.6.2113 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Dec 1;180(6):2113-23. doi: 10.1084/jem.180.6.2113.,PMC2191773,,,,,,,,

It is potentially useful for accelerating and enhancing haemopoietic recovery and neutrophil function. RESULTS: In acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) the dependence of blast cells on GM-CSF and its role in the development and maintenance of leukaemia are still poorly defined. In vitro exposure of fresh leukaemic blast cells to a wide range of concentrations of GM-CSF leads to a stimulation of cell proliferation in the majority of cases but does not induce any detectable maturation. CONCLUSIONS: Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor may be used in the management of ANLL and the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with the aim of: (i) accelerating the recovery of normal haemopoiesis; (ii) increasing cell killing by chemotherapy; and (iii) inducing cell maturation.

If clusters are real, then they are likely to be close to a determining hazard. DESIGN: Cluster postcode loci and partially matched control postcodes were compared in terms of distances to railways, main roads, churches, surface water, woodland areas, and railside industrial installations. Further supporting comparisons between non-clustered cases and random postcode controls with those map features representable as single grid points were made. SETTING: England, Wales, and Scotland 1966-83. SUBJECTS: Grid referenced registrations of 9406 childhood leukaemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including 264 pairs (or more) separated by < 150 m, and grid references of random postcodes in equal numbers. MAIN RESULTS: The 264 clusters showed relative proximities (or the inverse) to several map features, of which the most powerful was an association with railways. The non-railway associations seemed to be statistically indirect. Some railside industrial installations, identified from a railway atlas, also showed relative proximities to leukaemia clusters, as well as to non-clustered cases, but did not ""explain"" the railway effect. These installations, with seemingly independent geographical associations, included oil refineries, petrochemical plants, oil storage and oil distribution depots, power stations, and steelworks. CONCLUSIONS: The previously shown childhood leukaemia clusters are confirmed to be non-random through their systematic associations with certain map features when compared with the control locations.

DESIGN: The Central Statistics Office of Ireland provided computer analysis of all deaths coded as cancer of the brain, ICD 191, and of lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers, ICD codes 200-208, by socioeconomic, sex, and age groups, from 1971 to 1987. The deaths were then analysed by socioeconomic group and compared with the expected number of deaths in the general population. SETTING: A cluster of four deaths from primary brain cancer, three from leukaemia, and one from Hodgkin's disease, occurred in the research and technical staff of the former Agricultural Institute of the Republic of Ireland in men under the age of 65. This raised the question, were farmers more likely to get these forms of cancer due to exposure to herbicides or fertilisers? SUBJECTS: All deaths in the Republic of Ireland from 1971 to 1987 by socioeconomic group. MAIN RESULTS: Although deaths reported as due to primary brain cancers had increased in all socioeconomic groups in the two time periods studied, there was no greater increase in farmers and a smaller increase in other agricultural workers and fishermen. Deaths from Hodgkin's disease and multiple myeloma, and to a smaller extent from leukaemia, had also increased. The increase in reported mortality of these haematopoietic cancers in farmers was no greater and in other agricultural workers it was less than in the general population. CONCLUSION: There was no evidence that farmers had any greater increase in mortality from these cancers than the general population. The cluster of brain and haematopoietic cancers in research and technical staff at the Agricultural Institute of the Republic of Ireland does not reflect a high risk of these cancers among the general farming population, but strongly supports the need for a compilation of a register of causes of death of laboratory workers in a number of countries.","['Dean, G']",['Dean G'],"['Medico-Social Research Board of Ireland, Ballsbridge, Dublin.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*mortality"", 'Brain Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ireland/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/etiology/*mortality', 'Lymphoma/etiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/etiology/*mortality', 'Sex Distribution', 'Social Class']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.48.4.364 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1994 Aug;48(4):364-8. doi: 10.1136/jech.48.4.364.,PMC1059985,,,,,,,,

This signaling and secretion is also dependent on the organization of the cytoskeleton. Here we report that the aggregation of Fc epsilon RI on rat basophilic leukemia cells results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein, paxillin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is a relatively late event after Fc epsilon RI aggregation. Both the direct increase in intracellular Ca2+ with calcium ionophore and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with PMA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. The optimal tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin by Fc epsilon RI aggregation required PKC and extracellular Ca2+. However, there was also Fc epsilon RI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin independent of Ca2+ influx or PKC activation. By fluorescent microscopy, cell stimulation induced a redistribution of paxillin toward the periphery of the cells. Although Fc epsilon RI aggregation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in nonadherent cells, adherence markedly enhanced this phosphorylation. Together, the data suggest a role for paxillin in Fc epsilon RI signaling.","['Hamawy, M M', 'Swaim, W D', 'Minoguchi, K', 'de Feijter, A W', 'Mergenhagen, S E', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Hamawy MM', 'Swaim WD', 'Minoguchi K', 'de Feijter AW', 'Mergenhagen SE', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Pxn protein, rat)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Paxillin', 'Phosphoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor Aggregation/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgE/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Nov 15;153(10):4655-62.,,,,,,,,,

While some of the endogenous retroviruses were found in all of the SAM strains, others were found to be distributed uniquely, indicating their potential usefulness as genetic markers in the analysis of strain-specific phenotypes, and possibly of the phenomenon of accelerated senescence itself.","['Kitado, H', 'Higuchi, K', 'Takeda, T']","['Kitado H', 'Higuchi K', 'Takeda T']","['Procter & Gamble Company, Corporate Research Division, Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Gerontol,Journal of gerontology,0374762,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,,"['Aging/*genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genes, Viral/genetics', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Genome, Viral', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A/genetics', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/genetics', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics/physiology', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Proviruses/*genetics']",,1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/geronj/49.6.b247 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gerontol. 1994 Nov;49(6):B247-54. doi: 10.1093/geronj/49.6.b247.,,,['J Gerontol. 1994 Nov;49(6):B245-6.

It is for this reason that the concept of care by parents has evolved. Although such a philosophy is beneficial for the child, it has undoubtedly evolved due to low staffing levels, and in such an environment the guidelines for safe practice are easily called into question. In the wake of a new paediatric oncology ward, it was decided to consider instituting care by parents. In an effort to do this in a structured way, it was decided to make our practice research based. A teaching tool was formulated and five mothers who presented consecutively to the paediatric oncology ward were taught how to administer intravenous antibiotics to their child. Mothers' views on the teaching programme were sought using taped interviews, and the data were analysed using grounded theory. This methodology allowed a theoretical framework based on realistic data to emerge, and the resultant themes provided a valuable insight into mothers' views on the subject. It emerged that nurses' attitudes towards care by parents require clarifying and that changes need to take place if this concept is to be taken on board. Negotiation to allow mutual understanding between parents and nurses is essential to the successful implementation of such a scheme.","['Evans, M A']",['Evans MA'],"['Department of Nursing Studies, University of Southampton, General Hospital, England.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Adv Nurs,Journal of advanced nursing,7609811,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Child', 'Clinical Nursing Research', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous/nursing', 'Mothers/education/psychology', 'Nursing Staff, Hospital/psychology', '*Parents/education', '*Pediatric Nursing', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/nursing', 'Professional-Family Relations', 'Social Support']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2648.1994.tb02384.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Adv Nurs. 1994 Sep;20(3):477-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2648.1994.tb02384.x.,,,,,,,,,

These lesions have clinical features in common, in addition to shared histologic attributes. These include similarity in dermal distribution and growth pattern, nuclear characteristics, propensity to recruit other inflammatory cell types, and production of matrical sclerosis. In order to determine if immunohistology could contribute to differential diagnosis in this setting, we analyzed 15 cases of mucocutaneous GS, and compared them with 11 cases of well-documented PTCL. Antibodies in the CD15, CD20, CD34, CD43, CD45, CD45RO, and CD68 groups were used, as well as anti-myeloperoxidase (anti-MPX), anti-lysozyme (anti-LYSO), Mac387, and MB2. Anti-LYSO and anti-MPX were sensitive and specific markers of GS, labeling 93% and 80% of GS cases, respectively, and no cases of PTCL. Anti-CD15 and MB2 were also specific for GS, but each labeled only 60% of GS cases. CD34, CD68, and Mac 387 were specific but insensitive markers of GS. CD43 and CD45 were not particularly useful discriminants, with each being seen in 93% of GS cases, but also 64% and 100% of cases of PTCL, respectively. CD45RO was specific for PTCL; it was present in 82% of PTCL cases and no GS cases. Thus, conjoint reactivity for CD43, CD45, MPX, and LYSO characterizes GS, and differs from the pattern of PTCL, which is characterized by reactivity for CD45 and CD45RO, occasional reactivity for CD43, and lack of other specified markers.","['Ritter, J H', 'Goldstein, N S', 'Argenyi, Z', 'Wick, M R']","['Ritter JH', 'Goldstein NS', 'Argenyi Z', 'Wick MR']","['Division of Surgical Pathology, Barnes Hospital, Washington University Medical Center, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/chemistry/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology']",,1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0560.1994.tb00262.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 1994 Jun;21(3):207-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.1994.tb00262.x.,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cytoplasmic staining was carried out in samples from 40 cases of acute leukaemia with monoclonal antibodies against the myeloid antigen CD13, the lymphoid antigens CD3, CD22, mu chain and the enzymes terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilised with Tween 20 and Becton Dickinson's FACS lysing solution. Flow cytometry results were compared in the same cases with immunocytochemistry results using the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase method. RESULTS: The gentle permeabilisation induced by this method permitted preservation of the membrane antigens and the size and morphology of the cells. The results using flow cytometry were comparable with those obtained using immunocytochemistry, with nearly complete concordance in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: This technique is simple, rapid, sensitive and reproducible and it is suitable for double staining procedures, such as nuclear and cytoplasmic, nuclear and membrane, or cytoplasmic and membrane. It therefore provides a powerful tool for extending the use of immunophenotyping for the diagnosis and follow up of acute leukaemia. It could also be used for the investigation of minimal residual disease.","['Farahat, N', 'van der Plas, D', 'Praxedes, M', 'Morilla, R', 'Matutes, E', 'Catovsky, D']","['Farahat N', 'van der Plas D', 'Praxedes M', 'Morilla R', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, London.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cell Nucleus/*immunology', 'Cytoplasm/*immunology', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology']",,1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.47.9.843 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1994 Sep;47(9):843-9. doi: 10.1136/jcp.47.9.843.,PMC494943,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The number of mature reticulocytes was measured with flow cytometry in venous blood samples from 122 patients with haematological disorders and 100 healthy controls. Reticulocytes were classified into three categories by the fluorescence intensity of auramin O staining: low fluorescence ratio (LFR), medium fluorescence ratio (MFR), and high fluorescence ratio (HFR). Immature reticulocytes were determined as the aggregate of MFR and HFR (%). RESULTS: The mean (2SD) number of immature reticulocytes in 100 normal subjects was 9.0 (7.0)%. Significantly high mean values of immature reticulocytes with a normal or reduced reticulocyte count were shown in 90 patients with dyserythropoietic or ineffective erythropoietic conditions, such as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (n = 37), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 35), aplastic anaemia (AA) (n = 8), or megaloblastic anaemia (MA), (n = 6). Reticulocyte ratios returned to normal after successful treatment of patients with AML (n = 10) and MA (n = 3). However, high percentages of immature reticulocytes with increased reticulocyte counts were consistently observed in patients with enhanced erythropoiesis such as those with acquired autoimmune haemolytic anaemias (AIHA) (n = 4) or acute blood loss (ABL) (n = 4). Reticulocyte maturity was within the normal range in patients with reduced erythropoiesis such as occurs in chronic renal failure (CRF) (n = 11), or in iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) (n = 13). CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of reticulocyte maturity with total reticulocyte count seems to be clinically useful for estimating the qualitative impairment of erythropoiesis, and so could help differentiate haematological disorders.","['Watanabe, K', 'Kawai, Y', 'Takeuchi, K', 'Shimizu, N', 'Iri, H', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Houwen, B']","['Watanabe K', 'Kawai Y', 'Takeuchi K', 'Shimizu N', 'Iri H', 'Ikeda Y', 'Houwen B']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic/blood/drug therapy', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Child', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood', 'Reticulocyte Count', 'Reticulocytes/*pathology']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.47.8.736 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1994 Aug;47(8):736-9. doi: 10.1136/jcp.47.8.736.,PMC502148,,,,,,,,

The Medical Research Council Working Party on Childhood Leukaemia.,689-92,"AIMS: To assess the prevalence and degree of periodic acid Schiff (PAS) positivity in blast cells from children with lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL); its association with other disease characteristics; and its clinical importance in predicting the outcome of treatment. METHODS: Marrow slides from entrants to a large United Kingdom multicentre ALL trial (UKALL X) were batch processed and assessed blind for PAS positivity by one morphologist. Patients were classified into groups A, B, and C, corresponding to less than 1% PAS positive cells, 1-10%, and over 10%, respectively. Their PAS pattern was then compared with other clinical and pathological features of ALL and with treatment outcome. RESULTS: Slides from 921 children were examined of which 371 (40%) were categorised as group A, 324 (35%) as group B, and 226 (25%) as group C. There was a clear association between the presence of blast cell vacuoles on Romanowsky staining and PAS positivity. Group A (PAS negative) patients included a disproportionate excess of those with L2 morphology, those under 2 or over 6 years of age, those with an initial white cell count over 50 x 10(9)/l, those with a T or null cell immunophenotype, and those with chromosomal abnormalities other than ""high hyperdiploidy"". Four years from diagnosis, group C patients had an 8% disease free survival advantage over those in group A (2p = 0.01). This was irrespective of initial white cell count, but not of immunophenotype or the presence of vacuoles. CONCLUSIONS: Strong PAS positivity is a feature of ""common"" ALL and is particularly associated with blast cell vacuoles. It does occasionally occur in other disease subtypes with or without vacuoles. It predicts a better response to current treatment, but not independently of other cell characteristics.","['Lilleyman, J S', 'Britton, J A', 'Anderson, L M', 'Richards, S M', 'Bailey, C C', 'Chessells, J M']","['Lilleyman JS', 'Britton JA', 'Anderson LM', 'Richards SM', 'Bailey CC', 'Chessells JM']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Sheffield.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', '*Periodic Acid-Schiff Reaction', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors', 'Vacuoles/pathology']",,1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.47.8.689 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1994 Aug;47(8):689-92. doi: 10.1136/jcp.47.8.689.,PMC502136,,,,,,,,
